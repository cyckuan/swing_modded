<HEADLINE> White House Awaits Clemency Answer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton expects to hear soon  
whether 16 Puerto Rican independence activists will accept his 
offer of clemency if they reject violence and agree to parole 
terms, the White House said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton will not act until the 16  
members of FALN, a Spanish acronym for Armed Forces of National 
Liberation, have had time to review the offer with their lawyers. 
He said they met with their lawyers Monday, and ``we expect to hear 
from them quite soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are willing to renounce violence and agree to the  
parole terms that any parolee would, their sentences will be 
commuted,'' Lockhart said. ``It was not unexpected that the group 
of people involved here would want to talk to their attorneys 
before agreeing to the details of the offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered clemency to the 16 FALN members in response to  
human rights officials who argued that their sentences, ranging 
from 15 years to 90 years, were too harsh. The clemency offer came 
with conditions: that they sign statements requesting commutation, 
renounce violence and abide by all conditions of release set by law 
or the Parole Commission. They have not yet met the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials in New York decried Clinton's offer as  
an insult to victims of the 130 bomb attacks on U.S. civilian and 
military targets that FALN members staged from 1974 to 1983. Six 
people were killed and dozens wounded in attacks attributed to 
FALN, but none of those offered clemency was involved in attacks 
that killed people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are begging him, as a friend of law enforcement, to rescind  
his offer and let them serve out the sentences that they justly 
deserve,'' Thomas J. Scotto, president of the Detectives' Endowment 
Association in New York and the National Association of Police 
Organizations, said Monday. ``They are criminals. They are not 
patriots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former detective Richard Pastorella, who was blinded while  
trying to disarm a bomb on New Year's Eve 1982, called the clemency 
offer a move to help Hillary Rodham Clinton gain the Hispanic vote 
should she run for the Senate in New York next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really truly pandering to the Hispanic community, to  
the Latino community, for the vote when Mrs. Clinton runs,'' 
Pastorella said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's likely Republican opponent, New York Mayor  
Rudolph Giuliani, said that the activists have yet to accept 
Clinton's conditions shows that the president shouldn't have made 
the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's a week or 10 days later, and they haven't renounced  
violence -- that's got to tell you something,'' Giuliani said. ``The 
failure of the people involved to quickly renounce violence gives 
you a sense that this was a mistake.''

<HEADLINE> Religious Groups Gather for Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Members of more than 40 religious  
groups have gathered in this conservative city to brainstorm on how 
to win more acceptance of gays within the religious community. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Religious Leadership Roundtable includes Muslims,  
Jews, Catholics, Quakers, Methodists, Lutherans and Mennonites. At 
a meeting Monday night, a Denver rabbi suggested the coalition may 
be going about its task the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have framed this as a gay rights issue. I believe it is a  
civil rights issue,'' said Rabbi Stephen Foster of Congregation 
Emanuel. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged members to involve heterosexual members of synagogues,  
churches and mosques in their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Springs was chosen as the site of the meeting because  
it is the home of Focus on the Family, a Christian ministry headed 
by James Dobson that reaches 5 million listeners through its daily 
broadcasts. The organization believes homosexuality violates 
Christian principles. 
</P>
<P>
	The city south of Denver is also home to organizers of Amendment  
2, a 1992 ban on state laws intended to alleviate discrimination 
against gays. The U.S. Supreme Court recently struck down the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Coalition members said support for gays, lesbians, bisexuals and  
transsexuals has been strong among religious organizations for 
years and is growing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of our message is that the religious right absolutely  
does not speak for all people of faith, even though they kind of 
frame the debate that way,'' said Laura Montgomery-Rutt, national 
organizer for Equal Partners in Faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Creech, a Methodist minister who drew national attention  
and condemnation from his church for blessing the union of two 
women, said the church hasn't fulfilled its duty ``because we have 
excluded certain children of God from God's grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creech was acquitted of violating United Methodist law but was  
not reappointed to the pulpit after the 1997 ceremony in Omaha, 
Neb. The bishops of the 9.5 million-member church in 1998 
reaffirmed that performing same-sex marriages violates church law. 
</P>
<P>
	Creech said there is a long way to go before gays and lesbians  
win widespread acceptance, but he is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time in history has the conversation been so intense,  
have we had people so involved in thinking about the issue, 
whatever side they may be on,'' Creech said. ``So while I cannot 
tell you when it's going to happen, I can tell you the Christian 
churches one day will be open and inclusive of all people 
regardless of sexual identity.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Launches Olympic Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If 440 hours of Olympic coverage aren't enough,  
NBC has set up a Web site devoted solely to the 2000 Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the only Web site allowed to show video of the events  
and will also feature athletes contributing their accounts free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Due to the 15-hour time difference, Americans have to wait for  
TV coverage on NBC or one of its cable networks, CNBC and MSNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	However, diehard Olympic fans will be able to receive the latest  
information as it happens over www.nbcolympics.com -- a 
joint-venture with Quokka Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity to learn more and not just stop at where  
we made the choice because we only had 170 hours,'' said NBC Sports 
president Dick Ebersol. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is expected to show about 170 hours of Olympic coverage, and  
its two cable partners will show about 270 hours for an 
unprecedented 440 total hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A Web site poses a unique problem for the network.  
</P>
<P>
	``On one hand, we're promoting our broadcast and on the other  
hand, we're telling you what happens before you see it,'' said NBC 
senior producer David Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
	The site has been active for about a week and is the only  
internet site that is allowed to broadcast video of Olympic events 
in Sydney, according to Ebersol. 
</P>
<P>
	Other TV outlets are allowed to broadcast a total of six minutes  
a day, but only after the events have been shown on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and Quokka, a digital sports entertainment company based in  
San Francisco, have already signed up about 30 athletes for 
``Athlete Voice,'' where fans will be able to read and listen to 
accounts from the competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan O'Brien, who won a gold medal in the decathlon in the 1996  
Olympics, and 1996 gymnastics gold medalist Dominique Moceanu have 
already agreed to participate without compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprinter Michael Johnson, swimmer Amy Van Dyken and volleyball  
star Karch Kiraly will also share their perspective on the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said NBC's TV outlets will promote the Web site about 10  
times a day during the games and Olympic sponsors will receive 
priority to advertise on the site.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Gov. Candidate Facing Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Former Republican gubernatorial candidate  
John Lindauer, who won the GOP primary last year with a lavish 
campaign he later admitted was funded by his wife, was charged 
today with perjury and violations of campaign laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents filed in Superior Court in Anchorage accuses Lindauer  
of providing false information in campaign disclosure statements, 
soliciting illegal contributions and failing to report illegal 
campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindauer was accused of perjury -- the only felony charge among  
the 23 counts -- for claiming to have received a permanent fund 
dividend in 1997, a year in which he did not even apply for a 
dividend. The fund provides checks for state residents out of 
earnings from oil income. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindauer won the primary last year with a $1.7 million campaign,  
a sum he claimed was his own money. But the campaign quickly 
self-destructed after he admitted that nearly all the money came 
from his second wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican Party of Alaska withdrew its support for him, and  
he received only 17 percent of the vote in November. Incumbent 
Democrat Tony Knowles won with 51 percent of the vote, while the 
last-minute write-in backed by the GOP got 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said Lindauer's failure to apply for a dividend from the  
permanent fund, which has strict residency requirements, was 
evidence he wasn't truly a resident of Alaska. Lindauer, a former 
university chancellor and publisher of a group of rural Alaska 
newspapers, dropped out of site after his newspaper business 
collapsed. His reappearance on the political scene after marrying a 
wealthy Chicago heiress prompted accusations he was a carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said his wife, Dorothy Oremus, and her brother  
guaranteed $1 million in loans to Lindauer's campaign. Such loans 
are considered campaign contributions under Alaska law, and violate 
the $500 limit on individual contributions as well as a limit on 
contributions from outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The state also accused Lindauer of disguising campaign  
contributions as consulting fees from a wealthy businessman with 
ties to the Oremus family.

<HEADLINE> Movie Planned for Web Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An Internet company offering music and movie  
downloads says it will offer one of the first movies specifically 
produced for initial release on the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Quantum Project'' will be produced by Metafilmics, the  
production company that made ``What Dreams May Come,'' the Robin 
Williams feature that won an Academy Award for best visual effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Some short subject movies have had their premieres on the  
Internet, but analysts said they believed ``Quantum Project'' would 
be the first longer film to debut online. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3 million movie, which goes into production this year, will  
debut next spring on Sightsound.com. Viewers will be able to 
download the film for a rental fee, probably between $2 and $4, the 
same price range the company charges for its library of existing 
movies, said Scott Sander, president and chief executive officer of 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	With a high-speed Internet connection, now available only in  
limited areas, a 90-minute movie can be downloaded in three to 20 
minutes depending on how busy the lines are, Sander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the money from each download will be paid to Metafilmics  
in a distribution deal similar to how studios collect their share 
of ticket sales from movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quantum Project'' will combine live action and special effects  
to tell the story of a hero who takes a spiritual journey via the 
Web, said producer Stephen Simon of Metafilmics. The movie will be 
directed by Francis Glebas, who directed one of the segments for 
Walt Disney's upcoming ``Fantasia 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will not be a full-length feature film. Since download times  
for movies can take hours or days over conventional phone lines, 
the producers plan to keep the movie shorter to make it accessible 
to as many viewers as possible, Sander said. 
</P>
<P>
	After its Web debut, the movie might be expanded for theatrical,  
television or video release, Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always going to be traditional films. This is not  
going to replace that,'' Simon said. ``Video when it came in did 
not replace motion pictures, but it did give us a whole different 
way of doing things. That's what this is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1995, Sightsound.com started with music downloads and  
began offering movies on the Internet in April. Its catalog of 
films now includes ``D.O.A.'' starring Edmund O'Brien and such cult 
films as ``Cannibal! The Musical'' and director Ed Wood's ``Plan 9 
From Outer Space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In September, Sightsound.com will begin adding hundreds of  
movie, television and short-subject titles geared mainly toward 
students on college campuses, where high-speed Internet connections 
are more broadly available, Sander said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aiming for college students because they've got  
high-speed Internet access, they've got computers and they've got 
credit cards, the three building blocks of life,'' Sander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as the music industry was cautious about getting into music  
downloads on the Internet, mainstream movie studios also are wary. 
That has made it difficult to land well-known titles, so 
Sightsound.com's expanded library will be heavy on more obscure, 
edgier films, Sander said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new lineup will include such cult classics as the original  
``Little Shop of Horrors,'' featuring Jack Nicholson in a small 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	As high-speed Internet access over cable lines becomes widely  
accessible, movie downloads are expected to become more common. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe as an industry that the Internet as a whole is  
going to be a revolutionary means of getting our product in front 
and in the hands of consumers who might not be able to see our 
films other ways,'' said Richard Taylor, spokesman for the Motion 
Picture Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet research firm Jupiter Communications projects that 20  
percent of homes could have high-speed Internet access by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jupiter analyst Aram Sinnreich said widespread marketing of  
movies downloaded over the Internet remains a long way off because 
of other technological hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the value is really more promotional than anything  
else,'' Sinnreich said.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Sign Smith to 7-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Now that he's got a seven-year deal worth as  
much as $56 million, Akili Smith has a lot of catching up to do. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Bengals quarterback of the future planned to  
arrive at training camp today with less than three weeks left 
before the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the last unsigned member of the celebrated quarterback  
class of '99, agreed to a contract Monday evening. He intended to 
fly to Cincinnati, sign the deal and head to Georgetown, Ky., to 
start making up for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been nicer if it had been sooner,'' general  
manager Mike Brown said. ``It's behind us now. We've just got to 
catch up as best we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, chosen third overall behind quarterbacks Tim Couch and  
Donovan McNabb, doesn't want to repeat the experience that Bengals 
quarterback David Klingler had in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Klingler, the No. 6 pick overall that season, didn't sign until  
one week before the season opener. The Bengals made him the starter 
12 weeks into the season, but he got sacked 10 times by Pittsburgh 
in his debut and never panned out. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who like Klingler is represented by agent Leigh  
Steinberg, has a few things in his favor. Unlike Klingler, he got 
to work out with the Bengals before training camp started, so he's 
not as far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last couple of years, they've instituted these  
(programs) where he's spent a good deal of time in June and July in 
Cincinnati working out,'' Steinberg said. ``So the point is, he's 
received more preparation time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they did with Klingler, the Bengals slotted Smith as a backup  
in his first season, hoping he'd learn by watching Jeff Blake play. 
The question is whether he's far enough along to deserve the No. 2 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows how fast he can pick it up?'' coach Bruce Coslet  
said before the contract agreement was reached. ``He's pretty 
bright. He's a couple of years older than a normal rookie, so he's 
pretty mature. And I think he probably has been working with the 
stuff we sent him, but that's not the same as being on the field 
time after time after time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't on the field because Steinberg and the Bengals were at  
a philosophical impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg represented Dan Wilkinson and Ki-Jana Carter, who were  
No. 1 overall draft picks in the 1990s and got cutting-edge 
``voidable years'' contracts from the Bengals with little trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg wanted a deal for Smith that was comparable to what  
other top young quarterbacks got. Unhappy with how the Wilkinson 
and Carter deals turned out, the Bengals dug in this time. 
</P>
<P>
	The team initially pushed for a deal with incentives based  
heavily upon how well the Bengals perform. The two sides ended up 
at odds over what types of incentives would be included. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg flew to Cincinnati on Sunday and met for 16 hours over  
two days before getting a deal that includes a $10.8 million 
signing bonus and will pay up to $56 million if Smith reaches all 
of his performance goals along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal contains one voidable year, meaning it will  
automatically shorten to six years if he's in for 35 percent of the 
plays in his first year or 45 percent any following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's contract includes base salaries of $175,000; $250,000;  
$325,000; $350,000; $375,000; $400,000 and $450,000. Various 
escalators would push those numbers higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The first round of escalators clicks in when he passes for 1,601  
yards, the second when he throws for 2,500 yards and appears in 
half of the plays. 
</P>
<P>
	The final two rounds of escalators have Smith finishing in the  
top five in various passing categories, and the Bengals winning a 
playoff game -- something the Bengals haven't done since the 1990 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave here, they gave there,'' Brown said. ``Anyway, it's  
all set.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch agreed to a seven-year, $48 million deal with Cleveland,  
while McNabb got a seven-year deal from Philadelphia that could 
reach $54 million.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was lower against the yen Wednesday  
morning, despite rumors Japan's central bank intervened to stem the 
greenback's decline. Tokyo stocks fell after the U.S. Federal 
Reserve raised interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 111.16 yen at late morning, down 1.06 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 110.80 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 105.51 points,  
or 0.58 percent, to 17,989.90 at the end of the morning session. On 
Tuesday, the average closed down 138.14 points, or 0.76 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gyrated as rumors spread on the  
foreign exchange market that the Bank of Japan bought the currency. 
Traders said they could not confirm the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially fell back to a seven-month low in Tokyo  
after Japanese banks actively sold the dollar following the Fed 
rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But it moved as high as 112.40 yen at one point soon after  
Haruhiko Kuroda, Japan's vice finance minister for international 
affairs, said the ministry is ready to take actions against rapid 
moves in foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japanese institutional investors, including insurance  
companies, bought the yen later, pushing the dollar below 112 yen, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee raised its  
federal funds rate by 0.25 basis points Tuesday in an effort to 
contain inflationary pressure in the American economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher U.S. rates make returns more attractive on  
dollar-denominated investments. But the Fed also signaled that 
interest rates may stabilize. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the dollar had also touched a seven-month low against  
the yen in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 116.94 yen, down  
from 117.28 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices opened moderately lower on  
profit-taking in banking and brokerage issues following recent 
sharp gains after three major Japanese banks announced an alliance 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.46 points,  
or 0.15 percent, to 11,283.30 at Tuesday's finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 7.17 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,499.90. 
The TOPIX closed down 11.65 points, or 0.77 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.9900 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.9950 percent, driving 
its price up 98.41 yen from 98.37 yen.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Could Affect E.Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Dennis formed today in the western  
Atlantic and was on a track that could affect the East Coast this 
weekend, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis grew out of a tropical depression southeast of the  
Bahamas and north of Puerto Rico, becoming a named storm when its 
sustained wind speed topped 39 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2 p.m. EDT today, it was centered about 85 miles north of  
Grand Turk in the Turks and Caicos Islands, the National Hurricane 
Center said. Grand Turk is 575 miles southeast of Miami. Dennis had 
wind blowing at a sustained 45 mph and was moving west-northwest at 
nearly 9 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning  
for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm could be three days away from threatening the eastern  
United States, primarily the area from northern Florida to the 
Carolinas, said Jerry Jarrell, director of the hurricane center. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this could be one of those that goes up the whole East  
Coast and threatens everybody on the way and makes us all button 
up,'' he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a chance that Dennis could veer northward and  
away from the United States, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane center also was monitoring another tropical  
weather system located about 500 miles west of the Caribbean's 
Windward Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is pretty well-organized,'' said forecaster Todd  
Kimberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the mid Atlantic, Tropical Storm Cindy was centered about  
1,290 miles east of the Lesser Antilles. Cindy was traveling 
west-northwest at about 15 mph, with sustained wind near 60 mph.

<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Paraskevi Tsiamita won the triple jump  
gold medal at the World Championships on her first attempt today, 
beating Yamile Aldana of Cuba and another Greek athlete, 
Olga-Anastasia Vasdeki. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsiamita had already set the best jump of the season in  
qualifying and won the title with 48 feet, 10 inches on her first 
attempt. Aldana and Vasdeki both jumped 47-11 1/4, but Aldana took the 
silver because her second-best jump was one centimeter longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The gold-bronze double gave Greece its fourth medal in the last  
three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic Champion Inessa Kravets failed to make it through

<HEADLINE> Calif. Senate OKs Needle Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Trying to slow the spread of AIDS, the  
Legislature sent Gov. Gray Davis a bill Tuesday that would let 
cities and counties set up needle-exchange programs for drug 
addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Current state law bars such programs but four California cities  
-- Berkeley, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Santa Cruz -- and Marin 
County have adopted emergency ordinances allowing needle exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' office said the Democratic governor has not taken a  
position on the bill, which passed the state Senate on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 15 other states have authorized needle-exchange  
programs, although there are exchange programs operating in more 
than twice that many states, according to Assemblywoman Kerry 
Mazzoni's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of her proposal said studies have shown exchange  
programs reduce the spread of the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been at least six other needle-exchange bills  
introduced in California since 1993. They either died in the 
Legislature or were vetoed by then-Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.

<HEADLINE> Hometown Says Goodbye to Kim Perrot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) -- More than a thousand people filed through  
a church here Tuesday to pay last respects to Kim Perrot, the 
diminutive Houston Comets point guard who died of cancer last week 
at age 32. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lafayette native, Perrot lay in state in an open casket draped  
with red and white roses as friends, fans, her former teachers and 
teammates passed by prior to an afternoon funeral Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Tributes echoed those at a memorial a day earlier in Houston.  
Admirers spoke of the 5-foot-5 Perrot's generous heart and 
competitive spirit that won her a spot on Comets coach Van 
Chancellor's roster despite his initial misgivings about her size 
and playing style. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot went on to help the Comets win two WNBA championships.  
</P>
<P>
	``She was a competitor. She was tough. It affected the people  
around her. She had an effect on this community like no other 
person,'' said Olympic track and field star Hollis Conway, a 
classmate of Perrot's for four years at the University of 
Southwestern Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want everybody to remember her for who she was, a wonderful  
person who wanted to give back to the community,'' said Perrot's 
sister, Loretta Perrot. 
</P>
<P>
	Before and after her diagnosis last February, Perrot made more  
than 200 public appearances, often at schools, where she stressed 
the importance of working hard to achieve lifelong goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor and Comets players attended the funeral at the  
Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church. An estimated 1,500 people 
filed in and out of the church and past the rose-draped casket 
prior to the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the casket was a spray of flowers, red roses forming  
Perrot's No. 10 against a backdrop of white roses. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and family wore red roses and white patches with the  
number 10 printed on them.

<HEADLINE> Opera Patrons Go To Blows -- Sort Of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Lyric Opera of Chicago might want to consider  
a bleacher section. 
</P>
<P>
	The crackling noise of a candy wrapper so irritated the finely  
tuned ears of one opera lover that he turned to ask for quiet -- and 
got slapped on the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, John Gaggini, a tax attorney from suburban Oak Lawn, is  
facing a misdemeanor battery charge and possibly a year in jail. 
The 49-year-old says the contretemps is a complete 
misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm flabbergasted,'' he told the Chicago Sun-Times. ``I didn't  
strike the man. I bumped him. I'm a professional man. I'm not into 
fisticuffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged battery took place March 12 during a performance of  
Giuseppe Verdi's ``La Traviata.'' According to a police report, 
Alexander Weaver, 44, also an attorney, said he was disturbed in 
the middle of an aria by the annoying sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``He shushed the people behind him and was struck on the back of  
the head,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaggini said he had merely dozed off in his seat when he was  
startled awake by a ``shushing sound'' and his hand involuntarily 
jerked forward and landed on the man in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is set for trial Oct. 19.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can tell you is that this is very unusual,''  
said Susan Mathieson, director of marketing for the Lyric Opera. 
``Slapping incidents are very, very rare among opera patrons.''

<HEADLINE>  Russia May Be Driving Out Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- A Russian offensive today appeared to  
be driving Islamic militants from several of the front-line 
Caucasus Mountains villages they seized more than two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Conflicting claims by the rebels and the Russian security forces  
made it difficult to determine the exact status of the villages in 
the southern Russian republic of Dagestan. But the Russian forces 
seemed to be scoring their biggest advances since Aug. 7, when they 
began battling the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels attacked the Dagestani villages from neighboring  
Chechnya. They are seeking an independent Islamic state in southern 
Russia, but are heavily outgunned by the Russian forces, which are 
believed to number several thousand. 
</P>
<P>
	In the village of Tando, the scene of heavy fighting for days,  
government forces planted a red, white and blue Russian flag this 
morning, according to radio journalist Gadzhi Saipulaev. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian paratroopers entered the village Monday night and had  
driven out the last remaining rebels by morning, Saipulaev 
reported. He was in nearby Botlikh, where many Russian forces are 
based. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants had also pulled out of several other nearby  
villages, Russian military officials said. But Saipulaev also said 
he witnessed repeated Russian bombing raids this afternoon on three 
villages where rebels were still resisting. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels have been holding about a half-dozen small villages,  
often hiding in caves when Russian jets and helicopters swooped 
down on bombing raids. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gen. Mikhail Pankov, deputy commander of the Interior  
Ministry troops, said in Moscow that two villages had been cleared 
of rebels today, and the government forces were preparing to 
reclaim three more villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials in Dagestan have been making similar claims  
for several days, only to be proved wrong afterward. But the 
various reports today pointed toward a rebel retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels could not be immediately contacted for comment. But  
they have said previously that they might withdraw or redeploy 
forces rather than remain in the villages and battle the stronger 
Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev, one of the leaders of the  
insurrection, told Interfax on Monday that the loss of Tando and 
other villages was not important because the militants ``can at any 
moment begin military action at a place where they are least 
expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lt. Col. Viktor Gubry said that rebels had fought to  
maintain control of the villages, and had not relinquished any 
territory without a battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basayev is trying to put up a bold front to cover his  
defeat,'' Gubry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting is the worst in Russia since government troops  
withdrew from Chechnya nearly three years ago as part of a peace 
deal that gave the territory de facto independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in the 1994-96 secession war in Chechnya, the Islamic  
militants in Dagestan don't have wide support of the population. 
The republic's secular politicians and moderate religious leaders 
are also opposed to the militants. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels are believed to have more than 1,000 fighters in  
Dagestan, an impoverished republic along the west coast of the 
Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials say up to 700 rebels have been killed in the  
conflict, though rebel leaders have put their casualty figure at 
32. Moscow has acknowledged losing about 40 soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Man Dies in Va. Coaster Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOSWELL, Va. (AP) -- A New York man died in an apparent accident  
on a roller coaster in which riders stand through several loops 
that turn them upside down. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of two fatal accidents in as many days, the other one  
in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Fan, 20, was killed Monday night on the 50-mph Shockwave  
ride at the 400-acre Paramount King's Dominion theme park. 
Officials didn't have a hometown for Fan but said he lived on Long 
Island in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the park, which is located about 20 miles north of  
Richmond, released few details about the incident. Park spokeswoman 
Betsy Moss confirmed the fatality, which happened about 8:40 p.m., 
and said an investigation was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people were slightly injured Monday when a piece of  
decorative wood came loose from the track of a Knotts Berry Farm 
roller coaster ride in Buena Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in California, a disabled 12-year-old boy died Sunday after  
plummeting from an amusement park ride that was about to be shut 
down for a safety check. 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials said Joshua Smurphat somehow slipped from a  
shoulder harness and fell from the Drop Zone ride at Paramount's 
Great America Theme Park in Santa Clara. A park spokesman said the 
accident had nothing to do with the boy's disability or the safety 
check. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Drop Zone, riders are harnessed into six four-person  
coaches, sitting upright with their feet dangling. They are hoisted 
200 feet up a tower and free-fall about two-thirds of the way down, 
reaching speeds of 62 mph before braking. 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials disputed witness accounts suggesting that the boy  
was not properly strapped into his seat. Jay Lingenfelter, a family 
friend who was seated next to Joshua, said the safety harness was 
not checked before the ride began and he heard a sound like when 
the harness snaps open just before the boy fell. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kings Mills, Ohio, the Paramount's Kings Island amusement  
park closed two rides similar to the ones involved in the fatal 
accidents at two other Paramount parks, a spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drop Zone free-fall ride and the King Cobra stand-up roller  
coaster are closed indefinitely until Kings Island management 
obtains more information about the accidents in California and 
Virginia, Kings Island spokesman David Mandt said.

<HEADLINE>  Magic To Play Once for Swedish Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson, the retired  
NBA star and future Hall of Famer, has agreed to play at least one 
game in Sweden's basketball league, elated coach Charles Barton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People really don't believe it. Sometimes it's a little unreal  
for me, actually. It's true, though,'' said Barton, the former 
coach of Sweden's national team, said Tuesday in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	His team, known as M7, finished fifth in the Swedish League last  
season and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Haney, an attorney for the former all-star with the Los  
Angeles Lakers, said Johnson picked Sweden partly because of the 
impression the country made on him during a 1996 playing tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``He very much liked the Swedish people and the area is  
beautiful. The chemistry is right and the timing is right,'' Haney 
said, adding Johnson's presence might help promote basketball in a 
country where most people prefer ice hockey and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 40, learned in 1991 he was infected with HIV, the virus  
that causes AIDS. He retired in 1992 from the Lakers, came back 
briefly as a player and then quit for good during the 1992-93 
exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
	His pay for appearing in one game was not disclosed. The team's  
Swedish players make approximately $1,690 a month, about what a 
typical public schoolteacher earns.

<HEADLINE> 'Sixth Sense' Tops Box Office Again / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Sixth Sense'' scared up enough business  
at the box office this weekend to maintain its No. 1 spot and top 
the $100 million mark in just its third week of release. 
</P>
<P>
	The supernatural tale about a boy who can see dead people  
grossed $24 million over the weekend, according to industry figures

the No. 2 spot with $35.8 million in its second week of release.

<P>
	New films, meanwhile, opened with less-than-thrilling ticket  
sales. The mobster comedy ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' was in third place 
with a respectable $10.4 million, but the new ``Universal Soldier: 
The Return'' and ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' were weak performers.

<HEADLINE> Frozen Plants Tested for Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers are planning to test some 30,000  
frozen plant and animal tissue samples this week to make sure they 
were not damaged by a weekend power failure at Chicago's Field 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	As thousands of frustrated visitors were turned away from the  
museum Sunday morning because of the blackout, lab workers and 
scientists inside scrambled to save the collection of samples, 
considered one of the world's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad for us that the museum couldn't open, but I had no  
thought of that,'' said John Bates, assistant curator of birds at 
the Field Museum. ``My only thought was to safeguard the tissue 
collection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bates rushed from his suburban home Sunday morning to help staff  
pack the specimens in about 500 pounds of dry ice. Museum officials 
said the collection appeared to have escaped harm in the outage, 
but researchers planned to run tests this week to check for damage 
and also would be looking into ways to protect the collection in 
future outages. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection, which Field Museum researchers have been  
gathering for about a quarter century, is used by scientists from 
around the world for DNA research. 
</P>
<P>
	If the samples had thawed and spoiled, Bates said it would have  
meant ``an irreparable loss'' to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Many samples, such as rare ferns from New Zealand and fruit  
flies from Madagascar, would be almost impossible to duplicate 
because they were gathered during expensive expeditions, said 
Kathleen Pryer, a botanical curator at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can never get these teams of people together again to go  
get these samples,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's power failure happened on what should have been one of  
the Field Museum's busiest days, with officials expecting about 
8,000 visitors. It also affected the nearby Shedd Aquarium, which 
used an auxiliary generator, and part of a building at a small 
lakefront airport. 
</P>
<P>
	It was blamed on a failed Commonwealth Edison transformer that  
lacked a replacement unit. Power was restored to the museum shortly 
before midnight. The blackout was the most recent of a series of 
outages that have plagued the Chicago area this summer and have 
caused ComEd to be widely criticized.

<HEADLINE> Disney, Retired Workers To Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. has agreed to settle a  
class-action lawsuit aimed at reducing the amount of money 
thousands of mostly retired workers have to pay for medical 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accused the entertainment giant of reneging on a  
promise to fully cover the cost of medical insurance for retired 
studio and theme-park workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed settlement was agreed upon last week and covers  
3,800 employees with 20 years or more service, said plaintiffs' 
attorney, William T. Payne. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the total dollar amount has not been determined yet,  
Payne said attorneys on both sides plan to file a joint settlement 
motion next month in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney spokesman Ken Green declined comment Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's still before the court,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The employees filed the lawsuit in 1996, alleging Walt Disney  
has promised no-premium retirement health care insurance to 20-year 
employees, ages 62 and older. The employees said Disney changed the 
age to 65 in 1994 and then charged premiums for all but those with 
health maintenance organization coverage in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Disney officials had blamed the changes on  
increasing medical costs and said they were allowed under its 
contract with the workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in 1996. A settlement was reached once  
before in 1997, but the deal fell apart over conflicting 
interpretations of the agreement, Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current premium plan, a typical retired Disney  
employee pays more than $1,000 a year for insurance for themselves 
and a spouse. But under the settlement, Payne said the same payment 
would shrink to $102 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also calls for the cap on total deductions,  
premiums and co-payments to be raised from $1,500 to $2,100, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Did Somebody Say ... McPaint? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YARMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- Dr. Robert Bauer couldn't believe his  
eyes when he drove up to get a cup of coffee at his local 
McDonald's earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers were slapping fire-engine red, canary yellow and  
blinding white paint on the weathered shingled walls that had been 
so typical of Cape Cod's rustic architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, furious about a paint job he considered garish and cheap,  
fired off a blistering letter to the eatery's owners threatening a 
boycott. Amid community pressure, the owners agreed to repaint the 
restaurant cream and replace the bright red roof with cedar 
shingles. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a struggle that's being replicated around eastern  
Massachusetts as McDonald's owner-operators repaint their Golden 
Arches to update the image of the 44-year-old chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do is refreshen the stores, make them  
look better, in some cases, a little cleaner,'' said Robin 
Boorstein Mayhew, who co-owns two McDonald's on the South Shore. 
``The concept behind a lot of it was to give a fun look, a clean 
look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say it's fairly routine for restaurant franchises to  
regularly update their properties. McDonald's latest makeover comes 
as part of a turnaround after the industry leader suffered 
declining sales and inroads by competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The chain last year gained market share at stores open at least  
a year, in part because of successful promotions. The company's 
stock has soared from a 12-month low of $26.75 on Sept. 21 to 
$41.06 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Restaurants in the Northeast are the first to try the new  
``youthful spirit'' color scheme, but franchisees in markets around 
the country also are choosing to give themselves a facelift, a 
company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acceptance of this has been exceptional,'' said Henry  
Gonzalez, president of McDonald's Northeast Division. 
Owner-operators in Philadelphia have adopted the new colors and 
traffic is up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, Gonzalez said, McDonald's owner-operators are spending  
$31 million in four months to enhance 310 restaurants from 
Providence, R.I., to southern New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The makeover includes new menu boards, a visual customer order  
display for drive-through windows and new uniforms. But it's the 
new colors that have generated the biggest mess. 
</P>
<P>
	Although nary a peep has been heard about the repainted  
restaurants in old cities with big commercial districts, officials 
in historic New England towns are appalled by the colors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children may like it, but adults are enraged by it,'' said  
Paul Carroll, chairman of the Canton zoning board of appeal. ``Town 
leaders are enraged by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canton won't permit the new colors. Nor will its South Shore  
neighbors of Randolph and Hanson. In the Cape Cod towns of Hyannis 
and Bourne, one McDonald's owner suspended plans to repaint because 
of the outcry over his restaurant in Falmouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like one big Coney Island washboard by the bay,'' said  
Raleigh Costa, president of the Teaticket Civic Association in 
Falmouth. Costa has asked the owner to change the restaurant back 
to its original brick. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner has promised to check with corporate headquarters in  
Oak Brook, Ill., to see if the company allows any flexibility in 
the new decor. Gonzalez said repainting is not mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
	In Yarmouth, local authorities permitted a McDonald's to open on  
the condition the building conform to traditional Cape 
architectural standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark and Janice McBee, the restaurant's owners, ignored the  
town's wishes at their peril. Angry letters were fired off to local 
officials and newspapers, describing the new McDonald's as 
``glaringly ugly,'' with colors ``heretofore only seen by those 
ingesting hallucinatory drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think even Ray Kroc might be dismayed,'' wrote one person,  
referring to the restaurant chain's founder. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the McBees agreed to repaint the store after weeks of  
stormy public debate as well as negotiations between the building 
department and McDonald's lawyers. The McBees did not return calls 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Bauer, he is looking forward to returning to his favorite  
fast-food restaurant -- as soon as the red, white and yellow 
disappears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the food,'' he said. ``But I'm going to make sure I  
like the paint job before I go back.''

<HEADLINE> Media Air Disaster Coverage Derided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board's  
chairman chastised the news media for its coverage of major air 
disasters today, criticizing the reporting of a ``barrage of bad 
information'' that can distract investigators and stir emotional 
pain in victims' friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing 300 air safety investigators, James Hall said  
investigations of major air accidents are now conducted ``under the 
instantaneous scrutiny of the whole world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This in itself is not a bad thing,'' he said. ``What is a bad  
thing is the continual barrage of bad information that is spilling 
over the airwaves and, to a lesser extent, newspapers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such misinformation, he said, ``can distract the investigative  
process ... and bring needless pain to those who have suffered 
personal loss in an aviation tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As evidence, Hall showed several clips of inaccurate or  
speculative broadcast reports on air disasters dating back to the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall had chilly relations with reporters in the days following  
the July 16 crash of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane off Martha's 
Vineyard. During daily briefings, he accused reporters of 
displaying bad manners and reminded them to respect the survivors' 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he did not directly address the aftermath of the  
Kennedy crash today, he accused the media of substituting 
speculation for fact. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall acknowledged, however, that rumors arise in the absence of  
facts and said the board had to adjust its way of dealing with the 
media. He said he will announce the NTSB's new media procedures in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall blamed satellite technology and 24-hour deadlines for what  
he called ``often monotonously over-dramatized and continuous 
around-the clock coverage,'' and said reporters are not the only 
ones who give in to pressure to appear before television cameras 
with insufficient facts. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians and government officials also fall victim to such  
pressures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall also cautioned his audience -- members of the International  
Society of Air Safety Investigators -- that if they hadn't yet been 
exposed to the pressures of media driven by 24-hour deadlines, they 
would be soon.

<HEADLINE> Early Injuries Hitting Saints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- While running back Ricky Williams will miss  
the New Orleans Saints' third exhibition game on Saturday, coach 
Mike Ditka expects his only 1999 draft pick to be ready when the 
games start to count. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky is fine. He'll be ready for the season opener,'' Ditka  
said as he left the Saints' practice facility Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, for whom coach Ditka traded his entire draft and more  
in April, sprained his left ankle in the first exhibition game 
against Miami on Aug. 13. Trainer Dean Kleinschmidt said contrary 
to reports that circulated on Tuesday, the injury is not worse than 
the team thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had another medical evaluation by an LSU Medical Center  
orthopedist,'' Kleinschmidt said. ``This exam confirmed the medical 
staff's original diagnosis of a left high ankle sprain. Surgery is 
not indicated. There is no fracture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports that Williams would miss five weeks, however, are  
erroneous, Kleinschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who wears a protective boot on the injured ankle, left  
camp, refusing to speak to reporters. He walked on the Stairmaster 
on both Monday and Tuesday after watching his teammates practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams will miss Saturday's home game against Green Bay. After  
that, his condition will be reassessed. The Saints play Sept. 2 
against Tennessee before opening the regular season on Sept. 12 at 
home against Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka also stormed off the practice field Tuesday, refusing to  
talk to reporters after Pro Bowl players Joe Johnson and William 
Roaf both went down with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is out for the season after rupturing a tendon in his  
right knee during a line drill. His knee apparently collapsed 
without contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he just stepped wrong,'' defensive end Jared Tomich  
said. ``He just collapsed. It was a real fluke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had just returned to practice on Monday after sitting  
out all of training camp because of a bulging disc in his lower 
spine. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a first-round pick in 1994, was voted to the Pro Bowl  
for the first time last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Roaf, a five-time Pro Bowler, sprained his left knee and ankle  
when players landed on his leg in a pileup. He was helped off the 
field, and Kleinschmidt said later that he will miss the Green Bay 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an unusual day, the fact that we had two players of the  
status and stature of Willie Roaf and Joe Johnson go down within 45 
minutes of each other,'' Kleinschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints traded away eight draft picks to get Williams, the  
Texas running back who won the Heisman Trophy by tearing through 
opposing defenses. Williams is the key to kick-starting New 
Orleans' ground game and running all the way to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also signed an incentive-laden contract based on yards  
gained. Because of that, a long-term injury could cost him millions 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	After back-to-back 6-10 records, Ditka labeled Williams the  
final piece of the puzzle, saying a first-class ball carrier was 
all he needed to make the Saints a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints' offense was ranked 28th in the league last season.  
The running game was dead last.

<HEADLINE> Survivors Upset Over Swiss Bank Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A number of Holocaust survivors are withdrawing  
from a $1.2 billion settlement with Swiss banks, claiming too much 
money is going to lawyers involved in the class-action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Frenkel of the Group for World War II Survivor Justice said  
the settlement with Credit Suisse and UBS AG would entitle 
survivors to as little as $500 and strip them of the right to sue 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our only control is to opt out,'' said Frenkel, whose group  
represents about 200 people. ``We have to get out of the suits, 
remove our names and preserve our claims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gizella Weisshaus, one of the first to sue the banks, said she  
no longer wanted to be associated with the lawsuit because it would 
leave too little money for survivors. Neither Weisshaus nor Frenkel 
explained the basis for their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The distribution of money from the settlement has not yet been  
decided. The judge overseeing the case in U.S. District Court is 
expected to release a draft plan on Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss banks as the Nazis  
gained power in Europe, expecting to retrieve it later. The banks 
stonewalled after the war, saying they could not find accounts or 
requesting nonexistent death certificates of victims killed in Nazi 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Fagan, an attorney involved in a number of  
Holocaust-related lawsuits, did not return a call Monday seeking 
comment. He has said he is willing to accept whatever fee is deemed 
appropriate by a court. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks have agreed to pay account holders and their heirs 10  
times the value of their wartime accounts, said Elan Steinberg, 
executive director of the World Jewish Congress, which is a party 
to the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Frenkel said that was not enough to account for inflation and  
interest since 1945. He said the banks should pay each account 
holder about 114 times the value of the original deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said that lawyers in the case should not accept fees  
and that survivors were within their rights to opt out. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is bound by this settlement,'' he said. ``If they  
choose to opt out they can of course sue individually for whatever 
they want.''

<HEADLINE> Changes at Top of USOC Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Already battered by the Salt Lake City scandal  
and the abrupt departure of its fund-raising chief, the U.S. 
Olympic Committee could face a painful leadership shakeup as it 
puts together the team for the 2000 Games in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling executive committee will get an initial look Sunday  
at a consultant's study recommending extensive changes in the 
USOC's bulky, two-tiered management system. It's expected to 
include a switch in the placement of the chief executive officer's 
job -- a move that would open the door for a dramatic shuffle at the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report by McKinsey &AMP; Co., will focus on long-term  
programs and is unlikely to suggest specific personnel changes, it 
is expected to become a key element in how long Dick Schultz, the 
USOC's executive director since 1995, remains in that job. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz says he plans to stay through at least next year's  
Summer Games in Sydney and possibly through the 2002 Winter Games 
in Salt Lake. But others see a shorter timeline. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz encountered trouble shortly after Bill Hybl became USOC  
president in late 1996, with growing concerns that his low-key 
style was resulting in a lack of leadership. Those troubles 
escalated this spring, when Hybl and other members of a volunteer 
board of directors were caught flat-footed when John Krimsky 
resigned as deputy executive director and marketing chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz expressed surprise when Krimsky resigned and said he had  
informed Hybl and the others as soon as his deputy had given him 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this spring, Hybl ordered an internal management study  
headed by Donald Fehr, the executive director of the major league 
baseball players' union and a public-sector member of the USOC's 
board of directors. That study failed to single out any person but 
found problems in several areas and was folded into the McKinsey 
review, which will be finalized in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Hybl told a meeting of more than a dozen  
executive directors of Olympic sports bodies that the McKinsey 
report would lead to ``some changes that will be painful, and we 
need some new leadership,'' according to four officials present who 
all spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview from his office, Hybl, the head of the  
El Pomar Foundation in the USOC's headquarters in Colorado Springs, 
Colo., said the first draft of the McKinsey report would recommend 
that the executive director become the USOC's CEO, implementing 
policy drawn up by the volunteer officers and a 120-member board. 
Currently the president is the CEO, with the executive director -- 
the leader of a full-time staff -- No. 2. The job last year paid 
Schultz $483,666 in salary and $125,000 in benefits and deferred 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said he supported the change because it would put the USOC  
in line with other nonprofit organizations. But he stopped far 
short of saying that Schultz was the person to run things. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the recommended change could work with current  
personnel, Hybl replied: ``You mean would Dick be able to? Well, 
we'll have to take a look and see what the job is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl also said he and Schultz sometimes argued but were able to  
unite in most areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dick and I have worked together on a variety of issues and we  
don't always agree. But we've been able to resolve our 
disagreements, sometimes after lengthy discussion,'' Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said executive committee members had been ``positive  
towards me'' and that he and Hybl had a good relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep hearing these rumors about Bill and I not be able to  
work together, but that's just not true at all,'' he said. ``I 
think we've had a pretty good working relationship. It's a 
challenging relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz, formerly executive director of the NCAA, said Krimsky  
told him in late February he was looking at another job and would 
keep him informed. ``That was basically it,'' Schultz said. He also 
said he wanted to protect Krimsky's position in the marketplace by 
not sparking rumors that he was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky told him of the change just days before it was announced  
April 26, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised at that short notice,'' he said. ``As soon as  
I had knowledge that he was planning to leave, everybody knew about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky, now with a Dallas-based company that runs United  
Airlines' senior frequent flyer program, refused to comment on the 
matter.

<HEADLINE> Michael Bolton Charity Giving More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Michael Bolton's charitable foundation  
has increased its rate of giving following criticism of its 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	New financial reports show that Michael Bolton Charities Inc.  
increased its rate of charitable giving to nearly 69 percent last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial statements had earlier revealed that only 15 percent  
of the $2.5 million collected after expenses in 1995 went directly 
to organizations the singer's charity was created to help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still a young organization and we're still learning,''  
said Jacqueline Smaga, the foundation's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the state believes  
charities should spend at least half of their revenues on programs 
and activities that directly benefit the causes supported by 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	The charity funded 18 nonprofit organizations whose mission is  
to serve women and children who are at-risk for emotional, physical 
and sexual abuse.

<HEADLINE> Tears, Laughter at Perrot Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- For three seasons, Darcie Johnson has sat in  
Section 120 at the Compaq Center, seven rows up from the Houston 
Comets bench, cheering with friends Petra Davis and Lori Self. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio showed up at Kim Perrot's memorial service in Houston  
on Monday to celebrate the point guard's life. The 32-year-old 
Perrot was to be buried today in her hometown of Lafayette, La. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt like we needed closure, too,'' said Johnson, dressed  
in a red, white and blue Comets shirt, with Perrot's No. 10 pinned 
on her chest. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were among 1,000 who poured into Houston's Second  
Baptist Church to relive special moments from the point guard's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Comets player died Thursday, six months after she  
was diagnosed with lung cancer that spread to her brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be here today if she hadn't fought me,'' joked a  
misty-eyed Comets coach Van Chancellor, who recalled for the 1,000 
in attendance how he ``miscoached'' Perrot their first year 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	He met her just two years ago at a Houston high school gym,  
where he was holding tryouts for the new WNBA franchise. What he 
saw, he didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too wild, too small and too everything,'' Chancellor said,  
laughing at how he underestimated the 5-foot-5 Perrot and continued 
to do so even though that first season ended with a WNBA 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor reassessed his mistakes after he received a letter  
from two fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Van Chancellor, you are miscoaching Kim Perrot,'' the letter  
read. ``Point guards like her are hard to find and we are writing 
Les Alexander to say that coaches like you are a dime a dozen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diagnosed with cancer last February, Perrot died in Houston on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kim was special. Kim used her gifts to the fullest'' said  
Leslie Alexander, owner of the Comets and the Houston Rockets. 
``She never gave up on her dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor said he and Perrot often joked that their great skill  
was responsible for the success two-time MVP Cynthia Cooper 
enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
	When Chancellor teased back, asking how he figured she was  
involved, Perrot quickly responded: ``You call all the plays and 
I'm passing her all the basketballs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blinking away tears, Chancellor softly remarked: ``What a fun  
person. There will never be another Kim Perrot, in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper, who was at Perrot's bedside when she died last week,  
said it was her best friend's generous spirit and love of people 
that left a mark on the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason she touched so many lives is because Kim had a  
courageous heart,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before and after her diagnosis, Perrot made more than 200 public  
appearances, often at schools, where she stressed the importance of 
working hard to achieve lifelong goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of fans, many wearing the Comets' trademark red or  
carrying Comets mementos, filled pews. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a motivator,'' said 12-year-old Christopher Miller,  
whose own cancer is now in remission. Holding a basketball Perrot 
autographed for him last fall, he said: ``She motivated me to stay 
strong.''

<HEADLINE> Ad Man Says Beatty's a Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (AP) -- Actor Warren Beatty has been coy about  
whether he plans to run for president but an ad man he had over for 
dinner says the idea is no idle fancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very serious about it,'' said Bill Hillsman of  
Minneapolis, who met Beatty at the star's Los Angeles home last 
week to discuss a possible campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillsman, president of North Woods Advertising, created funny TV  
ads credited with helping liberal Minnesota Democrat Paul Wellstone 
win a Senate seat in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Hillsman came up with TV ads featuring Jesse Ventura  
as an action figure battling Evil Special Interest Man. The former 
pro wrestler went on to win election as Minnesota governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be willing to help,'' he said of a possible Beatty  
campaign. ``I don't see anyone else lighting the world on fire -- in 
either party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty, in an opinion piece in The New York Times on Sunday,  
pitched public financing of federal campaigns -- a favorite theme of 
his -- and was noncommittal on whether he might run. 
</P>
<P>
	He opened by saying that despite pressure from some quarters to  
run, he preferred to work as one of those ``bleeding heart 
celebrities'' to return the Democratic Party to its roots. He 
closed by saying: ``Stay tuned. We'll be back after this message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful John  
McCain, whose push for federal campaign finance reforms has put him 
at odds with his party's leaders in Congress, endorsed on Tuesday a 
proposal to put a similar measure on California's primary ballot in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain backed the so-called California Voters Bill of Rights  
petition at a news conference near the end of his 11-day campaign 
tour of California. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system is broken,'' the Arizona senator said. ``No one  
disagrees with that. We have reached a point in California and in 
Washington where the special interests rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would limit contributions, impose fund-raising  
blackout periods, ban corporate contributions and require 
disclosure on the Internet within 24 hours of major contributions. 
It would also provide limited public financing for candidates who 
agree to spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain acknowledged that endorsing the petition puts him at odds  
with leaders of the California Republican Party, but predicted that 
``over time, they'll come around to my point of view.'' 
</P>

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A past of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll won't  
stop Jeff ``Skunk'' Baxter, a former Steely Dan and Doobie Brothers 
guitarist, if he decides to run for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to admit that I did all that stuff,'' said Baxter,  
who wears a black beret and sports a walrus mustache. ``But the 
most important thing is to learn from your past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview at his West Los Angeles recording studio, the  
50-year-old composer and producer said he is contemplating a GOP 
challenge next year for the House seat held by Democratic Rep. Brad 
Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
	Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers soared to prominence in the  
1970s, and their records -- noted for superior musicianship -- 
reflect the freewheeling attitudes of the era. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to obscure his past would only generate more fuss about  
it, said Baxter. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-running GOP presidential  
candidate, has been dogged by questions about whether he ever used 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter's interests include defense, gun rights, the environment  
and bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not Thomas Jefferson reincarnated, but America has been  
really good to me,'' Baxter said. ``Now, I just want to give 
something back and serve my country.''

<HEADLINE> Fire Evacuates Ranches in Nevada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STEAD, Nev. (AP) -- Fires swept across thousands of acres north  
of Reno late Tuesday, burning within a mile of a housing 
subdivision and forcing the evacuation of 60 ranches and a number 
of exotic animals. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire consumed about 3,500 acres of sagebrush and pine trees  
and was burning out of control in the Antelope Valley. There were 
no injuries reported or structures damaged, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was started by a car blaze near the Animal Ark Shelter  
on Tuesday afternoon. It burned through the shelter, but all 
animals were evacuated safely, including a tiger, a bobcat and a 
coyote. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some burnt whiskers and singed noses but amazingly  
all the animals survived,'' Washoe County spokesman Bob Harmon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty fire engines, two air tankers and a Bureau of Land  
Management helicopter were battling the blaze with more help on the 
way, Washoe County spokeswoman Kathy Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another fire sparked by lightning two days ago continued to burn  
near Doyle, Calif. That fire had charred about 9,000 acres of brush 
Tuesday night. No structures were threatened.

<HEADLINE> The Lighter Side of Business /  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NO TIME LIKE NOW: Young people who are thinking of starting  
their own businesses should just go out and do it, advises 
Professor Barrett Hazeltine, a professor emeritus of engineering at 
Brown University. Hazeltine, interviewed in Fast Company magazine, 
says the best time to begin a new company is when you're still 
young. ``You don't have a spouse. You don't have a mortgage. 
Failure at 40 can be a huge blow; but at 25, you go to the beach 
for a few days, and it's all better.'' He also advises the 
inexperienced not to worry about the brevity of their resumes. ``If 
you're starting an Internet company, there just isn't a common set 
of principles that you'll need to spend years learning ... . 
Experience doesn't have much advantage anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	WHO BUYS ONLINE AND WHY: People who shop over the Internet tend  
to be attracted by its convenience rather than any price breaks, 
finds the consulting firm Mitchell Madison Group. In a survey of 
more than 1,200 Internet users, the company found that people who 
buy online are pressed for time and aren't the kind to shop just 
for fun. Internet users who are considering online shopping but 
haven't done it yet are attracted by the time savings, but they're 
also concerned about getting a good price. The survey also found 
that more traditional shoppers are among the least likely to buy 
online because it's not as satisfying an experience as shopping in 
a store or mall. These shoppers also tend to spend less time online 
than people who currently buy over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	AIRPORTS? UGH: Ask most adults what they want in an airport and  
they'll probably say short lines at the gate and flights that leave 
on time. But ask kids what they'd like and they're likely to say 
video arcade games, TV sets and binoculars so they can watch planes 
take off and land. HNTB Corp., an architectural firm that designs 
airport facilities, surveyed nearly 200 children ages 8 to 15, 
asking them what they liked and disliked about airports, and what 
they wanted to see in an airport. Nearly 70 percent wanted video 
games, and 45 percent wanted their own TV sets. Nearly a quarter 
asked for binoculars. Asked what they liked the least about being 
in an airport, more than half replied, ``having nothing to do.'' 
More than half also complained about waiting for planes and waiting 
to check in.

<HEADLINE> Wildcats' Offense Faces Stern Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona brings one of college football's  
most experienced and potent offenses to Penn State for Saturday's 
Pigskin Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats' lightning-fast tailback, two big-play quarterbacks  
and breakaway receiver will run smack into a Nittany Lions defense 
that should be one of the best in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their defense may be the best one we've ever played,'' Arizona  
coach Dick Tomey said. ``You don't find anybody just marching up 
and down the field on them. You just have to try to put together 
some first downs. You're certainly not going to make big play after 
big play against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big plays, though, are Arizona's trademark.  
</P>
<P>
	Tomey's program was once known for sputtering offense and  
stifling defense, but that was before the arrival of Trung 
Canidate, Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a program that has won 16 of its last 17 games. Seven  
offensive starters return from last year's 12-1 team, which 
averaged 445 yards and 34.7 points per game. Penn State has nine 
starters back from a defense that ranked in the top 12 nationally 
in four statistical categories. 
</P>
<P>
	Something, obviously, has to give, when the fourth-ranked  
Wildcats and third-ranked Nittany Lions square off, and Arizona's 
players have no illusions that anything will be easy at Beaver 
Stadium, where Penn State hasn't lost a home opener since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look fabulous on paper,'' Canidate said. ``But the bottom  
line is, on the 28th, we're going to have to put those little paper 
men out on the field. We've got the personnel, but the bottom line 
is you still have to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most spectacular offensive weapon is Canidate, a senior  
tailback who had 10 touchdown runs of 37 yards or longer last year. 
He gained a school-record 288 yards in the regular-season finale 
against Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	But he will be going against a defense that allowed no runner,  
not even Wisconsin's giant Ron Dayne, to gain 100 yards last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``A big game out of Trung is just doing whatever it takes in the  
scope of the game to help us win,'' Tomey said. ``If it's 50 yards, 
it's 50 yards and some key 2-yard gains, or if it's 150 yards, and 
it's hanging onto the football. A big game against a team like this 
is not like a big game against the Little Sisters of the Poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Smith likely will start at quarterback, but Tomey won't  
abandon the two-headed quarterback system that worked so well last 
season. Ortege Jenkins will play. 
</P>
<P>
	``They both deserve to play and we're going to do that for  
awhile,'' Tomey said. ``How long they do that will be determined by 
how well they do. They're both prepared for anything. They've set a 
tone for the whole team. They've set the tone for unselfishness for 
everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Dennis Northcutt is another big weapon. He had  
some big games last year, including 10 receptions for 135 yards 
against Washington and eight for 103 against UCLA. He needs 19 
catches to become Arizona's career receiving leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The other receiving threats include Brad Brennan and freshman  
Bobby Wade, last year's Arizona prep player of the year who also 
will return kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	The big-play people could be silenced if Arizona can't control  
Penn State's defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quarterback experience is good, but the offensive line is  
what's going to have to prevail in this game,'' Tomey said, 
``because if your offensive line can't do the job, your 
quarterbacks, running backs and receivers aren't going to get a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about the offensive line. We have a much more  
experienced offensive line than we had a year ago. We basically 
have four guys who were starters or near-starters. The matchup 
between the offensive and defensive lines for both teams will 
probably determine the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Canidate has been dreaming about breaking through the  
line on a long run, silencing the hostile crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all you think about all summer when you're working out.  
You're watching film of all these great players they've got,'' he 
said. ``Most definitely, I daydream about this game. You've got to 
visualize yourself doing great things, and then be prepared for the 
worst.''

<HEADLINE> Hemp Co-Op Sparks N.D. Farmers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A planned industrial hemp cooperative in  
North Dakota is causing a stir among farmers, and government 
officials concerned that the co-op is promising something it can't 
legally deliver. 
</P>
<P>
	Dustin Mathern, who formed the Fargo-based HempCo earlier this  
month with Janet Miller, another Fargo resident, said details of 
the co-op are still being worked out but that they include 
establishing processing plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising hemp, a cousin of marijuana, is illegal. Mathern said  
he's working with the Drug Enforcement Administration to find a way 
to legally grow the crop. DEA officials did not immediately return 
calls seeking comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just getting the ball rolling,'' Mathern said, adding  
that if HempCo isn't able to process industrial hemp it likely 
would be an organization dedicated to promoting legalization of the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the state Department of Agriculture has received at  
least a dozen calls from hopeful farmers looking for more 
information on the co-op. 
</P>
<P>
	John Leppert, noxious weeds specialist with the department, said  
HempCo has done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	However, ``We're concerned that information may be floating out  
there that farmers can rush out to join a co-op and they can raise 
hemp and process it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemp, which is used to make clothes, paper, cosmetics and other  
goods, does not produce a high, but it is still illegal in the 
United States to grow it. 
</P>
<P>
	During North Dakota's last legislative session, lawmakers  
ordered hemp be removed from a state list of noxious weeds that 
have to be eradicated and instituted a system for licensing growers 
should hemp production ever become legal. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Leppert said, ``federal law still supersedes state  
law on this issue. There's no way (the co-op) is going to be able 
to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only is it illegal to grow hemp in the United States, it  
also is against the law to import raw hemp into the country, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agriculture department on Monday informed HempCo of that.  
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly hope the DEA will modify its position, and allow  
our producers the opportunity to grow hemp to compete in the world 
marketplace with this versatile and increasingly valuable 
commodity,'' state Agriculture Commissioner Roger Johnson said. 
``But for right now it's simply against the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The co-op has sparked interest in the farming community, which  
has been plagued in recent years by poor prices for most crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Brinkman, who grows small grains near Bismarck, said that  
even though he knows growing hemp is illegal, he still plans to 
contact HempCo to get more information on efforts to legalize hemp 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	``Admittedly it's an uphill battle all the way,'' he said. ``But  
somebody's got to fight the fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Janet Millers who live in Fargo but aren't the Miller  
associated with the co-op project say they've received wrong-number 
calls from numerous farmers looking for information. Both said 
they're not upset about the calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fine -- we like farmers,'' said Raymond Miller, the  
husband of one of the Janets.

<HEADLINE> Fed News Drives Dollar Mostly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar turned mostly lower in volatile  
trading Tuesday as the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest 
rates for a second time this summer but also signaled that rates 
now may hold steady in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0529, up  
from $1.0505 late Monday. The dollar also was quoted at 110.80 
Japanese yen, down from 111.44. But the British pound fell below 
$1.60. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve raised  
interest rates by a quarter point for the second time in two months 
in an effort to cool the economy by making it more difficult for 
Americans to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates make returns more attractive on investments  
denominated in dollars. But the Fed also signaled that rates may 
stabilize. It said the two interest rate increases over the past 
eight weeks ``should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. stocks gyrated after the decision was announced and the  
dollar followed that pattern. The Dow Jones industrial average, 
which closed at a record high Monday, initially rose on the Fed's 
decision, then retreated only to regain much of the lost ground at 
the close of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds gained ground. The dollar was slightly higher against the  
yen and slightly lower against the euro after the Fed's action. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5201 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5236, and 1.4925 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4979. The British 
pound fell to $1.5941 from $1.6026. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8575 German 
marks, down from 1.8620; 6.2297 French francs, down from 6.2449; 
and 1,839 Italian lire, down from 1,843.

<HEADLINE> Bennett Apologizes to Black Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sen. Bob Bennett said he didn't mean to  
offend anyone when he predicted that George W. Bush will be the GOP 
presidential nominee unless ``some black woman comes forward with 
an illegitimate child that he fathered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I make a mistake, it's a beaut,'' Bennett, R-Utah, said  
Monday after a private meeting with civil rights leaders. ``There's 
no question this was a mistake. I had no intention of offending 
anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett had said he regretted making the ``clumsy'' remark to  
the editorial board of the Standard-Examiner newspaper in Ogden on 
Aug. 13. Bennett said he was thinking of the movie ``Primary 
Colors'' and its portrayal of a fictional Southern governor's 
womanizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless George W. steps in front of a bus or some woman comes  
forward, let's say some black woman comes forward with an 
illegitimate child that he fathered within the last 18 months, or 
some other scenario that you could be equally creative in thinking 
of, George W. Bush will be the nominee,'' Bennett told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was simply a clinical description of the state of politics  
in America, but it was not received that way, and I should have 
been smart enough to realize it probably would not be received that 
way,'' Bennett said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told him that was a very poor excuse,'' Jeanetta Williams,  
president of the NAACP's Salt Lake City branch, said after meeting 
with Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only Sen. Bennett can give you a clear explanation about what  
was in his mind,'' said Edward L. Lewis Jr., president of the 
NAACP's Utah, Idaho and Nevada branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of  
Colored People also are upset with comments made by Utah's other 
Republican senator, Orrin Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	``People of color can't do anything about their color,'' Hatch  
said recently. ``But I do believe gay people have a choice to live 
within the legal rules or not. It's up to them, they do have a 
choice, where an African-American has no choice with regard to the 
color of their skin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Lewis criticized Hatch for contrasting gays and  
blacks in terms of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not equate being gay or being lesbian with 300 years of  
slavery and being black in America. It is not the same thing,'' 
Lewis said. ``However, we do feel that everyone should have their 
civil rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch was hosting a golf tournament and was not immediately  
available for comment Monday. His spokeswoman, Heather Barney, said 
Hatch has ``done an awful lot for the minorities' communities and 
he takes his responsibilities very seriously in representing 
everyone in Utah.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. May End Popular Gun Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- County officials have given preliminary  
approval to banning sales of guns and ammunition on county 
property, a move that would effectively bring an end to the popular 
Great Western Gun Show. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 for the ordinance, which was  
prompted by the killing of a postal worker and the wounding of five 
people at the North Valley Jewish Community Center earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think today's vote was a historic vote taken by the nation's  
largest county, which has been host to the largest gun show in the 
world,'' Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 vendors set up exhibitions at the gun shows, which  
attracts some 100,000 customers each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The board will take up the measure a second time in the next few  
weeks and, if given final approval, would go into effect 30 days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of the Great Western Show, which convenes four times  
a year at the Los Angeles County fairgrounds in Pomona, said they 
would file a lawsuit challenging the county's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we're proceeding as though the show is still on,''  
Great Western general manager Chad Seger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun shows contribute an estimated $9 million each year to  
the county's economy, said Karl Amelang, president of the gun show 
company.

<HEADLINE> UBS Announces Profits Up 13 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss banking giant UBS AG on Tuesday  
said its first-half net profit rose by 13 percent, results that 
were on the lower end of analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Profit in the first half of 1999 was $2.64 billion, up from  
$2.34 billion in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	UBS, formed last year from the merger of Union Bank of  
Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp., said profits were ``well within 
expectations considering the background of an ambitious and 
challenging integration process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said UBS' profit was burdened by higher taxes and  
expenses and by revenues which grew less than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	UBS said the first-half figure was adjusted to take into account  
pretax gains on divestments both this year and last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, UBS booked a pretax gain of $1.2 billion from the  
sale of its equity stake in Swiss Life, a shareholding in the 
Julius Baer bank and from the disposal of the international 
operations of its global trade finance business. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, UBS announced a net profit of $ 2.2 billion for 1998  
after hedge-fund losses and an out-of-court settlement of Holocaust 
claims in the United States, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Brandon Stays With Cavs for $58M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Now that he knows what it's like to be  
courted as a free agent, Terrell Brandon wants to experience the 
thrill of finally playing for a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really wasn't another team that I could say really  
interested me as much as Minnesota,'' the two-time All-Star point 
guard said Tuesday after signing a six-year, $59 million deal to 
stay with the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon arrived from Milwaukee last March as part of the  
three-team trade that sent disgruntled point guard Stephon Marbury 
to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon refused to sign an extension last spring, saying he  
wanted to test free agency for the first time in an eight-year NBA 
career that included six seasons in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice,'' Brandon said of flirtations with other teams,  
including the Toronto Raptors. ``And I think people really didn't 
understand where I was coming from, just having the opportunity to 
go through it once in my career. Just being free. I had never been 
one before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Brandon said his intentions all along were to stay put.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it got very serious with other teams; phone  
calls here and there and possible sign-and-trades, it came up a 
lot,'' he said. ``As far as putting it in writing, my agent knew I 
wanted to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Duffy, Brandon's agent, said his client wanted dearly to  
pick his place to play for the first time since choosing to attend 
Oregon in 1988, even though few teams could afford his asking 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played the first eight years of his career without being  
able to determine that,'' Duffy said. ``Now, the marketplace 
changed. It wasn't like there were 12 clubs that could have paid 
him whatever. So, it would have been on a sign-and-trade basis. We 
could have manipulated his destination, but he chose to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duffy said Brandon valued his short-term exposure to coach Flip  
Saunders, owner Glen Taylor and vice president of basketball 
operations Kevin McHale. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he trusts them and he knows Kevin McHale is all about  
winning championships and that's what Terrell wants to do,'' Duffy 
said. ``He's had a lot of individual success. Now he has the 
financial security and the only thing left is to reach the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders said the Kevin Garnett-led Wolves are finally poised  
for playoff success with the signing of Brandon and free agents Tom 
Hammonds and Joe Smith, along with first-round draft picks Wally 
Szczerbiak and William Avery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got some stability,'' Saunders said. ``I don't  
think you win in this league until you do have some stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon has been beset by injuries throughout his career.  
Saunders said he should be able to keep Brandon's health in check 
by spelling him with Avery and Bobby Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to have to play Terrell 40 minutes a game,''  
Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon averaged 13.9 points and 8.6 assists last season,  
leading the NBA in assist-to-turnover ratio. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is a big step for us going where we want to go,  
which is homecourt advantage in the playoffs and advancing in the 
playoffs,'' McHale said. ``No longer are we content just to make 
the playoffs. Those days are over. We've got to start advancing and 
making runs in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we feel Terrell is going to be the man that's going to  
lead us there.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with  
many investors expecting a rise in U.S. interest rates despite a 
record rally overnight on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp gains on Wall Street came despite widespread  
expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest 
rates one-quarter percentage point at its Federal Open Market 
Committee meeting later Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost  
138.14 points, or 0.76 percent, to finish at 18,095.41 points. On 
Monday, the average closed up 135.44 points, or 0.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks closed lower on profit-taking. Many bank shares  
ended lower after rising sharply over the past three sessions on 
expectations of further realignment in the industry following the 
three-way alliance of Industrial Bank of Japan, Dai-Ichi Kangyo 
Bank and Fuji Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 112.22 yen,  
up 1.48 yen from its level of 110.74 in Tokyo late Monday and also 
above its late New York level of 111.44 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks closed higher in a storm-shortened session.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose rose 60.21 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 
13,633.87. On Monday, the index gained 6.92 points, or 0.05 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As on Monday, trading on the exchange was limited to 90 minutes  
Tuesday because of torrential rain that caused flooding throughout 
the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share price rose in reaction to sharp gains on Wall  
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 199.15 points, 
or 1.8 percent, to 11,299.76, surpassing its July 16 record close 
of 11,209.84. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many investors in Hong Kong remained cautious because  
of worries over a possible rise in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower for a second consecutive  
session amid worries over corporate first-half earnings, which are 
expected later this month. The market's key Weighted Stock Price 
Index fell 135.59 points, or 1.7 percent, to 7,984.39. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The benchmark  
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 17.39 points, or 0.8 percent, to 
2,133.75. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher on follow-through buying  
triggered by Wall Street's overnight gain, traders said. The 
30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 28.16 points, or 
1.3 percent, to 2,248.93. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed lower, taking an  
opposite stance to Wall Street's rise overnight, amid expectations 
of a rise in U.S. interest rates. The All Ordinaries Index fell 
11.8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 3,052.4. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher as market sentiment was buoyed  
by a sharp rise on Wall Street. The Korea Composite Stock Price 
Index rose 14.83 points, or 1.6 percent, to 932.41. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed mostly higher. The  
Composite Index, which tracks 100 key stocks, rose 2.89 points, or 
0.3 percent, to 775.18. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The  
benchmark Straits Times Index fell 3.95 points, or 0.5 percent, to 
2,120.02. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed slightly lower on  
profit-taking. The main SET index slipped 1.64 points, or 0.4 
percent, to 446.55. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed mixed. The Composite Index  
rose 1.433 points, or 0.2 percent, to 586.236.

<HEADLINE> OSU's Diggs Passes On Knowledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A year ago, the kid wearing No. 32 was  
trying to make a name for himself while playing in the shadow cast 
by the take-charge guys who also played linebacker for Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the role played by Na'il (pronounced NEYE'-ehl) Diggs has  
changed. Now he is the lynchpin of Ohio State's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at the younger guys and I see that I was them last  
year,'' the 6-foot-4, 235-pound junior said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Katzenmoyer was a Butkus Award winner who drew extra  
attention off and on the field while earning All-American acclaim 
and getting on the cover of Sports Illustrated's 1998 college 
football preview issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Jerry Rudzinski was an introspective five-time  
scholar-athlete who captained the Buckeyes to an 11-1 record and a 
No. 2 ranking in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Diggs watched and learned. He saw how Katzenmoyer and Rudzinski  
prepared for games and how intense and intent they were once the 
games began. He took note of their work habits and dedication to 
conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring Diggs realized that, with both of his  
teammate-teachers gone, he had a responsibility to pass on what he 
had discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not easy. There's a lot to learn,'' he said of the  
process that all young players encounter. ``You want to help them, 
to say, 'Are you getting this?' There's a lot to take in. You want 
to put a hand on their shoulder and say, 'You might want to try 
doing it this way,' or 'Here's how you ought to do that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	As Ohio State readies for Sunday's Kickoff Classic game against  
Miami, it's clear that Diggs is the fulcrum of a Buckeye defense 
that lost five central figures from last year's run for the 
national title. He is respected not only as a player but also as a 
quiet leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Diggs takes the job seriously. In a questionnaire, he said the  
best thing about being an Ohio State football player is ``meaning 
so much to the people of Columbus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His job is elder statesman of the linebacker corps,''  
defensive coordinator Fred Pagac said. ``I think he's stepping up 
and being a little more vocal and also doing a little more leading 
by example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diggs played on the defensive line his first two years at Ohio  
State after Pagac stole the Los Angeles native away from Southern 
Cal. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Rodney Bailey has noticed Diggs' growth.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's taken that leadership role,'' Bailey said. ``He's shown  
that all of us who have played the last two or three years should 
do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Katzenmoyer, Rudzinski and defensive backs Antoine  
Winfield, Damon Moore and Central McClellion all gone, Ohio State's 
defense needs more than someone who can lead cheers and make 
everyone feel good. 
</P>
<P>
	There isn't much doubt Diggs can handle the role of enforcer,  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago he shocked many by beating out Katzenmoyer for  
first-team All-Big Ten in voting by the conference coaches. His 16 
tackles for negative yardage were the most on the team and his 80 
stops were exceeded only by Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really developing into an outstanding player,'' head  
coach John Cooper said. ``We feel Na'il is one of the better 
linebackers in this league and I just hope he can play as well this 
year as he did last year. If he does, I think he'll be an 
All-American player for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's Buckeye offense averaged 36 points a game. With  
several important cogs missing from that offensive unit, including 
3,000-yard passer Joe Germaine, Diggs recognizes that the defense 
may have to carry an even bigger share of the load. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really more of a diverse team,'' he said. ``Last year,  
we were a quick-strike type of offense. This year on offense we'll 
have more drives and longer drives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things don't change so much on defense, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``The defense will be doing the same thing. Every year we're  
trying to keep the ball out of the other offense's hands,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Prints Unabomber's Parable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The Unabomber isn't done writing, not by a  
long shot. 
</P>
<P>
	His manifesto behind him and his 368-page memoir only weeks from  
release, Theodore Kaczynski has written a parable for a magazine 
produced by students at the State University of New York in 
Binghamton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ship of Fools'' tells of passengers and crew who spend their  
time griping about personal injustices instead of taking over the 
vessel from an insane crew. The boat eventually crashes into two 
icebergs and everyone dies. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski wrote the 11-page tale from his Colorado prison cell  
at the request of Tim LaPietra, a 21-year-old senior. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPietra calls the story ``a mockery of the left and how it  
operates.''

	``What I get from it is that he's saying, `People who are  
leftist shouldn't waste their time with what he calls reform, such 
as equal wages and equal treatment for women,''' LaPietra said. 
``The main issue is we have to stop the industrial machine before 
it takes away all of our humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story, to be published next month in Off magazine, has been  
posted on the Web site of Context Books (www.contextbooks.com). The 
publisher also is handling Kaczynski's memoir, ``Truth Versus 
Lies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski was captured in 1996 after his brother noticed  
similarities between Kaczynski's writings and the Unabomber's 
anti-technology manifesto published in The Washington Post and The 
New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski ended his trial by confessing to being the elusive  
Unabomber who killed three people and injured 23 others between 
1978 and 1995 with homemade bombs. He was sentenced to life in 
prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	In the parable, the Harvard-trained Kaczynski writes of a  
college professor shocked at what he sees on the doomed vessel: 
</P>
<P>
	``All this is just awful! Its immoral!'' according to the Web  
site story. ``Its racism, sexism, speciesism, homophobia and 
exploitation of the working class! Its discrimination!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watching it all is the cabin boy, who repeatedly warns that the  
sailors and passengers should put their grievances aside and 
overthrow the captain to turn things around. At this point, the 
professor announces: ``I don't believe in violence. It's immoral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaPietra, who describes himself as an anarchist, said he doesn't  
condone violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what it's worth, you've got to weigh the cost and  
benefit,'' he said. ``He took drastic action and his message got 
out to the mainstream media. I think people realize that he wasn't 
just a serial killer. He had something to say.''

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Fight Ownership Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Newspaper Association of America has asked  
federal regulators to suspend a rule that prohibits ownership of a 
broadcast station and daily newspaper in the same locale. 
</P>
<P>
	In a petition to the Federal Communications Commission, the  
association asked the agency to quit enforcing the regulation or at 
least implement a waiver policy until it can be repealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The association said newspapers face a disadvantage in the  
marketplace because of recent actions by the FCC relaxing other 
broadcast ownership restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC earlier this month altered its rules to allow a single  
company to own two TV stations in the same market under certain 
conditions. It also has relaxed rules that had prohibited ownership 
of radio and TV stations in the same market. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper trade group said while other companies will seek  
to acquire broadcast stations as a result of these changes, 
newspapers will be shut out because of the nearly 25-year-old 
prohibition on cross-ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the government to lock out local newspaper publishers is  
unfair, uncompetitive and frankly, bizarre in a world marked by 
hundreds of over-the-air and cable channels, broadcasting 
nationwide from satellites, and the ubiquitous nature of the 
Internet,'' NAA President John F. Sturm said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule is currently under  
review by the FCC. The agency is considering whether to eliminate 
it entirely, change it or keep it as is. The commission also has 
the authority to stop enforcing the rule on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in the commission's mass media bureau have indicated  
that they will make their recommendations by fall.

<HEADLINE> Report: Toyota, VW Agree on Engines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. of Japan and Germany's  
Volkswagen AG have agreed to supply each other with fuel-efficient 
engines in a bid to remain competitive in world markets, a 
newspaper reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The automakers see the move as a ``strong alliance'' amid a wave  
of global automobile reorganizations, the mass circulation Yomiuri 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yomiuri, Japan's largest daily, cited sources close to both  
automakers but did not name them. A Toyota spokesman refused to 
comment on the report and Volkswagen officials in Tokyo could not 
immediately be reached Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a basic agreement, Toyota will license to VW about 200  
patents on its D-4, or direct-injection gasoline engines, the 
report said. A direct-injection engine is more fuel-efficient than 
conventional engines because of computer-controlled injection of 
fuel into cylinders. 
</P>
<P>
	VW, the largest European carmaker, starting next year will mount  
Toyota-supplied direct-engines on its new vehicles, the Yomiuri 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, will install  
VW-supplied direct-injection diesel engines in its luxury models to 
be sold in Europe, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota and VW plan to annually build a combined total of about  
10 million direct-injection engines in their respective vehicles, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yomiuri said the two auto giants are expected to conclude a  
contract shortly, and officially announce their partnership at this 
year's Tokyo Motor show, scheduled for October.

<HEADLINE> Astros' Hidalgo To Have Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Houston Astros outfielder Richard Hidalgo, on  
the disabled list since Aug. 9, found out Tuesday he needs surgery 
on his left knee and will miss the rest of the season, 
</P>
<P>
	Hidalgo, one of 13 Astros on the disabled list this season, has  
inflammation resulting from loose cartilage. The Astros said it was 
caused by a congenital condition that caused the kneecap not to 
properly join together. 
</P>
<P>
	He will have the operation Thursday in Houston.

<HEADLINE> Richmond Is NBA's Highest Paid Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For much of the summer, Mitch Richmond's  
future seemed to lie almost anywhere but Washington. That changed 
Tuesday as he signed a four-year, $40-million contract with the 
Wizards to become the highest-paid shooting guard in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully my jersey is washed,'' Richmond joked to assistant  
equipment manager Jerry Walter after he returned to the MCI Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards and Richmond's agent reached agreement last week  
after stalled negotiations, which puts Richmond ahead of shooting 
guards Reggie Miller, Kobe Bryant, Latrell Sprewell and Ray Allen -- 
each of whom will make about $9 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``What can you say?'' Richmond said. ``I thought that I played a  
lot of years in this league. You never know when it's going to 
come, but you want to keep playing and let things handle 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Richmond's first with the Wizards, the 34-year-old  
guard led the team in scoring, averaging 19.7 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	But that scoring average was also the lowest of Richmond's  
career. The team had a rocky season, finishing 18-32 and without a 
shot at the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Richmond predicts a turnaround.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt we were a playoff-caliber team last year, but things  
didn't go our way,'' Richmond said. ``This year definitely I think 
we'll be a lot better team. I think we are a playoff team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards acquired Richmond in May 1998 in a trade with  
Sacramento, where he played for seven years. After he became a free 
agent at the end of last season, Richmond looked ready to leave 
Washington when contract talks stalled over money. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond's agent fielded offers from as many as eight teams,  
including deals that would have required the Wizards to sign and 
trade Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are applying for a job, you want to really seek out  
all options,'' Richmond said. ``... They explored all options, and 
we explored all options, and we found out the best alternative ... 
was to remain a Wizard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington general manager Wes Unseld said in a statement that  
retaining Richmond was ``a top-priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mitch is one of the top shooting guards in the NBA, and with  
point guard Rod Strickland we retain one of the best backcourts in 
the league,'' Unseld said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards have yet to sign another shooting guard, Richard  
Hamilton, selected seventh overall in the June draft. Hamilton 
agreed to a three-year, $5.9 million deal last month, but fired his 
agent before it was signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's new agent, Bill Strickland, said he expected a new  
deal to be worked out soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wes and I plan to get together very shortly to continue the  
dialogue,'' Strickland said. ``I don't anticipate much in the way 
of problems.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. May Issue Reagan Car Tags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Ronald Reagan-loving drivers may soon  
be able to display the object of the affection on their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Senate on Tuesday voted 30-4 for final approval for  
Ronald Reagan plates, which would be designed by the Reagan 
Presidential Library and the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, has not said whether he would sign  
the measure into law. Spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the governor 
is aware of Reagan's position in history as the first California 
governor to be elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is about honoring a Californian who achieved a status  
that's unique,'' said Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cordova, who said 
supporting the plate legislation is not a vote to support Reagan's 
conservative Republican politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The plates would cost $50 at first, and $40 to renew each year.  
The money would go toward the 40th president's library. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan, 88, announced five years ago that he has Alzheimer's  
disease and has made few public appearances since.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Mostly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks ended mostly higher Tuesday,  
including French shares boosted by strong first-half results from 
France Telecom and Elf Aquitaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies closed up  
0.58 point, or 0.2 percent, at 310.53, while the Dow Jones Euro 
Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in countries joining the 
single currency, ended up 1.60 points at 323.74. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index finished 28.71 points higher  
at 3781.30, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index rose 14.32 points to 
3733.44. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, the CAC 40 index rose 1.2 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom announced it will launch a free Internet service  
and that it had agreed in principle with Lyonnaise Cable, a unit of 
utility giant Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, on a plan to create a 
jointly owned company that would unite France Telecom's cable 
infrastructure with Lyonnaise Cable's cable service operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf Aquitaine's reported 16 percent fall in first-half net  
profit, excluding special items, was better than expected. It said 
it had made rapid progress with its cost-cutting program. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in French pay-television group Canal Plus climbed 7.0  
percent on market speculation that Vivendi is planning to sell part 
of its 49 percent stake to German media group Bertelsmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Vivendi increased its stake in Canal Plus to 49 percent from 34  
percent last month, but said it was wanted to reduce this stake 
back below 40 percent if it could find a strategic partner for the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	France's banking trio -- Banque Nationale de Paris, Societe  
Generale and Paribas -- rose, continuing Monday's banking, which was 
sparked by consolidation hopes,

index closed down 0.1 percent and Amsterdam's AEX ended 0.2 percent

<P>
	In Zurich, the SMI closed 0.6 percent lower, dragged down by  
disappointing results from banking group UBS, which reported an 
increase of 13 percent net profit in first half -- at the lower end 
of market expectations.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am 103 Families Get Briefings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Relatives of Pan Am 103 victims were assured  
by Scottish prosecutors there would be ``no deals'' in the upcoming 
trial against the two men charged with carrying out the 1988 
bombing of a jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've assured the family members that there have been no  
deals,'' said Lord Hardie, Scotland's senior law officer. ``There 
have been no deals and there will be no deals to hold back any 
available evidence in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200 relatives attended the private meeting Monday to  
receive updates on preparations for the trial next February against 
alleged Libyan agents accused of planting a suitcase bomb on the 
Pan Am jetliner. The attack killed 270 people, including 189 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	To persuade Libya to turn over the suspects -- Abdel Basset Ali  
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah -- the British and U.S. 
governments agreed to hold the trial at Camp Zeist, Netherlands, 30 
miles southeast of Amsterdam. Under a treaty, the camp will be 
considered Scottish territory for the duration of the trial, which 
will be conducted under Scottish law. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Cohen of Cape May Court House, N.J., opposes the deal,  
contending it rewarded Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi for turning 
over the suspects. Like other victims' families, Mrs. Cohen 
believes Gadhafi ordered the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those two men going on trial could never have acted  
independently,'' said Mrs. Cohen, who lost her 20-year-old 
daughter, Theodora, in the explosion. ``I'm afraid that Gadhafi 
will come out of this without a scratch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said officials  
worked diligently to put pressure on Gadhafi ``to allow a fair 
trial outside Libya.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Williams of Joppa, Md., said he was relieved to see any  
type of action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take from this whatever we can get,'' said Williams, who  
lost his 24-year-old son, Geordie. ``I'm glad to see things finally 
moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Hardie, officials from the FBI and Justice  
Department also met with family members at a downtown hotel. 
Attorney General Janet Reno addressed the group briefly as well. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Security Council air and arms embargoes against Libya were  
suspended April 5 when the two suspects were handed over for trial 
in the Netherlands. The council imposed the measures in 1992 to 
compel Gadhafi to turn the men over. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has said it won't allow sanctions to be lifted  
entirely until Libya has cooperated with the court proceedings, 
paid compensation to the families if the men are convicted and 
demonstrated its renunciation of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Families of the victims will be allowed to attend the trial with  
help from the British and U.S. governments. Alternatively, they can 
watch the proceeding from designated sites through encrypted 
satellite links that will be established for them. An Internet Web 
site also will be available to help relatives keep track of 
developments in the trial.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rallied Tuesday on expectations that  
the quarter-point rate hike announced by the Federal Reserve will 
be the last of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 23/32  
point, or $7.18 3/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.93 percent from 5.98 percent 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	As was widely anticipated, the Fed said Tuesday it was  
increasing its target for the federal funds rate -- the interest 
banks charge each other on overnight loans -- to 5.25 percent from 5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision marked the second time this summer that the Fed has  
raised this rate to try to slow the economy by making it more 
expensive for Americans to borrow. In a statement, the Fed said the 
two rate hikes should ``markedly diminish the risk of rising 
inflation going forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank also said it was keeping its policy directive,  
which signals possible future actions, on neutral. Some economists 
took that as a signal there may not be further rate hikes this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader bond market, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities were up between 3/32 point and 7/32 point, and 
intermediate maturities were up 3/8 point to 17/32 point, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.97 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.84 percent. Six-month 
yields were 5.08 percent, as the discount fell 0.06 percentage 
point to 4.88 percent. One-year yields were 5.14 percent as the 
discount fell by 0.04 percentage point from late Monday to 4.88 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.06 from 5.00 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/8 to 113 1/8. The average yield to 
maturity fell to 5.85 percent from 5.86 percent.

<HEADLINE> Jones Comes Up Short in Long Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Marion Jones looks unbeatable in the  
sprints. In the long jump, she's not even second best. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones came into the World Championships seeking a record four  
gold medals. She'll leave with no more than three. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after winning the 100 meters in 10.80 seconds, Jones  
settled for bronze in the long jump, which ended in dramatic and 
controversial fashion for the top two finishers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I set my goals very high,'' Jones said. ``The bronze is not  
going to cut it for me. I'm very disappointed. I need to get back 
to the drawing board and get ready for next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones can still get two more golds in Seville, in the 200 and  
one of the relays. For next year's Sydney Olympics, she has her 
sights set on an unprecedented five golds: in the 100, 200, long 
jump and two relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who hasn't lost a sprint race since 1997, returns to  
action today in the 200 heats and quarterfinals. So does Maurice 
Greene, who won the men's 100 Sunday in 9.80 seconds and is bidding 
for a rare sprint double. 
</P>
<P>
	Six finals were scheduled tonight: women's hammer, women's  
triple jump, men's discus, women's 800, men's 1,500 and men's 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Perfecting the long jump will be Jones' biggest challenge. She's  
got the speed; it's the mechanics that need work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be the first one to tell you I need to work on my  
technique,'' she said. ``My speciality is running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones dismissed suggestions that she put too much pressure on  
herself by proclaiming her intention to win four gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't regret it at all,'' she said. ``It blows my mind that  
people can't understand that when I'm entered in four events, I'm 
not going to say I'm going to win three golds and a bronze.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, with a career-best 23 feet, 11 3/4 inches in the long jump,  
never got untracked. Her best effort of 22-5 Monday was 1 1/2 feet 
short of that. 
</P>
<P>
	British-born Italian Fiona May, the 1995 world champion, was  
leading until the next-to-last jump. Then Cuban-born Niurka 
Montalvo of Spain soared 23-2, a career-best, but her toe appeared 
to be past the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials ruled it a fair jump as the crowd of 37,815 roared in  
approval. May had the final jump and couldn't match that distance, 
giving her the silver at 22-9 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians quickly protested. More than an hour after the  
competition, a six-member Jury of Appeal rejected the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``No mark (on the plastecine), no foul,'' International Amateur  
Athletic Federation spokesman Giorgio Reineri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montalvo, who received Spanish citizenship May 5, became the  
first woman from her adopted country to win gold in track and field 
at an Olympics or World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	May was in tears.  
</P>
<P>
	``That was a foul,'' she said. ``It was a no-jump. All the other  
jumpers who saw the replay told me it was a no-jump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she felt robbed for a second straight time at a World  
Championships. In Athens, Greece, two years ago, May was called for 
a foul on her last leap and settled for the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the second time they're doing this to me,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	This was the third consecutive World Championships that the  
women's long jump was decided in the final stages, and each time 
May was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, she beat Montalvo with her final attempt.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm paying her back now,'' Montalvo said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's other finals, Kenya's Christopher Koskei won the  
3,000 steeplechase at 8 minutes, 11.76 seconds as world 
record-holder Bernard Bermasai, also of Kenya, finished fifth; 
Russia's Vyacheslav Voronin won the men's high jump at 7-9 1/4, a 
career best and the best in the world for 1999; and Franka Dietzsch 
of Germany took the women's discus at 223-7.

<HEADLINE> Thai Bank Board Forced To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The Thai central bank forced the  
resignation Tuesday of every member of the board of troubled Krung 
Thai Bank except for the new president named last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The purge was announced after a meeting of the Bank of  
Thailand's rescue fund, which is the major shareholder in 
state-owned Krung Thai, the country's second largest commercial 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Krung Thai has been at the center of a political uproar  
following disclosure of a preliminary audit by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers estimating that 84 percent of the bank's 
loans could be bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Like all of Thailand's banks following the Asian economic crisis  
two years ago, state-owned Krung Thai is swamped with 
non-performing loans. But bank officials say the figure is closer 
to 59 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition members of parliament have demanded an investigation  
into allegedly lax lending practices, targeting Sirin 
Nimmanhaeminda, a former bank president and brother of Finance 
Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Tarrin named a former central bank governor Tuesday  
to head an independent, five-member committee to investigate Krung 
Thai's lending practices. The findings are to be reported in 45 
days.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Spanish and Italian newspapers were split  
over the controversial decision that resulted in Niurka Montalvo 
winning the long jump gold medal over Fiona May at the World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``A questionable leap to gold,'' read a front-page headline in  
the Barcelona daily El Periodico on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A polemical'' victory said El Pais, a Madrid newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
	The headlines in Italy mirrored May's anger over the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``Judges tear away the gold from Fiona May,'' said Il Giornale,  
while Corriere dello Sport said, ``Fiona robbed of the best gold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corriere stood behind May's complaint, and printed a close-up of  
Montalvo's foot at the foul line with a red circle around the 
contested toe. 
</P>
<P>
	But Il Giornale admitted that ``it's difficult to say'' whether  
Montalvo's foot improperly broke the line. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, May's contested silver medal was secondary to her  
tantrums and tears. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision ``made her cry in front of everybody, unable to  
find consolation,'' Il Giornale said. 
</P>
<P>
	La Repubblica was harsher. ``You can jump over anything, but  
destiny always trips one up,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish papers were reticent to claim the Cuban-born  
Montalvo's gold was entirely for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two countries and just one medal,'' El Pais said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Spanish gold that comes from Cuba,'' headlined Diario 16.  
</P>
<P>
	Montalvo married a Spaniard in January 1998 and was given  
Spanish nationality in May this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the first Spanish woman to win a track and field gold medal  
at an Olympics or World Championships is apparently not famous in 
her new home. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people paid any attention to Montalvo late Monday night when  
she was seen with several friends at an outdoor restaurant near the 
famous Seville cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	Still wearing her jumping suit and the trousers of her warm-up  
suit, Montalvo was asked politely by the restaurant staff to leave 
at 3 a.m., about an hour after the restaurant regularly closes. She 
and her friends complied.

<P>
	Busemann finished the dash in 10.87 seconds and also took part  
in the long jump, with a top effort of 24 feet, 11 1/4 inches, but 
then decided he couldn't go on.

	``It happened as I was coming easily out of the starting blocks  
while warming up,'' the 24-year-old said.

<HEADLINE> Ritzy NYC Restaurant Faces Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The state has filed sex discrimination charges  
against the family that owns the Rainbow Room and other ritzy 
Manhattan restaurants, saying they only hire men at some locales. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the Cipriani family's restaurants, Harry Cipriani on the  
Upper East Side and Downtown in Soho, hire only men for lucrative 
positions as waiters and other floor staff, Attorney General Eliot 
Spitzer said in a complaint filed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer said the jobs are often the first step to management  
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``What in essence is being put in place is a glass ceiling that  
prevents women from gaining access to the higher positions in the 
industry,'' he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rainbow Room, which the Ciprianis took over in January and  
plan to reopen next month after renovations, was not named in the 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan Elgarrahy, the general manager of Harry Cipriani, said  
the charges were untrue and that one of his twelve waiters was a 
woman. The number was that small only because of low turnover, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any discrimination with regard to sex, religion  
or creed,'' Elgarrahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the Ciprianis' companies said he had not seen the  
complaint and declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the high tab for meals -- dinner for two at Harry  
Cipriani can reach $120 -- tips sometimes bring a waiter's wage to 
as much as $367 a night, Spitzer said. Tips are also shared with 
floor staff.

<HEADLINE> Nadeau To Fill In for Irvan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORESVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- One day after losing his Winston Cup  
ride, Jerry Nadeau found another one. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadeau was hired Tuesday to temporarily take over the driving  
duties for Ernie Irvan, who is recovering from head and lung 
injuries from a crash last week at Michigan Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to working with him, and he will be in the car  
until Ernie is ready to return,'' said Jay Frye, general manager of 
MB2 Motorsports 
</P>
<P>
	Nadeau began the season driving for Melling Racing, but that  
team fired him Monday, citing his recent decision to leave at the 
end of year to drive for Hendrick Motorsports in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mooresville-based MB2 team will have Nadeau behind the wheel  
of its Pontiac this weekend at Bristol, Tenn. Irvan is recuperating 
at his Mooresville farm, and additional medical tests are planned 
to determine if he is fit enough to return to the circuit next 
weekend at Darlington, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all hoping for a speedy recovery for Ernie,'' Nadeau  
said, ``but I'm glad to be able to help out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan's crash occurred last Friday during a practice run in his  
Busch Grand National car at Michigan. The wreck came five years to 
the day after he had a near-fatal accident in a Winston Cup car on 
the same two-mile track.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Higher but Limited / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures were slightly higher early today  
on the Chicago Board of Trade following a report that showed a 
deterioration in the crop condition, while grain futures opened 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean gains were limited by heavy rain beneficial to key  
growing areas in the eastern Midwest and the Mississippi River 
Delta. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, prices rose after a weekly report by the U.S. Department  
of Agriculture, released late Monday, showed a surprisingly steep 
decline in soybean crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 48 percent of all soybean acreage was in good condition as  
of Sunday, according to the government. That's down from 51 percent 
a week ago and 54 percent two weeks ago. Investors had expected 
crop conditions to improve slightly because of last week's 
Midwestern rains. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn turned quickly lower, with talk of an early harvest  
dampening investors' enthusiasm. Wheat also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was down 1 1/2 cents to $2.86 1/2 a  
bushel; December corn was down 1 1/2 cents to $2.18 1/2 per bushel; 
December oats were unchanged at $1.14 a bushel; and November 
soybeans were up 1/2 cent to $4.71 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle prices were unchanged and feeder cattle prices were  
lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork futures were 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle were unchanged at 64.70 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle were down 0.12 cent at 77.65 cents a pound. 
October lean hogs were up 0.03 cent at 46.45 cents per pound, and 
February pork bellies were up 3 cents at 61.30 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> Freebies Luring College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) -- With campus life not selling so well at  
some universities, more schools are hoping students will try a 
night at the chamber orchestra or theater in exchange for free 
tuition and other perks. 
</P>
<P>
	At West Virginia University, free food is offered to lure  
students to campus activities, away from the bar scene. At 
Westminster College in Pennsylvania, students who attend at least 
six workshops about dorm life get first dibs on prime rooms the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
	And at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, students who  
attend at least eight school-sponsored events per semester get a 
shot at free books or tuition. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools around the country are finding themselves in the same  
situation: Participation in school-sponsored social and educational 
events has fallen in recent years, said George Kuh, an education 
professor at Indiana University who has studied the issue. He did 
not have specific figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Universities have taken different approaches to solving the  
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	At Southern Illinois, students are being given cards to take  
along to school-sponsored events. After eight events, they turn the 
card in and get a coupon book with discounts to pizza parlors and 
other merchants. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are entered in a drawing for a free semester's worth  
of books or tuition donated by the university. Two students will 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Illinois junior Ryan King says the possibility of free  
books or tuition is likely to draw some students to campus events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not to be judgmental on people, but anything that has to do  
with money, that's what they're focused on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because students must attend at least eight events -- including a  
cultural event, a lecture, a educational event, a concert or play 
and an athletic event -- it will be weeks before even the most 
diligent of students can complete their first card. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Lingren, SIU's assistant director of student development,  
sees the offer as a way to encourage reluctant students to try 
something different. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greeks are involved in Greek activities; students who know  
athletes go to athletic events,'' she said. ``But students are 
sometimes unwilling to step outside the box and experience new 
activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Texas Christian University, students get punch cards to keep  
track of attendance at social, academic and religious events. 
Enough points translate to ``credit'' on transcripts that graduates 
can present to employers as evidence of extracurricular 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	At Iowa State University, students of one residence hall are  
required to participate in extracurricular activities to remain in 
the recently remodeled building. More than 1,200 students applied 
for 488 slots, said university spokesman Steve Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuh, the education professor, is not a big fan of handouts. He  
said students at schools that require extracurricular activities as 
part of the academic curriculum get the best experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Grinnell College in Iowa has said no to freebies, thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe Grinnell has had to resort to gimmicks to get  
the students to participate,'' spokesman Dann Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary White, a freshman at Southern Illinois, echoed that  
thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody likes free,'' she said. ``But if you're paying all  
this money to go to college, you ought to do the whole thing, even 
if you don't get something for it.''

<HEADLINE> Kato Wins Court Battle Over Headline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former O.J. Simpson house guest Kato Kaelin  
won another battle in federal court in his $15 million lawsuit 
against a tabloid over a headline that said ``Cops Think Kato Did 
It!'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian Jr. on Monday rejected an  
argument by attorneys for the National Examiner and its publisher 
Globe Communications Corp. that the headline was not malicious 
because it was screened and approved by the company's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Globe has done ... has set itself up a system of checks  
and balances by giving attorneys veto power'' over stories, Globe 
attorney Amy Hogue told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tevrizian rejected the argument.  
</P>
<P>
	``Simply because an attorney approves of it doesn't mean that  
actual malice doesn't exist,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaelin was Simpson's house guest when Simpson's ex-wife Nicole  
Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman were killed in front of 
her nearby condominium on June 12, 1994. Kaelin testified about 
hearing thumps on the wall the night of the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was acquitted on Oct. 3, 1995. The Globe story ran a  
week after the innocent verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The tabloid article did not accuse Kaelin of killing the two.  
The paper's news editor, John Garton, had told Kaelin's lawyer that 
the headline ``could have been better'' but explained that the 
``it'' referred to perjury, not murder. He said there was no 
evidence that police thought Kaelin was involved in the murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Tevrizian originally dismissed the suit in 1997, saying there  
was no evidence the newspaper doubted the truth of its story. A 
public figure like Kaelin can prove libel only by showing that a 
statement was knowingly or recklessly false. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court reinstated it and said a jury should  
decide whether the story neutralized the headline -- and, if not, 
whether the headline itself was libelous. 
</P>
<P>
	The court declared in a landmark ruling late last year that a  
headline alone can be grounds for libel action. 
</P>
<P>
	During a wrongful death civil trial that started in the fall of  
1997, Simpson was found liable for the slayings.

<HEADLINE> 'Sixth Sense' Tops Box Office Again / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Sixth Sense'' scared up enough business  
at the box office this weekend to maintain its No. 1 spot and top 
the $100 million mark in just its third week of release. 
</P>
<P>
	The supernatural tale about a boy who can see dead people  
grossed $24 million over the weekend, according to industry figures 
released Monday.

	The Steve Martin-Eddie Murphy comedy ``Bowfinger'' held on to  
the No. 2 spot with $35.8 million in its second week of release. 
</P>
<P>
	New films, meanwhile, opened with less-than-thrilling ticket  
sales. The mobster comedy ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' was in third place 
with a respectable $10.4 million, but the new ``Universal Soldier: 
The Return'' and ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' were weak performers.

<HEADLINE> Selig: Rose May Go to World Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Picture this: Pete Rose on the field before the  
World Series opener. 
</P>
<P>
	For a decade, it's been a dream. Now it might happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Exactly 10 years after Rose was kicked out of baseball for life,  
commissioner Bud Selig said Monday that if Rose is elected to the 
All-Century team, the sport's career hits leader would be invited 
to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was snubbed by baseball last month when the living players  
among the 100 on the All-Century ballot participated in a memorable 
on-field ceremony before the All-Star game. Rose wasn't asked to a 
pregame luncheon with the others on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever is elected to that team will be invited to the World  
Series,'' Selig said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans vote for 25 players, and the 30-man All-Century team,  
including five additions selected by a media panel, will be 
announced before the World Series opener Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine outfielders will make the team, and Rose was ninth in the  
latest vote totals, which were released last week. Stan Musial and 
Roberto Clemente were close behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Updated totals were to be announced today.  
</P>
<P>
	Selig said he hadn't reversed his position on allowing Rose's  
participation and said the decision to invite Rose if he's elected 
doesn't affect his status as a banned player. At the All-Star game, 
98 of the 100 players on the ballot were honored with banners 
hanging at Fenway Park -- Rose and Shoeless Joe Jackson, banned as a 
result of the Chicago Black Sox scandal in 1919 -- were exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a result of an election, and I felt that in terms of  
what baseball does, those people who are elected ought to be asked 
to come,'' Selig said. ``But does it change his status or anything 
else? The answer is no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said last week that he had heard rumors he might be invited  
if he's elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's good news for me to hear, that he's OK with me being  
part of the All-Century team,'' Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then manager of the Cincinnati Reds, Rose signed an agreement  
accepting a lifetime ban on Aug. 23, 1989. While the agreement made 
no official finding, commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti said at a 
news conference the following day that he concluded Rose had bet on 
Reds games. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement, Rose may not work with major league  
teams or their minor league affiliates. He also may not be in any 
part of any ballpark or training complex that is not open to fans 
with tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, 58, applied for reinstatement in September 1997. While  
Selig hasn't ruled, he also has said he sees no reason to change 
the lifetime ban, one of just 15 ever issued by the commissioner of 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is ineligible for the Hall of Fame as long as he's banned  
for life. No person ever permanently banned has ever been 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that in our society, 99 out of 100 guys are given  
another opportunity,'' Rose said. ``I'm the one out of 100 that's 
not being given another opportunity, which is mind-boggling to 
me.''

<HEADLINE> How To Remember Computer Passwords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: I keep forgetting my computer passwords. What should I do,  
and how do I keep this from happening again and again? 

</P>
<P>
	A: The Internet has brought with it a proliferation of passwords  
to safeguard computers, online access and Web-site subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The codes are intended in part to keep an individual's  
confidential information from falling into the hands of pranksters 
and scam artists. This is especially crucial to protect accounts 
for online banking, stock trading and other financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rampant growth in passwords is frustrating many users,  
who must go to ever-greater lengths to remember the codes, and who 
are unsure what to do when they forget them. 
</P>
<P>
	A common solution is to attach paper notes to your computer  
monitor. But some security experts say that's like keeping the keys 
in your car. If you can't commit the code to memory, hide it in a 
secure place, such as a locked draw or safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, don't pick a code that an unscrupulous person can  
easily crack, such as your name or a common word. Instead, pick a 
combination of numbers and characters, and alternate lower and 
upper case letters. 
</P>
<P>
	To make codes easy to remember, choose numbers and letters that  
suggest a favorite phrase. For example, 2D4Uxy could stand for, 
``Today, for you,'' with ``xy'' thrown in at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, remembering a password is easier said than done. Many  
Web surfers are forced to juggle a dozen codes or more for 
everything from an America Online subscription to an Expedia travel 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	Aharon Friedman, chairman of Fortress Technologies Inc., a  
Tampa, Fla.-based computer security firm, said his personal 
strategy is to choose just two passwords for all his 10 Web 
accounts. One is an easier-to-remember password for his less 
important accounts, such as a travel Web site. The other, a more 
obscure, complicated code, protects his most valuable accounts, 
such as an online banking site that carries far more risk if it's 
hacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Just to make sure, Friedman says he changes his passwords every  
three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatiana Gau, head of integrity assurance for America Online  
Inc., the nation's largest Internet service provider, takes a 
different approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under no circumstance should you use the same password  
elsewhere,'' said Gau, who is responsible for enforcing privacy 
policies and making sure users aren't engaging in misdeeds. She 
contends the risk is too great that a hacker could figure out one 
password and then get access to all of a user's accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gau says she has more than 100 passwords that she totes around  
in her day planner. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, with all the passwords around nowadays, it seems  
nearly inevitable you'll lose one along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	At AOL, forgetful subscribers are urged to immediately call the  
company's customer service unit to choose a new one. To be extra 
safe, Gau said, the subscriber should sign back into the service 
and change the password again, so that even the customer service 
representative can't abuse it.

	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton settled into quiet  
vacation mode Tuesday, staying close to his holiday cottage while 
Hillary Rodham Clinton nursed a summer cold.

	After five straight nights of fund-raisers and social  
engagements, Clinton spent the day at his Oyster Pond vacation home 
with Mrs. Clinton and daughter Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady was still feeling ill from ``a nagging cold,''  
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. The family wanted to 
unwind before heading to New York state this weekend, where a full 
schedule awaited them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing serious,'' Lockhart said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons leave Martha's Vineyard on Saturday and travel to  
the Hamptons, where they will attend three fund-raising events, 
Lockhart said. On Sunday, Mrs. Clinton is attending a Women's 
Leadership Forum fund-raiser, then she and the president attend 
another event for the Democratic National Committee, Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Saturday event and the women's reception raise money for the  
DNC, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Mrs. 
Clinton's New York Senate exploratory committee, Lockhart said. The 
host for the first reception is Liz Robbins, a friend of the 
Clintons from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	While the first lady is at the women's event Sunday, the  
president plans to check out the surroundings, Lockhart said. It is 
the first time they have vacationed there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect he'll have some time to relax there and enjoy the  
wonderful, natural surroundings,'' Lockhart said. ``The ocean, the 
beach and potentially some fine golf courses.''

<HEADLINE> MasterCard Denies Pressuring Selig </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The sponsor of baseball's All-Century team said  
Tuesday it didn't pressure commissioner Bud Selig to allow Pete 
Rose to participate if he's elected. 
</P>
<P>
	After snubbing Rose at the All-Star game, Selig said Monday the  
career hits leader would be invited to the World Series if he's 
elected to the All-Century team, even though Rose is banned from 
baseball for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a baseball policy issue,'' said Jeff Price, the vice  
president of U.S. sponsorships and events for MasterCard 
International. ``MasterCard didn't get involved with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said last month that Rose wasn't invited to on-field  
ceremonies at the All-Star game honoring the living players on the 
100-man ballot. He denied that he was pushed to reverse himself on 
inviting Rose to the Series if he's elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Price wouldn't say whether MasterCard planned to use Rose for  
its commercials. Its current ads include Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, 
George Brett and Barry Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on the 10th anniversary of the announcement of Rose's  
lifetime ban, former commissioner Fay Vincent said he didn't mind 
Selig's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that what is important is that Bud has been very  
strong on not readmitting Pete to baseball,'' said Vincent, who 
oversaw the Rose investigation as the top deputy to commissioner A. 
Bartlett Giamatti. ``That's the critical judgment. The rest is on 
the fringe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997. While Selig  
hasn't ruled on the application, he's made clear that he sees no 
reason to change the lifetime ban Rose agreed to following an 
investigation of his gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	While the agreement with Rose didn't contain a formal finding,  
Giamatti said in announcing the ban on Aug. 24, 1989, that he 
concluded Rose had bet on the Cincinnati Reds, the team he was 
managing. 
</P>
<P>
	As long as Rose remains banned for life, he is ineligible for  
the Hall of Fame, 
</P>
<P>
	``Bud sees no reason to change what Bart and I did,'' said  
Vincent, who became commissioner following Giamatti's death eight 
days later. ``I think Bud's position is what it ought to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose's possible inclusion on the All-Century team is a sensitive  
issue for baseball. As a banned player, he isn't allowed on major 
league fields or in clubhouses, but baseball plans to honor the 
All-Century team on the field before a World Series game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine outfielders will be selected among the 25 players chosen by  
fans, and Rose remained ninth in vote totals released Tuesday, 
increasing his lead for the final spot from 12,000 to nearly 
17,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron leads outfielders with 396,921, followed by Babe Ruth  
(395,304), Ted Williams (384,995), Mays (382,781), Joe DiMaggio 
(361,036), Mickey Mantle (340,341), Ty Cobb (266,781), Ken Griffey 
Jr. (222,785) and Rose (212,908). 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Clemente (196,055) moved into 10th, passing Stan Musial  
(193,775). 
</P>
<P>
	There was no change among the leaders at any position. Fans vote  
for two players at each infield position, two catchers and six 
pitchers. A panel picked by baseball will be able to add up to five 
players who are overlooked by the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan Ryan leads pitchers at 341,823, followed by Sandy Koufax  
(333,251), Cy Young (298,019), Bob Gibson (195,214), Roger Clemens 
(165,882), Walter Johnson (160,585), Greg Maddux (146,736), Steve 
Carlton (136,189), Satchel Paige (135,009), Warren Spahn (114,862) 
and Tom Seaver (112,954). 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Bench (343,440) leads catchers, followed by Yogi Berra  
(244,478) and Carlton Fisk (109,271), and Lou Gehrig (413,859) tops 
first basemen, followed by Mark McGwire (178,284) and Jimmie Foxx 
(118,458). 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Robinson (272,215) is ahead at second, trailed by Rogers  
Hornsby (215,007) and Joe Morgan (205,455), and Cal Ripken 
(232,988) leads at shortstop, followed by Ozzie Smith (202,838) and 
Ernie Banks (202,249) in the closest voting at any position. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Schmidt (289,477) tops third basemen, followed by Brooks  
Robinson (259,905) and George Brett (228,724). 
</P>
<P>
	Voting runs through Sept. 19.

<HEADLINE> Ohio School Vouchers in Limbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A federal judge has struck down one of the  
nation's oldest school voucher programs, one that allowed Cleveland 
students to attend private or parochial schools at taxpayer 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	With many city schools opening today, district officials braced  
for the possibility of having to absorb thousands of children cut 
off from private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're recommending that students call their voucher program  
schools to find out how their institution wants to handle things 
now,'' said William Wendling, spokesman for the 77,000-student 
Cleveland public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters plan to appeal Tuesday's ruling by U.S. District  
Judge Solomon Oliver Jr., whose injunction halted the voucher 
program until a trial determines whether it violates the 
constitutional separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-funded program covers up to $2,500 in tuition costs  
per child for poor families so they can attend private schools. It 
is being conducted on an experimental basis in Cleveland, the 
state's second-largest city. This year, 4,003 students from 
kindergarten through fifth grade have signed up. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the judge said the program appeared to have the  
``primary effect of advancing religion,'' because most of the 56 
participating schools are religious institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Carol Anne Smith, superintendent of schools in the  
Cleveland Catholic Diocese, urged parents to keep their children in 
voucher schools pending the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnnietta McGrady, whose two children enrolled at St. Thomas  
Aquinas School with the help of vouchers, said she was 
``terrified'' by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really can't afford the private school now,'' she said.  
``The kids will have to go to public school this year. There's no 
other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver said that allowing the program to go forward could  
``cause an even greater harm to the children by setting them up for 
greater disruption at a later time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bob Taft, who supports the program, said the ruling  
``disrupts at the 11th hour the plans of those who utilize 
Cleveland's school choice program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What possible harm would result from allowing these children  
to attend school where they have been enrolled pending the 
resolution of this court case?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Voucher supporters also said Oliver's ruling will ruin the  
program because data should be collected for four straight years to 
evaluate whether student performance improves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio program was among the first in the nation when it began  
in 1995. Milwaukee has had vouchers since 1990, and this year 
Florida began a statewide voucher program. 
</P>
<P>
	A challenge to the Ohio law was filed in state court shortly  
after the Legislature enacted the program, in response to concerns 
about the quality of education at Cleveland's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In that lawsuit, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that the program  
doesn't violate the separation of church and state, but it still 
struck the program down as unconstitutional because of procedural 
errors by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers revived the program last month in a measure signed by  
the Republican governor, only to have the issue wind up in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important day for all children in Cleveland because  
public funds will be used only for public schools,'' said Judith 
Schaeffer, deputy legal director of People for the American Way, a 
Washington, D.C.-based civil liberties union that filed the lawsuit 
along with several other national and local organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups that sued in Cleveland also are challenging the  
Florida program.

<HEADLINE> Romania To Drug Test Soccer Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Romania on Tuesday introduced  
mandatory drug testing for professional soccer players following 
the death last month of a promising young striker who collapsed and 
died a few minutes into his first premier league game. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy on 23-year-old Stefan Vrabioru, who played for Astra  
Ploiesti, showed the presence of anabolic steroids in the blood, 
although doctors attributed his death to a previously undiagnosed 
heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	In an announcement Tuesday, the Romanian Professional Soccer  
League said the tests would be carried out on a random basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vrabioru case was one of several in Romania recently  
involving allegations of drug use by athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Romanian judo sportsman Alexandru Lungu was banned  
for two years from national and international competitions after 
testing positive for anabolic steroids in July at the World 
University Games in Palma de Mallorca. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanian long distance runner Cristina Costea was banned from  
competition for life for testing positive for anabolic steroids 
following a marathon in Berlin on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past 10 years, 14 Romanian long distance runners have  
been banned from competition for two years or more for drug use.

	Interest Rates Rise a Quarter Point  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve today raised interest  
rates by a quarter point, marking the second time this summer that 
the Fed has raised this rate. The Fed said it was increasing its 
target for the federal funds rates -- the interest banks charge each 
other on overnight loans -- to 5.25 percent from 5 percent. It 
boosted the funds rate from 4.75 percent to 5 percent on June 30, 
the first increase in two years. Today's increase was an effort to 
cool the economy by making it more expensive for Americans to 
borrow.

	Venezuela Court President Resigns  
</P>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The president of Venezuela's Supreme  
Court resigned today, saying the court had committed ``suicide'' by 
caving in to a constitutional assembly controlled by supporters of 
President Hugo Chavez. The court's leader, Cecilia Sosa, said she 
was giving up her post to protest a Supreme Court decision late 
yesterday saying the assembly acted lawfully when it gave itself 
extensive new powers to fire judges and overhaul the courts. She 
said that decision contradicted an earlier court ruling that the 
assembly's mission should be limited to writing a new constitution 
for Venezuela.

	Experts Address Turkey's Health Fears  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Experts are saying some public health  
fears in Turkey are being fueled by misconceptions, primarily the 
myth that the presence of decomposing bodies alone could set off an 
epidemic. The real health threat stemming from disasters like 
Turkey's earthquake, said Dr. Michel Thieren of the World Health 
Organization, is poor sanitation, contaminated water and the 
interruption of routine medical care, not the presence of large 
numbers of unburied corpses. Last week's earthquake left some 
18,000 dead and 200,000 homeless.

	U.S. Teen Pleading Guilty to Murder  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Samuel Sheinbein, who was the subject of a  
17-month extradition battle between U.S. and Israeli authorities, 
has agreed to plead guilty to murder, a county prosecutor said 
today. Sheinbein, 19, will be sentenced to 24 years in an Israeli 
prison when he enters the plea in a Tel Aviv court Sept. 2, 
Montgomery County, Md. State's Attorney Douglas Gansler told The 
Associated Press. A spokesman for Israel's Justice Ministry 
confirmed the agreement. Last month, Sheinbein pleaded innocent to 
killing Alfred Tello, 19, whose burned and dismembered body was 
found in Aspen Hill, Md., on Sept. 18, 1997.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian negotiators suspended meetings  
today on a prisoner release with Israel, citing no progress on the 
sensitive issue ahead of a Palestinian briefing of the Clinton 
administration. Hisham Abdel Razek, the Palestinian Minister for 
Prisoners, told The Associated Press that after a meeting that 
lasted into the early hours today, there was still no agreement on 
the numbers of Palestinian prisoners or the criteria for their 
release from Israeli jails. The failure of the talks is likely to 
put a damper on a Thursday meeting in Washington between U.S. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and top Palestinian 
negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mahmoud Abbas.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though gas prices are rising, Labor Day travel  
may reach the second highest figures ever, the AAA said today. An 
estimated 34.8 million Americans are expected to travel 100 miles 
or more from home over the Labor Day holiday, a 2 percent increase 
from last year. The vast majority of the travelers, 29.2 million, 
will go by car, said the AAA. The all-time high for Labor Day 
travel was reached in 1997 with 34.9 million travelers.

interest rates, sending most stocks higher even as blue-chips fell 
back slightly. The Dow industrial average ended down 16.46 at 
11,283.30. Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange led 
advancers 1,694-1,286. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 32.80 at

Championships today and set a World Championships record with his 
final effort. Washington shot from fourth to first place with a 
heave of 226 feet, 8 inches, overtaking German veteran Juergen 
Schult, who fell to second place and dropping four-time defending 
champion Lars Riedel, another German, to third. The result was a 
stunning blow to Germany, which had counted on the gold from either 
Riedel or Schult, both past Olympic champions.

<HEADLINE> Why Did Fed Raise Interest Rates? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Federal Reserve raised interest rates  
Tuesday by a quarter percentage point for the second time in two 
months in a bid to slow the economy and contain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are some questions and answers about the Fed's action and  
what impact it might have on the economy and consumers: 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What did the Fed do?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The policy-making arm of the nation's central bank, led by  
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, raised the suggested ``federal funds'' 
rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans from 5 
percent to 5.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed officials also raised the ``discount rate'' it charges on  
direct loans to banks from 4.5 percent to 4.75 percent, the first 
increase in that rate since Feb. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The boost in rates, which was widely expected, followed a  
quarter percentage point increase in the fed funds rate on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How much and how soon will higher interest rates affect  
consumers? 
</P>
<P>
	A: The impact of a Fed rate hike is usually immediate, but not  
that drastic since they come in small quarter-point increments. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, paying more to borrow from the Fed and other banks, will  
quickly make up for their increased expenses by charging businesses 
and consumers more to borrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The interest charged on many types of consumer borrowing --  
including variable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit card debt 
-- are tied to the prime rate or directly to the federal funds rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime rate was raised to 8.25 percent from 8 percent,  
effective Wednesday, by several large banks. The prime is the base 
upon which banks compute loans to business customers. The best 
customers may pay less than the prime rate. Riskier ventures will 
pay a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Savers may benefit from higher rates because banks and other  
financial institutions will pay more interest on deposits in 
various types of accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Weren't interest rates already rising?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Yes. Mortgage rates climbed above 8 percent earlier this  
summer, a two-year high, in part because of expectations that the 
Fed would tighten credit further. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, however, higher mortgage rates haven't dampened home  
sales or housing construction that much. In fact, many consumers 
may be househunting now out of concerns that mortgage rates will 
push even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Home sales are a key economic force, driving demand for building  
supplies, appliances and home furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Why the sudden push to raise interest rates?  
</P>
<P>
	The two rate hikes, the first in more than two years, are  
designed to ripple through the economy, slowing the pace of 
borrowing and spending among banks, businesses and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	While everyone likes a strong economy, there is a potential  
downside: 
</P>
<P>
	If consumer confidence is too high, it may become hard for  
factories and service providers to keep up with demand. And if jobs 
are plentiful, workers bargain for better wages. Companies faced by 
product shortages or lost sales may boost prices so they can hire 
more workers and pay higher wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Is that's what's happening now?  
</P>
<P>
	A: So far, inflation has remained surprisingly tame, with  
consumer prices rising just 0.3 percent in July and at a 2.4 
percent rate for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But inflationary pressures persist with unemployment near a  
three-decade low and the economy growing at a brisk 4 percent pace 
for the year. Hoping to keep those pressures from boiling over, the 
Fed boosted rates in June and again on Tuesday as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How will higher rates slow the economy?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Increased borrowing costs may discourage some businesses from  
investing in expansion, buying new equipment or hiring workers. 
Consumers, worried about higher lending rates and a weaker job 
market, may slow their spending on clothes and travel or postpone 
major purchases like cars, homes and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What if higher interest rates smother the economy, causing a  
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	A: Fed policy is a work in progress. Last fall, the central bank  
cut rates three times to reinvigorate the economy, bolstering 
confidence among lenders and borrowers fearful of a global 
financial crisis. If the economy slows too much, the Fed could 
switch course and start cutting rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What's next?  
</P>
<P>
	A: In announcing Tuesday's action, the Fed maintained a neutral  
stance on future interest rate decisions, expressing confidence in 
the economic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the Fed said that its actions on Tuesday and  
June 30 should ``markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation 
going forward.''

<HEADLINE> 8 Insurers Sued Over Repair Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- The insurance industry's preference for  
cheaper auto-body parts is under attack in courts from Arizona to 
Florida. State Farm is already at trial defending its practice, 
while at least seven other insurers face lawsuits filed this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the lawsuits -- there are 14 in all -- were filed shortly  
after the publication of a February Consumer Reports article 
criticizing the parts. One, in Maryland, was filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits accuse Allstate, Geico, Nationwide, USAA,  
Progressive, Metropolitan and Farmers Group of Insurance Companies 
of breach of contract and fraud. So far, the State Farm lawsuit -- a 
class action filed in Williamson County Circuit Court in Marion 
representing 5.5 million current and former policyholders -- is the 
only case to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Auto insurance customers contend the use of parts modeled on  
factory originals but made without the benefit of factory 
specifications failed to restore their cars to pre-loss conditions, 
as required in most policies. 
</P>
<P>
	But some say the lawsuits, if successful, will hurt consumers by  
reducing the use of such aftermarket parts, causing prices and 
premiums to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``All other things being equal, and that's a big if, it's a good  
thing for consumers to have generic products on the market,'' said 
Brian Wolfman of the consumer group Public Citizen. ``The presence 
of generic products brings down the cost of other products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Farm trial continued in its second week Tuesday with  
testimony from a body shop owner who said aftermarket parts never 
match the quality produced by factories run for Ford, Toyota and 
other automakers.

<P>
	``If it's not the same in thickness, if it's not the same in  
weld, then it's not safe, either,'' John Kirby of Mobile, Ala. said 
in videotaped testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, witnesses have testified that State Farm documents  
also call into question the parts' quality. In one, State Farm 
lawyers suggested eliminating the use of aftermarket sheet metal 
parts due to the increasing cost of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Although State Farm has settled lawsuits over use of the parts  
in Cook County, Ill., and California, State Farm has denied 
allegations that it uses unsafe or inferior parts, saying its 
practice of using ``quality replacement parts'' saves customers' 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Berman, a Seattle attorney handling lawsuits against  
Allstate, Nationwide, Geico and USAA in Arizona, Illinois, Ohio and 
Washington state, said those cases are almost identical to the 
State Farm claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona lawsuit accuses Allstate and Geico of violating that  
state's insurance code, federal racketeering laws and consumer 
fraud laws by forcing shops to use aftermarket parts and failing to 
disclose their use to consumers. The lawsuit, filed in January, is 
awaiting class-action certification. 
</P>
<P>
	But Charles Davies, general counsel for Geico in Chevy Chase,  
Md., said his company doesn't hide its use of the parts because 
executives think they are a good deal for customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reliable evidence we've seen to say these parts on  
the whole are bad,'' Davies said. ``If we didn't have competitive 
parts which are lower in price than the manufacturer's parts, we 
would have a situation where insurance is unaffordable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide declined to comment. Metropolitan's telephone went  
unanswered after normal business hours late Tuesday. The other 
companies did not return calls seeking comment earlier Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Leaf Asks for Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- For a guy who insists he's a non-story, Ryan  
Leaf keeps making news. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest chapter in Leaf's saga came Tuesday, when San Diego  
Chargers coach Mike Riley confirmed a published report that the 
troubled second-year quarterback will ask for a trade if the team 
puts him on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf underwent surgery July 26 to repair a tear in his right  
shoulder. At the time, club officials said he'd be out for 3-4 
months, and questioned whether they'd be able to hold a roster spot 
for him. Although he'd at best be the third-stringer, Leaf keeps 
saying he feels he'll be ready to play in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said Leaf made his comments before Saturday night's  
exhibition loss to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just frustrated and mad,'' Riley said. ``It was just  
like that: `I'm going to be ready to play. If I can't play, I want 
to be traded.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I didn't feel threatened, because a trade is not going  
to happen anyway,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Leaf obviously knows how to cash his paychecks from the  
Chargers, he's clearly not up to speed on the salary cap rules. 
</P>
<P>
	What would the Chargers tell Leaf if he requested a trade?  
</P>
<P>
	``Don't waste the time,'' club president Dean Spanos said.  
``It's not even a question. They know it's not in the cards. It's 
not going to happen. We'd take a $7 million hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually that would be a $7.5 million hit, the amount of Leaf's  
prorated signing bonus that would count against this year's cap, 
which is approximately $57.3 million. That would mean cutting 
players and redoing the contracts of others, something the Chargers 
can't afford even as troublesome as Leaf has been to them. 
</P>
<P>
	What the Chargers would like Leaf to do is concentrate on his  
rehabilitation and just keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows the situation,'' Spanos said. ``You can talk all you  
want, but the facts are, you're here, you're going to be here, we 
want you here. Try to make the best of it and do the best you can. 
There's no easy way out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to comment on a story in Tuesday's San Diego  
Union-Tribune, Leaf said: ``I'm just tired of this `He said, she 
said' stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to work real hard and whatever happens happens.  
I shouldn't be a story, because I'm not even playing. It shouldn't 
even be an issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it is, because of Leaf's many missteps his rookie season  
after signing the richest contract in Chargers history. Also, he 
said last week he doesn't think he'll be with the Chargers when his 
contract becomes voidable after the 2000 season. However, just 
because he met the criteria to have the contract voided, he won't 
be totally free to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf was quoted by the Union-Tribune as saying, ``I never said  
if I get put on IR I'm going to demand a trade. (But) if I get put 
on IR when I know -- they know -- there's a possibility that I can be 
back in mid-October, then that means there's something wrong. If 
that's the case I don't want to sit here for a year when I know I 
can play in October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he's put on IR, he's out for the season.  
</P>
<P>
	Leaf couldn't have ingratiated himself with his teammates when  
he told the newspaper he would like to be traded ``if they didn't 
believe in me enough to know that when I get healthy I could 
contribute, when we have older quarterbacks who have been hurt 
before and may get hurt at the end of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of those quarterbacks, 34-year-old Erik Kramer, had shoulder  
surgery similar to Leaf's in December. 
</P>
<P>
	When told of Leaf's comments, Kramer said: ``He's the one who's  
hurt. Explain that to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's starter is 35-year-old Jim Harbaugh.  
</P>
<P>
	Riley feels it's his job to help develop Leaf.  
</P>
<P>
	To that end, the coach said he told the quarterback: ``Quietly,  
go back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the NFL said Leaf was fined $10,000 for not  
wearing team-issued apparel on the sideline Saturday night. 
Instead, he wore a shirt from the shoe company he endorses.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Teen Pleading Guilty to Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A Maryland teen-ager accused of killing  
and dismembering an acquaintance will plead guilty to murder in a 
Tel Aviv courtroom next week in a case that caused an international 
dispute over jurisdiction and outraged American prosecutors and 
members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel Sheinbein, 19, fled to Israel two years ago to escape  
Maryland murder charges in the death of Alfredo Tello Jr., also 19. 
The killing also roiled Maryland Latinos, who accused prosecutors 
of negligence in allowing Sheinbein to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of a plea agreement announced Tuesday by Maryland  
State's Attorney Douglas Gansler, Israeli prosecutors and lawyers 
for Sheinbein will recommend a 24-year sentence for the teen, who 
would be eligible for parole after serving about 16 years -- or 
two-thirds of his sentence. He could leave prison on weekend 
furloughs in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month Sheinbein pleaded innocent in an Israeli court.  
</P>
<P>
	Ido Baum, spokesman for Israel's Justice Ministry, confirmed the  
agreement but said he had requested the Americans to withhold 
disclosure until Sept. 2, when Sheinbein is scheduled to enter his 
plea in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Eitan Maoz, an attorney for Sheinbein, refused to comment other  
than to say that any developments in the case would be heard at the 
court appearance next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein, who claims Israeli citizenship through his  
Israeli-born father, will serve his sentence in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Tello's burned and dismembered body was found in an empty garage  
near Sheinbein's home in Aspen Hill, Md., on Sept. 18, 1997. 
Sheinbein fled to Israel several days later. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing, and afterward Sheinbein's flight to Israel, raised  
a furor among Maryland's Hispanic organizations and Latino 
community, which staged protests and rallies to demand Sheinbein's 
extradition. In Congress, several lawmakers threatened to cut 
Israel's annual aid unless the teen-ager was returned to face trial 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Tello's parents refused to attend Gansler's news conference but  
had him release a statement that said: ``The Tello family feels 
that justice has not been achieved in this case, that Mr. Sheinbein 
and his family have continually manipulated the judicial systems of 
both Israel and the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein's attorney has challenged Maryland attorneys to prove  
that Sheinbein took an active part in the killing with his friend, 
Aaron Needle. Needle committed suicide in a Maryland prison just 
before his trial was to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was actually what has been called a `thrill kill.'''  
Gansler said. ``They killed Alfredo Tello for the mere pleasure of 
it. They actually planned on killing another friend of Mr. 
Sheinbein and Mr. Needle down the road, and this was basically a 
practice murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler said that authorities collected DNA, fingerprints and  
other evidence, including a handwritten, notarized confession 
signed by Sheinbein and Needle. Officials also have a ``recipe for 
murder'' Sheinbein wrote that listed tools needed to kill, such as 
the saw he allegedly used to dismember Tello, goggles, Lysol 
disinfectant, garbage bags and a tarpaulin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still feel that we would have had a very, very strong case  
against Mr. Sheinbein. Indeed they don't get much stronger,'' 
Gansler said. His appraisal was that Sheinbein would have been 
convicted and sentenced to life in prison if he were tried in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy to have a conviction in the case, particularly  
given the frustration and the history of this case, (but) the 
bottom line remains unacceptable to the State's Attorneys Office,'' 
he said. ``It is our view it is an insult to justice, and Mr. 
Sheinbein will be free to walk the streets of Israel under the most 
likely scenario when he is 33 years of age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler said he and his assistants learned about the plea  
agreement only Monday night, in a fax sent by Israeli authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should have been our case,'' he said. ``Mr. Sheinbein  
should have been returned here, and we would have asked that they 
consult us before entering into this plea agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department was not told about the agreement, either,  
agency spokesman James Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stated we would have preferred to see this trial take place  
in the United States. But since it was the view of the Israeli 
courts that it should take place there, we wanted to see justice 
done,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Sheinbein is freed, he could still be arrested and charged  
with first-degree murder if he tried to enter the United States or 
any country that belongs to the international police organization 
Interpol, Gansler said. ``There's no double jeopardy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein's father, Sol, living in Israel, faces obstruction of  
justice and hindering investigation charges in Montgomery County, 
Md., Gansler said.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Anti-Tobacco Campaigns Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Smoking remains popular in tobacco-producing  
states like Kentucky, but the federal government says tough 
anti-smoking campaigns have been successful in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	California had the second-lowest adult smoking rate, 18.4  
percent, in 1997 after hitting 26 percent in 1984, according to 
figures released Tuesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC attributed the drop to the nation's oldest anti-smoking  
initiative, which began in 1989. The voter-approved measure raised 
tobacco taxes to fund a variety of health and environmental 
programs, including anti-smoking ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a very varied and multiethnic population ... but they  
had the foresight to provide the resources for an aggressive 
tobacco control campaign, and it worked,'' said CDC director Dr. 
Jeffrey Koplan, who presented the new state-by-state smoking 
figures at the National Conference on Tobacco and Health in 
Kissimmee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Koplan said the figures will be used to back up recommendations  
on how states should spend anticipated billions from settlements 
with tobacco companies, who had been sued over tobacco-related 
health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Each state should spend between $31 million and $83 million on  
health and anti-smoking programs, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are saying is that from what we've found in our own  
experience and in the shared experience, here is what works,'' 
Koplan said. ``And we're saying here's the amount that will pay for 
it. It's the same approach we take with immunization against 
disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon's cigarette consumption rate decreased 11.3 percent  
between 1996 and 1998. Voters there approved an anti-smoking 
campaign similar to California's in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	And Massachusetts voters approved higher tobacco taxes and an  
aggressive anti-smoking media campaign in 1993. The state's 
consumption rate dropped 20 percent between 1992 and 1996, the CDC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah, with its large Mormon population, had the lowest smoking  
rate among adults, 13.7 percent, in 1997. The state has had the 
lowest rate in each of the last three reports issued by the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah also had the lowest youth smoking rate in 1997 at 16.4  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In states with few anti-smoking controls, smoking rates actually  
rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky had the highest adult smoking rate in the nation in  
1997 at 30.8 percent, up from 27.8 percent in 1995. Kentucky's 
youth smoking rate also is the highest in the country, with 47 
percent of students in grades 9-12 saying they had smoked in the 
previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Barkley, project manager for the tobacco-control coalition  
Kentucky Action, said the state has provided no funding for tobacco 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	It is illegal to sell tobacco to a minor in Kentucky, but not  
illegal for a minor to use tobacco products. The state imposes a 
3-cent excise tax per pack on cigarettes, the second lowest in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public policy environment here is very poor,'' Ms. Barkley  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of Kentucky farms grow tobacco, making it the  
nation's most tobacco-dependent state, according to the Federal 
Reserve Bank. In 1996, the state produced 27 percent of the 
country's tobacco, second only to North Carolina at 38 percent. 
That state's adult smoking rate was 25.8 percent, down from 26.0 in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny McKinney, head of the Kentucky Burley Tobacco Growers  
Cooperative, said farmers are willing to join the fight against 
youth smoking, but will not stand for state money being used to 
combat adult smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We draw the line when it comes time to spend money to limit  
adult choice,'' McKinney said.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Closes on Penguins' Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The long-awaited sale of the Pittsburgh  
Penguins to Mario Lemieux neared completion Tuesday, with lawyers 
telling a federal bankruptcy judge the closing should come within 
two days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect every document to be finished and signed by  
Thursday,'' said Douglas Campbell, Lemieux's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The $95 million closing has been expected for weeks but was  
delayed by a mountain of paperwork -- U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard 
Markovitz has a six-inch-high stack on his desk -- and the 
complexity of reaching final agreements with all investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gone out of the business of predicting when this will get  
done, but it should be done by Thursday,'' Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, just in time for the Penguins to start preseason camp Sept.  
4 under the ownership of a six-time NHL scoring champion who was 
preparing for his last training camp only three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux did not attend Tuesday's hearing before Markovitz, who  
sifted through the numerous documents to sign off on several 
procedural matters needed to complete the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz agreed to the Penguins' practice rink lease with  
Morris Belzberg, an investor in former owner Howard Baldwin's group 
who has also joined Lemieux's group. Belzberg will own the 
Southpointe rink in Washington County and will lease it to the 
Penguins for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Also approved was a settlement between Belzberg and the team's  
unsecured creditors, who will be paid $1.75 million, according to 
court documents. They sued in May, seeking to recover $9 million 
they said Belzberg took from the team 11 months before it filed for 
bankruptcy protection in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz, who has persistently pushed the parties involved to  
move the case along and keep the Penguins in Pittsburgh, noted that 
he has already signed some of the documents more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like we do everything three times,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the last unresolved issues is the signing of Lemieux's  
Civic Arena lease with SMG, which operates the 38-year-old downtown 
arena. The lease agreement may be the last document signed before 
Lemieux officially takes over the two-time Stanley Cup winners, 
perhaps as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG will continue managing the arena until 2004, when Lemieux  
will gain control. However, the Penguins hope to be playing in a 
new arena by then, perhaps one located between the new Steelers 
stadium and Pirates ballpark on the city's North Side. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as the SMG matter is settled, we will close ... it  
should be done and documented in the next 48 hours,'' Penguins 
lawyer Robert G. Sable said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is investing $25 million, including $20 million in  
equity and $5 million paid him by former co-owner Roger Marino, and 
also has more than $50 million in commitments from investors. That 
money is being held in escrow, along with thousands of dollars in 
preseason ticket sales.

<HEADLINE> Furor Lingers Over NYC Youth March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The leader of a rally that included inflammatory  
speeches and a brawl with police a year ago has accused the city of 
racism for rejecting a request for another march. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Monday he will not issue a  
permit for a second Million Youth March, proposed for next month in 
Harlem. The dispute likely will go to federal court -- as it did 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir's decision was denounced by Khallid Abdul Muhammad, the  
main organizer of the march which the city said attracted 6,000 
people last year. Muhammad said it brought in 300,000 people -- and 
he vowed to march Sept. 4 despite the stand by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make it clear here today that no devil, racist,  
cantankerous, constipated cracker like Mayor Giuliani can stop'' 
the march, Muhammad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani's office had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad made his comments at a news conference outside City  
Hall during which organizers denounced Jews and whites. 
</P>
<P>
	The rhetoric mirrors circumstances preceding last year's march,  
in which the city also refused to grant Muhammad a permit. The 
march took place only after federal courts overruled the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-hour event featured dozens of inflammatory speeches  
denouncing whites, Jews, black elected officials and police. As the 
rally wound down, Muhammad's closing speech ran beyond the allotted 
time and police officers in riot gear moved toward the stage while 
police helicopters flew low over the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad exhorted the crowd to beat or shoot officers if they  
were attacked, and some members of the audience threw barricades, 
chairs and bottles. Twenty-eight people were injured.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Rivalry Heats Up After Taping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Ouachita Baptist and Henderson State  
universities are so close that they can't be called cross-town 
rivals. They are more like cross-the-street rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The schools have endured each other's antics over the years --  
they've played football 73 times -- but it was still a surprise when 
a Henderson student assistant coach was caught videotaping a 
Ouachita football practice from a nearby park last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach fled, but he left some evidence behind in a trash can  
-- a camera labeled ``Henderson State Property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Back in the day people around the town took sides, kids on the  
playground took sides. You were either for us or Henderson,'' said 
Ann Vining, the 1950 homecoming queen who was abducted by a group 
of Henderson cheerleaders and taken to nearby Hot Springs before a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pranks and spying were not really accepted, but it was  
expected. A lot of things that we did then we'd probably get 
arrested for today,'' Vining said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and Ouachita, who open the season on Ouachita's campus  
Sept. 4, are former members of the Arkansas Intercollegiate 
Conference. Their rivalry is made unique by the proximity of their 
schools -- they're less than a half-mile apart across Arkansas 7 in 
Arkadelphia, 60 miles southwest of Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	In some places, only a ravine separates the schools' campuses.  
</P>
<P>
	``I bet these schools are the only ones where players can say  
they literally walk across the street for an away game,'' said Rex 
Nelson, a spokesman for Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Nelson has 
been the play-by-play announcer for Ouachita football for 18 of the 
last 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids would do some awful things to each other and the  
campuses, but it was funny,'' he said. ``Any other week, it would 
have been vandalism, but not during football weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, NAIA rankings had Ouachita and Henderson ranked in the  
top five going into the last game of the year. While students at 
Ouachita were coming out of chapel, a plane flew over the campus 
and dropped marshmallows with an ``H'' painted on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some of our boys got in a car and met them when they  
landed,'' said Vining, whose husband, Bill, was a defensive end and 
captain of the football team. ``I still have my marshmallow around 
here somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson State University is a public, liberal arts school with  
an enrollment of near 4,000. Ouachita Baptist University is a 
private school with an enrollment of 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
	Ouachita is playing its last year in the Lone Star Conference  
before joining Henderson in the Gulf South Conference. The old AIC 
folded this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	In some years, Henderson students would arrive on the Ouachita  
campus armed with light bulbs filled with red paint -- one of 
Henderson's colors -- to decorate OBU. 
</P>
<P>
	It got so bad that Ouachita students put bells on each side of  
the campus and rang them when an unidentified car arrived. One 
time, Ouachita students waited in the bushes with a fire hose and 
sprayed Henderson students who came to paint the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it was a pretty big rivalry, but at the time our team  
didn't think so,'' said Charlie Boyd, a Little Rock attorney and a 
defensive back for Henderson from 1975 to 1979. ``After a while, it 
got heated, but it was always fun. 
</P>

	``They broke our hearts a few times,'' said Boyd, whose team  
lost 21-20 in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there is no NCAA Division II rule against taping or  
scouting an opponent's practice, it is considered an ethical 
breach. Ouachita athletic director David Sharp has accepted 
Henderson's apology for the taping incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Casual observance has been a thing that has always gone on,''  
Sharp told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper of Little Rock. 
``I can even remember I had an old-timer tell me that when the two 
stadiums were closer than they are now ... participants from both 
schools used to get in the tops of their stadiums and observe each 
other's practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson coach Patrick Nix said he did not know about the  
taping before it happened and he would not say what the assistant's 
punishment was. 
</P>
<P>
	He may have to suffer some consequences -- the videotape found in  
the trash can had only six minutes of OBU footage. The rest, now in 
OBU's hands, was of Henderson's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Some alumni said the taping was all done in good fun.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time that things started up again,'' Vining said.  
``It reminds me of the old days.''

<HEADLINE> Burglar Sues Homeowner for Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEVILLE, Mich. (AP) -- A man who broke into a house is suing  
the owner, saying she was responsible for the beating he took when 
he returned to the home the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassidy L. VanHorn, 21, suffered two broken arms, a broken jaw  
and other injuries in the July 1997 attack at the home of Diana 
Folbigg, his attorney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	VanHorn is seeking at least $25,000 in damages.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Ms. Folbigg did not take part in the attack, she owed a  
duty to VanHorn to provide a safe environment at her home when she 
``lured'' him back, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said: `Come on back, forget about what happened ... Let's  
party,''' lawyer David Femminineo said. ``He's kind of slow, not 
the most intelligent guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived and arrested VanHorn along with one of his  
attackers. That man pleaded guilty to assault and battery. 
</P>
<P>
	VanHorn later pleaded guilty to breaking and entering and to an  
assault and battery charge, and spent 85 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Folbigg's lawyer did not return telephone messages left at  
his office.

<HEADLINE>  Albanians Won't End Russia Blockade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians refused today to  
lift their blockade against Russian peacekeepers here, saying 
Moscow's troops are unwelcome in a town ``where so many crimes were 
committed'' by Serb-supporting Russian mercenaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanian community leaders made the statement after a meeting in  
which Russian and NATO officers tried to persuade them to remove 
tractors, trucks and other vehicles from roads into the town. The 
barricades were erected Monday when Russian troops were to have 
begun taking over the town's peacekeeping positions from the Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting broke up with the ethnic Albanians refusing to  
budge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told them the Russians will only destabilize the  
situation,'' protest leader Agim Hasku said. ``The Russians can be 
sent where there were no massacres committed by Russians. Why 
station them here where so many crimes were committed by 
Russians?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one roadblock, about 50 ethnic Albanians, who had spent the  
night behind barbed wire barricades, held banners in Albanian, 
English and German saying ``NATO yes, Russians no,'' ``We don't 
like Russians'' and ``Russians are criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A long line of vehicles and people were still clogging the road  
further down into town. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Serb quarter, meanwhile, several hundred Orahovac Serbs  
rallied in support of the Russians, shouting ``Serbia, Serbia, we 
want Russians, we won't give up the Russians, KLA out.'' Earlier, 
Dutch Capt. Mike Bos had said the Serbs were urging the Dutch to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo's dwindling Serb population trust their fellow Slav  
Russians more than NATO to protect them from ethnic Albanians 
seeking revenge for atrocities committed against them during 
Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown. For their part, the ethnic 
Albanians want NATO, not Russian, troops. They claim Russian 
mercenaries fighting with the Serbs killed at least two Albanian 
men in the town before international peacekeepers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute here underscores the problems facing NATO and the  
United Nations in overcoming deep ethnic hatred between the Serb 
and Albanian communities, which speak different languages and 
follow different religious customs and culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanians and the peacekeepers agreed to meet again  
Wednesday. Dutch Lt. Col. Ton van Loon said peacekeepers had 
decided against using force to remove the barricades and would 
continue trying to convince the ethnic Albanians to back down. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, the Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the Orahovac  
blockade as an ``open challenge'' to the international community 
and Moscow's participation in the Kosovo peacekeeping force. 
Russia's deputy defense minister, Alexander Avdeyev, said it was up 
to the NATO-led peacekeeper command to sort out the problem so the 
Russians could take their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians, who sided with Serbia during the NATO-led airstrikes  
earlier this year, have faced similar protests in other ethnic 
Albanian communities. U.S. and NATO officers say Russian forces 
have behaved professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Dutch and German troops began house-to-house  
searches in the Serb quarter, looking for weapons which may have 
been handed over to local Serbs by Serb paramilitaries before they 
evacuated Kosovo in June. German and Dutch commanders had given 
local Serbs until midnight Sunday to hand in weapons or face 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic tensions in Orahovac are especially high because the town  
was the scene of fighting in July 1998. The Kosovo Liberation Army 
seized positions in Albanian neighborhoods there before being 
driven off in a massive Serb counterattack. Ethnic Albanians claim 
Serb police killed many civilians in the town in retaliation for 
their support of the rebels.

<HEADLINE>  Mazel Trick To Miss Pacific Classic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Mazel Trick, the probable favorite in  
Sunday's $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar, was injured Tuesday 
morning in his final prep and will miss the ninth running of the 
1 1/4-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky-bred chestnut colt was in the midst of a  
five-furlong workout when he was pulled up on the far turn by 
jockey Chris McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
	Transported to trainer Bobby Frankel's barn by horse ambulance,  
Mazel Trick was diagnosed by veterinarians to have suffered 
fractured sesamoids in his right foreleg. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is not believed to be life threatening, but the  
4-year-old son of Phone Trick will undergo surgery, perhaps as soon 
as Wednesday, a Del Mar spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers said Mazel Trick was injured when he seemed to take a  
bad step on the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazel Trick most recently won the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar  
on Aug. 7 by six lengths in 1:40 3-5 for his fourth straight 
victory since Frankel transferred him from grass to dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazel Trick has won six of his 10 lifetime starts and earned  
$435,662. 
</P>
<P>
	The defection of Mazel Trick will probably make Malek the  
favorite in the Classic, won last year by Free House in 2:00 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Other probable starters are General Challenge, Lazy Lode, River  
Keen, Jack Grandi, Smile Again and Barter Town, who is also trained 
by Frankel.

<HEADLINE> Jury Deliberates in Martin Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A jury must decide if Miami Dolphins receiver Tony  
Martin laundered money for a local drug kingpin or was merely 
trying to help a longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury of eight women and four men began deliberations Tuesday  
to decide the fate of the Pro Bowl receiver. Martin is charged with 
four federal counts of laundering drug profits and one of 
conspiracy to hide drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury discussed the case, now in its fourth week, for nearly  
six hours before adjourning. Deliberations were set to resume 
Wednesday at 10 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, is being tried alongside Rickey Brownlee, who served  
seven years in prison for two 1980s drug convictions, in a case 
largely focusing on Brownlee's alleged narcotics activities from 
1994 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing statements concluded Tuesday morning, with Martin's  
lawyer arguing the receiver never made any effort to hide a series 
of cash repayments and never profited from the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government wants you to think `cash' is some kind of  
four-letter word. It's currency. It's money,'' attorney Howard 
Srebnick said. ``There is no evidence that any money Mr. Martin 
received was drug money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is accused of leasing three cars in his name on behalf of  
Brownlee, who paid him back with cash. He also is accused of taking 
$100,000 in cash to reimburse a check written to Brownlee's first 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin could face three to five years in prison if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether Martin, who has known Brownlee since  
childhood and calls him his uncle, knowingly accepted drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	Srebnick told jurors that despite Martin's problems managing his  
own finances, leading to a bankruptcy filing last March, he would 
not risk his career over something so perilous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony may have been financially irresponsible. He may have made  
terrible investment decisions. But he's not a money launderer,'' 
Srebnick said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony is a loyal, trusting friend. He believes in the man that  
believed in him. He gave Rickey Brownlee the benefit of the doubt 
that the government won't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Srebnick recounted Martin's inner-city upbringing in Miami,  
saying Brownlee was somebody who helped the youngster pursue his 
dream of playing professional football. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Brownlee needed a car and had no credit after his  
release from prison in 1993, the lawyer said, Martin was willing to 
help out the man who once helped him. 
</P>
<P>
	``From Day 1, Tony Martin disclosed that Rickey Brownlee might  
be sharing this car,'' Srebnick said. ``Is there anything wrong 
with that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Srebnick also pointed out Brownlee went on to manage two  
restaurants that took in some $1.6 million over 2 1/2 years, according 
to ledgers offered as evidence by the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Those Opa-locka restaurants now are closed, Assistant U.S.  
Attorney Ron DeWaard noted in his rebuttal statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the drug proceeds dried up -- when the drug trafficker was  
gone -- it no longer functioned,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWaard dismissed claims that Brownlee was destitute, referring  
back to a report compiled by IRS agents showing Brownlee amassed 
some $1.3 million in unexplained wealth before he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The list included 15 cars and eight real-estate transactions  
among nearly three dozen big-ticket acquisitions Brownlee made, 
beginning in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``You didn't hear about Rickey Brownlee having credit problems.  
You heard how he was buying everything,'' DeWaard said. ``But the 
nicest car Rickey Brownlee had was always in Tony Martin's name.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Christiansen Placed on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates placed left-handed  
pitcher Jason Christiansen on the 15-day disabled list for the 
third time this season on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Christiansen has a cervical strain and is due to see a  
neurologist within the next few days. The problem first flared up 
while he was sitting on the bullpen bench during Sunday's game 
against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't jumping off the bench or wrestling or doing anything  
stupid,'' he said. ``My neck just tightened up on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christiansen was called into Sunday's game but was unable to  
pitch. In 35 relief appearances this season, he is 2-3 with a 4.46 
ERA and three saves. 
</P>
<P>
	His spot on the roster will be taken by left-hander Jeff  
Wallace. He has pitched in 32 games for the Pirates, going 1-0 with 
a 3.69 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Christiansen was on the disabled list from May 13-28 with a neck  
strain and again from July 31 to Aug. 21 with lower back 
inflammation.

<HEADLINE> Bret Soaks Texas Cotton Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- Cotton growers in south Texas will  
have slim pickings in the aftermath of Hurricane Bret. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's quite a few depressed farmers here now,'' said Bill  
Ordner, a cotton farmer who was among those who fled the storm. He 
returned to his 1,500-acre cotton field southwest of Corpus Christi 
on Tuesday to find crops ruined. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made us sick,'' he said. Ordner estimated his losses at  
$700,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the crop had been harvested, but the remaining cotton  
will likely be rotten. Farmers might as well kiss the wet cotton 
goodbye, said John Norman, a Texas A&AMP;M University agriculture 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll sprout and rot and basically be of no use,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bret rolled ashore Sunday with drenching rains and 125-mph  
winds. The storm caused relatively few problems considering its 
size and strength, missing urban areas and quickly deteriorating 
into a tropical storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Laredo and other cities in the region had braced for flooding,  
but the anticipated deluge never arrived in most areas. Only minor 
flash flooding was reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was good news for some. The drenching rains were just  
what the thirsty south Texas citrus crop needed after months of 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the best thing that could have happened to  
the citrus industry,'' Pat Walsh, owner of Mission Shippers, told 
The Monitor in McAllen. ``The fruit is going to be larger than 
normal. That benefits the grower because you get more weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh estimated 3 inches of rain fell on his groves over the  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Johnson, farm manager for Plantation Produce, said his  
fields of bell peppers, cabbage, parsley and knob onions benefited 
from the weekend's rain, too, though muddy fields will delay 
further planting of cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar cane fields also will benefit from the rain, building up  
the plants before the harvest begins in October. Rainwater is 
better than irrigation water for the plants because it has less 
salt content. 
</P>
<P>
	Most livestock also have weathered the storms.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Joe Paschal, a Corpus Christi livestock specialist with the  
Texas Agricultural Extension, said cattle are unique because they 
will drift with a storm, unlike horses, which tend to wander. 
</P>
<P>
	``If cattle feel a storm coming, they'll walk with the storm to  
seek shelter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The King Ranch reported downed trees but no livestock losses on  
one of the country's largest cattle operations.

	Turkey Quake Survivors Struggling  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Although Turkey has suffered numerous  
earthquakes over the past decade, experts say little has been done 
to address the problems of shady contractors who don't bother with 
permits and skimp on materials, or local officials who don't 
enforce building codes. Thousands of cheaply made 
concrete-and-cinderblock apartment blocks collapsed during last 
week's quake, crushing thousands as they slept. Tens of thousands 
of homeless are now camped out on streets, in parks and on vacant 
lots. Many are waiting to see if and when the government will help 
them. 

</P>

	Bret Soaks Texas Cotton Fields  
</P>
<P>
	CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- Hurricane Bret whipped up plenty of  
trouble for south Texas cotton farmers, ripping cotton tufts from 
their protective locks and dragged the delicate crop through the 
dust. Then came rain that left entire fields submerged and washed 
away any hope for a decent market price. ``It made us sick,'' said 
Bill Ordner, who ventured into his 1,500-acre cotton field 
southwest of Corpus Christi after the storm blew through. He 
estimates the storm cost him $700,000.

	Gas Said Fired in Davidian Siege  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Contradicting years of denial from the U.S.  
government, a former FBI official says agents fired two pyrotechnic 
tear gas grenades into the Branch Davidian compound the day it 
erupted in a deadly inferno. However, Danny Coulson said the 
devices were fired hours before the blaze began April 19, 1993, and 
were not to blame for the fire that consumed the compound with 
David Koresh and more than 80 followers inside. The issue of 
whether the FBI used pyrotechnic devices is a major focus of an 
inquiry by the Texas Rangers and a key allegation in a 
wrongful-death lawsuit filed against the government by surviving 
Davidians and families of those who died.

	Fed Boosts Interest Rates  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs for  
millions of Americans for the second time this summer today, 
boosting two rates it controls by a quarter point in an effort to 
keep the economy from overheating. The central bank said its 
actions ``should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation 
going forward'' -- a statement that some in the financial markets 
hoped would mean the Fed will stop with just the two rate 
increases. But many private economists said they think the economy 
is still growing more rapidly than the Fed considers safe.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- GOP presidential contender George W. Bush claimed  
the endorsements of Georgia's top Republicans today on the eve of a 
three-day Southern swing. But there were fresh comments from one of 
them about drugs. Though he endorsed the Texas governor, House 
Republican Leader Bob Irvin of Atlanta said Bush should put an end 
to questions about illegal drug use. ``I think he ought to tell the 
truth and tell the full truth as soon as possible,'' Irvin said.

	CDC: Anti-Tobacco Campaigns Working  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Anti-smoking campaigns appear to be working in  
states like Oregon and California, while smoking rates rose in 
states with few controls such as tobacco-producing Kentucky, the 
federal government said today. Kentucky had the highest adult 
smoking rate in the nation in 1997 at 30.8 percent, up from 27.8 
percent in 1995, according to figures released by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. ``It's a dose-response relationship 
-- the bigger dose of the drug, in this case, tobacco control, you 
administer, the more response you get,'' said CDC director Dr. 
Jeffrey Koplan.

<HEADLINE> Diabetics Take Chances Driving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Diabetics often decide to drive when their  
blood-sugar levels are so low that they could lose coordination and 
even black out, researchers suggested today in a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is not to mean that they should necessarily have their  
drivers' privileges taken away or restricted,'' said Dr. William 
Clarke of the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center at 
Charlottesville. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Clarke said, diabetics should be aware of the danger of  
relying on their ability to detect low blood sugar without 
measuring it. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 45 percent of the time, the diabetics in the study said  
they would drive when they believed their blood sugar to be below 
70 milligrams per tenth of a liter of blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous research among diabetics using driving simulators has  
shown that blood-sugar levels below 65 lead to loss of control -- 
swerving, spinning and wandering off the road. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants all had type 1 diabetes, which affects about 1  
million Americans. All type 1 diabetics must take insulin, often 
several times a day, to help them metabolize sugar into energy. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published in today's Journal of the American  
Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies have yielded conflicting data about whether  
type 1 diabetics have a higher risk of traffic accidents because of 
fluctuations in blood sugar, Clarke said. He and his colleagues did 
not analyze accident rates among the participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke said diabetics might not realize their blood sugar has  
fallen because how and when people experience symptoms varies. 
Symptoms may include shakiness, trembling, sweating, pounding 
heart, irritability, inability to think clearly, visual disturbance 
and lack of coordination. 
</P>
<P>
	The condition is treated by eating or taking glucose tablets,  
which type 1 diabetics always should carry. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied 65 adult diabetics, who entered data  
into hand-held computers several times a day for several weeks. 
They recorded how they felt, what they estimated their blood sugar 
to be and whether they would drive. Then, each diabetic measured 
his or her blood sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	A second group of 93 diabetics was enrolled two years later and  
similarly studied. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazingly, Clarke said, 38 percent of the first group and 18  
percent of the second said they would drive when they believed 
their blood sugar to be below 40, slightly above the level at which 
people begin to black out. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Bruce Zimmerman, president of the American Diabetes  
Association, said diabetics should be trained to be more aware of 
the danger in driving with low blood sugar. Some diabetics have 
virtually no symptoms but can be taught to pick up subtle signals, 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Krayzelburg Sets Backstroke Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- When American Jeff Rouse broke the  
world 100-meter backstroke record in 1992, Lenny Krayzelburg was a 
17-year-old Russian migrant trying to start a promising swimming 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Krayzelburg broke Rouse's world mark at the Pan  
Pacific championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 23-year-old Californian was overshadowed by Australian  
Ian Thorpe, who broke his third world record in three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe lowered his own mark in the men's 200 freestyle -- set on  
Monday in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world record was my goal coming into the meet, but I was  
surprised it was so fast,'' Krayzelburg said after his 53.60-second 
performance, breaking the previous mark of 53.86 that Rouse set at 
the Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Krayzelburg, who began swimming when he was 5 years old with the  
Red Army club at his home in Odessa, came to the United States with 
his family in 1989 and became an American citizen in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he may return on the winner's podium Friday night when  
he goes after Spanish swimmer Martin Lopez-Zubero's 8-year-old 
1:56.57 record in the 200 backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can do it again,'' Krayzelburg said. ``The 200 has  
always been my favorite, so I'm feeling pretty confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-year-old Thorpe fought off fatigue to get a record for  
the third straight day running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't experienced anything this exciting for a long time,  
and I don't think I'll experience anything like it for a long time 
to come,'' Thorpe said. ``I'd never believed I'd be able to do this 
and now that I've done it was all worthwhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was close with countryman and world champion Michael Klim  
after 100 meters but then moved ahead over the next 50. Thorpe held 
the margin down the stretch and when he touched the scoreboard 
initially showed him at 1 minute, 45.7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The scoreboard fault cast some confusion on the result, but  
after a delay Thorpe was given a time of 1:46.0 -- breaking his mark 
of 1:46.34. Thorpe also broke the 400 record on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic 200 butterfly silver medalist Tom Malchow also had the  
fourth fastest time ever in the semifinals of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Malchow became the third fastest swimmer in the 200 fly. He said  
the record may be threatened, but it's not his primary concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal was to swim 1:55 and I've done that,'' Malchow said.  
``I'm just going to go in and have a good time and hope for a 
victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South African Penny Heyns won the 100 gold in the breaststroke  
but couldn't improve her record from the heats. American Jenny 
Thompson broke the other record in the 100 fly Monday.

<HEADLINE> Chad Scott's Comeback is Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Chad Scott has no pain in his surgically  
repaired knee. He has no fear that his one-year injury layoff 
eroded his skills. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback still doesn't know if his  
recovery is complete. That day will come when he feels it not in 
his left knee, but in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Someday soon, an NFL quarterback will test his side of the field  
-- something that has been done only once in the preseason -- and 
Scott will make an interception. Then he will take off downfield, 
the ball in his arms and his mind free of all doubt he has 
recovered from a torn anterior cruciate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing cornerback is instinctive,'' Scott, the Steelers' 1997  
first-round draft choice, said Tuesday. ``Everybody here has great 
natural ability. That's why they're here. If you have natural 
ability and talent, playing should be like riding a bicycle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that was Scott's problem last season. He spent it riding a  
stationary bicycle, not starring in a secondary that clearly missed 
him, surrendering 3,559 yards passing and 17 touchdowns during a 
7-9 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Cowher tried to compensate for Scott's injury by  
again shifting former Pro Bowl safety Carnell Lake to the corner. 
But Lake lacked over a full season the very instincts for the 
position that Scott mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake has since signed with Jacksonville, but not without taking  
a parting shot at his former team, saying the Steelers are in a 
rebuilding stage and might need four years to contend again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers shrugged off the remarks, especially Scott, who  
expects the secondary to be better than it was a year ago with 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott will team at cornerback with Dewayne Washington, who comes  
off a solid season, with Lee Flowers and either free agent Travis 
Davis or rookie Scott Shields at safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole defense will be better,'' Scott said. ``It's  
about the same defense we played last year, I just think we'll play 
it better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of Scott's rookie season, when the Steelers lost the  
AFC championship game to Denver, Cowher said Scott was playing as 
well as any cornerback in the league. He expects the same level 
this season, even though the former Maryland star missed an entire 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm back into the flow now, reacting, doing the things  
that come naturally,'' Scott said. ``It has been what I expected. I 
haven't seen any difference in my speed or my reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't lost any size; at 6-foot-2 and 200 pounds, he is one  
of the NFL's fastest cornerbacks and one of its best hitters. The 
Steelers must be convinced he's back, because they signed him to a 
$10.5 million, four-year contract in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I kind of just watched everybody else and how they  
reacted and what they did and tried to put myself in the same 
situation,'' Scott said. ``Now I'll be in that same position.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton: Health Insurance Lacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- With his wife nursing a summer cold,  
President Clinton headlined a fund-raiser for financially 
struggling Martha's Vineyard Hospital and said that on a holiday 
island that draws the rich and famous, 20 percent of local children 
lack health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is readying a  
near-certain run for a Senate seat from New York, missed the party 
for more than 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry Hillary is not here, but she is a little under the  
weather,'' Clinton said. ``And I want her to get well because she 
has a rigorous schedule ahead of her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the first lady had  
a minor cold. 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton's help, organizers raised $335,000 for the Martha's  
Vineyard Hospital, a 71-year-old, 22-bed facility that serves 
14,000 residents in wintertime and more than 100,000 vacationers at 
any given time each summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The president used the moment to urge Congress to pass his plan  
to give new rights to patients who receive health care under 
managed health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you show up at the hospital, they don't ask you for your  
party registration,'' Clinton said. ``That's why we're trying so 
hard to pass the Patients' Bill of Rights down in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martha's Vineyard, a tiny island off the Massachusetts coast,  
has long attracted legions of rich and famous vacationers who 
mingle with permanent residents, many of whom struggle to earn 
their living. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of wonderful people who live here and work  
here the year round, and who would never be able, themselves, to 
afford the kind of vacations that all of us take every year and 
take for granted,'' Clinton said. ``And they deserve good health 
care too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, a champion political fund-raiser, suggested the  
organizers pass the hat again next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've raised a lot of money in my life, and I'm not running for  
anything, so I can spend the rest of my life raising money for 
causes like this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent most of Monday on the golf course, his first golf  
outing on Martha's Vineyard in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was clear that for the president both golf and mulligans  
are back in style. 
</P>
<P>
	A mulligan is the repeat shot gracious golfers allow one of  
their number when a first swing doesn't quite meet expectations. 
The president has taken plenty of them in his golfing career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aw, I killed it. I came over. I need help,'' Clinton said  
Monday after slicing his first shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aw, I did it again,'' he exclaimed after slicing his second.  
</P>
<P>
	It was Clinton's first golf excursion on Martha's Vineyard since  
his vacation here in 1997. He went golfless on his last summer 
vacation, an unhappy time in which he tried to make amends with his 
wife and daughter after admitting to the nation that he had not 
told the truth when he denied a sexual relationship with former 
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

<TEXT>
<P>
	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Eccentric filmmaker Lars von Trier  
has demanded that his widely acclaimed movie ``The Idiots'' be 
withdrawn from theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	The offense? Executive producer Peter Aalbaek Jensen's decision  
to use artificial lighting without telling the director -- an 
``unforgivable'' transgression, von Trier said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plead guilty. I have been unfaithful to Lars,'' Aalbaek  
Jensen said. ``Otherwise it would have been impossible to see what 
was happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the movie would not be withdrawn from theaters.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, three Danish directors -- von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg  
and Soeren Kragh-Jacobsen -- wrote the ``Dogma Manifesto'' in which 
they vowed to respect certain minimalist production techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio have won international prizes for their films.  
Vinterberg's ``The Celebration,'' about incest and suicide in a 
family, won the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 
1998. Von Trier's works include ``Europa'' and ``Breaking the 
Waves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Idiots'' is a provocative film about middle-class misfits  
feigning mental retardation to mock modern society. It was made in 
1998 -- ostensibly without props, lighting, or special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, von Trier said he intended to launch ``a  
version (of the film) which is 100 percent controlled by me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie opened across Europe last year. Aalbaek Jensen said he  
told von Trier that new copies would not be altered, including the 
ones to be sent to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Idiots'' is scheduled to open in selected U.S. theaters in  
coming months.

<HEADLINE> Dual Transplant a Unique Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A woman received a new kidney and a bone marrow  
transplant in a landmark operation that may spare her from having 
to take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
	The bone marrow has made it easier for her immune system to  
accept the new kidney, doctors reported today in the journal 
Transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Thomas Spitzer, who as director the Massachusetts General  
Hospital bone marrow transplant program participated in the 
operation, said the approach has promising ramifications for other 
transplant patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is believed to be the first time a patient received a  
kidney and bone marrow transplant in a single operation, according 
to Spitzer and other experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The patient, a woman in her 50s from the Boston area, was  
diagnosed with kidney failure about a year ago. At the time, she 
learned she also had cancer of the bone marrow -- multiple myeloma -- 
that had caused the kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
	She underwent surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital last  
September, receiving a new kidney and bone marrow from her sister 
to treat both the kidney failure and the bone marrow cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Many transplant recipients must take strong drugs for the rest  
of their lives to suppress the immune system so it won't attack the 
new organ, which the patient's body sees as a foreign invader. But 
these drugs leave patients vulnerable to severe infections and can 
cause other serious side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Boston patient, however, the infusion of bone marrow had  
the effect of blending her immune system with her sister's. As a 
result, the new kidney was not entirely foreign to her body, and 
she was better able to accept it, Spitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman took anti-rejection drugs for just 73 days. She now  
has completely normal kidney function, and her bone marrow cancer 
is in remission, Spitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bone marrow transplants are not done solely to prevent organ  
rejection because they are invasive and carry risks, Spitzer said. 
But doctors might be able to achieve the same result by giving 
transplant patients enough stem cells, which are contained in blood 
and bone marrow, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can, by introducing a donor's immune system -- even at a  
very low level -- create this kind of transplant tolerance, then it 
could benefit many patients who need transplants,'' Spitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a very significant achievement that they were  
able to treat renal failure plus an underlying bone marrow 
disease,'' said Dr. Thomas Starzl, a professor of surgery at the 
University of Pittsburgh who pioneered liver transplants in 1967 
and was not involved in this operation. ``This is really an 
exploitation at a very practical level of fundamental principles of 
transplantation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, a patient received a kidney transplant from a sibling  
and then received a bone marrow transplant from the same relative 
nine years later, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing 
of Richmond, Va.

<HEADLINE> Sapp Returns To Practice With Bucs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay tackle Warren Sapp returned to  
practice Tuesday after an MRI on his sore back revealed no 
structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Pro Bowl selection said the test revealed he has a  
narrow spine and that there was some swelling causing the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Sapp, who hadn't practiced for a week, said he woke up Tuesday  
and felt fine. He felt even better after hearing from the team's 
orthopedic specialist, Dr. John Zvijac. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-year pro didn't report any discomfort after the Bucs'  
two-hour afternoon workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a couple of hits on it and felt fine,'' Sapp said.  
</P>
<P>
	Running back Warrick Dunn, sidelined most of camp because of  
tendinitis in his right knee and a sore left hamstring, also 
practiced for the first time in more than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Warren did fine, went through the whole practice and didn't  
have any problems,'' coach Tony Dungy said. ``Warrick, we kind of 
picked our spots with. He went through some individual work and 
some selective work in the drills.''

	If Ryan Leaf is placed on injured reserve, he doesn't want to  
stay in San Diego. Of all the Chargers' options, a trade is not one 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't waste the time,'' club president Dean Spanos said when  
asked what the team would do if Leaf asked to be dealt. ``It's not 
even a question. They know it's not in the cards. It's not going to 
happen. We'd take a $7 million hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chargers coach Mike Riley confirmed a published report that the  
troubled second-year quarterback will ask for a trade if the team 
puts him on injured reserve, which would end his season before it 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just frustrated and mad,'' Riley said. ``It was just  
like that: `I'm going to be ready to play. If I can't play, I want 
to be traded.' I guess I didn't feel threatened, because a trade is 
not going to happen anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf sustained a tear in his right shoulder and underwent  
surgery July 26 to repair it. The Chargers said then that Leaf 
would be out for 3-4 months, and didn't know if there'd be an 
available roster spot for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he'd at best be the third-stringer, Leaf keeps saying  
he feels he'll be ready to play in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf's prorated signing bonus would count $7.5 million against  
this year's cap, which is approximately $57.3 million. A trade of 
Leaf would force the Chargers to cut players and rework other 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Saints    	
</P>
<P>
	It was not a good day for the New Orleans Saints. Rookie running  
back Ricky Williams was lost for at least one game and Joe Johnson 
is gone for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner for whom the Saints traded  
all their 1999 draft picks to Washington to get in their backfield, 
has a slow-healing left-ankle sprain. It will keep him out of 
Saturday's exhibition game against Green Bay, but he is expected to 
be ready for the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred during the first exhibition game against  
Miami on Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a Pro Bowl defensive end, ruptured a tendon in his  
right knee during a line drill, apparently without contact. He 
comes off a seven-sack season. 
</P>
<P>
	William Roaf, a five-time Pro Bowler, sprained his left knee and  
ankle when players landed on his leg in a pileup. He was helped off 
the field, and he will miss the Green Bay exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie defensive end Dimitrius Underwood, who walked out on the  
Minnesota Vikings to pursue his faith, now appears ready to play 
for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood met with Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson and agreed to  
report for practice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to be with the Dolphins,'' Johnson said. ``I am happy  
he decided to play, because you can never have too many talented 
players, and obviously he is a talented player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, the 29th player taken in the first round of the April  
draft, was claimed off waivers by the Dolphins last week after the 
Vikings released him Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Eagles    	
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Hoying, Philadelphia's starting quarterback at the outset  
of last season, was traded to Oakland for a conditional draft pick 
and reunited with Raiders coach Jon Gruden. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoying, 26, thrived under Gruden, then the Philadelphia  
offensive coordinator, late in 1997, but lost his starting job and 
confidence during the Eagles' 3-13 season. The Eagles have Doug 
Pederson starting, with rookie Donovan McNabb, the second overall 
selection in the draft, as the backup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles get a sixth-round pick in 2000 that could upgrade to  
a fifth-rounder based on Hoying's playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoying will battle Wade Wilson for the backup job behind Rich  
Gannon in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Left guard Lance Scott sprained his right knee during practice,  
opening a spot for Luke Petitgout. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the day before, Giants coach Jim Fassel moved Petitgout  
from the backup position behind Scott to the backup right tackle 
because starter Scott Gragg was not performing up to par. 
</P>
<P>
	Petitgout took over as the starting left guard as soon as Scott  
sprained his medial collateral ligament during a 7-on-7 passing 
drill. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel guessed that Scott could be out as little as two weeks,  
but he said an examination today would tell more. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Cowboys    	
</P>
<P>
	Alonzo Spellman, a defensive end since he started playing  
football, is switching to tackle. After 19 months away from the 
NFL, Spellman is more than happy to move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be in there if I wasn't willing to do it,''  
Spellman said following his second practice as a first-team 
defensive tackle. ``If it's going to make the team better, then I'm 
all for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spellman is lining up next to Chad Hennings in Leon Lett's  
former spot. The NFL has yet to announce how many games Lett will 
miss during his third ban for violating the league's substance 
abuse rules, but it's sure to be at least four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Spellman was released last summer by Chicago after a spurt of  
erratic incidents triggered by bipolar disorder, a mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bears    	
</P>
<P>
	Chicago claimed Shane Burton off waivers, a day after he was cut  
by Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, 25, started eight games as a rookie in 1996 and four  
games in 1997, but the 6-foot-6, 305-pound defensive lineman 
slipped to the third team on the depth chart this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins wanted to cut his salary, but the Bears agreed to  
the full $934,000, Burton's agent, Drew Rosenhaus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Burton had 23 tackles and two sacks in 15 games.  
</P>
<P>
	Burton has played both end and inside on the defensive line, and  
Rosenhaus said the Bears are going to take a look at him at both.

<HEADLINE> AMA Endorses Managed Care Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan bill being crafted in the House  
to better protect the rights of patients in managed care plans has 
received a strong endorsement from the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill delivers the essential protections patients and  
voters are demanding,'' AMA President Thomas R. Reardon said in a 
statement Monday. ``Doctors will be allowed to make medical 
decisions. Health plans will be held accountable for their 
actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA's backing, decided at an annual meeting of the  
290,000-member group in Chicago over the weekend, provides a 
powerful weapon to supporters of the bipartisan bill before an 
expected House vote next month on HMO patient rights. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in a statement, said the AMA endorsement  
``sends a strong message to Congress'' on the need to pass 
legislation that ``provides meaningful protections for all 
Americans in all health plans, and holds plans accountable when 
their actions cause harm to patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, sponsored by Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and  
Charles Norwood, R-Ga., would ensure that people in HMO plans have 
access to emergency room care, guarantee access to specialists, 
permit patients to get referrals to doctors outside their networks, 
and allow lawsuits against HMOs that deny care. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwood, a dentist who broke with his party's leaders in  
demanding a stronger patient rights bill, said that with the 
endorsement of the AMA and previous support voiced by the American 
Dental Association, the nation's two largest medical groups are now 
united behind his bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate last month passed a more modest GOP-backed managed  
care bill after rejecting several Democratic provisions, including 
one that would have allowed patients harmed by medical decisions to 
sue their health plans for damages. The White House said it was 
inadequate and would draw a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The House GOP leadership, led by Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,  
tried unsuccessfully to unite its members behind a similar bill. 
Norwood and some 20 other House Republicans instead joined the 
Democrats in sponsoring more comprehensive legislation including 
the expanded right to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance and HMO groups are opposed to the Democratic-led plan,  
saying it would result in a flood of lawsuits and drive up health 
care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with strong public support for HMO legislation and the  
defections within his party, Hastert earlier this month promised a 
vote on a managed care bill when Congress returns from its August 
recess next month. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the main vehicle for that vote would be legislation  
still being written by Reps. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John Shadegg, 
R-Ariz., that moves closer to the Dingell-Norwood bill and for the 
first time put Republicans in favor of expanding the right to sue. 
It also would seek to make it easier for the uninsured to get 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA commended Coburn and Shadegg for their efforts and said  
it would work with them and the GOP leadership as the bill moves 
toward a vote. Dingell-Norwood supporters said they would offer 
their bill as an alternative to the GOP plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA also said it was joining the American Dental Association  
and other medical groups in running ads this week in the hometown 
newspapers of 28 House members with the theme ``what are HMOs so 
afraid of?''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton: Health Insurance Lacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- With his wife nursing a summer cold,  
President Clinton headlined a fund-raiser for financially 
struggling Martha's Vineyard Hospital and said that on a holiday 
island that draws the rich and famous, 20 percent of local children 
lack health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is readying a  
near-certain run for a Senate seat from New York, missed the party 
for more than 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry Hillary is not here, but she is a little under the  
weather,'' Clinton said. ``And I want her to get well because she 
has a rigorous schedule ahead of her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the first lady had  
a minor cold. 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton's help, organizers raised $335,000 for the Martha's  
Vineyard Hospital, a 71-year-old, 22-bed facility that serves 
14,000 residents in wintertime and more than 100,000 vacationers at 
any given time each summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The president used the moment to urge Congress to pass his plan  
to give new rights to patients who receive health care under 
managed health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you show up at the hospital, they don't ask you for your  
party registration,'' Clinton said. ``That's why we're trying so 
hard to pass the Patients' Bill of Rights down in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martha's Vineyard, a tiny island off the Massachusetts coast,  
has long attracted legions of rich and famous vacationers who 
mingle with permanent residents, many of whom struggle to earn 
their living. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of wonderful people who live here and work  
here the year round, and who would never be able, themselves, to 
afford the kind of vacations that all of us take every year and 
take for granted,'' Clinton said. ``And they deserve good health 
care too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, a champion political fund-raiser, suggested the  
organizers pass the hat again next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've raised a lot of money in my life, and I'm not running for  
anything, so I can spend the rest of my life raising money for 
causes like this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent most of Monday on the golf course, his first golf  
outing on Martha's Vineyard in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was clear that for the president both golf and mulligans  
are back in style. 
</P>
<P>
	A mulligan is the repeat shot gracious golfers allow one of  
their number when a first swing doesn't quite meet expectations. 
The president has taken plenty of them in his golfing career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aw, I killed it. I came over. I need help,'' Clinton said  
Monday after slicing his first shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aw, I did it again,'' he exclaimed after slicing his second.  
</P>
<P>
	It was Clinton's first golf excursion on Martha's Vineyard since  
his vacation here in 1997. He went golfless on his last summer 
vacation, an unhappy time in which he tried to make amends with his 
wife and daughter after admitting to the nation that he had not 
told the truth when he denied a sexual relationship with former 
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies' Francis Calls Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Steve Francis, the Vancouver  
Grizzlies' first-round draft pick who is at the center of trade 
rumors, has called a news conference for Friday in his hometown of 
Takoma Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Land, who works for a public relations firm that  
represents the former Maryland guard, said Tuesday the news 
conference was basketball-related but couldn't give any more 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Grizzlies said Tuesday night the team did  
not know what the news conference is about. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver has been shopping Francis, the No. 2 overall pick  
behind Elton Brand in June's NBA draft, to several teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports persist that the Grizzlies and Detroit Pistons are near  
a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Free Press reported Tuesday that Vancouver has  
reservations about a possible seven-player trade because of 
concerns over power forward Loy Vaught's back. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation is the Pistons have offered Vaught and guard Jerry  
Stackhouse to Vancouver for Francis, Lee Mayberry, Michael Smith, 
Doug West and Rodrick Rhodes. Detroit would also return a draft 
pick it received from Vancouver in the trade for Otis Thorpe. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week a Pistons spokesman denied there were any  
trade talks with Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies have also talked to the Miami Heat and Toronto  
Raptors about the 6-foot-3 Francis, who averaged 17 points and 2.8 
steals in his one season at Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies tried to sign Vaught, 31, as a free agent last  
year. He ended up agreeing to a five-year, $22.5 million deal with 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaught played in 37 of 50 games last season, averaging 13  
minutes, 3.4 points and 3.9 rebounds. He played in just 10 games 
the previous season with the Los Angeles Clippers before undergoing 
major back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	On draft night Francis made no attempt to hide his displeasure  
at being picked by Vancouver. He later explained his initial 
reluctance was because he didn't want to move so far away from his 
home and his grandmother who has raised him since the death of his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the only one of the top six draft choices not to sign a  
contract.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Down 16.46 at 11,283.30 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After some initial confusion, investors today  
welcomed the Federal Reserve's long-expected decision to raise 
interest rates, sending most stocks higher even as blue-chips fell 
back slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 16.46 at 11,283.30. The Fed's announcement sparked a volatile 
afternoon on Wall Street, as the index jumped more than 65 points 
from Monday's record high close, then tumbled as much as 105.43 
points before regaining ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators ended higher.  
</P>
<P>
	The Fed surprised few with its quarter percentage point increase  
in the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other on 
overnight loans. Fed policy-makers had already boosted the rate on 
June 30, and chairman Alan Greenspan made it clear that any signs 
of inflation would prompt the Fed to raise rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	But some market players were thrown off guard by the Fed's  
decision to also raise the discount rate -- the interest that it 
charges for direct loans to banks -- also by a quarter point. 
</P>
<P>
	The fed funds increase ``was the second most widely anticipated  
change in monetary policy in years,'' said Peter Canelo, U.S. 
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, noting that 
the June increase was also widely expected. ``It has been taken 
very well by stock and bond markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices, which have improved steadily over the past week,  
rose again. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.93 
percent, from 5.98 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, which are highly sensitive to inflation, drew support  
from the Fed's statement that today's increase ``should markedly 
diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward.'' The central 
bank also held to a neutral bias, indicating that it may leave 
rates untouched in the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
	The market appeared divided over what message the Fed seemed to  
be sending via its discount rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``The performance of the market is suggesting that investors  
believe the Fed may be finished,'' said Dan Laufenberg, chief 
domestic economist at American Express Financial Advisors. 
``Generally, stocks and bonds don't like rate increases until they 
feel the Fed has done enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates can hurt stocks by cutting to corporate profits as  
it becomes more expensive for businesses to borrow money. Financial 
services companies, usually among the first to feel the pinch of 
higher rates, rose following the Fed's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	But Laufenberg suggested that the change in the discount rate  
was meant to drive home the Fed's intent to knock down any signs of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they wanted to give the impression that they may not  
be finished,'' said Laufenberg. ``There isn't much of a current 
inflation risk, but the Fed wants to be forward-looking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the session, technology companies held up well.  
</P>
<P>
	Semiconductor maker Applied Materials and Microsoft rose.  
Microsoft got a boost from a court ruling on a dispute over 
Microsoft's use of the Java programming language, which is 
copyrighted by Sun Microsystems. A federal appeals court ordered a 
judge to reconsider a November injunction that prohibited Microsoft 
from using its own modified version of Sun's products. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
rose 3.28 to 1,363.50. The Nasdaq composite index rose 32.79 to 
2,752.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,714 down, 1,291 up and 563 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 719.00 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
673.77 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.27 to 436.98.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Starts To Save Orangutans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Environmental groups launched a major  
campaign Tuesday to stop illegal logging in national parks that 
provide havens for orangutans, one of Indonesia's most endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based Environmental Investigation Agency and Telapak  
Indonesia launched the campaign after a yearlong probe into illegal 
logging in two of Indonesia's flagship national parks -- Tanjung 
Puting in Kalimantan and Gunung Leuser on Sumatra island. 
</P>
<P>
	``The environmental fallout is causing an incalculable loss in  
terms of priceless biodiversity and pushing the orangutans of 
Indonesia even closer to extinction,'' EIA's director Dave Currey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currey said Tanjung Puting has 2,000 of the primates and Gunung  
Leuser has 2,500, though the numbers could be reduced following 
forest fires two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjung Puting was ravaged by massive forest fires in 1997,  
thanks in part to a long dry spell. But environmental groups claim 
plantations and timber firms were responsible for most of the 
blazes. 
</P>
<P>
	Currey said environmentalists would urge the World Bank,  
International Monetary Fund, European Union and individual 
countries to pressure Indonesia to stop illegal logging. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report, EIA and Telapak said that in Tanjung Puting, 500  
miles northeast of Jakarta, ``illegal logging is carried out in 
full view of the local authorities in an atmosphere of endemic 
corruption among park rangers, police and the military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Gunung Leuser, in the mountainous south of Aceh province,  
1,100 miles northwest of Jakarta, the report said illegal logging 
had degraded swamp areas where orangutans live. 
</P>
<P>
	``The importance of these swamps to orangutan conservation  
cannot be underestimated. If the logging is allowed to continue the 
orangutan population will disappear rapidly,'' said the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia, home to about 10 percent of the world's remaining  
tropical forests, has been under constant criticism for excessive 
logging. But officials argue that timber is a major source of 
revenue and supports millions of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Other endangered species in Indonesian forests include rhino,  
clouded leopard, sun bear, Sumatran tiger and the proboscis monkey.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Trade Hoying to Oakland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles traded quarterback  
Bobby Hoying to the Oakland Raiders on Tuesday, reuniting him with 
his former offensive coordinator, Jon Gruden. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoying, 26, thrived under Gruden late in 1997, but lost his  
starting job and confidence last year during the Eagles' 3-13 
season. The Eagles, who have Doug Pederson starting at quarterback 
with rookie Donovan McNabb as the backup, get a conditional draft 
pick in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to make sure that he was in good hands when he left  
here, and I think that's a very good situation for him,'' Eagles 
coach Andy Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoying, who had left practice when the deal was announced, will  
vie with Wade Wilson for the backup job behind Rich Gannon in 
Oakland. The Eagles get a sixth-round pick in 2000 that could 
upgrade to a fifth-rounder based on Hoying's playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is Hoying's friendship with Gruden that the coach was on  
his way to pick him up at the airport Tuesday. After a quick 
refresher course in Gruden's version of the West Coast offense, 
Hoying is expected to get some playing time in Monday night's 
exhibition game against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at all the teams' quarterback situations, I'd  
probably put the Raiders' situation at the top of the list,'' said 
Hoying's agent, Shawn Trell. ``He has a chance to at least battle 
for a backup spot and, looking to training camp next year, possibly 
a starting job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoying, the Eagles' third-round draft choice from Ohio State in  
1996, had some brilliant performances after taking over for Ty 
Detmer and Rodney Peete in Philadelphia for the last six games of 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 20-for-23 with two touchdowns in his first win as a  
starter against Pittsburgh, then was 26-for-42 for 313 yards and 
four touchdowns in a victory over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles anointed him their quarterback of the future, but  
Gruden left to become coach of the Raiders in 1998. Hoying 
struggled from the start under new coordinator Dana Bible, and 
never recovered his confidence or passing touch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those were a set of circumstances that I don't care what  
quarterback you plugged in there, it was a very difficult situation 
in which to succeed,'' Trell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gruden was not available to discuss the trade. The coach said in  
a statement, ``I believe Bobby will be a good complement to our 
current stable of quarterbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hoying was one of the Eagles' few pleasant surprises in  
training camp this year under Reid, holding his own in the chase 
for the third quarterback spot with Koy Detmer. Hoying was 4-for-9 
for 64 yards and directed Philadelphia's only scoring drive in its 
first preseason game, a 10-7 loss to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby has done a nice job here throughout our minicamps and  
training camp,'' Reid said. ``As a coaching staff and an 
organization, we appreciate everything that he did for us. This 
will be a good situation for him, having him reunited with Jon 
Gruden. He'll be able to step right in and I'm sure work into that 
second position for them.''

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Workers Awarded $30,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Five workers who claimed they were harassed  
by a supervisor because they were from Iraq have won about $30,000 
in a federal discrimination lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The men worked as meat cutters at M.I. Industries in Lincoln  
making pet treats from animal byproducts. They claimed in the 
lawsuit that they had been fired because their boss did not like 
Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Neary, their attorney, said they were told to take dog  
food home for their friends to eat, denied medical attention after 
being injured at work and assigned duties in the most dangerous 
part of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were treated like animals,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Company president Robert Milligan said Monday's verdict does not  
reflect the way M.I. Industries treats its employees. The company 
is considering an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the lawsuit, the supervisor, Bill Tobias, accused  
the men of being unsanitary and told them to leave and to take 
their Iraqi friends with them. One time, Tobias told the men they 
should take some of the cow tendons that were using to make dog 
chews to their Iraqi friends to eat, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the men complained about how they were being treated, they  
were laid off and never hired back. 
</P>
<P>
	They said Tobias created a hostile work environment and  
subjected them to harassment from May to September in 1996. Tobias 
no longer works for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the men was awarded between $4,200 and $9,400. They now  
work at different jobs, Ms. Neary said.

<HEADLINE> Henderson Agrees to Deal With Cavs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday kept forward  
Cedric Henderson on the team, signing him to three-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7, 225-pound Henderson, Cleveland's second-round  
draft pick in 1997, averaged 9.7 points and 4 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavaliers general manager Jim Paxson and Henderson's agent, Tim  
Jumper, disclosed no contract details other than its length and 
that it includes performance incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt Cedric was someone we needed to have on the team to  
build with,'' Paxson said. ``He's a quality NBA player and he's 
only going to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jumper said other teams had expressed interest in Henderson, but  
that Henderson wanted to return to the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said he is looking forward to playing an up-tempo  
style under new coach Randy Wittman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The style I like is to play up and down the floor and to maybe  
get some easy baskets'' Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, a starter at small forward in 119 Cleveland games  
over the past two seasons, will have to battle for playing time 
with Lamond Murray, a former Los Angeles Clippers player who came 
to Cleveland in a trade for guard Derek Anderson and forward Johnny 
Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Kemp and recently signed free agent Mark Bryant are the  
power forwards.

	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Turkish officials broadcast appeals  
today for everything from tents to bulldozers to help begin 
rebuilding shattered lives after last week's earthquake left more 
than 14,000 dead and 200,000 homeless. Yet, more immediate medical 
worries began to emerge. Israeli doctors quarantined a 21-year-old 
Turkish soldier suffering from typhoid fever, an acute infection 
spread by food and water contaminated by someone suffering from the 
disease. Victims suffer from severe dehydration that can lead to

ambassador, Saeed Hasan, repeated Iraqi allegations that samples of 
the VX nerve agent were used to contaminate fragments of Iraqi 
warheads -- not to test equipment. The chemical agents were left

<HEADLINE> Reusable Spacecraft in the Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flight tests will begin next year on a new  
generation of reusable spacecraft that will be less expensive to 
operate than current rocket launchers, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of NASA and its aerospace industry partners said  
Tuesday that three types of experimental craft were poised to begin 
flight testing starting in the summer of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The X-33 craft, being built by the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works  
in Palmdale, Calif., will undergo suborbital flights next summer. 
Another craft, called the X-34 and being built by Orbital Sciences 
Corp. of Dulles, Va., will undergo engine and structural tests in 
2000, leading up to a series of flights. 
</P>
<P>
	A third craft, called the X-37, is in an earlier development  
stage by the Boeing Co., but is scheduled for two test flights from 
the space shuttle starting in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Payton, deputy associate administrator of the National  
Aeronautics and Space Administration, said the goal of the 
technology development program was to ``bring down the cost of 
space access by a factor of 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Putting a pound into orbit using current rockets or the space  
shuttle costs $5,000 to $20,000 a pound, he said, and there is no 
way to improve those costs with the present U.S. launch systems. 
Most current rockets are expendable -- used one time and thrown away 
-- and take weeks to prepare for launch. 
</P>
<P>
	The new generation of space launchers could reduce the cost of  
space access to about $1,000 a pound, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton said the program also would develop spacecraft that could  
be launched more often and by fewer people. It now takes hundreds 
of engineers who spend weeks in preparation to launch a single 
payload. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new generation of spacecraft, he said, ``five flights  
in 21 days will be routine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed's X-33 is designed to be launched as a single stage to  
orbit, in contrast to current systems that use several rockets to 
reach space. It is a 69-foot-long, wedge-shaped craft that is 
launched vertically and then lands like an airplane after a gliding 
descent from orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleon Lacefield said a goal of the X-33 program was to build a  
spacecraft that could be launched every seven days by as few as 50 
people from simple spaceports that could be located virtually 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The X-33 will start a series of 15 test flights next summer. The  
first will be a suborbital flight from Edwards Air Force Base in 
California to the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. The craft is 
expected to reach an altitude of 31 miles and accelerate to 11 
times the speed of sound. 
</P>
<P>
	The X-34 is designed as the ``workhorse'' test vehicle for the  
program, said Bob Lindberg of Orbital Sciences. Orbital is building 
three models of the X-34, with each one being used for different 
phases of testing new technologies and materials that could be used 
in later spacecraft. It will make 27 flight tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindberg said the X-34 is a robot rocket that will be launched  
at high altitude from a converted airliner. Some tests will involve 
unpowered drops to a landing, but later the X-34 will rocket up to 
250,000 feet at eight times the speed of sound before returning to 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The X-37, being built by Boeing, will be carried into orbit by  
the space shuttle, fly to higher orbits and then land like an 
airplane. More than three dozen technologies will be tested in two 
flights by the craft starting in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the cost of the development programs is being paid by  
private industry. For the X-33, NASA has invested $941 million and 
industry has contributed $287 million. Boeing and NASA are 
splitting the $173 million cost of the X-37. Orbital is building 
and testing the X-34 under a $85.7 million NASA contract.

<P>
	The Cincinnati Bengals will finally get to see their No. 1 draft  
pick in action. 
</P>
<P>
	Akili Smith, a rookie quarterback from Oregon, agreed to a  
seven-year contract on Monday, ending an impasse that caused him to 
miss most of training camp and two exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, chosen third overall behind quarterbacks Tim Couch and  
Donovan McNabb, was the last unsigned member of the celebrated 
quarterback class of '99. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-year deal includes a $10.8 million signing bonus and  
will pay Smith, expected to be Jeff Blake's backup, as much as $56 
million if he reaches various performance goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal contains one voidable year, meaning it will  
automatically shorten to six years if he's in for 35 percent of the 
plays in his first year or 45 percent any following year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contracts are so statistical, especially for quarterbacks, and  
have a level of complexity that it simply takes time to work 
through,'' agent Leigh Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement ends the longest impasse between the Bengals and a  
quarterback since David Klingler signed one week before the season 
opener in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been nicer if it had been sooner,'' general  
manager Mike Brown said. ``It's behind us now. We've just got to 
catch up as best we can.'' 
</P>

back, had an MRI examination to determine the extent of his injury.

	The Buccaneers said the result would not be known until today  
after the test is read by the team's orthopedic specialist, Dr. 
John Zvijac, in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Pro Bowler last practiced on Aug. 17. The Bucs also  
held him out of last Saturday night's exhibition against Kansas 
City as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Steve McNair will be on the sidelines Friday night  
when Tennessee plays its first game in its new home stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair has not played or practiced since the Titans' first  
exhibition game Aug. 15 at Kansas City because of spasms and 
stiffness in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup Neil O'Donnell, 21-of-34 for 166 yards in two games, will  
make his second start of the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
                            *Cardinals    	
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Jake Plummer's sprained right thumb will keep him  
out of Arizona's preseason game Saturday at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer was injured on the third play of Friday night's game  
against Tennessee when he was sacked by Mike Jones. Plummer was to 
be examined by a hand specialist to make sure the injury isn't more 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer expects to be ready for the season opener at  
Philadelphia on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Cowboys    	
</P>
<P>
	Running back Chris Warren, who left training camp early last  
week after asking permission to visit a groin specialist he's been 
working with in Colorado, was supposed to back a few days later. A 
schedule change allowed him to be out until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But a morning meeting and afternoon practice passed without  
Warren arriving. He was expected back late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Chan Gailey's face and the tone of his voice when  
discussing the matter made it obvious this wasn't an excused 
absence. He answered four straight questions by saying, ``I'll talk 
to him tonight when he gets here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren's agent, Rick Schaeffer, said the whole thing is a simple  
misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie defensive end Dimitrius Underwood, wavering between his  
faith and an NFL career, planned to meet today with coach Jimmy 
Johnson to discuss his future. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unlikely Underwood will play this season, said his agent,  
Craig Domann. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota made Underwood a first-round draft choice, but he left  
their training camp after one practice, saying he was struggling to 
balance football and his religious beliefs. The Vikings released 
Underwood, and he was claimed off waivers last week by the 
Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Steelers    	
</P>
<P>
	All-Pro center Dermontti Dawson returned from a three-week  
injury layoff and running back Jerome Bettis may not be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis, who said last week he wasn't 100 percent certain if he  
would be ready to start the Sept. 12 opener in Cleveland, discarded 
his left knee brace to take part in running drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson and Bettis injured their left knees only two days apart  
shortly after the Steelers opened camp July 29, and neither 
practiced until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Cowher said Bettis might resume full-scale practicing  
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Panthers    	
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in as many days, Tshimanga Biakabutuka was  
unable to get through a practice because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury kept Biakabutuka from finishing the morning's nearly  
two-hour practice, but he said it was nothing more than a bruise. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest problems involve the same knee Biakabutuka injured  
shortly after the Panthers made the running back their top draft 
choice in 1996. A torn left anterior cruciate ligament four games 
into his rookie year required season-ending surgery. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Halfback Gary Brown, who led New York in rushing with 1,063  
yards last season, practiced for the first time since training camp 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was sidelined with a buttocks injury suffered in a  
motorcycle accident in late June. Coach Jim Fassel hopes to play 
Brown in Saturday night's exhibition against the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	First-round draft pick Luke Petitgout is being moved into the  
starting lineup and right tackle Scott Gragg might be the odd man. 
</P>
<P>
	With Petitgout moving to tackle, Fassel moved Mike Rosenthal,  
the fifth-round draft choice, to guard. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	Kick returner Vaughn Hebron was placed on the reserved-retired  
list by Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebron, a member of Denver's Super Bowl championship teams the  
past two years, was signed by the Colts a week ago. He returned two 
kickoffs for 45 yards in Saturday's 37-7 exhibition victory at New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Lions    	
</P>
<P>
	Center Mike Compton injured his knee in practice on Monday when  
a teammate fell on the back of his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of the injury was not immediately known. Compton, 28,  
a seventh-year player, was taken to Henry Ford Hospital for tests.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Gets Nod From Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some criticize him and one wants to sit him  
down for a ``heart-to-heart talk'' about economics. But few in the 
field of presidential candidates say Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan is the wrong man for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who announced a quarter-point interest rate hike  
Tuesday, ends his current four-year term on June 30, 2000. Wall 
Street expects President Clinton to ask him to stay on for another 
four-year term at that point, taking pressure off his successor to 
make that choice. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked theoretically if they would appoint Greenspan  
themselves, only former vice president Dan Quayle was firm that he 
would not. Patrick Buchanan's campaign officials did not return 
phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Elizabeth Dole approves of Greenspan's performance  
and would reappoint him if she were elected, said her spokesman Ari 
Fleischer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole believes ``Greenspan has been a steady hand, has steadied  
the economy, and represents a stabilizing figure for our workers 
and our markets,'' said Fleischer. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, in an interview last month, would not  
say definitively whether he would reappoint Greenspan, but did 
praise his performance as Fed chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll send you the clearest message that I think is appropriate  
to send,'' Gore said. ``I personally think no one could have 
possibly done a better job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's record, Gore said, is ``one of really outstanding  
A-plus-plus performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's only Democratic challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley,  
said earlier this month that he would approve of Clinton 
reappointing Greenspan for another term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the most important thing that you can have in a  
Fed chairman is somebody who has the confidence of the financial 
markets. Alan Greenspan has that,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, would  
also reappoint Greenspan, said spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Steve Forbes, who has been highly critical of the Federal  
Reserve's interest rate increases, would not rule Greenspan out, 
said spokeswoman Juleanna Glover. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would consider reappointing Mr. Greenspan only after having  
a heart-to-heart talk to ensure that Mr. Greenspan understood that 
prosperity does not cause inflation,'' said Glover. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidate Gary Bauer praised Greenspan overall but said he would  
wait to decide about reappointing him until he could judge his 
performance over the next 12 months. Like Forbes, Bauer has 
strongly criticized the Fed's recent interest rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain approves of Greenspan, but thinks it is  
premature to consider his reappointment now, said spokesman Howard 
Opinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle was the only presidential hopeful who said he would  
definitely not consider reappointing Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' said spokesman Jonathan Baron. He said Quayle disagrees  
with the Fed's policy on raising interest rates. ``To raise the 
interest rates at this time as part of an effort to fight a 
nonexistent inflation makes no sense,'' said Baron.

<HEADLINE> Seattle, San Fran Named Kids' Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If you're looking for a big city that's  
child-friendly, head west. 
</P>
<P>
	That's according to the group Zero Population Growth. It ranks  
three West Coast cities -- Seattle, San Francisco and San Jose, 
California -- at the top of the list of big cities that provide the 
best quality of life for children. 
</P>
<P>
	The study measures seven categories such as education, health,  
and public safety. Seattle, San Francisco and San Jose are the only 
three to win ``A'' ratings among major cities. Meanwhile, 
Washington, D.C. gets a ``D'' rating. St. Louis and Baltimore each 
get an ``F.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group says the study suggests three key elements -- poverty,  
teen pregnancy and urban sprawl -- have the biggest impacts on kids' 
quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
	The complete ranking of 229 cities, including suburban cities  
with more than 100,000 people, are on the group's Web site at

<HEADLINE> Hart Investigator Won't Be Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Defense Department investigator accused of  
asking overly intrusive questions about the personal life of former 
Sen. Gary Hart will not be suspended from his post after all, the 
Pentagon said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``After further review of the circumstances, it was decided that  
no adverse actions will be taken'' against the investigator, David 
Kerno, said Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood. 
</P>
<P>
	That closes the case, Flood said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kerno was reinstated to his investigator's job with the Defense  
Security Service in Denver, one he has held for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart had complained about questions asked during a background  
check required to grant him the top-secret security clearance 
needed to serve on a defense oversight board. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerno, 53, had questioned three of Hart's law firm colleagues  
and apparently asked several questions about Hart's sexual conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart complained to the Pentagon that the questions went beyond  
the bounds of what is necessary for a security check and suggested 
that such inquiries would discourage people from serving in 
voluntary positions on defense boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon removed Kerno from investigatory field work and  
assigned him to a desk. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics suggested that Kerno was punished because of Hart's  
close relationship with Defense Secretary William Cohen. Both are 
former senators and wrote a novel together. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said last month he did not intervene in the case although  
he sympathized with the basic thrust of Hart's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerno learned of his reinstatement in a short letter Friday  
informing him the disciplinary action had been dropped, said his 
lawyer, Daniel Minahan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's 1988 run for the Democratic presidential nomination  
collapsed amid publicity about his relationship with Donna Rice, an 
aspiring actress and part-time model. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders of Kerno said questions about extramarital affairs and  
other personal matters are commonplace in security investigations 
because of the possibility of blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kerno's supervisors suggested he had gone too far and  
recommended a 30-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon decision rejected that recommendation.

<HEADLINE> Thailand OKs Oil Refinery Bailout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The government announced Tuesday that  
it has approved a bailout plan for the debt-ridden petroleum 
refinery Thai Oil Co. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Petroleum Authority of Thailand has been  
authorized to raise $350 million for Thai Oil as part of a plan to 
restructure the company's $1.9 billion debt, Industry Minister 
Suwat Liptapanlop said after a weekly Cabinet meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	PTT owns 49 percent of the company, with multinational petroleum  
company Royal-Dutch Shell Group holding 15 percent and Caltex 
holding 4.75 percent. Caltex is a joint venture of Texaco and 
Chevron. Individual Thai investors hold most of the remaining 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the cash infusion, the government's bailout plan  
would involve swapping debt held by some of the company's 124 
creditors for new equity valued at $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Suwat said all creditors have agreed to the plan except for  
Japanese financial institutions, which hold 41 percent of the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai Oil, battered by a financial crisis that shook the region  
in 1997, stopped repaying its debt in November 1998.

<P>
	A look at Air Canada and Canadian Airlines:  

</P>
<P>
	 *AIR CANADA   	
</P>
<P>
	Headquarters: Montreal.  
</P>
<P>
	Employees: 23,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Operations: With more than 155 aircraft, it flies to more than  
700 destinations in 110 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	President and chief executive: Robert Milton, appointed this  
month to succeed retiring Lamar Durrett. 
</P>
<P>
	History: The airline was government owned and known as  
Trans-Canada Airlines before its name change to Air Canada in 1965. 
In 62 years, it has grown into a $3.9 billion business, including 
regional carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The government began privatizing the airline 11 years ago. The  
initial public offering of stock was in August 1988, with a second 
offering in 1989 completing the transformation of Air Canada into a 
shareholder-owned corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Finances: Profit of about $49 million in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> 'Meet the Press' Co-Creator Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Martha Rountree, co-creator and first  
moderator of the NBC News program ``Meet the Press'' has died at 
age 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Rountree, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, died Monday at  
Sibley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to originating and co-producing ``Meet the Press,''  
she was also the only woman moderator in the show's 52-year 
history. She also produced several other television shows, 
including ``Keep Posted,'' ``Washington Exclusive'' and ``Capitol 
Close Up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, she joined Lawrence Spivak in introducing ``Meet the  
Press'' as a radio show, and two years later the program aired on 
television for the first time. She went on the lecture circuit in 
1953 when she sold her share of the show to Spivak after a coin 
toss. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a news pioneer who helped create a national  
treasure,'' said Tim Russert, NBC News Washington Bureau chief and 
current moderator of ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rountree was born in Gainesville, Fla., in 1911, and studied at  
the University of South Carolina. She returned to Florida as a 
reporter for the Tampa Tribune but moved in 1938 to New York, where 
she worked as an editor and freelance journalist. She joined NBC 
seven years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, the award-winning journalist founded Leadership, a  
nonprofit political research organization, and was its president 
until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Rountree's husband, advertising executive Oliver M. Presbrey,  
died in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	She is survived by two daughters, three grandchildren, a brother  
and a sister.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises, Japan Stocks Decline / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A record-high finish on Wall Street boosted the  
U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen in Tokyo on Tuesday. Japanese 
stocks sank moderately as traders cashed in on recent grains in 
financial shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar was trading at 112.22 yen at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT),  
up 1.48 yen from its level of 110.74 in Tokyo late Monday and also 
above its late New York level of 111.44 yen. The dollar ranged 
between 111.52 yen and 112.80 yen during the day's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 138.14 points,  
or 0.76 percent, to finish at 18,095.41 points. On Monday, the 
average closed up 135.44 points, or 0.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained on the yen after the  
stock surge in New York on Monday. The modest recovery came one day 
after the greenback fell to a seven-month low against the yen in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders expected the exchange rate to hold steady in a tight  
range for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	Yukihiko Hashimoto, vice president of foreign exchange at Sanwa  
Bank, said the fear that authorities might intervene to support the 
dollar has eased, and there are expectations that the strong yen 
won't hurt the profitability of Japanese exporters too much. 
</P>
<P>
	However, ``if the yen rises much higher than 110 yen, Japanese  
stocks ... will be hurt by a worsening in earnings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 199.15 points  
-- or 1.8 percent -- to close at a record-high 11,299.76. The Dow's 
previous record-high finish was 11,209.84 points on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally on Wall Street came despite the widespread belief that  
the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates one-quarter 
percentage point at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting later 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 117.28 yen, down  
from 118.18 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, traders cashed in on recent gains  
in banking and financial shares. Attention focused on the U.S. 
Federal Open Market Committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``While many players decided to take a wait-and-see stance  
before FOMC, dealers locked in near-term profits, particularly in 
financial stocks,'' said Hiroichi Nishi, deputy general manager at 
Nikko Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Many bank shares ended lower after rising sharply over the past  
three sessions on expectations of further realignment in the 
industry following the three-way alliance of Industrial Bank of 
Japan, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The market gained in the morning, when the rally on Wall Street  
and the yen's relative weakness against the dollar combined to 
support share prices. Morning gainers included export-oriented 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 11.65 points, or 0.77 percent, to 1,507.07. 
The TOPIX closed up 19.78 points, or 1.32 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 623 to 560, while 136  
issues were unchanged. Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo 
Stock Exchange was estimated at 940.74 million shares, slightly 
down from 965.63 million shares Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.9700 percent from Monday's finish of 1.9200 percent, 
driving its price down to 98.57 yen from 98.98 yen.

<HEADLINE> Inmate Beaten To Death at Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ROSA, N.M. (AP) -- An inmate beaten to death with a laundry  
bag full of rocks is the fourth to die at New Mexico prisons run by 
a private company. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Gabaldon, 51, was watching television Sunday when he was  
attacked, state police said. He had been serving a life sentence at 
Guadalupe County Correctional Facility for habitual armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were questioning another inmate.  
</P>
<P>
	The 600-bed prison is run by Wackenhut Corrections Corp. The  
company has a $25 million annual contract to hold about 1,500 
inmates at two prisons in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Wackenhut headquarters in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.,  
was not returned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lea County Correctional Facility, operated by Wackenhut, has  
had three inmate stabbing deaths since it opened in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 percent of New Mexico's 4,720 male inmates are in  
privately-run prisons, some of which have been hit by outbreaks of

<HEADLINE> Plot To Blow Up Alaska Pipeline Foiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A Canadian man was accused of plotting  
to bomb the trans-Alaska oil pipeline on New Year's Day, allegedly 
devising the scheme in order to reap windfall profits when oil 
prices spiked upward. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason he was doing it wasn't for any political or  
ideological terrorism. It was in furtherance of a fraudulent 
scheme,'' Larry Bettendorf, an agent with the U.S. Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested Alfred Heinz Reumayr  
on Aug. 18 in British Columbia, and the extradition process to 
return Reumayr to the United States has begun, Bettendorf said. The 
arrest was announced last week but few details of the accusations 
were disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The date the plot was to be carried out, Jan. 1, was selected to  
coincide with the expected problems resulting from the Y2K computer 
bug, authorities said. The date would provide a ``multiplier effect 
I'm expecting from the whole millennium effect,'' the affidavit 
quoted Reumayr as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest was made possible by an Albuquerque-based informant  
who met Reumayr while the suspect was serving time in a Texas 
prison for mail fraud and violation of probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF said Reumayr, 50, intended to buy up oil futures, then  
detonate 14 bombs and destroy the pipeline. The informant, whose 
name was withheld, was supposed to set the bombs, Bettendorf said. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest warrant charges Reumayr, of New Westminster, near  
Vancouver, British Columbia, with attempting to bomb the pipeline 
and aiding and abetting in the attempted bombing. Bettendorf said 
each count carries a possible 20-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just glad that the system worked and that the fellow was  
arrested,'' said Jennifer Ruys, spokeswoman for Alyeska Pipeline 
Service Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The informant approached the ATF with word of the alleged plot  
in May 1998, authorities said. Reumayr said he needed explosives, 
equipment and a pilot, the affidavit said. Among items mentioned 
were fuse igniters, a Claymore mine, an anti-personnel mine, an 
impact fragmentation grenade, 35 pounds of military TNT, C-4 
explosives, blasting caps, and three machine guns, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF prepared a photograph of materials that was forwarded to  
Reumayr. 
</P>
<P>
	By June 1999, the informant received a communique identifying  
three trans-Alaska Pipeline targets -- Thompson Pass north of 
Valdez, Tazlina River and Tanana River.

<HEADLINE> Bank One Warns of Profit Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Bank One Corp., the nation's fifth-largest bank,  
warned Tuesday that its 1999 earnings are likely to be as much as 8 
percent below Wall Street expectations because of slower than 
expected growth in its credit-card unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One said its operating earnings per share probably would be  
between $3.60 and $3.65. Wall Street had been expecting 1999 
profits of about $3.92 a share, based on a survey of analysts by 
First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The revised earnings outlook is entirely the result of a  
recent change in the growth and margin prospects for First USA'' 
credit-card subsidiary, Chicago-based Bank One said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One said an unexpectedly high number of First USA customers  
were switching to other credit-card issuers as they offer more 
attractive rates. That, in turn, has forced First USA to cut its 
interest rates on some new accounts and lower expectations for the 
second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Bank One fell 43 3/4 cents to close at $55.62 1/2 on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One said last month its second-quarter earnings rose 22  
percent to $1.11 billion, or 93 cents a share, boosted by increased 
fees from its credit card business.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Warren Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Chris Warren was back in Dallas  
Cowboys training camp Tuesday. So were concerns about the groin 
problem that limited him last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches thought Warren was fine until he left camp last week for  
further treatment with a specialist in Colorado. He was supposed to 
be back in time for a team meeting and a practice Monday, but 
missed both. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Chan Gailey was going to meet with Warren on Monday night,  
but the running back got in so late that they didn't get together 
until Tuesday morning. Their talk seemed to resolve things. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a mistake and he knows it,'' said Gailey, whose anger  
was obvious Monday. ``He's apologized to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a communication mixup,'' Warren said. ``I could've  
handled it differently, but I didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Warren is back, the focus returns to the groin problem  
that kept him out of seven full games last year and parts of two 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The injury is in kind of a weird spot,'' Warren said. ``It  
can't be strengthened with weights or any of the things we would 
normally do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting better. I just have to stay on top of it, that's  
the main thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren practiced in pads Tuesday afternoon after only going  
through agility drills in the morning. Gailey said there's a chance 
Warren will play in the exhibition game Sunday night against 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got to see how it feels in three or four days,''  
Gailey said. ``Then we'll be in better shape to make that 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey called Warren's injury a little problem that could become  
a big one if it lingers. The coach said it's frustrating not 
knowing whether he can count on Warren because there were plans to 
expand his role in the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy's a great player,'' Gailey said. ``I wish I had it a  
different way, I really do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren, Seattle's career leading rusher, averaged a team-best  
4.9 yards per carry last season and had Dallas' two longest runs 
from scrimmage while playing on third downs and backing up Emmitt 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey tinkered with using Smith and Warren together and had  
other ideas he hoped to test. For now, those plans are on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost a little over a week of work with him, not  
implementing some things we would've like to have implemented,'' 
Gailey said. ``Whether we still can, I don't know. It's not like 
there's a lot of installation time to tinker with new things.''

<HEADLINE>  Cruise Liner, Cargo Ship Collide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARGATE, England (AP) -- A Norwegian Cruise liner collided with a  
cargo ship on its way back from a 13-day tour of the Scandinavian 
capitals early today. At least 20 passengers suffered minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The cruise ship bound for Dover pulled into the port on  
schedule, Norwegian Cruise Line President Geir Aune said. The 1,726 
passengers, most Americans, had breakfast on board before 
disembarking to return home. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard the bang, I really pictured another Titanic and  
started running to the deck,'' said passenger Arielle Adelman, 16, 
from New York City. ``It was really scary. There was a loud bang. I 
was walking down the hall and fell over. The ship started shaking 
and things started falling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash smashed the bow of the cruise ship, called the  
Norwegian Dream, but the boat made the 40-mile trip to Dover on its 
own and arrived safely. The injured passengers remained on board 
until the ship docked. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few people went to the doctor's office to check for minor  
scratches, but it was nothing serious,'' Aune said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue efforts were focused on the Panama-registered cargo ship  
Ever Decent, which was adrift outside shipping lanes 12 miles off 
the coast of Margate in southeast England. Its 40 crew members 
battled a fire that broke out as a result of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollution experts were on alert. Some of the cargo containers  
held hazardous material, but the pollution risk was considered 
minimal, coast guard spokeswoman Joanne Groenenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash happened at 1:15 a.m. in a part of the English Channel  
known as Falls Bank, 20 miles from Margate, the coast guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear why the two ships collided. Weather conditions at  
the time of the crash were not hazardous, the coast guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The force of the collision threw three shipping containers from  
the deck of the Ever Decent onto the 41,000-ton cruiser. Other 
containers fell into the water, while several more caught fire, 
said coast guard spokesman Mark Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	The cargo ship started to take on water and began leaning to one  
side, but later recovered and regained an upright position. It then 
headed toward shallow water to run aground, apparently to make it 
easier for a rescue and to fight the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruise ship passenger Bob Gedan, 62, from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,  
who was traveling with his wife Winnie, 61, said there were some 
anxious moments among passengers but never any panic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people were asleep at the time. The TV fell off onto our  
bed and woke my wife up,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Russia, IMF Seek Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia and the International Monetary Fund are  
inching toward a compromise that would allow Russia to receive more 
IMF loans, a news report said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides are discussing the size of the primary surplus in the  
1999 Russian federal budget, the revenue left over when all 
spending is accounted for apart from debt service. 
</P>
<P>
	A larger surplus would be good for Russia as it shows the  
government is collecting more taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF's approval of the budget is necessary for Russia to  
continue receiving funds from a $4.45 billion loan program begun 
last month with the release of a first installment of $640 million. 
The rest will be loaned over an 18-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	The current draft, delivered by the Finance Ministry to the  
government earlier today, has a target primary surplus of $6.5 
billion, or 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product forecast for 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF originally demanded a primary surplus of 4 percent of  
GDP, while the Russian government offered a surplus of 2.8 percent 
of GDP. A team of IMF economists are in Moscow to examine the 
government's compliance with loan conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides are close to an agreement, First Deputy Prime  
Minister Viktor Khristenko said today, with both sides moving off 
their previous demands, according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, the IMF's biggest borrower with about $20 billion of  
debt incurred in the past six years, is using the loan to finance 
repayments of earlier loans to the fund.

<HEADLINE> Magic To Play Once for Swedish Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson, the retired  
NBA star and future Hall of Famer, has agreed to play at least one 
game in Sweden's basketball league, elated coach Charles Barton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People really don't believe it. Sometimes it's a little unreal  
for me, actually. It's true, though,'' said Barton, the former 
coach of Sweden's national team, said Tuesday in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	His team, known as M7, finished fifth in the Swedish League last  
season and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Haney, an attorney for the former all-star with the Los  
Angeles Lakers, said Johnson picked Sweden partly because of the 
impression the country made on him during a 1996 playing tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``He very much liked the Swedish people and the area is  
beautiful. The chemistry is right and the timing is right,'' Haney 
said, adding Johnson's presence might help promote basketball in a 
country where most people prefer ice hockey and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 40, learned in 1991 he was infected with HIV, the virus  
that causes AIDS. He retired in 1992 from the Lakers, came back 
briefly as a player and then quit for good during the 1992-93 
exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
	His pay for appearing in one game was not disclosed. The team's  
Swedish players make approximately $1,690 a month, about what a 
typical public schoolteacher earns.

<HEADLINE> Throwback Game Show A Hit for ABC / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC has hit the jackpot with its two-week quiz  
show series, ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With perfect timing to catch viewers bored with reruns, the  
Regis Philbin-hosted show hadn't even ended its run of 13 episodes 
in 14 nights before ABC was asking for more. 
</P>
<P>
	Four episodes of ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' were ranked  
in Nielsen Media Research's top 10 shows last week, helping ABC to 
a strong second-place showing in the ratings, and first among total 
viewers and adults aged 18-49. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the ratings, you can see the broad appeal,''  
said Michael Davies, the show's executive producer. ``Families are 
watching this together and young people are throwing parties to 
watch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the re-creation of a British TV game show, participants build  
bankrolls by answering questions that steadily grow more difficult. 
Contestants have a chance to win big money, but at each point risk 
losing much of what they've already earned if they answer 
incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a throwback to Monty Hall of ``Let's Make a Deal'' and the  
old-time theatrics of television, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC has already asked for additional episodes, Davies said. It's  
not clear when they would be ready to air, or whether they would 
run as a weekly series or several nights in a row as it was this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratings performance buoyed ABC, which has routinely run a  
distant third during most of the past year. Even more encouraging, 
``Millionaire'' picked up viewers as the week went on, with the 
exception of the traditionally slow Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 6.3 rating and 12 share. ABC and NBC  
tied with 6.1 ratings and 11 shares, and Fox had a 4.4 rating and 8 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.1 rating and 4  
share. UPN had a 1.9 rating and 3 share, receiving a boost from its 
Friday night broadcast of the Source magazine Hip-Hop Awards. 
Ratings for Pax TV were not immediately available from Nielsen 
Media Research. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news ratings race  
with a 7.0 rating and 16 share. The ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 6.9 
rating and 16 share, and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 5.8 and 
13. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Aug. 16-22, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 9.6; ``Who Wants To Be 
a Millionaire-Sunday,'' ABC, 9.4; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 8.8; 
``Frasier'' special, NBC, 8.8; ``Who Wants To Be a 
Millionaire-Friday,'' ABC, 8.7; ``Who Wants To Be a 
Millionaire-Thursday,'' ABC, 8.6; ``CBS Sunday Movie: To Sir, With 
Love II,'' CBS, 8.3; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 8.3; ``Everybody 
Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 8.2; ``20-20-Wednesday,'' ABC, 8.0; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 8.0; ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire-Wednesday,'' 
ABC, 8.0.

	Kosovo Albanians Block Russians  
</P>
<P>
	ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Russian peacekeepers are waiting out  
a standoff with ethnic Albanians who are blocking roads into the 
southern Kosovo town of Orahovac to protest the presence of the 
Russians, who they say favor Serbs. Russian officials said Monday 
they are convinced their NATO partners will eventually overcome 
ethnic Albanian resistance to their presence in Orahovac. Dutch 
military officers are hoping to mediate an end to the standoff, 
which began Monday when Russian troops tried to enter Orahovac to 
take over positions held by the Dutch.

	Cruise Liner, Cargo Ship Collide  
</P>
<P>
	MARGATE, England (AP) -- A cruise ship carrying more than 2,400  
passengers collided with a burning cargo vessel early Tuesday off 
Britain's southeast coast, coast guard officials said. Three of the 
2,400 passengers aboard the Norwegian Dream cruise ship suffered 
minor injuries from the collision, but remained on board until the 
ship docked in Dover, 40 miles from the crash site. It made the 
journey on its own, but its bough was smashed. The crash occurred 
at 1:15 a.m. while the 40-member crew of the Panama-registered 
cargo ship Ever Decent fought an on-board fire in the English 
Channel, the coast guard said.

	Gas Said Fired in Davidian Siege  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A former FBI official said agents fired two  
pyrotechnic tear gas grenades at the Branch Davidian compound on 
the day it went up in flames, contradicting previous government 
claims, The Dallas Morning News reported Tuesday. The former 
official, Danny Coulson, told the newspaper two devices were fired 
hours before the compound erupted in flames on April 19, 1993. 
However, he said they did not start the fire. The issue of whether 
the FBI used pyrotechnic devices that day is a major focus of an 
ongoing inquiry by the Texas Rangers and a key allegation in a 
pending federal wrongful-death lawsuit filed against the government 
by surviving Davidians and families of those who died.

	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Pulling out of Turkey as the relief  
effort switched from finding earthquake survivors to aiding those 
already out of the rubble, foreign rescue teams packed up their 
listening equipment and caged their sniffer dogs on Monday. But 
some amazing discoveries continued to emerge -- most notably, a 
scared, hungry 4-year-old boy found alive Monday after six days 
under tons of debris. In a tiny space under a collapsed building, 
rescuers discovered the boy, whose relatives had already prepared a 
grave for him.

Washington Post reported. Notra Trulock, the Energy Department's 
deputy director of intelligence called a report issued by the 
agency's inspector general last week, which failed to back him up, 
``a whitewash,'' the newspaper reported in Tuesday editions. 
Neither Trulock nor DOE officials could be reached by telephone for 
comment Monday night.

	Texas Storm Causes Little Damage  
</P>
<P>
	CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- Texans returned to their homes  
Monday as the strongest hurricane to hit the state in nearly 20 
years had weakened into a tropical storm, causing little damage to 
the remote areas where it was centered. Heavy rains that washed 
over the area were blamed for a Monday crash in which four people 
died. Police said a tractor trailer jackknifed and hit a pickup, 
killing the big rig driver and two women and a man in the pickup. 
Those were the only reported deaths.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Republicans Endorse Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- GOP presidential contender George W. Bush claimed  
the endorsements of Georgia's top Republicans Tuesday on the eve of 
a three-day Southern swing. But there were fresh comments from one 
of them about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he endorsed the Texas governor, House Republican Leader  
Bob Irvin of Atlanta said Bush should put an end to questions about 
illegal drug use. ``I think he ought to tell the truth and tell the 
full truth as soon as possible,'' Irvin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's Southern trip ends Friday in Atlanta after stops in South  
Carolina and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a new poll suggests Americans are no more interested  
at this point in hearing about any drug use by Bush than he is in 
talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Four in five respondents in an ABC News poll released Tuesday  
said it would make no difference in their vote if the Republican 
presidential candidate continued to avoid questions about whether 
he had ever used cocaine. About the same number said their vote 
would not change if it turned out Bush had used cocaine in his 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	When people were asked whether Bush should answer the question  
of whether he used cocaine when younger, more than half said he 
should not. About four in 10 said he should. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he hasn't taken illegal drugs in the last 25 years  
but has refused to discuss the matter further. No one has produced 
any evidence of illegal drug use by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, for one, said Bush should offer more details.  
</P>
<P>
	``Something somebody does a long time ago is a whole lot less  
important than their behavior as an adult,'' the Atlanta lawmaker 
said. ``So if the answer is that he used it 25 years ago or 30 
years ago and has not used it since and that he's learned from 
that, among other things, then that would be OK with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statewide Georgia officials listed as Bush backers were state  
school Superintendent Linda Schrenko, Public Service Commission 
members Stan Wise, Bobby Baker and Bob Durden and Insurance 
Commissioner John Oxendine. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen of 22 Republican state Senate members and 33 of 78  
Republican House members also were listed as backers of Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	In the national ABC poll, Bush led Democratic Vice President Al  
Gore 49 percent to 37 percent. Among Republicans and those leaning 
Republican, Bush had 56 percent while Elizabeth Dole was second 
with 14 percent and other GOP hopefuls trailed in single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABC poll of 1,031 adults was taken Thursday through Sunday  
and had an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Increase Aid to Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is looking for ways  
to help Colombia, which is struggling through a civil war while 
plagued with narcotics trafficking, human rights abuses and a 
declining economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The hint Monday of increase economic and military aid followed  
separate visits to the South American country by White House drug 
policy director Barry R. McCaffrey and Undersecretary of State 
Thomas Pickering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colombia's needs are critical, and we are certainly exploring  
every avenue to provide assistance,'' deputy State Department 
spokesman James Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colombia is working on a comprehensive strategy to address the  
interrelated problems confronting it,'' he said. ``And we are going 
to be studying that strategy closely with an eye toward providing 
assistance where we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia defense officials last month requested $500 million in  
military aid over the next two years. This year Colombia already is 
due to receive $289 million in counterdrug assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley declined to say how much additional aid Colombia may get.  
``It certainly is premature to discuss specific amounts at this 
point,'' he said. ``We are considering a wide gamut of possible 
areas of assistance, but any assistance package we do come up with 
will be heavily weighted towards counternarcotics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our vision is that the United States must be prepared to  
provide resources, equipment, training and intelligence but the 
most important thing is to provide political support,'' McCaffrey 
said Monday at a news conference in Brazil, the first stop on a 
four-nation visit to Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey has talked about a $1 billion regional supplement but  
Pickering said last week that any such proposal is premature in the 
absence of a specific program the United States could support. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickering also said it would be a mistake to overestimate the  
strength of FARC guerrillas, the dominant rebel group in Colombia, 
despite recent battlefield successes. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters on his visit to Bogota a week earlier,  
Pickering said Colombia ``is not in danger'' of being taken over by 
the guerrillas, who number between 20,000 and 25,000 and who 
finance their activities by working in league with 
narcotraffickers.

<HEADLINE> Elliott May Be Released Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- San Antonio Spurs forward Sean Elliott is  
scheduled to be released from a hospital Wednesday, a little more 
than a week after having a kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Elliott needed the transplant because of an  
illness he has had for several years called focal segmental 
glomerular sclerosis. The condition prevented his kidneys from 
properly filtering waste from the blood. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, 32-year-old Noel Elliott, underwent surgery to  
donate one of his healthy kidneys for the transplant Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Elliott, a 10-year NBA veteran, played a big role as the  
Spurs won their first NBA championship in June. A 3-pointer he made 
while balancing on his tiptoes in the final seconds of a game was 
crucial in the team's victory over Portland in the Western 
Conference finals.

<HEADLINE> Cash-for-Guns Program Draws Crowds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- So successful was a District of Columbia  
program to buy guns from citizens for $100 each that city officials 
have added $100,000 to use for the purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	By day's end Monday, 1,164 guns were turned in for payment,  
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	In just the first half-hour, people handed over around 400 guns  
at the seven police district offices, said assistant chief Terry 
Gainer. That's half as many firearms as normally are confiscated in 
the district in a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the program began, Gainer said, police decided to  
spend an extra $25,000 for what was to have been a $100,000 
program. By Monday night, they had decided to add another $100,000 
to the program. 
</P>
<P>
	People who turned in guns did not have to give police their  
names and were granted amnesty from the city's law barring people 
from owning handguns or other illegal firearms, police spokesman 
Sgt. Joe Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said guns would be tested to see if they could be traced  
to crimes in the district. 
</P>
<P>
	Funds to pay for the program are coming from money and assets  
confiscated from drug dealers.

<HEADLINE> US Fighters Advance in Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- U.S. light-flyweight champion Brian Viloria  
struggled and heavyweight Michael Bennett cruised, but both 
Americans advanced to the semifinals of the World Amateur Boxing 
Championships Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing on points at the start of the fourth round, Viloria  
rallied with a furious charge to beat Brahim Asloum of France. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, entered in his first international tournament,  
continued his surprising showing with a 6-0 victory over Serik 
Umirbekov of Kazakhstan. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Clarence Vinson, three-time U.S. bantamweight champion,  
was defeated by Zakhid Mekhtsiyeu of Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more U.S. fighters were on the evening card.  
</P>
<P>
	Viloria punched his way to victory. Tied 3-3 on points, Viloria  
threw 34 punches to 15 for Asloum 
</P>
<P>
	``That guy was very tough,'' Viloria said. ``He kept his hands  
up the entire fight. I couldn't score unless I could make some 
openings. The coaches told me I was down on points so I tried to 
give more heat and punches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I just hoped.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, who has been boxing for only one year, was off-balance  
with many of his punches and lurched at times, but his power was 
too much for Umirbekov. Bennett was ahead 4-0 on points going into 
the final round, where he extended his lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great, I feel strong, not physically but mentally,''  
Bennett said. ``I didn't know what to expect. I came here to do my 
best. I didn't expect to lose and I didn't expect to win, just do 
the best I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time Olympic heavyweight champion Felix Savon of Cuba also  
reached the semifinals with a 9-2 victory over Rustam Chagaev of 
Uzbekistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinson was even on points with Mekhtsiyeu going into the third  
round, but fell behind in the third and didn't score a point in the 
fourth round, losing the bout 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
	In other bouts, 1998 Goodwill Games welterweight gold medalist  
Juan Hernandez of Cuba beat Adrian Suteu of Austria 10-2 and 1998 
Goodwill Games light-flyweight champion Maikro Romero of Cuba beat 
Pal Lakatos of Hungary.

<HEADLINE> Feds Want ADA To Apply to Cruises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tammy Stevens checked and rechecked. She was  
assured the cruise ship she would board in her wheelchair for a 
special Mother's Day treat would accommodate her. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stevens got two buckets to replace the inaccessible  
bathroom, was excluded from the evacuation drill and was shut out 
of excursions on Premier Cruises' Big Red Boat. 
</P>
<P>
	Back on shore, she sued. A federal district judge in Miami threw  
out the case, ruling the Americans With Disabilities Act doesn't 
apply to foreign flag cruise ships -- the bulk of the ships visiting 
U.S. ports. 
</P>
<P>
	On appeal, the Justice Department startled the industry by  
setting up a test case, saying in a friend-of-the-court brief that 
the ADA does in fact apply, and Premier Cruises must comply. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty hot issue,'' said Elaine Ostroff, founder of  
Adaptive Environments in Boston, one of 10 government-funded 
centers offering technical assistance for ADA compliance. ``It's 
going to change the way the industry is operating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disability rights advocates believe the cruise industry's  
floating hotels should be treated under the ADA as a public 
accommodation, like restaurants, supermarkets and other businesses 
that offer services to the public. The 1990 law mandates the 
removal of architectural barriers when it can be accomplished 
without much difficulty or expense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect this world to be rebuilt for me, but don't tell  
me one thing and do something else,'' said Stevens, 35, who was 
paralyzed from the chest down in a 1979 auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, a development manager at the Jacksonville zoo, was  
excited when Premier advertised a wheelchair-accessible cruise. She 
checked with her travel agent and the cruise line before booking 
the four-day trip from Port Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
	But once on board the 34-year-old ship last year, one  
humiliation followed another. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sister and my mother had to physically pick me up, put me  
onto the commode, pick me up and put me into the shower,'' she 
said. ``I had bruises all on my arms from all the banging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Premier attorney Gary Davidson contends that the Justice  
Department is taking an unreasonable position with costly 
consequences by claiming the ADA applies when the Department of 
Transportation has not proposed any rules for compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ships are by their very nature a very different type of animal  
than an office building,'' he said. ``We're not here just talking 
about throwing down a couple of concrete slabs and building a 
ramp-way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, the design and construction of cruise ships have always  
been policed by flag states, the nations where ships are 
registered, Davidson said. Premier's ship is registered in the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you have a situation where, according to the Department of  
Justice, it is going to be the port state, in this case the United 
States, dictating to each and every flag state ... how those 
vessels that call on our ports are going to be designed,'' Davidson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In large part, cruise ships are not subject to U.S. laws and  
regulation. But there are exceptions. Casino gambling is legal only 
in international waters, and cruise lines don't serve drinks to 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
	By treaty, the International Maritime Organization regulates  
cruise ship safety with a set of common rules called Safety of Life 
at Sea, or SOLAS. But the U.S. Coast Guard inspects and grades 
cruise ships for safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Council of Cruise Lines, which represents 17  
lines, said members are striving to make their ships accessible, 
but they don't believe they are legally bound by the ADA at this 
time because no access rules have been issued. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the ADA applies to them, some cruises lines try to be  
accommodating. Carnival Corp. builds its ships with a limited 
number of cabins with wider doorways, no lips in the bathroom 
doorway and no shower divider in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	That makes good business sense to Sid Wolinsky, co-director of  
Disability Rights Advocates in Oakland, Calif., a nonprofit center 
for disability-related lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outfits like Premier Cruises that don't recognize this are  
shooting themselves in the foot,'' he said. ``People with 
disabilities are now venturing out more, married more, employed 
more in professional jobs. They have money to spend and are ready 
to go on vacation like anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal is before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in  
Atlanta. A three-judge panel could address the broad issue of 
cruise ship access or consider it on narrow grounds, such as 
whether Stevens has legal standing to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our first cruise, our first time going away together  
for this length of time, our first everything. I so wanted it to be 
perfect,'' Stevens said. ``I don't ask for anything free in this 
world, but I do expect to be treated as an equal, and I think 
everybody does.''

	Federal Reserve Hikes Interest Rates  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time this summer, the Federal  
Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point in an effort to 
cool the economy by making it more expensive for Americans to 
borrow. The Fed today said it was increasing its target for the 
federal funds rates -- the interest banks charge each other on 
overnight loans -- to 5.25 percent from 5 percent. The central bank 
also raised the discount rate, the interest that it charges for 
direct loans to banks, by a quarter of a point as well. The 
discount rate was increased to 4.75 percent, the first increase in 
the discount since 1995.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- After some initial confusion, investors today

interest rates, sending most stocks higher even as blue-chips fell 
back slightly. At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial 
average was down 16.46 at 11,283.30. The Fed's announcement sparked 
a volatile afternoon on Wall Street, as the index jumped more than 
65 points from yesterday's record high close, then tumbled as much 
as 105.43 points before regaining ground. Broader stock indicators 
ended higher.

	Labor Day Travel Predicted Heavy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though gas prices are rising, Labor Day travel  
may reach the second highest figures ever, the AAA said today. Some 
34.8 million Americans are expected to travel 100 miles or more 
from home over the Labor Day holiday, a 2 percent increase from 
last year. At the same time, the group's fuel gauge report shows a

	New WTO Chief Makes Plea for Poor  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Mike Moore, who becomes leader of  
the World Trade Organization next month, said Tuesday that smaller 
and poorer members must be given a greater role in promoting free 
trade. Moore said he has asked wealthy member countries to 
contribute to a special budget for the world's poorest nations. 
Such a move would allow them to fully participate in negotiations 
in Geneva, where the WTO is based, and in ministerial meetings, 
such as the sessions in November in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Greene, Jones Advance to 200 Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- World 100-meter champions Maurice Greene  
and Marion Jones continued their pursuit of sprint doubles today, 
winning their quarterfinal rounds in the 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene looked flat and finished only third in his opening heat  
in the morning, clocking 20.76 seconds. But he came back strong in 
the evening, moving well clear of the field before easing up in the 
final 10 meters to finish in 20.23. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just caught me off guard,'' Greene said of his first  
round heat. ``I wanted to go as close to 21 flat as possible, but 
they didn't let me do that. I need to work more on taking the 
curve. The curve could be better. It's getting there, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, the former 200 champion who could  
be Greene's main rival for the title, had the best time of the 
men's quarterfinals (20.11). 
</P>
<P>
	Jones rebounded from her defeat in the long jump Monday night,  
winning both of her 200 rounds to advance to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones overcame heat and fatigue to take her races in 22.69 and  
22.45 seconds, the fourth fastest times in both rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stumbled out of the blocks,'' Jones said after her  
quarterfinal run. ``I didn't feel as sharp as in the past. I feel a 
little winded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Jones, who won the 100 meters Sunday in 10.80 seconds,  
was satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``All things considered, the fact I could come back even in this  
heat and run 22.4, that says a lot about my shape,'' she said. ``If 
I get a little rest tonight, I'll be ready to run fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said she got only five hours' sleep and that she and other  
athletes were suffering from the ``very harsh conditions,'' 
referring to the extreme heat, with temperatures in the 90s (30s). 
</P>
<P>
	The first gold medal of the night went to Romanian Mihaela  
Melinte, who won the inaugural women's hammer competition at the 
worlds with a throw of 246 feet, 9 inches 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Olga Kuzenkova won the silver and Lisa Misipeka of  
America Samoa took the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who lost her bid for a record four gold medals when she  
was beaten in the long jump, can still get three golds with 
victories in the 200 and one of the relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene also is contention for three golds. He is seeking to  
become the first man to win the 100 and 200 at a world 
championship, and is also running in the 400 relay. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaica's Beverly McDonald had the fastest time in both rounds  
of the women's 200 (22.52 and 22.26). 
</P>
<P>
	American Inger Miller, who took the silver behind Jones in the  
100 and figures to be her main challenger in the 200, comfortably 
won both rounds in 22.92 and 22.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending 200 champion Zhanna Pintusevich of Ukraine scratched  
from the quarterfinals, apparently due to an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 110-meter hurdles, two-time defending champion  
Allen Johnson of the United States scratched from the semifinals. 
While warming up, he strained his right calf muscle, aggravating 
the same injury he suffered six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow American Duane Ross had the fastest time in both hurdles  
semifinals (13.14). Colin Jackson of Britain, the world 
record-holder and former champion, finished second in his semifinal 
in 13.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomas Dvorak got off to a solid start in defense of his  
decathlon title, just 10 points off his own world record pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak, of the Czech Republic, led the field after three events  
with 2,890 points. He had 2,900 points at the same stage when he 
broke Dan O'Brien's 7-year-old record on July 4 in Prague, amassing 
8,994 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak posted the second fastest time in the 100 meters (10.60  
seconds), had a personal best in the long jump (26 feet, 2 1/4 inches) 
and threw the shot (54-1 1/4). 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Huffins, the U.S. and Pan American Games champion, was  
second with 2,800 points and Erki Nool of Estonia third with 2,688. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Johnson, bidding for a fourth straight world title in  
the 400, cruised through his semifinal. He was so far ahead that he 
shut down three times in the last 100 meters and coasted across the 
line in 43.95. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 400-meter hurdles, U.S. champion and gold medal  
contender Angelo Taylor failed to qualify, finishing third in his 
heat (49.58) and only 19th overall. Taylor banged his fist against 
a wall in the mixed zone area after the race and declined to speak 
to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephane Diagana, the defending champion from France, was the  
fastest in the heats at 48.55, while former champion Samuel Matete 
of Zambia was fourth overall at 48.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Llewellyn Herbert of South Africa, the fastest in the world this  
year, pulled out of the event Monday with a left quadriceps injury.

<HEADLINE> Ohio State Names Winner of QB Duel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- While fans weighed in on Internet sites,  
argued in sports bars and made their cases in letters to 
newspapers, Austin Moherman quietly made points with Ohio State's 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he was declared the ninth-ranked Buckeyes' starting  
quarterback against Miami in Sunday's Kickoff Classic. Steve 
Bellisari dropped to No. 2 on the depth chart, ending Ohio State's 
most recent quarterback duel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has not been torturous,'' Moherman said. ``I went out every  
day and did what I could do. I tried to show the coaches. I didn't 
focus on the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bellisari said he doesn't consider the competition over and  
thinks the decision will be made on the field during games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever is making plays, has good production, puts points on  
the board and wins games, that should be the starter,'' Bellisari 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The job appears to be Moherman's -- for as long as the Buckeyes  
offense flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot tell you right now in my mind who I think the best  
quarterback is, but we think the one who deserves to start in this 
first ballgame is Austin,'' coach John Cooper said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Bellisari would definitely play against the 12th-ranked  
Hurricanes, Cooper said, ``I didn't say that. We've said we're 
going to start Austin in the ballgame and we're going to do 
everything we can to win the football game. If we start Austin and 
he played fantastic, played great -- why take him out?'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a change from the 1996 and 1997 seasons when Stanley  
Jackson and Joe Germaine were listed No. 1 and 1-A at quarterback, 
sharing playing time, but not a love for the uncomfortable position 
they were in. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson started all but one game in those two seasons, but never  
received the full confidence of the coaching staff. He was almost 
always replaced in the second quarter by Germaine, who usually 
played when a game hung in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going into this ballgame saying, `Austin, you're  
going to play the first two series, then Steve you're going in,''' 
Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you there's probably a good chance that somewhere  
during the game Steve will go in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two have jousted for the job since the first practice of the  
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither has established much of a college track record.  
Bellisari, a sophomore from Boca Raton, Fla., was 3-for-5 passing 
in one game last season, while Moherman, a redshirt sophomore from 
Mission Viejo, Calif., misfired on his only attempt in the same 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	But Moherman at least was a full-time quarterback for his two  
years at Ohio State and was able to learn from Germaine, who passed 
for 3,330 yards while leading the Buckeyes to an 11-1 record and a 
No. 2 spot in the final polls last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellisari played on special teams and at defensive back last  
season, sharing the award for top special team's player and 
finishing tied for 11th on the squad in tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did Moherman get the nod over Bellisari?'' Cooper  
repeated. ``Well, he's had the nod. He's been our first-team 
quarterback. Normally, when we start out in the spring, seniority 
rules and he was of course a quarterback last year and started out 
a little ahead of Steve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the Ohio State players said they were happy to have  
the situation clarified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am just relieved so people won't be like, `Who's going to  
start?' I'm glad to have that part over with,'' wide receiver 
Reggie Germany said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said Moherman also had the edge in the team's August  
workouts in preparations of meeting the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main reason that we will start Austin in this ballgame is  
that we grade them every day in practice, we keep charts on 
completions, interceptions, total yardage and bad plays. For 
whatever reason, Austin has graded out slightly ahead of Steve -- 
particularly in the last couple of scrimmages we've had in the 
stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said Sunday's game would determine if -- or when --  
Moherman stayed on the field or Bellisari replaced him. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it will be based on feel, a gut decision that you  
make during the ballgame,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Teen Pleading Guilty to Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Maryland teen-ager Samuel Sheinbein, who was  
the subject of a 17-month extradition battle between U.S. and 
Israeli authorities, has agreed to plead guilty to murder, a county 
prosecutor said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Sheinbein will plead guilty for his involvement in the  
murder as well as his involvement in the dismemberment of Alfredo 
Tello,'' Montgomery County, Md. State's Attorney Douglas Gansler 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein, 19, will be sentenced to 24 years in an Israeli  
prison when he enters a plea in a Tel Aviv court on Sept. 2, 
Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ido Baum, spokesmon for Israel's Justice Ministry confirmed the  
agreement but declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea is a surprise reversal. Last month, Sheinbein pleaded  
not guilty to killing 19-year-old Tello. 
</P>
<P>
	Tello's burned and dismembered body was found in an empty garage  
near Sheinbein's home in Aspen Hill, Md., on Sept. 18, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein fled to Israel several days later. He claimed  
citizenship through his Israeli-born father and Israel declined to 
return him to the United States for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler said it was the evidence that prompted Sheinbein to  
admit he committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a mountain of evidence, all of which would have been  
compelling,'' Gansler said. That included DNA, eyewitness accounts, 
and a ``recipe'' to commit murder written by Sheinbein, the 
prosecutor added. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein will be eligible for parole in 16 years and will be  
able to leave the prison on weekend furloughs in six years, Gansler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not pleased with the result, because it's still a very  
short sentence in terms of what he would have gotten here,'' 
Gansler said, adding that Sheinbein would probably have received a 
life sentence had he been tried in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Sheinbein is freed, he could still be arrested and charged  
with first-degree murder if he tried to enter the United States or 
any country that belongs to the Interpol international police 
organization, Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no double jeopardy,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein's father, Sol, who is living in Israel, faces  
obstruction of justice and hindering investigation charges in 
Montgomery County, Gansler said.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Seeks Restructuring of Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Hoping to avoid default on part of its  
crushing $13 billion foreign debt load, Ecuador's chief loan 
negotiator arrived in New York Tuesday to hammer out a 
restructuring plan of a $98 million interest payment that comes due 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of Juan Montufar, head of the foreign debt  
department in Ecuador's Finance Ministry, came one day after the 
Latin American country's government promised not to declare a 
moratorium on its debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Minister of Finance Ana Lucia Armijo said in a short news  
release that her country, struggling through its worst economic 
crisis in 70 years, would instead propose a ``coordinated 
restructuring'' of its Brady bond debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady bonds, named for former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas  
Brady, allowed 18 countries over the last 10 years to repay their 
debt by repackaging defaulted loans into new bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest payments totaling $98 million on Ecuador's $6 billion  
Brady bond debt are due Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador raised fears last week that it could become the first  
country to default on its Brady debt, causing market instability 
throughout the region, when it hinted it might seek deferral of the 
$98 million payment. 
</P>
<P>
	But over the weekend President Jamil Mahuad tried to ease those  
tensions, telling reporters that Ecuador is ``not considering 
avoiding its commitments. What we are seeking are market mechanisms 
that permit paying less for the debt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ecuadorean officials continue to work with an  
International Monetary Fund mission in Quito to regain some 
semblance of economic stability. Sources familiar with the 
negotiations said talks so far had focused on banking reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts by Mahuad's government to obtain an 18-month, $400  
million loan have been hampered by an opposition Congress unwilling 
to take action on tax reform, and banking and government subsidy 
programs, proposed by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's total foreign debt of $13 billion is expected to total  
117 percent of its gross domestic product by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The smallest South American nation with a population of 12  
million people, Ecuador was hammered last year by $2.6 billion in 
damage from El Nino-powered floods and low prices for oil, its main 
export. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation is grappling with 55 percent inflation, 16 percent  
unemployment and a $1.7 billion budget deficit that has swelled to 
7 percent of its gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Bicyclist's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- A driver was arrested Tuesday on charges  
he struck and killed a bicyclist and drove 13 miles with the body 
caught in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Isidro Calderon Hernandez, 26, was booked for investigation of  
felony hit-and-run in the death of John Lee LaBord, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBord apparently crashed through the windshield of the car that  
struck him Sunday night while he was with friends. His body was 
found Monday morning 13 miles away and a few miles from a damaged 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accident happened so quickly that nobody saw what kind of  
vehicle it was,'' Sgt. Joe Vargas said. ``They looked around and 
saw the crumpled bike and a sneaker, but not the victim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe Hernandez may also have been involved in a  
hit-and-run accident May 22 in which another bicyclist was hit and 
suffered scrapes.

<HEADLINE> Cops Ask Clinton To Rescind Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton's offer of clemency to 16  
Puerto Rican independence advocates imprisoned after a wave of 
bombings on U.S. targets is an insult to the victims, law 
enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are begging him, as a friend of law enforcement, to rescind  
his offer and let them serve out the sentences that they justly 
deserve,'' Thomas J. Scotto, president of New York's Detectives' 
Endowment Association and the National Association of Police 
Organizations, said Monday. ``They are criminals. They are not 
patriots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials dismissed suggestions that Clinton's offer  
is politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that has been under consideration for quite  
some time,'' White House spokesman Barry Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Clinton said he would offer clemency to 16  
members of the FALN -- the Spanish initials for Armed Forces of 
National Liberation -- if they signed statements asking for 
commutations, agreed to renounce violence and abided by all 
conditions of release set by law or the Parole Commission. They 
have not yet met the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The FALN members staged some 130 bomb attacks on political,  
military and civilian targets in the United States from 1974 to 
1983. Bombings attributed to the FALN killed six people and wounded 
dozens, but none of those offered clemency was involved in attacks 
that resulted in fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's offer came in response to human rights officials who  
argued that the sentences were too harsh. The 16 are serving 
sentences ranging from 15 years to 90 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But former Detectives Richard Pastorella, and Anthony Senft and  
former police Officer Rocco Pascarella said they have been 
forgotten. Pastorella and Senft were injured as they tried to 
disarm a bomb on New Year's Eve in 1982. Pascarella was injured 
that same night when a bomb exploded outside New York police 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastorella, who was blinded, called the offer a move designed to  
help Hillary Rodham Clinton gain the Hispanic vote should she run 
next year for the U.S. Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really truly pandering to the Hispanic community, to  
the Latino community, for the vote when Mrs. Clinton runs,'' 
Pastorella said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was joined at the news conference by two other former cops  
injured in those attacks, police Commissioner Howard Safir and 
representatives of the city's five police unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who also is exploring a  
Senate run, supports the police but did not attend the news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president ... said the premise of his pardoning them was  
that they would renounce violence, and now it's a week or 10 days 
later and they haven't renounced violence -- that's got to tell you 
something,'' Giuliani told reporters in Rochester ``The failure of 
the people involved to quickly renounce violence gives you a sense 
that this was a mistake.''

<HEADLINE> Parties in Nazi Case Talk Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- After a series of talks on German  
companies' liability for using Nazi slave labor during World War 
II, negotiators turned today to the topic of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of former slave workers, the German and U.S.  
governments and Jewish groups met in Bonn for a new three-day round 
of talks on how much to compensate an estimated 1 million survivors 
of slave and forced labor camps. They are trying to work out a 
compensation deal with 16 German companies who used the camp 
inmates the Nazis provided. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first session where we're talking about money,''  
U.S. envoy Stuart Eizenstat said during a break in the talks in 
Bonn. ``I think we'll narrow the differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A larger meeting that will also include the governments of  
Israel and eastern European countries was scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from U.S. lawsuits against German companies, the  
government and industry launched the idea of a compensation fund 
for slave workers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The German government had originally hoped to have an agreement  
by Sept. 1 -- the 60th anniversary of the start of World War II. But 
now all sides say that target likely won't be met. 
</P>
<P>
	The German government negotiator, former economics minister Otto  
Lambsdorff, publicly warned lawyers this week that there are limits 
to what German companies are willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Reported demands by attorneys for a $20 billion fund are ``way  
beyond the realm of the serious,'' said a spokesman for the planned 
fund, Wolfgang Gibowski. 
</P>
<P>
	German industry has offered about $1.7 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the survivors' attorneys, Edward Fagan, renewed pressure  
Monday for a wider settlement, including compensation for Jewish 
bank fortunes and insurance assets seized by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan said many Holocaust victims were never compensated for  
such losses even though the German government says the issue was 
settled under postwar restitution laws. He urged German banks to 
open their archives to an independent historian who would 
investigate the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a number of Holocaust survivors announced in New York  
that they are withdrawing from a $1.2 billion settlement in a 
similar case involving Swiss banks. 
</P>
<P>
	They said too much of the settlement money will go to lawyers  
and not enough to survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement with Credit Suisse and UBS AG would entitle  
survivors to as little as $500 and strip them of the right to sue 
again, said Paul Frenkel of the Group for World War II Survivor 
Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get out of the suits, remove our names and preserve  
our claims,'' said Frenkel, whose group represents about 200 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan, the attorney involved in the Swiss suit as well as the

	Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss banks as the Nazis

<HEADLINE> GAO Criticizes Veterans Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs has spent  
$61 million in travel funds on items other than travel since 1993 
and let some top officials approve their own expenses, according to 
a critical congressional report. 
</P>
<P>
	The department didn't report the reprogramming of the funds to  
the Senate Appropriations Committee, which lawmakers had requested. 
</P>
<P>
	However, failure to report the switching of funds to areas such  
as salaries and equipment did not constitute a crime, said the 
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO also criticized the VA travel policy that allowed at  
least five administrators to authorize and approve their own travel 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This lack of internal controls over open travel authorizations  
and delegated travel authority increases the potential for abuse,'' 
the GAO said in the report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1998, one VA official claimed hotel expenses of $260 a  
night, staying in Washington, D.C. The lodging allowance was less 
than half of that, $126 a night, the GAO said. No explanation for 
the increased costs was provided by the official. Another official 
issued a four-month blanket authorization for all staff travel to a 
county where lodging exceeded 200 percent of the allowance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written response, Dennis Duffy, the VA assistant secretary  
for planning and analysis, agreed with the need for monitoring the 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	But he did not agree with the GAO recommendation to change the  
excess budget claims. The VA plans to spend more money on travel in 
the future, due to more community care and hospital-based home 
care. The overestimate is necessary to cushion that increase, Ungar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the VA staff has traveled more over the past three  
years, the gap between requests and actual expenditures has 
narrowed, according to the GAO report. In 1996, the VA request 
exceeded the actual travel by $28 million, in 1997 by $11 million, 
and in 1998 by $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The total excess request from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal  
year 1998 was $61 million, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any reprogramming of funds over $250,000 is required to be  
reported to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Ungar said his 
agency doesn't consider travel expenses a ``major program 
activity'' itself.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Homers To Tie Gehrig Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his 51st homer Tuesday night  
against the Montreal Expos to tie Sammy Sosa for the major league 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's homer, a 435-foot, two-run shot to center with one out  
in the first, also tied Lou Gehrig's major league record of 493 
home runs by a first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	With J.D. Drew on first, McGwire connected on a 2-2 pitch from  
Montreal's Javier Vazquez to draw even with Sosa, who went 
homerless in Chicago's 12-4 loss to San Francisco earlier in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit his 51st homer in the St. Louis Cardinals'  
127th game, is on the same home run pace as last year, when he hit 
70.

<HEADLINE> White House Denies Clinton Coke Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to renewed media interest in past  
drug use by politicians, the White House said Tuesday that 
President Clinton never used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has never done cocaine,'' Jim Kennedy, spokesman  
for the White House counsel's office, told The Washington Times. 
``That applies to his entire life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question arose after Gennifer Flowers, who claimed to have  
had a long-term liaison with Clinton when he was governor of 
Arkansas, alleged in an interview with Fox News Channel on 
Wednesday that Clinton told her he had used the illegal drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said Tuesday that he had not spoken directly with  
Clinton about the question. White House press secretary Joe 
Lockhart backed up Kennedy's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spoken to ... (the president) about these stories,''  
Lockhart said. ``I know the statements by Mr. Kennedy are both 
authorized and accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign has been  
dogged by questions over whether he used drugs when he was a young 
man. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart noted that the question about Clinton first arose  
during the 1992 campaign, when Clinton admitted he had tried 
marijuana but said he didn't inhale. At that time, Clinton's top 
aide in the governor's office denied that Clinton had used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president addressed this issue in the 1992 campaign,''  
Lockhart said. ``It hasn't changed. Mr. Kennedy's remarks are 
accurate.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Said Fired in Davidian Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Contradicting years of denial from the U.S.  
government, a former FBI official says agents fired two pyrotechnic 
tear gas grenades into the Branch Davidian compound the day it 
erupted in a deadly inferno. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Danny Coulson said the devices were fired hours before  
the blaze began on April 19, 1993, and were not to blame for the 
fire that consumed the compound with David Koresh and more than 80 
followers inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fire did not start there. That's a lot of nothing,'' he  
said in today's Dallas Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of whether the FBI used pyrotechnic devices is a major  
focus of an ongoing inquiry by the Texas Rangers and a key 
allegation in a pending federal wrongful-death lawsuit filed 
against the government by surviving Davidians and families of those 
who died. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government consistently has disputed accusations  
that the FBI started the fire. Independent investigators concluded 
the fire began simultaneously in three separate places. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI bugs recorded Davidians discussing spreading fuel and  
planning a fire hours before the compound burned. Arson 
investigators also found evidence that gasoline, charcoal lighter 
fluid and camp stove fuel had been poured inside the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials have maintained the FBI used only  
nonflammable devices to get tear gas into the compound because of 
fears that pyrotechnic grenades might spark a fire in the wooden 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement by Coulson, founding commander of the FBI's  
hostage rescue team and a deputy assistant FBI director at the time 
of the Waco incident, marks the first time any government official 
has publicly contradicted those claims, the News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a spokesman with the U.S. Justice Department again  
denied that any pyrotechnic devices were used. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are aware of no evidence to support the notion that any  
pyrotechnic devices were used by the federal government on April 
19,'' Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin told the newspaper. 
``We've said that all along.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wins Health-Care Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and former top aide  
Ira Magaziner did not act in ``bad faith'' in describing the makeup 
of Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care task force, a federal 
appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled  
Tuesday that the White House should not have to pay $285,864 legal 
bills for a doctors' group that sued to get access to the task 
force's deliberations and the failed effort to devise a national 
health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute concerns the membership and leadership of the 1992  
task force headed by Mrs. Clinton and Magaziner. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth said Magaziner and other  
White House advisers misled the court by insisting the task force 
was composed of only federal employees when it was not. 
</P>
<P>
	Magaziner swore in a 1993 affidavit that ``only federal  
government employees'' were members of a group advising the task 
force. Courts used the description to keep the group's records from 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the appeals court found the district  
court was ``clearly erroneous'' in ruling in favor of three 
nonprofit medical and legal advocacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hold that the district court's findings of bad faith ...  
are without clear and convincing evidentiary support and that the 
attorney's fees award therefore cannot be upheld insofar as it 
rests on bad faith,'' the appeals court ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court sent the case back to Lamberth for  
reconsideration.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Trade Mercker to Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox are getting serious about  
their wild-card stretch run and Kent Mercker is glad that he'll be 
a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox, tied with Oakland for the AL wild-card spot  
entering Tuesday night's games, acquired the left-hander from the 
St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for two minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fortunate early in my career with Atlanta to go to five  
playoffs,'' Mercker said. ``I've missed that atmosphere and I'm 
looking forward to getting back into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mercker is 6-5 with a 5.12 ERA this season in 25 games, 18 of  
them starts. Since July 1, Mercker is 4-2, with a 3.99 ERA. He is 
also 1-0 with a 2.53 ERA in four appearances against American 
League teams this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know (Red Sox manager) Jimy Williams,'' Mercker said. ``He  
was a coach with me for a long time in Atlanta and I always 
respected him as a coach, and I'm looking forward to playing for 
him. I know he's done a lot of good things over there, the guys 
like him and he's got a plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mercker was 11-11 in 1998, leading the team in wins in his first  
season in St. Louis after signing as a free agent. For his career, 
Mercker is 60-58. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved to have been in the playoffs here,''  
Mercker said. ``But I guess if you can't do it where you're at, to 
get a chance to do it somewhere else, to at least get to go to a 
pennant race where every game means something, that's exciting for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mercker will join the Red Sox on Wednesday in Minnesota.  
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette said the addition of  
Mercker should strengthen the team for its stretch drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a versatile pitcher who has the ability to be effective  
as a starter and as a reliever,'' Duquette said. ``He has had 
success throughout his career late in the season and also has 
extensive postseason experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear if Mercker would initially start or relieve. The  
Red Sox are a starter short since placing right-hander Bret 
Saberhagen on the 15-day disabled list Monday with a weak throwing 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	For his career, Mercker is 4-2 with a 3.16 ERA in games in  
September and October, including 3-0 with a 2.70 ERA last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercker pitched in the playoffs during the 1991-1995 seasons as  
a member of the Braves. He is 0-1 with a 2.25 ERA in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Mercker, the Cardinals got left-hander Mike  
Matthews and catcher David Benham. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews, 25, is a career minor leaguer with a lifetime 43-48  
record. He began this season at Buffalo, Cleveland's Triple-A 
affiliate. He was sent to Double-A Akron in June and was traded to 
the Red Sox on Aug. 3, pitching for Double-A Trenton. Overall, he 
is a combined 0-5 with a 7.47 ERA this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Benham, 23, was drafted by the Red Sox in the 12th round last  
June. He is hitting .238 with three homers and 11 RBIs in 33 games 
for Class-A Sarasota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals assigned Matthews to Double-A Arkansas, and Benham  
to Class-A Potomac. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also said that Larry Luebbers will replace Mercker in  
the starting rotation and will pitch Wednesday at Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Season in Full Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The 1999 hurricane season was in full swing  
Tuesday, with three tropical storms swirling in the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical Storm Emily joined Dennis and Cindy, taking forecasters  
by surprise with her strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand what's happening out there, but things are  
popping,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane 
Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning  
Tuesday for the Turks and Caicos Islands and for the southeastern 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical Storm Dennis could threaten the eastern United States  
as early as Friday. At 2 a.m. Wednesday, Dennis was centered about 
75 miles north of the Caicos islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Some strengthening was forecast through Wednesday, and it was  
expected to become a hurricane in the next day or so, according to 
the hurricane center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think Dennis will turn up the east coast and with any luck  
will miss everything, but it will come close enough where we'll 
worry about it,'' Jarrell said. ``In three days it can be on almost 
any of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emily had 65 mph winds, just shy of hurricane strength, but  
those winds slowed down to 45 mph by late Tuesday. Forecasters had 
not even listed the storm as a depression before the tropical storm 
advisory Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, far east in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Cindy  
continued moving across the open ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until this past week, there had only been one tropical storm,  
Arlene, in June. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm carries winds of 39 to 73 mph. A tropical storm  
becomes a hurricane when sustained winds reach 74 mph.

<HEADLINE> Cash-for-Gunds Program Gets Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A program to get guns off the street by buying  
them for $100 apiece -- no questions asked -- is proving so popular 
in the nation's capital that police have increased its size by 125 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first 90 minutes during the second day of the program  
Tuesday, people brought 460 guns into police stations, including 
handguns, sawed-off shotguns and assault rifles, all of them 
illegal in the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Some looked especially menacing, such as a black shotgun brought  
into a station in northwest Washington by a man in his 20s. 
Inscribed on it was the word, ``redrum,'' which spells murder 
backwards. It also said, ``Let's go to the edge. Try to run, get 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That came directly from the street,'' said one officer.  
</P>
<P>
	But most of the guns turned in on Monday and Tuesday did not  
come from thugs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Gilbert, of Silver Spring, Md., was among several  
elderly women who participated in the program. ``I inherited the 
gun. I've got no need for it. I don't want it in my house,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many who turned in guns were from suburban Maryland and  
Virginia. They included one collector who handed over more than two 
dozen guns. Police put no geographical limits on the program, 
saying guns from other areas can easily be used in the district. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are paying for the $225,000 program with money and assets  
collected from drug dealers. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer 
said the department collects about $800,000 in such funds annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Police originally allotted $100,000 for the program but decided  
to add more money to it Monday, when they collected 1,164 guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've struggled to get guns in the traditional way,'' Gainer  
said. ``On our best day we get about seven guns'' through normal 
police procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Gainer said the collected would be test-fired to see if they can  
be linked to any crimes in the district. If not, they will be 
destroyed, he said.

<HEADLINE> Greene Chases Rare Sprint Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Jealousy of the attention received by  
Marion Jones and Michael Johnson for being multiple-event athletes 
made Maurice Greene a serious contender for a sprint double at the 
World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the two-time world champion at 100 meters is trying to  
accomplish something not done by a male sprinter since Carl Lewis 
won the 100 and 200 at the 1984 Olympics -- sweep the dashes at a 
major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be a complete sprinter is every sprinter's goal,'' Greene  
said before beginning his bid today for the 200 title at the World 
Championships. ``You can't just run the 100, you have to run 
both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just like Jones does and Lewis did, and if not the two short  
sprints, then the two long sprints, like Johnson does. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene's financial adviser, Emmanuel Hudson, said he and coach  
John Smith had to talk the 100-meter world record-holder into 
running the 200 this year at the USA Championships, the qualifying 
meet for the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene had set the 100 record of 9.79 seconds at Athens, Greece,  
10 days before the national championships and wasn't interested in 
running the 200. That would have meant he wouldn't have competed in 
the nationals because he automatically was qualified for the worlds 
as the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not doing this,'' Greene said.  
</P>
<P>
	However, when told that Johnson would be running the 200 instead  
of the 400, Greene's interest was piqued. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told him the way the public perceives you doesn't count  
unless you cross categories -- like Johnson,'' Hudson said. ``We 
told him he was the world champion in the 100. We said you're 
dominating in the 100. Now, you've got to get the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael's been the man in the 400 for 10 years. When he did  
both (winning the 200 and 400 at the 1996 Olympics), `boom!' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, they're talking about Marion Jones and how she's going  
for four gold medals (in the 100, 200, long jump and relay at the 
World Championships).'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, Johnson, the world record-holder, withdrew  
from the 200 at the nationals because of injury, and Greene won the 
title, giving him the opportunity for the rare sprint double at a 
major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	His chances have improved immensely with the absences of  
Johnson, injured training partner Ato Boldon of Trinidad and 
Tobago, the 1997 world champion, and possibly Frankie Fredericks of 
Namibia, the leader in career sub-20-second clockings with 24, four 
ahead of Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Fredericks, also the career leader in legal sub-10-second times  
with 26, one more than Greene, withdrew from the semifinals of the 
100 with a thigh injury, and his status for the 200 is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 200, he (Greene) is getting more convinced,'' Hudson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The imperturbable Greene looks at the 200 as another challenge,  
something he thrives on. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a real competitor -- with everything,'' Hudson said. ``It  
can be swimming across a pool, video games, dominoes, cards ... 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a challenge, he's competitive. There's no fun for  
him (Greene) unless he can be challenged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The male sprinters also challenge each other on things like who  
has the fastest 100-200 double for a career, for the year, for a 
meet and on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene's competitiveness will work in his favor in the 200. He  
won't let the emotional high of winning his second straight world 
title in the 100 Sunday night in 9.80, only .01 seconds off his 
world record, affect his bid for his first major international 
championship in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take a lot to get him motivated,'' Hudson said.  
``On the day of a meet, you don't have to say anything to him. Just 
tell Maurice there's a race and he goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is not taking any chances.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you win a race like this (the 100), there's the chance  
you can have an emotional letdown,'' he said. ``We have to make 
sure he's ready to run the first and second rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, enjoying the best year ever by a male 100-meter runner,  
with the world record and nine sub-10.00 clockings, probably would 
have broken the 100 record again if he hadn't stumbled out of the 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a goal of 9.76,'' he said. ``The start wasn't as good as  
I wanted. The little problem I had at the beginning was the world 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't run the perfect race. If I do, then we'll see what  
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene is not putting limits on his potential.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say I'm only going to run one (particular)  
time, because if I run it, they'll think that's as fast as I can 
run,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bret Remnants Soak Southern Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAREDO, Texas (AP) -- The remnants of Hurricane Bret sloshed  
across southern Texas and northern Mexico today, soaking the region 
with nearly a foot of rain after sending about 3,500 people to 
higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Flash flood warnings were in effect along the Rio Grande from  
Laredo upstream to Del Rio and about 40 miles east, as well as the 
San Antonio area. 
</P>
<P>
	Laredo, which had braced for serious flooding, appeared to be  
largely spared although nearly 200 homes in low-lying areas were 
flooded with as much as 2 feet of water. Authorities were still 
concerned that the Rio Grande might rise because of rainfall 
upstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The most powerful hurricane to strike Texas in 20 years unwound  
from 140 mph wind off shore Sunday to 40 mph after it moved over 
land Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy rain was blamed for a traffic accident that killed  
four people Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But they were the only deaths reported from the storm that  
crossed the coast on Sunday evening midway between Corpus Christi 
(population 300,000) and Brownsville (132,000). Bret blew into the 
cattle country of Kenedy County, where cows outnumber people 60,000 
to 458 and where damage was relatively light. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might call it the great escape. I think the city of Corpus  
Christi is very fortunate,'' Mayor Loyd Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just southwest of Corpus Christi, a few dozen residents of the  
farm town of Driscoll huddled in a church as runoff from creeks and 
fields filled streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever someone drives up the driveway, waves hit the door,''  
Mary Sappington, 18, said today as the water began to level off 
near her grandmother's home. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service said today that the storm could  
produce an additional 5 to 10 inches of rain along the Rio Grande 
watershed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rio Grande city of Eagle Pass had street flooding today and  
eight low-lying, rural roads were closed by water, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Water and water and water,'' said Maverick County Judge Rocky  
Escobedo. ``If we need to move and evacuate people, we're ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Del Rio, devastated one year ago today by flooding from Tropical  
Storm Charley, reported only light rain this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	However, said police spokeswoman Maribel Perez, ``Everybody's  
worried and calling in this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 7 inches of rain and wind gusting to 40 mph were reported  
at El Indio, about 20 miles south of Eagle Pass. At San Antonio, 
nearly an inch of rain fell in an hour early today. 
</P>
<P>
	In Laredo, the anticipated heavy rainfall never materialized.  
``The only thing we're concerned with now is the amount of rain 
they're getting north of us,'' Chris Niles of the Laredo Fire 
Department said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The three bridges linking the city to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, were  
reopened today. Laredo International Airport also reported normal 
operations today after equipment problems slowed traffic Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,500 people on both sides of the Rio Grande had left  
their homes for higher ground Monday as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Janie Mena and 11 family members took refuge in the Laredo Civic  
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in a mobile home and since the wind was blowing pretty  
hard we came,'' the 17-year-old said. ``I wish other people would 
do it, too, because you never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Closer to the coast, damage was substantial in Falfurrias, a  
town of 5,800 about 60 miles southwest of Corpus Christi, Mayor 
Michael Guerra said. The wind ripped roofs from homes and 
businesses and up to 90 percent of the town had no electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Major damage also was reported in Port Mansfield, about 50 miles  
north of Brownsville, especially to mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado that was spun off by Bret between Rockport and Aransas  
Pass destroyed a mobile home and damaged several other buildings.

<HEADLINE> New WTO Chief Makes Plea for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Mike Moore, who becomes leader of  
the World Trade Organization next month, said Tuesday that smaller 
and poorer members must be given a greater role in promoting free 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Moore said he has  
asked wealthy member countries to contribute to a special budget 
for the world's poorest nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move would allow them to fully participate in  
negotiations in Geneva, where the WTO is based, and in ministerial 
meetings, such as the sessions in November in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are countries which feel they've been locked out ... and  
they're right,'' said Moore. ``I want to be their champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, 50, a former prime minister of New Zealand, is the first  
non-European to fill the world's top trade job. 
</P>
<P>
	He will replace Italy's Renato Ruggiero, who stood down at the  
end of April after his four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	In a decision ending extended debate within the 134-nation WTO  
over rival candidates, Moore will hold the job as director-general 
for three years to be followed by Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's 
vice prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said he was working on a budget to aid WTO participation  
by poorer nations and that some of the funds would come from the 
WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that some 30 nations need special help, saying some  
``can't even afford to have a representative in Geneva.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While I'm unbiased, as I must be, the poorer, the smaller  
economies need to have a down payment,'' he said. ``They need to 
get results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 30, WTO ministers begin meeting in Seattle, Washington,  
for talks aimed at rolling back trade barriers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore acknowledged that WTO officials haven't yet finished  
putting together the agenda for the meeting, which requires 
whittling down more than 80 proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	He said agriculture and service industries are two areas that  
will be discussed but did not reveal others. 
</P>
<P>
	European Union states reportedly want to discuss 16 areas of  
world trade. Asian and Pacific groups have pressed for a shorter 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The last WTO talks, known as the Uruguay round, lasted seven  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``About the only thing we agree on is this round must be shorter  
than Uruguay,'' Moore said. ``Some are even saying three years is 
too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Key issues for the Seattle talks include the implementation of  
major agreements from the Uruguay Round. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about China's efforts to become a member of the  
organization, Moore said it would be a ``splendid achievement'' if 
that was accomplished in the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether labor standards could be an issue at the Seattle  
round, Moore would say only that the WTO would work more closely 
with the International Labor Organization and other international 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would like up to five deputy director-generals  
to form a cabinet-style management team for the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Catnip Said To Repel Cockroaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The stuff that puts the nip in catnip is a  
turnoff for cockroaches. 
</P>
<P>
	One form of the chemical in catnip repels cockroaches 100 times  
better than DEET, the basis for commercial bug repellents, Iowa 
State University scientists told a meeting of the American Chemical 
Society on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Peterson and Joel Coats said they began studying catnip a  
few years ago when a summer intern told them it was resistant to 
insects. The pair boiled catnip leaves and distilled the active 
ingredient, a chemical called nepetalactone. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson also has found roach-repellant compounds in an inedible  
softball-sized fruit called the osage orange or hedgeapple, but 
doesn't know which specific chemical creates the roaches' ``yuck'' 
response. 
</P>
<P>
	The osage orange is sometimes sold in groceries because of folk  
wisdom that putting the fruit in cupboards or basements will repel 
just about any bug, they said. The fruits are filled with a sticky 
substance that turns rubbery when exposed to air, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery could lead to new nontoxic methods for curbing the  
tenacious insects, which are more than just an annoyance around the 
house. The rate of asthma among children, particularly in cities, 
is rising. Scientists say the reason is an allergic reaction to 
roach excrement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been chasing cockroach treatments for three years,'' Dr.  
Peyton Eggleston, a pediatrics professor at Johns Hopkins 
University Children's Center, told The (Baltimore) Sun. ``If you 
could do it with a repellent, that would be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers tested repellent power by flooring a cage with  
treated and untreated filter paper, and measuring how much time the 
roach spends on each side during a five-minute test. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most people would prefer to kill roaches outright, a  
repellent might be an effective way to keep them out of the house 
after the exterminators have left. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, they have only studied the small brown German  
cockroaches, rather than their thumb-sized American cousins. They 
are just beginning to look at mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Roaches have sense organs on their antennae, feet and mouths.  
The ``feelers'' seem to be the spot affected by both catnip and 
osage oranges, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	They have not tested the effectiveness of spreading catnip  
leaves around the house. While it might help turn away a swarm of 
cockroaches, it could lead to a new infestation -- writhing, 
blissed-out cats.

<HEADLINE> Frozen Plants Tested for Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers are planning to test some 30,000  
frozen plant and animal tissue samples this week to make sure they 
were not damaged by a weekend power failure at Chicago's Field 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	As thousands of frustrated visitors were turned away from the  
museum Sunday morning because of the blackout, lab workers and 
scientists inside scrambled to save the collection of samples, 
considered one of the world's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad for us that the museum couldn't open, but I had no  
thought of that,'' said John Bates, assistant curator of birds at 
the Field Museum. ``My only thought was to safeguard the tissue 
collection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bates rushed from his suburban home Sunday morning to help staff  
pack the specimens in about 500 pounds of dry ice. Museum officials 
said the collection appeared to have escaped harm in the outage, 
but researchers planned to run tests this week to check for damage 
and also would be looking into ways to protect the collection in 
future outages. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection, which Field Museum researchers have been  
gathering for about a quarter century, is used by scientists from 
around the world for DNA research. 
</P>
<P>
	If the samples had thawed and spoiled, Bates said it would have  
meant ``an irreparable loss'' to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Many samples, such as rare ferns from New Zealand and fruit  
flies from Madagascar, would be almost impossible to duplicate 
because they were gathered during expensive expeditions, said 
Kathleen Pryer, a botanical curator at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can never get these teams of people together again to go  
get these samples,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's power failure happened on what should have been one of  
the Field Museum's busiest days, with officials expecting about 
8,000 visitors. It also affected the nearby Shedd Aquarium, which 
used an auxiliary generator, and part of a building at a small 
lakefront airport. 
</P>
<P>
	It was blamed on a failed Commonwealth Edison transformer that  
lacked a replacement unit. Power was restored to the museum shortly 
before midnight. The blackout was the most recent of a series of 
outages that have plagued the Chicago area this summer and have 
caused ComEd to be widely criticized.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Prints Unabomber's Parable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Still writing furiously, even behind bars,  
the Unabomber has completed a parable about the ills of modern 
society that will be printed next month in a magazine published by 
students at the State University of New York at Binghamton. 
</P>
<P>
	The story, ``Ship of Fools,'' describes a boat's passengers who  
spend their time griping about personal injustices instead of 
taking over the vessel from an insane crew. The boat crashes into 
two icebergs and everyone dies. 
</P>
<P>
	Theodore Kaczynski, whose other writings include the rambling,  
35,000-word Unabomber manifesto and a 368-page memoir due out this 
fall, wrote the story at the request of Tim LaPietra, a 21-year-old 
senior and publisher of Off! magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPietra called the story ``a mockery of the left and how it  
operates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What I get from it is that he's saying, `People who are  
leftist shouldn't waste their time with what he calls reform, such 
as equal wages and equal treatment for women,''' LaPietra said. 
``The main issue is we have to stop the industrial machine before 
it takes away all of our humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski carried out a 17-year bombing campaign against the  
industrial order that killed three people and injured 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI captured him in 1996 after his brother, David, noticed  
similarities between Kaczynski's writings and the Unabomber 
manifesto published in The Washington Post and The New York Times. 
He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison without 
parole in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Kaczynski last fall, LaPietra asked him to  
contribute an article for the twice-yearly magazine, which is aimed 
at college activists and prison inmates. The Unabomber responded 
with the hand-written parable several months later. 
</P>
<P>
	The story has been posted on the Web site of Context Books  
(www.contextbooks.com).

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A memorial fund for actor William Shatner's  
wife will help a nonprofit home for women recovering from 
alcoholism and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner, best known as Capt. James Kirk in TV's ``Star Trek,''  
found his wife Nerine in the swimming pool of his Studio City home 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Police termed her death an accidental drowning. Autopsy results

</P>
<P>
	``I want to make her tragic death meaningful,'' Shatner said in  
a statement Tuesday. ``She brought youth, inspiration and passion 
to everything. She wanted to work with women whose disease was 
something she fought herself for many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donations to the Nerine Shatner Memorial Fund will help the

<HEADLINE> Selig: Rose May Go to World Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Picture this: Pete Rose on the field before the  
World Series opener. 
</P>
<P>
	For a decade, it's been a dream. Now it might happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Exactly 10 years after Rose was kicked out of baseball for life,  
commissioner Bud Selig said Monday that if Rose is elected to the 
All-Century team, the sport's career hits leader would be invited 
to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was snubbed by baseball last month when the living players  
among the 100 on the All-Century ballot participated in a memorable 
on-field ceremony before the All-Star game. Rose wasn't asked to a 
pregame luncheon with the others on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever is elected to that team will be invited to the World  
Series,'' Selig said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans vote for 25 players, and the 30-man All-Century team,  
including five additions selected by a media panel, will be 
announced before the World Series opener Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine outfielders will make the team, and Rose was ninth in the  
latest vote totals, which were released last week. Stan Musial and 
Roberto Clemente were close behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Updated totals were to be announced today.  
</P>
<P>
	Selig said he hadn't reversed his position on allowing Rose's  
participation and said the decision to invite Rose if he's elected 
doesn't affect his status as a banned player. At the All-Star game, 
98 of the 100 players on the ballot were honored with banners 
hanging at Fenway Park -- Rose and Shoeless Joe Jackson, banned as a 
result of the Chicago Black Sox scandal in 1919 -- were exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a result of an election, and I felt that in terms of  
what baseball does, those people who are elected ought to be asked 
to come,'' Selig said. ``But does it change his status or anything 
else? The answer is no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said last week that he had heard rumors he might be invited  
if he's elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's good news for me to hear, that he's OK with me being  
part of the All-Century team,'' Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then manager of the Cincinnati Reds, Rose signed an agreement  
accepting a lifetime ban on Aug. 23, 1989. While the agreement made 
no official finding, commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti said at a 
news conference the following day that he concluded Rose had bet on 
Reds games. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement, Rose may not work with major league  
teams or their minor league affiliates. He also may not be in any 
part of any ballpark or training complex that is not open to fans 
with tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, 58, applied for reinstatement in September 1997. While  
Selig hasn't ruled, he also has said he sees no reason to change 
the lifetime ban, one of just 15 ever issued by the commissioner of 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is ineligible for the Hall of Fame as long as he's banned  
for life. No person ever permanently banned has ever been 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that in our society, 99 out of 100 guys are given  
another opportunity,'' Rose said. ``I'm the one out of 100 that's 
not being given another opportunity, which is mind-boggling to 
me.''

	Fed Raises Interest Rates  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve today raised interest  
rates 0.25 percentage points, the second bump in eight weeks, in an 
effort to cool the economy by making it more expensive for 
Americans to borrow. The central bank's monetary-policy panel voted 
to raise the key federal funds rate from 5.00 to 5.25 percent. But 
the Fed's Open Market Committee retained a cautious approach to 
rate increases and said it was not inclined to raise rates again in 
the next two months.

earthquake jumped by one-third today to 18,000 and officials 
broadcast appeals for everything from tents to bulldozers to help 
survivors rebuild their lives. More medical worries also emerged. 
Health workers warned that potential killers such as typhoid fever, 
cholera and dysentery could flare at any time in squalid 
encampments of those left homeless by the massive quake. Doctors 
quarantined a Turkish soldier who has typhoid fever, a potentially 
deadly infection spread through contaminated food and water.

brutal murder, has agreed to plead guilty to the killing of Alfred 
Tello, Jr. Sheinbein will be sentenced to 24 years in an Israeli 
prison when he enters a plea in a Tel Aviv court on Sept. 2. Last 
month, Sheinbein pleaded not guilty to killing Tello, an 
acquaintance, in Sept. 1997. Tello's burned and dismembered body 
was found in an empty garage near Sheinbein's home in Aspen Hill, 
Md., on Sept. 18, 1997. Sheinbein fled to Israel several days 
later, and claimed citizenship through his Israeli-born father.

	Seattle, San Fran Named Kids' Best  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A new survey indicates the best big U.S.  
cities in which to raise children are located on the West Coast. 
The group Zero Population Growth ranks Seattle, San Francisco and 
San Jose, Calif., at the top of the list of large cities that 
provide the best quality of life for children. The study measures 
seven categories such as education, health, and public safety. The 
group says the study suggests three key elements -- poverty, teen 
pregnancy and urban sprawl -- have the biggest impacts on kids' 
quality of life. St. Louis, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., are 
ranked among the worst places to raise a kid.

	U.S. Denies Killing Iraq Civilians  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- The U.S. military denied today attacking  
civilian sites in Iraq, saying the Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery 
which fired at U.S. planes also killed two Iraqi civilians. Iraqi 
officials claim American and British planes killed two people in an 
attack on the town of Ba'shequa, 280 miles north of Baghdad. 
``Saddam Hussein is killing his own people by firing at us,'' a 
U.S. military spokesman said. British and U.S. planes at Incirlik 
patrol the skies over northern Iraq to protect the Kurdish minority 
from Iraqi forces. Another no-fly zone over southern Iraq protects 
a Shiite minority there.

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Free agent point guard Terrell Brandon

to pursue the ministry, has decided to join the Miami Dolphins 
after meeting with coach Jimmy Johnson. Underwood will report to

disappeared from training camp and said he wasn't sure he wanted to 
play football.

<HEADLINE> Space Shuttle Schedule in Disarray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Dates for the next three space  
shuttle missions are up in the air because of time-consuming 
electrical safety checks on each of the space planes, NASA 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers here are finishing inspections on Endeavour and NASA  
expects to set a new launch date next week for the radar topography 
mission that was planned for Oct. 7, said James Hartsfield, a 
spokesman at Johnson Space Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible that Discovery, which was supposed to launch Oct.  
14 on a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission, will fly first in 
late October or November, Hartsfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantis cannot be readied in time for its scheduled Dec. 2  
mission to the International Space Station. Atlantis will not be 
launched until mid-January at the earliest because unfavorable sun 
angles on the station could overheat the docking mechanism, 
Hartsfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Russia seems on track for launching the long-delayed  
service module to the station Nov. 12, Hartsfield said, pending a 
general design review at the end of September.

<TEXT>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Bengals will finally get to see their No. 1 draft  
pick in action. 
</P>
<P>
	Akili Smith, a rookie quarterback from Oregon, agreed to a  
seven-year contract on Monday, ending an impasse that caused him to 
miss most of training camp and two exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, chosen third overall behind quarterbacks Tim Couch and  
Donovan McNabb, was the last unsigned member of the celebrated 
quarterback class of '99. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-year deal includes a $10.8 million signing bonus and  
will pay Smith, expected to be Jeff Blake's backup, as much as $56 
million if he reaches various performance goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal contains one voidable year, meaning it will  
automatically shorten to six years if he's in for 35 percent of the 
plays in his first year or 45 percent any following year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contracts are so statistical, especially for quarterbacks, and  
have a level of complexity that it simply takes time to work 
through,'' agent Leigh Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement ends the longest impasse between the Bengals and a  
quarterback since David Klingler signed one week before the season 
opener in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been nicer if it had been sooner,'' general  
manager Mike Brown said. ``It's behind us now. We've just got to 
catch up as best we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            *Buccaneers    	
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackle Warren Sapp, sidelined the past week by a sore  
back, had an MRI examination to determine the extent of his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buccaneers said the result would not be known until today  
after the test is read by the team's orthopedic specialist, Dr. 
John Zvijac, in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Pro Bowler last practiced on Aug. 17. The Bucs also  
held him out of last Saturday night's exhibition against Kansas 
City as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Steve McNair will be on the sidelines Friday night  
when Tennessee plays its first game in its new home stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair has not played or practiced since the Titans' first  
exhibition game Aug. 15 at Kansas City because of spasms and 
stiffness in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup Neil O'Donnell, 21-of-34 for 166 yards in two games, will  
make his second start of the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
                            *Cardinals    	
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Jake Plummer's sprained right thumb will keep him  
out of Arizona's preseason game Saturday at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer was injured on the third play of Friday night's game  
against Tennessee when he was sacked by Mike Jones. Plummer was to 
be examined by a hand specialist to make sure the injury isn't more 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer expects to be ready for the season opener at  
Philadelphia on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Cowboys    	
</P>
<P>
	Running back Chris Warren, who left training camp early last  
week after asking permission to visit a groin specialist he's been 
working with in Colorado, was supposed to back a few days later. A 
schedule change allowed him to be out until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But a morning meeting and afternoon practice passed without  
Warren arriving. He was expected back late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Chan Gailey's face and the tone of his voice when  
discussing the matter made it obvious this wasn't an excused 
absence. He answered four straight questions by saying, ``I'll talk 
to him tonight when he gets here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren's agent, Rick Schaeffer, said the whole thing is a simple  
misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie defensive end Dimitrius Underwood, wavering between his  
faith and an NFL career, planned to meet today with coach Jimmy 
Johnson to discuss his future. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unlikely Underwood will play this season, said his agent,  
Craig Domann. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota made Underwood a first-round draft choice, but he left  
their training camp after one practice, saying he was struggling to 
balance football and his religious beliefs. The Vikings released 
Underwood, and he was claimed off waivers last week by the 
Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Steelers    	
</P>
<P>
	All-Pro center Dermontti Dawson returned from a three-week  
injury layoff and running back Jerome Bettis may not be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis, who said last week he wasn't 100 percent certain if he  
would be ready to start the Sept. 12 opener in Cleveland, discarded 
his left knee brace to take part in running drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson and Bettis injured their left knees only two days apart  
shortly after the Steelers opened camp July 29, and neither 
practiced until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Cowher said Bettis might resume full-scale practicing  
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Panthers    	
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in as many days, Tshimanga Biakabutuka was  
unable to get through a practice because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury kept Biakabutuka from finishing the morning's nearly  
two-hour practice, but he said it was nothing more than a bruise. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest problems involve the same knee Biakabutuka injured  
shortly after the Panthers made the running back their top draft 
choice in 1996. A torn left anterior cruciate ligament four games 
into his rookie year required season-ending surgery. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Halfback Gary Brown, who led New York in rushing with 1,063  
yards last season, practiced for the first time since training camp 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was sidelined with a buttocks injury suffered in a  
motorcycle accident in late June. Coach Jim Fassel hopes to play 
Brown in Saturday night's exhibition against the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	First-round draft pick Luke Petitgout is being moved into the  
starting lineup and right tackle Scott Gragg might be the odd man. 
</P>
<P>
	With Petitgout moving to tackle, Fassel moved Mike Rosenthal,  
the fifth-round draft choice, to guard. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	Kick returner Vaughn Hebron was placed on the reserved-retired  
list by Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebron, a member of Denver's Super Bowl championship teams the  
past two years, was signed by the Colts a week ago. He returned two 
kickoffs for 45 yards in Saturday's 37-7 exhibition victory at New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Lions    	
</P>
<P>
	Center Mike Compton injured his knee in practice on Monday when  
a teammate fell on the back of his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of the injury was not immediately known. Compton, 28,  
a seventh-year player, was taken to Henry Ford Hospital for tests.

<HEADLINE> Gebrselassie Wins 10,000 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Haile Gebrselassie won the 10,000 meters  
world championships for the fourth time in a row today, defeating 
his main rival Paul Tergat of Kenya and fellow Ethiopian Assefa 
Mezgebu. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie's victory underlined his dominance of the  
long-distance events and he won in a time of 27 minutes, 57.27 
seconds. Tergat was second, 1.29 seconds behind the winner and 
Mezgebu had a time of 27:59.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie defended his world title even though it was only  
his first race over the distance this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie has set a whopping 15 world records, owns the 5,000  
and 10,000 marks, is a multiple world champion and the reigning 
10,000 Olympic champion. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to defend his title in the 2000 Sydney Games  
before moving on to the Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	He set his 10,000 world record of 26:22.75 last year. In the  
sweltering heat of the Olympic Stadium and because of the lack of 
pacesetters, he never got close here. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading group was still bunched tighly together with 2,000  
meters to go, with Kenyans trying to throw Gebrselassie off the 
pace. The Ethiopian was happy to stay in second position but moved 
up with 500 meters to go. Nobody could match his pace.

<HEADLINE> Akili Smith Has Stormy Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GEORGETOWN, Ky. (AP) -- A storm rolled in minutes after Akili  
Smith stepped on the practice field for the first time as a 
Cincinnati Bengals quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Was it an omen for a team that hasn't had a winning record since  
1990? The Bengals hope so. 
</P>
<P>
	They made their quarterback of the future part of their present  
on Tuesday. The first-round draft pick flew into Cincinnati from 
the West Coast, signed his contract and then made the trek to 
training camp for his first practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he could even loosen up, a storm moved in and the team  
had to head for cover as lightning flashed overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Akili Smith signs and lightning comes,'' offensive tackle  
Willie Anderson said as he walked off the field. ``That's how 
strong the man is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was merely a soaked man when practice finished. A  
drought-stricken area that hadn't had any afternoon storms in 23 
days got one of those downpours it desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what that was all about,'' the quarterback from  
Oregon said. ``I thought I got rid of the rain when I left Oregon. 
It followed me. But everybody was saying they need it here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith got to throw a few passes in the rain, but was mainly a  
spectator as starter Jeff Blake ran the offense. It's going to be 
that way for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Smith signed his seven-year deal that could pay him  
as much as $54 million if he reaches all of his incentives, the 
Bengals were looking at him as a prodigy in need of tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
	When they took him with the third overall pick in the draft last  
April, the Bengals envisioned him as a backup for one year to 
Blake, who is in the final season of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	There's some question now whether Smith can handle the No. 2  
job. He missed most of training camp and the first two preseason 
games, leaving him way behind. 
</P>
<P>
	It showed in practice Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a guy who missed 27 practices and he's behind, but we'll  
catch him up,'' coach Bruce Coslet said. ``Let's not push him too 
quick. Let's see him practice a few times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ideally, Smith would have attended all of training camp and been  
ready to step in if Blake got hurt early in the season. Instead, 
Smith needs a lot of practice time, and that will be harder to come 
by now that the Bengals are giving the starters more time to get 
ready for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get our team ready, not just one guy,'' Coslet  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith knows it.  
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts a lot because I'm a rookie coming into the game,  
getting the speed of the game down pat and getting familiar with 
the offense,'' he said. ``It's definitely going to hurt me a lot, 
but I'm still optimistic about this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first day was tough. When agent Leigh Steinberg called him  
in San Diego on Monday evening and told him he'd reached a contract 
agreement, Smith packed quickly and caught an overnight flight to 
Cincinnati, sleeping for only about an hour on the plane. He got 
another hour of sleep before heading off to sign his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith arrived in Georgetown a few minutes before the afternoon  
practice, put on an orange No. 11 jersey and headed for the field, 
only to have to turn back five minutes later because of the 
incoming storm. 
</P>
<P>
	After a half-hour delay, the Bengals went back out and the rains  
came. 
</P>
<P>
	When the workout ended, Smith still wasn't sure where he was  
staying. All he knew was that he had supper and a team meeting to 
go to. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a lot going on, just being mentally exhausted with the  
flight and the lack of sleep and the time change,'' Smith said. 
``I'm going to get some rest.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Raises Interest Rates 0.25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve today raised interest  
rates by a quarter point in an effort to cool the economy by making 
it more expensive for Americans to borrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed said it was increasing its target for the federal funds  
rates -- the interest banks charge each other on overnight loans -- 
to 5.25 percent from 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the second time this summer that the Fed has raised  
this rate. It boosted the funds rate from 4.75 percent to 5 percent 
on June 30, the first increase in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	To drive home its efforts to fight inflation, the Fed also  
raised the discount rate, the interest that it charges for direct 
loans to banks, by a quarter of a point as well. The discount rate 
was increased to 4.75 percent, the first increase in the discount 
since Feb. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are taking out an insurance policy on inflation,'' said  
economist Clifford Waldman of the economic consulting firm, Waldman 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices gyrated after the Fed announcement, with the Dow  
Jones industrial average closing down just 16.46 points at 
11,283.30 after bouncing both higher and lower through the late 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's rate increases were expected to be followed quickly by  
announcements from commercial banks that they were boosting their 
prime lending rate by a similar quarter point, from the current 8 
percent to 8.25 percent. The prime rate is a key benchmark for 
millions of loans, from home mortgages and credit cards to 
short-term loans for small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the Fed said that its actions today and the June  
30 rate increase should ``markedly diminish the risk of rising 
inflation going forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accordingly, the central bank said it was keeping its policy  
directive, which signals possible future actions, on neutral. It 
had switched to a neutral directive following its June 30 rate 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists viewed the Fed's decision to stay with the  
neutral policy directive and the central bank's statement that its 
action should ``markedly diminish'' an outbreak of inflation down 
the road as a signal that there may not be further rake hikes this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That statement supports market expectations that today's move  
could be the Fed's last for some time,'' said Merrill Lynch's chief 
economist Bruce Steinberg. ``We concur with that outlook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Kasriel, chief economist with Northern Trust Co., was  
more guarded. ``I don't think you can exactly rule out that they 
won't tighten on Oct. 5. They don't know today whether they are 
going to do that. It will depend on economic data in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed actions came after a closed-door meeting today by the  
Federal Open Market Committee, Fed governors and bank presidents 
who meet eight times a year to set interest rate policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Martin Bailey, chairman  
of the Council of Economic Advisers, appeared to support the Fed's 
actions, saying in a joint statement that they ``share the Federal 
Reserve's goals of maintaining healthy economic growth, while 
preserving low inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the economy has slowed in recent months, it is still  
expected to grow almost 4 percent this year, a brisk pace that has 
pushed unemployment down to its lowest level in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	While that's good news for workers, it is worrisome to the Fed,  
which is concerned that employers foraging for workers are wooing 
them with higher wages and benefits -- something that could drive up 
prices and spark inflation down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts see the Fed's goal this year as taking away some  
of the stimulus it provided last fall when it cut interest rates 
three times to counter a growing threat that the Asian financial 
crisis could topple the United States into recession. Now those 
Asian economies are slowly on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
	``With financial markets functioning more normally and with  
persistent strength in domestic demand, foreign economies firming 
and labor markets remaining very tight, the degree of monetary ease 
required to address the global financial market turmoil of last 
fall is no longer consistent with sustained, non-inflationary 
economic expansion,'' the Fed said in a statement explaining 
today's policy actions. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Fed raised rates in June it also switched it policy  
directive from one leaning toward a rate increase to neutral. That 
caused the financial markets to rally, boosting stock prices and 
pushing long-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan tried to  
correct the situation by sounding more hawkish in an appearance 
before Congress, pledging to move ``promptly and forcefully'' to 
counter inflation. Those remarks were taken as strongly signaling 
an August rate increase.

<HEADLINE> Underwood To Join Dolphins on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Barring another change of heart, rookie defensive  
end Dimitrius Underwood has decided to play this season for the 
Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, who walked out on the Minnesota Vikings to pursue his  
faith, met for about an hour Tuesday with Dolphins coach Jimmy 
Johnson and agreed to report for practice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to be with the Dolphins,'' Johnson said. ``I am happy  
he decided to play, because you can never have too many talented 
players, and obviously he is a talented player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, the 29th player taken in the first round of the April  
draft, was claimed off waivers by the Dolphins last week after the 
Vikings released him Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will try to do everything I can to contribute in any way  
possible,'' Underwood said in a statement. ``I am looking forward 
to being with the team in a few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It should be noted, however, that Underwood has changed his mind  
about whether to play football at least four times this month. As 
recently as Monday his agent, Craig Domann, said the most likely 
scenario was that Underwood would never play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hopeful the decision he has made today is one he's 100  
percent committed about, and he'll follow through,'' Domann said. 
``He's trying to make decisions that are going to make things right 
for him and the team. I don't think he would have told coach 
Johnson he would show up if he didn't intend to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, 22, left the Vikings unannounced after just one  
practice, saying he was struggling to balance football and his 
religious beliefs. He sacrificed a $1.75 million signing bonus, 
part of his five-year, $5.3 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins will owe him no signing bonus and a base salary of  
just $395,000, but money likely was a motivating factor in his 
decision to return to football. Since leaving the Vikings, he has 
been helping to care for his 16-month-old twin children in East 
Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him to go back and take care of his business, go get  
his clothes and get packed,'' Johnson said. ``He'll be back this 
weekend, and we'll start practicing him Monday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood is unlikely to play much this season. His conditioning  
is questionable because he sat out last season at Michigan State 
with a sprained ankle, and the Dolphins don't need to rush him into 
the lineup because of their depth in the defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him there were really no expectations as far as what is  
going to happen this year,'' Johnson said. ``With the right kind of 
work ethic, he could become a very good player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins rated Underwood as the best defensive end in the  
draft. They have five veterans at the position -- Jason Taylor, 
Trace Armstrong, Rich Owens, Kenny Mixon and Lorenzo Bromell -- and 
it's now likely that one of them won't make the final roster.

<HEADLINE>  Turkey Death Toll Climbs Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Turkish officials broadcast appeals  
today for everything from tents to bulldozers to help begin 
rebuilding shattered lives after last week's earthquake left some 
18,000 dead and 200,000 homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, more immediate medical worries began to emerge. Israeli  
doctors quarantined a 21-year-old Turkish soldier suffering from 
typhoid fever, an acute infection spread by food and water 
contaminated by someone suffering from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims suffer from severe dehydration that can lead to fatal  
complications without access to antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	No other cases have been reported, but some health workers have  
warned that potential killers such as typhoid fever, cholera and 
dysentery could flare at any time in the squalid encampments. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the epidemic diseases,'' said Dr. Aharon  
Finestone, a member of the Israeli medical team in Adapazari, 60 
miles southeast of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	A World Health Organization official, Dr. Michel Thieren, said  
typhoid fever is present in the Mediterranean region but there was 
``no risk'' of cholera because it ``is not prevalent in Turkey at 
the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A medical emergency could significantly escalate pressure on the  
embattled government, whose health minister has said foreign 
doctors and supplies are not needed. Some newspapers have demanded 
the resignation of the minister, Osman Durmus, and some foreign 
health workers have complained that no contagious disease center 
has been established. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, many foreign rescue teams started leaving a week  
after the 7.4 quake struck western Turkey. State television 
reported today that at least 17,997 people have been confirmed 
killed. Some officials estimated the final death toll could reach 
40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, the end of searches was hard to accept.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are three or four people alive there,'' a man who would  
give his name only as Mehmet said angrily to a bulldozer driver who 
was tearing into the rubble of an apartment building in Izmit, 90 
miles east of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	Mehmet, 26, insisted his friend Arzu had called her brother  
Sunday night from a cellular phone, saying she and her mother, 
brother and sister were still alive in the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Although dozens of people reportedly used cellular phones to  
call for help from under the rubble in the early days after the 
quake, the likelihood of anyone still having a charged phone a week 
later is highly improbable. 
</P>
<P>
	A 4-year-old boy given up for dead by his family was rescued  
Monday, but officials said the emergency response work was shifting 
to identifying and helping the wounded and other survivors. But a 
few crews, including Americans, pressed ahead with searching for 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rains eased over the worst-affected regions. The muddy  
quagmires left by the recent downpours increasing fears of disease 
from mosquitoes and flies attracted by the foul-smelling wreckage. 
Thousands of decaying bodies are believed to still be buried, and 
contaminated runoff poured into streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Drenched survivors battled in vain to keep their simple  
cardboard-and-blanket huts from collapsing into soggy piles. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is helping us,'' cried a 70-year-old woman walking  
barefoot through the muddy streets of Adapazari. ``All I have is my 
blanket, and that is wet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a nearby Israeli-run field hospital, 10 children were  
evacuated from a tent swamped by the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Memduh Oguz, governor of hard-hit Izmit province, urged those  
whose houses were not seriously damaged to return home. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a practical side to it,'' Oguz said. ``In one  
neighborhood, specialists have told me that 4,800 apartments are 
structurally sound. That means 4,800 fewer tents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey's National Security Council estimated there are 200,000  
people without homes or who are unable to return to damaged 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dutch group said it would send 30,000 prefabricated shelters  
designed to withstand quakes and winter cold. The government 
broadcast appeals listing the most-needed items in hard-hit areas, 
including tents, flashlights, blankets, heavy machinery for 
clearing rubble, garbage trucks, disinfectants and tetanus 
vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is desperate to deflect the impression it was  
helpless to deal with the disaster. Thousands of tents and hotel 
rooms were prepared in advance of the rain. But many survivors were 
either unaware of the shelter or simply too tired to reach it. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey's public works minister, Koray Aydin, said emergency  
housing may not be ready until late November -- when chilly rains 
pelt northwestern Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	A quicker response to the housing crisis could help ease public  
anger toward the government and military, which had been considered 
the lone Turkish institution capable of handling any crisis. But 
that admiration was eroded by a slow deployment of soldiers to the 
quake zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, The Energy Ministry undersecretary, Yurdakul  
Yigitguden, said 90 percent of the power grid in the quake zone has 
been repaired. A major oil refinery damaged by fire could resume 
production in four months, officials predicted.

<HEADLINE> Syphilis Traced to Net Chat Room </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Health officials are trying to warn  
participants in an Internet chat room that at least seven gay men 
who met through the on-line site have been diagnosed with syphilis. 
</P>
<P>
	Since most people who use America Online's SFM4M chat room are  
disguised by fake ``screen'' identities, the San Francisco 
Department of Health has no names or phone numbers to figure out 
who might have been exposed to the sexually transmitted disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials do know that as many as 47 men may have dated after  
meeting in SFM4M, which stands for San Francisco Men For Men, said 
Jeffrey Klausner, director of the health department's sexually 
transmitted diseases division. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven men who fell ill said their most recent encounters had  
been with men they met in SFM4M. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL refused to release information about its members who visit  
the chat room. But it did put Klausner in touch with San 
Francisco-based PlanetOut, on online service for gays, lesbians and 
bisexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	PlanetOut employees spent two weeks visiting the chat room and  
warning users about the outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1970s and early 1980s, San Francisco had the  
nation's highest rate of syphilis infection. But cases of disease, 
which is easily treated with antibiotics if detected early, are at 
an all-time national low and the disease is one targeted for 
elimination by the federal government.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Sets Sights on 400M Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- There was a serious question about Michael  
Johnson's health early this year. There isn't now, and the American 
400-meter runner thinks he can break the world record at the World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm in shape to run faster than 43.29,'' Johnson said  
Tuesday night after blistering through the first 300 meters of his 
semifinal heat and advancing to Thursday night's final. 
</P>
<P>
	American Butch Reynolds set the record in 1988, and Johnson has  
been chasing it in frustration in recent years. He has come close 
three times, with clockings of 43.39, 43.44 and 43.49. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just have to make sure I don't make any major mistakes,''  
Johnson said. ``The pace should be no problem Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson blazed through the first 300 before shutting down three  
different times during the final 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``I shut down one gear on the end of the curve because I saw  
that I had a little lead, but I was still afraid of losing the 
lead,'' he said. ``Then when I got to the straight, I shut down a 
little more because I knew I had a safe lead. I shut down a whole 
lot with 60 to 70 meters left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he finished in 43.95 seconds, only 0.03 seconds off his  
world-leading time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	While Johnson was speeding around the fast Olympic Stadium  
track, distance runners Hicham El Guerrouj and Haile Gebrselassie 
also were impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj won his second straight 1,500 title in 3 minutes,  
27.65 seconds, the fifth-fastest ever; and Gebrselassie took his 
fourth consecutive 10,000 title in 27:57.27. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's other finals, Anthony Washington of the United  
States won the men's discus on his final throw of 226 feet, 8 
inches; Ludmila Formanova of the Czech Republic scored an upset 
victory in the women's 800 in 1:56.68; Greece's Paraskevi Tsiamita 
won the women's triple jump at 48-10; and Romania's Mihaela 
Melinte, the world record-holder in the women's hammer throw, 
posted her 26th consecutive victory, at 246-9. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's program includes finals in six events: men's  
50-kilometer walk, triple jump, 110-meter hurdles and decathlon, 
and the women's shot and 400 hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	The championships were hit by its first two drug cases. Nigerian  
sprinter Davidson Ezinwa tested positive for a banned hormone and 
faces a two-year suspension, the IAAF said. Somalian 1,500 runner 
Mohamed Ibrahim Aden tested positive for a stimulant and received a 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Johnson has been bothered by an imbalance in his hip  
and pelvic areas and was forced to reduce his schedule. He also 
pulled out of the USA Championships in June and stopped in midrace 
during a meet in Stockholm, Sweden, on July 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The world 200 record-holder and double Olympic gold medalist in  
1996 has not shown any sign of injuries during the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is in better shape than he was in '96 in my opinion,''  
said American Jerome Davis, who just missed making the 400 final. 
``He's running like a madman out there right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Antonio Pettigrew, the 1991 world champion, is  
wondering how he's going to cope with Johnson in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to stay with him and stay in contention when he comes  
off the turn, or you're going to be in trouble,'' Pettigrew said. 
``You can't let him get away or there's no way you're going to 
catch him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj and Gebrselassie also were uncatchable once they got  
away Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj stayed behind Moroccan teammate Adil Kaouch for 700  
meters, then took control. His long, graceful strides carried him 
to an 10-yard victory over Kenya's Noah Ngeny in the race in which 
the top five all broke 3:32. Spaniards Reyes Estevez, 1992 Olympic 
champion Fermin Cacho and Andres Dias finished 3-4-5 before a 
roaring, capacity crowd of 50,810. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj, the world record-holder in the 1,500 and the mile,  
dedicated the victory to Mohamed VI, the new Moroccan king, and 
said the late King Hassan II, who died in July, ``would have been 
very proud of me today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie ran the final 15 laps of the 10,000 with badly  
blistered feet, the same problem that plagued him while winning the 
1996 Olympic final. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hot and I had problems right from the start with my  
feet from 10 laps out, but I couldn't do anything but carry on,'' 
Gebrselassie, the world record-holder in the 5,000 and 10,000, said 
after leading a 1-3-4 Ethiopian finish. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his 40th consecutive victory and 55th triumph in his last  
56 races at distances from 1,500 to 10,000 since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ethiopian carefully chooses his 10,000s and runs them to  
perfection. This was his seventh race at that distance in four 
years and every one was significant -- three world titles, three 
world records and one Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya's Paul Tergat, the five-time world cross-country champion,  
finished second at 27:58.56. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Don Haskins Retires From UTEP Hoops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Don Haskins left one indelible mark on  
college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame coach, with 719 victories, took his team to the  
NCAA tournament 14 times. He brought home seven Western Athletic 
Conference championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But Haskins, who stepped down Tuesday after 38 years in charge  
of the Texas-El Paso basketball team, will be remembered for a 
bigger accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 19, 1966, he led the Miners to the NCAA championship,  
and he started five black players -- a first in the title game. 
Texas Western, as UTEP then was known, upset the all-white, 
top-ranked Kentucky Wildcats 72-65. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the decision meant a lot of hate mail for Haskins. But  
over time, he would be revered as the man who broke down the color 
barrier in college sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he was able to win that national championship against  
Adolf Rupp's all-white team, it changed the look of the game 
forever,'' said Oklahoma State's Eddie Sutton, who has coached 
college basketball for 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins went on to finish with a 719-353 career record, putting  
him 10th on the victory list of college coaches. He remains the 
only men's basketball coach to bring a national title home to 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after spending more than half his life coaching the Miners,  
Haskins says it's time. 
</P>
<P>
	The 69-year-old, known affectionately to UTEP fans as ``The  
Bear'' for his burly physique, says he's grateful for all his years 
at UTEP. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many people have been somewhere 38 years and been happy?  
Not many,'' he said in announcing his retirement at the Don Haskins 
Center, the arena renamed for him in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a miracle,'' added his wife, Mary, seated beside him.  
</P>
<P>
	His wife was misty-eyed throughout the announcement, but Haskins  
retained a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether he has any regrets, he looked up, smiled and  
said, ``A hell of a lot. We haven't got time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UTEP athletic director Bob Stull said a search will begin right  
away for a new coach. ``We're going to do a national search and try 
and find a coach that can replace a legend,'' Stull said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins made it clear it was his decision to leave, and he's not  
being forced out. The university offered to pay his salary for the 
next year, which he accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few years, he has had to deal with a number of  
health problems. He had a mild heart attack during a game in 1996, 
followed by triple-bypass surgery. Earlier this year, he had a 
pacemaker implanted in his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins' career started as a student at Oklahoma A&AMP;M, where he  
played for coach Henry Iba, another Hall of Famer. He was an 
unknown Texas high school coach when Texas Western hired him in 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly four decades at UTEP, Haskins consistently fielded  
competitive teams, even when he had only a handful of talented 
players. In the 1980s, UTEP was a WAC powerhouse that featured, 
among others, a young Tim Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
	In the '90s, Haskins' program struggled after twice being  
slapped with NCAA sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the school was placed on three years' probation after  
the NCAA found that basketball players received improper gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in 1997, UTEP was put on a five-year probation for rampant  
violations in basketball, football and other programs. An 
investigation found that UTEP used ineligible players and 
incorrectly certified ineligible players. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking to the future, Haskins said Chicago Bulls coach and  
longtime friend Tim Floyd offered him a job as an assistant, and he 
plans to serve as an adviser from time to time. Floyd coached under 
him at UTEP from 1977-86. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that has happened in my career has been because of  
my association with Don Haskins,'' Floyd said. ``I have always 
measured every coach against him and none has been able to 
compare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Haskins said Warners Bros. signed him to a deal three  
years ago to make a film about the 1966 championship team. When 
asked who would play him in the movie, Haskins joked, ``Robert 
Redford.''

<HEADLINE> Ban Sought on Animal Death Videos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lawmakers and animal rights activists are  
calling for a ban on the production of ``crush videos,'' films for 
viewers who get sexually aroused by watching women smashing rats 
and other small animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of the videos, primarily on the Internet, is a worldwide  
business, Ventura County District Attorney Michael Bradbury said at 
a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was flanked by poster-sized photographs taken from videos  
that showed women's feet in platform shoes or stiletto heels, 
apparently crushing rats and other rodents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put a stop, won't you, to crush videos,'' said actor Mickey  
Rooney, an animal rights activist. ``What are we going to hand our 
children? This is what we're going to hand down, these videos, 
crush videos? God forbid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State animal cruelty laws outlaw the making of such videos, but  
prosecution is difficult unless producers are caught in the act. A 
proposed federal law would target distributors, said Rep. Elton 
Gallegly, R-Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``It clearly is one of the sickest and most demented forms of  
animal cruelty that I've ever been exposed to,'' Gallegly said. 
</P>
<P>
	His bill would make it illegal to create, sell or possess any  
``depiction'' of animals being tortured, maimed or killed for 
commercial purposes. Violators could get up to five years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Vilencia of Lakewood, whose Squish Productions has made  
crush films of insects, said he doesn't plan to resume production 
unless the controversy is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about the fur industry, what about fishermen, what about  
the cattle industry?'' Vilencia asked. ``The concern is you can 
kill anything you want, basically, in any manner you want if it's 
for food or for sport or for fashion, but you cross the line when 
you do it for sexual gratification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated there were fewer than 1,000 crush fetishists  
worldwide, based on his Internet contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	During a yearlong probe, an investigator went into Internet chat  
rooms to try to obtain crush videos. 
</P>
<P>
	``She talked to people in Italy, the United Kingdom, Japan,  
Mexico, all over the United States,'' said Tom Connors, a Ventura 
County assistant prosecutor. ``We were trying to find out whether 
people were still producing the videos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The probe led to animal cruelty charges against two people who  
are scheduled for a preliminary hearing on Thursday, said Carol 
Rash, a Los Angeles County prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, they could face more than four years in prison,  
she said.

<HEADLINE> Umpire Leaves After One Inning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marvin Hudson, one of the new National League  
umpires hired as permanent replacements, left Tuesday night's game 
between the New York Mets and Houston Astros after one inning 
because of a strained Achillies' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson, the second-base umpire, worked the first inning, then  
conferred with a trainer in the New York dugout. He came back on 
the field after the second inning to talk with crew chief Dana 
DeMuth, then left again. 
</P>
<P>
	The game went on with a three-man crew: Sam Holbrook behind the  
plate, and DeMuth and Charlie Relaford on the bases.

<HEADLINE>  Envy As Swimming Record Is Broken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The former Mary T. Meagher is surprised her world  
record in the 100-meter butterfly lasted as long as it did. She'll 
be even more surprised if her other world mark lasts through the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way they're swimming now, it's only a matter of time,''  
said the five-time Olympic medalist who is now Mary T. Plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow American Jenny Thompson broke the long-standing 100-meter  
record Monday at the Pan Pacific Championships in Sydney, 
Australia. She swam the event in 57.88 seconds, breaking Plant's 
record of 57.93, set on Aug. 16, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kudos to Jenny -- she was able to keep going and I wasn't,''  
Plant said of Thompson, 26. ``I have so much respect for her. I 
tried to keep it going mentally and physically, but finally had to 
give it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three days before setting the 100-meter record, Plant set the  
200-meter world mark of 2:05.97 at the same Senior National 
Championship meet in Brown Deer, Wis., when she was 16. Australian 
swimmer Susie O'Neill has come close, and is aiming for the mark 
this week in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm actually pulling for her since I've met her and she's nice  
and also a bit older,'' said Plant, a native of Louisville, Ky., 
who now lives in Peachtree City, Ga. ``Not to put too much pressure 
on her or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plant heard the news Monday at her vacation home in Wedowee,  
Ala., where she was with her husband, former Olympic speedskater 
Mike Plant, and their two young children. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the few contacts she's had with the sport since  
she retired after winning a bronze at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very conscious decision to leave it all behind,''  
Plant said. ``My husband and I have seen so many athletes that 
never make that transition into real life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson set the record at the Pan Pacific Championships in the  
pool in Sydney, Australia, where the 2000 Olympic meet will be 
held. And while she gained inspiration watching Plant win three 
gold medals in the 1984 Los Angeles Games, Thompson said watching 
footage of Plant's stroke on the Internet was even more helpful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helped me focus on what I need to do, and it's made a  
difference,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plant said that even with all her medals, setting and then  
holding the records was the highlight of a career recognized when 
she was selected to help carry the Olympic flag during opening 
ceremonies in Atlanta in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I won in 1984, I wasn't swimming my best times,  
and as an athlete, your No. 1 goal is to race against yourself,'' 
Mrs. Plant said. ``I never got to that point again, even if I came 
close a couple of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But to have what I have now, I consider myself very lucky.''

<HEADLINE>  Marion Jones Wins 200 Meter Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- A day after losing her bid for a record  
four gold medals, world 100-meter champion Marion Jones won her 
opening heat in the 200 meters today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who settled for bronze in the long jump Monday night,  
eased up over the final 20 meters and crossed the line in 22.69 
seconds, the fourth-best time of the seven heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones hasn't lost in the 200 since 1995 and has won 21  
consecutive finals in the event. She said she was tired today after 
getting only five hours of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was standing behind the blocks, I should have been  
visualizing the race,'' Jones said. ``Instead, I was visualizing 
going back to my hotel and going back to bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow American Inger Miller, who took the silver behind Jones  
in the 100 and figures to be her main challenger in the 200, 
comfortably won her heat in 22.92. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was basically like a workout for me, just feeling it out,''  
Miller said. ``I've got the same motivation I had in the 100, the 
same high energy. That's my plan, to be on the podium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fastest time in the women's 200 heats was run by Jamaica's  
Beverly McDonald, who ran 22.52. Defending 200 champion Zhanna 
Pintusevich of Ukraine finished only fifth in her heat at 23.19 but 
still qualified for the next round. 
</P>
<P>
	The 200 quarterfinals are tonight.  
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Greene, the men's 100 champion, finished only third in  
his opening 200-meter race. Greene, attempting to become the first 
man to win the 100 and 200 at a world championship, looked sluggish 
as he was overtaken by two runners and finished in only 20.76 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the last qualifier in his heat, was beaten by Greece's  
Konstantinos Kenderis (20.68) and Britain's Douglas Turner (20.72). 
</P>
<P>
	Greene looked upset after the race and said only, ``It was all  
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former world 200 champion Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, who  
scratched from Saturday's 100 final with an injury, comfortably won 
his heat in 20.60. He said he'd been suffering from a sciatica 
problem since May. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 400-meter hurdles, U.S. champion and gold medal  
contender Angelo Taylor failed to qualify, finishing third in his 
heat (49.58) and only 19th overall. Taylor banged his fist against 
a wall in the mixed zone area after the race and declined to speak 
to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephane Diagana, the defending champion from France, was the  
fastest in the heats at 48.55, while former champion Samuel Matete 
of Zambia was fourth overall at 48.90. 
</P>
<P>
	In the decathlon, Dvorak, of the Czech Repubic, led the field  
after three events with 2,890 points. He had 2,900 points at the 
same stage when he broke Dan O'Brien's 7-year-old record on July 4 
in Prague, amassing 8,994 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak posted the second fastest time in the 100 meters (10.60  
seconds), had a personal best in the long jump (26 feet, 2 1-4 
inches) and threw the shot 54-1 1-4). 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Huffins, the U.S. and Pan American Games champion, was  
second with 2,800 points and Erki Nool of Estonia third with 2,688. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Frank Busemann, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist,  
pulled out after the first two events with a left thigh injury. He 
said he felt pain while warming up for the 100 and decided not to 
risk long-term injury that would endanger his preparations for next 
year's Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Six finals were scheduled tonight: women's hammer, women's  
triple jump, men's discus, women's 800, men's 1,500 and men's 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after winning the 100 meters in 10.80 seconds, Jones  
settled for bronze in a long jump competition Monday that ended in 
dramatic and controversial fashion for the top two finishers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I set my goals very high,'' Jones said. ``The bronze is not  
going to cut it for me. I'm very disappointed. I need to get back 
to the drawing board and get ready for next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For next year's Sydney Olympics, Jones has her sights set on an  
unprecedented five: in the 100, 200, long jump and two relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Perfecting the long jump will be Jones' biggest challenge. She's  
got the speed; it's the mechanics that need work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be the first one to tell you I need to work on my  
technique,'' she said. ``My specialty is running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones dismissed suggestions that she put too much pressure on  
herself by proclaiming her intention to win four gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't regret it at all,'' she said. ``It blows my mind that  
people can't understand that when I'm entered in four events, I'm 
not going to say I'm going to win three golds and a bronze.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, with a career-best 23 feet, 11 3/4 inches in the long jump,  
never got untracked. Her best effort of 22-5 Monday was 1 1/2 feet 
short of that. 
</P>
<P>
	British-born Italian Fiona May, the 1995 world champion, was  
leading until the next-to-last jump. Then Cuban-born Niurka 
Montalvo of Spain soared 23-2, a career-best, but her toe appeared 
to be past the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials ruled it a fair jump as the crowd of 37,815 roared in  
approval. May had the final jump and couldn't match that distance, 
giving her the silver at 22-9 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians quickly protested. More than an hour after the  
competition, a six-member Jury of Appeal rejected the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Montalvo, who received Spanish citizenship May 5, became the  
first woman from her adopted country to win gold in track and field 
at an Olympics or World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's other finals, Kenya's Christopher Koskei won the  
3,000 steeplechase at 8 minutes, 11.76 seconds as world 
record-holder Bernard Bermasai, also of Kenya, finished fifth; 
Russia's Vyacheslav Voronin won the men's high jump at 7-9 1/4, a 
career best and the best in the world for 1999; and Franka Dietzsch 
of Germany took the women's discus at 223-7.

	Maurice Greene, the men's 100 champion, finished only third in  
his opening 200-meter race. Greene, attempting to become the first 
man to win the 100 and 200 at a world championship, looked sluggish 
as he was overtaken by two runners and finished in only 20.76 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the last qualifier in his heat, was beaten by Greece's  
Konstantinos Kenderis (20.68) and Britain's Douglas Turner (20.72). 
</P>
<P>
	Greene looked upset after the race and said only, ``It was all  
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former world 200 champion Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, who  
scratched from Saturday's 100 final with an injury, comfortably won 
his heat in 20.60. He said he'd been suffering from a sciatica 
problem since May. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 400-meter hurdles, U.S. champion and gold medal  
contender Angelo Taylor failed to qualify, finishing third in his 
heat (49.58) and only 19th overall. Taylor banged his fist against 
a wall in the mixed zone area after the race and declined to speak 
to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephane Diagana, the defending champion from France, was the  
fastest in the heats at 48.55, while former champion Samuel Matete 
of Zambia was fourth overall at 48.90. 
</P>
<P>
	In the decathlon, Dvorak, of the Czech Repubic, led the field  
after three events with 2,890 points. He had 2,900 points at the 
same stage when he broke Dan O'Brien's 7-year-old record on July 4 
in Prague, amassing 8,994 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak posted the second fastest time in the 100 meters (10.60  
seconds), had a personal best in the long jump (26 feet, 2 1-4 
inches) and threw the shot 54-1 1-4). 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Huffins, the U.S. and Pan American Games champion, was  
second with 2,800 points and Erki Nool of Estonia third with 2,688. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Frank Busemann, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist,  
pulled out after the first two events with a left thigh injury. He 
said he felt pain while warming up for the 100 and decided not to 
risk long-term injury that would endanger his preparations for next 
year's Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Six finals were scheduled tonight: women's hammer, women's  
triple jump, men's discus, women's 800, men's 1,500 and men's 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after winning the 100 meters in 10.80 seconds, Jones  
settled for bronze in a long jump competition Monday that ended in 
dramatic and controversial fashion for the top two finishers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I set my goals very high,'' Jones said. ``The bronze is not  
going to cut it for me. I'm very disappointed. I need to get back 
to the drawing board and get ready for next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For next year's Sydney Olympics, Jones has her sights set on an  
unprecedented five: in the 100, 200, long jump and two relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Perfecting the long jump will be Jones' biggest challenge. She's  
got the speed; it's the mechanics that need work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be the first one to tell you I need to work on my  
technique,'' she said. ``My specialty is running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones dismissed suggestions that she put too much pressure on  
herself by proclaiming her intention to win four gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't regret it at all,'' she said. ``It blows my mind that  
people can't understand that when I'm entered in four events, I'm 
not going to say I'm going to win three golds and a bronze.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, with a career-best 23 feet, 11 3/4 inches in the long jump,  
never got untracked. Her best effort of 22-5 Monday was 1 1/2 feet 
short of that. 
</P>
<P>
	British-born Italian Fiona May, the 1995 world champion, was  
leading until the next-to-last jump. Then Cuban-born Niurka 
Montalvo of Spain soared 23-2, a career-best, but her toe appeared 
to be past the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials ruled it a fair jump as the crowd of 37,815 roared in  
approval. May had the final jump and couldn't match that distance, 
giving her the silver at 22-9 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians quickly protested. More than an hour after the  
competition, a six-member Jury of Appeal rejected the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Montalvo, who received Spanish citizenship May 5, became the  
first woman from her adopted country to win gold in track and field 
at an Olympics or World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's other finals, Kenya's Christopher Koskei won the  
3,000 steeplechase at 8 minutes, 11.76 seconds as world 
record-holder Bernard Bermasai, also of Kenya, finished fifth; 
Russia's Vyacheslav Voronin won the men's high jump at 7-9 1/4, a 
career best and the best in the world for 1999; and Franka Dietzsch 
of Germany took the women's discus at 223-7.

<HEADLINE> Labor Day Travel Said To Reach High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though gas prices are rising, Labor Day travel  
may reach the second highest figures ever, the AAA said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 34,8 million Americans are expected to travel 100  
miles or more from home over the Labor Day holiday, a 2 percent 
increase from last year. The vast majority of the travelers, 29.2 
million, will go by car, said the AAA. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the group's fuel gauge report shows a national  
average increase of 8.1 cents a gallon for self-service unleaded 
gas from a month ago. That increase -- to $1.255 a gallon -- is the 
biggest from one month to another since prices soared 11.4 cents 
after Iraq attacked Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the pre-Labor Day average price was $1.075 a gallon.  
</P>
<P>
	Some 23 percent of holiday travelers are planning to visit  
cities, 20 percent rural areas and towns, 19 percent oceans and 
beaches, and 14 percent are heading for the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	The all-time high for Labor Day travel was reached in 1997 with  
34.9 million travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers are based on a national survey with 1,500 adults by  
the Travel Industry Association.

<HEADLINE> Writer Fired for Uncertain Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona Republic columnist fired on suspicion  
of making up sources quoted a ``Jennifer Morgan'' four separate 
times and gave a niece's phone number when asked for a number for a 
man she profiled, the newspaper said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said it fired Julie Amparano after being unable to  
find people quoted in columns or stories, including Morgan and a 
man depicted as a white racist who learned he was part-Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those were the names I was given. I would not make up the same  
name four times. I would not make up a name at all,'' Amparano said 
in a phone interview with The Associated Press Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released earlier in the day, Amparano insisted  
her sources were real and said she was given less than 24 hours to 
produce information requested by the Republic to help verify her 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republic announced the firing Saturday in a brief front page  
note to readers, saying editors were unable to substantiate some of 
her quoted sources. Tuesday's edition carried a detailed 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	Amparano, who worked at the paper for five years, began writing  
a thrice-weekly column last month. Her ``Conversations'' column 
focused on people with compelling tales. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said an investigation also failed to verify the  
existence of a gay man living in an intolerant neighborhood, an 
upscale woman visiting a downscale restaurant and 16 others quoted 
in the 17 columns she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	A July 19 column quoted a Jennifer Morgan complaining about  
advertisements at her dentist's office. On Aug. 11, Amparano quoted 
a Jennifer Morgan, identified as an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice in 1995, the paper said, Amparano quoted individuals named  
Jennifer Morgan in news stories, one described as an owner of an 
answering service and one an advertising representative. The paper 
couldn't verify the existence of any of the four. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said Amparano provided a number for a Luis Adler  
Varela, identified in a column as a racist who learned when he was 
25 that he was half Hispanic. However, Senior Editor David Fritze 
said he learned the phone was listed to Amparano's niece. 
</P>
<P>
	Republic Managing Editor Julia Wallace said she confronted  
Amparano with the niece's name and fired her immediately when 
Amparano denied knowing her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the demand was unfair from the onset,''  
Amparano said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Stephen Montoya, said Amparano had used her niece as  
a source in a columns to find out what a child would think. The 
niece's number was among a list of numbers Amparano gave to the 
Republic but was not given as the contact number for the racist, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said editors began looking into Amparano's sources  
last week after a senior staff member reported rumors that she made 
up some parts of her column and that it was possible other media 
outlets were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said 65 people were identified in the columns. The  
editors had questions on about 40. Of those, 24 had uncommon names 
and were checked out. Four were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Amparano told editors the sources were found while she was out  
in the community -- at parks, bookstores or on street corners -- and 
couldn't be readily traced, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel embarrassed and chagrined about this,'' Deputy Managing  
Editor John D'Anna said. ``In hindsight, the fact we were getting 
something that was so new and different and fit so well into our 
goals, yeah, it clouded my judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amparano's previous employers included The Associated Press and  
The Wall Street Journal. Bill Schiffmann, an AP editor in San 
Francisco who supervised her there in the 1980s, said Tuesday, 
``There were no problems that I can recall.'' Her supervisor at the 
Journal in the early 1990s, Roger Rickless, told the Republic, 
``There certainly were no ethical issues (that) arose during that 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, two Boston Globe columnists resigned after reports  
some column material was made up. Patricia Smith admitted to 
inventing characters in four columns. Mike Barnicle, long the 
newspaper's marquee columnist, resigned amid suspicions he 
fabricated a column about two children with cancer.

<HEADLINE> Lennon Guitar Being Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The guitar that a 16-year-old John Lennon was  
playing with the Quarrymen the day he met Paul McCartney will be 
auctioned next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting on July 6, 1957, resulted in the 15-year-old  
McCartney being asked to join the band, which evolved into the 
Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gallotone Champion is expected to fetch up to $160,000 when  
it is sold Sept. 14. Lennon bought the black-and-red guitar by mail 
for about $28 one month before playing at a church picnic near 
Liverpool. 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney approached Lennon later that evening as the group set  
up for another session at the church hall. He impressed Lennon by 
teaching him the chords and words to Eddie Cochran's ``Twenty 
Flight Rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few days later, Lennon asked McCartney to join the group.  
</P>
<P>
	Lennon was shot to death in New York in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Akili Smith Arrives for Bengal Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Now that he's got a seven-year deal worth as  
much as $56 million, Akili Smith has a lot of catching up to do. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Bengals quarterback of the future took an  
overnight flight and arrived for what's left of training camp 
today, less than three weeks before the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the last unsigned member of the celebrated quarterback  
class of '99, agreed to a contract Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've missed 20 to 25 practices. It's definitely going  
to hurt me, but I'm still optimistic about this year,'' said Smith, 
looking tired from the lack of sleep. ``I want to salvage some of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got about two hours of sleep overnight, attended a brief news  
conference after signing his contract, then headed for training 
camp and an afternoon workout in Georgetown, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	``(General manager Mike Brown) said, 'I don't care about you  
sleeping, I don't care about you eating. We want you in there 
practicing,''' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown talked all offseason about acquiring a quarterback to pull  
his team out of a decade-long rut. He's still hopeful that Smith 
can pick up the offense quickly enough to make an impact this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a good time for him to be in Cincinnati, with our new  
stadium coming out of the ground,'' Brown said. ``It will be ready 
next year and maybe he'll be ready sooner than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, chosen third overall behind quarterbacks Tim Couch and  
Donovan McNabb, doesn't want to repeat the experience that Bengals 
quarterback David Klingler had in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Klingler, the No. 6 pick overall that season, didn't sign until  
one week before the season opener. The Bengals made him the starter 
12 weeks into the season, but he got sacked 10 times by Pittsburgh 
in his debut and never panned out. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who like Klingler is represented by agent Leigh  
Steinberg, has a few things in his favor. Unlike Klingler, he got 
to work out with the Bengals before training camp started, so he's 
not as far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last couple of years, they've instituted these  
(programs) where he's spent a good deal of time in June and July in 
Cincinnati working out,'' Steinberg said. ``So the point is, he's 
received more preparation time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they did with Klingler, the Bengals slotted Smith as a backup  
in his first season, hoping he'd learn by watching Jeff Blake play. 
The question is whether he's far enough along to deserve the No. 2 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows how fast he can pick it up?'' coach Bruce Coslet  
said before the contract agreement was reached. ``He's pretty 
bright. He's a couple of years older than a normal rookie, so he's 
pretty mature. And I think he probably has been working with the 
stuff we sent him, but that's not the same as being on the field 
time after time after time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't on the field because Steinberg and the Bengals were at  
a philosophical impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg represented Dan Wilkinson and Ki-Jana Carter, who were  
No. 1 overall draft picks in the 1990s and got cutting-edge 
``voidable years'' contracts from the Bengals with little trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg wanted a deal for Smith that was comparable to what  
other top young quarterbacks got. Unhappy with how the Wilkinson 
and Carter deals turned out, the Bengals dug in this time. 
</P>
<P>
	The team initially pushed for a deal with incentives based  
heavily upon how well the Bengals perform. The two sides ended up 
at odds over what types of incentives would be included. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg flew to Cincinnati on Sunday and met for 16 hours over  
two days before getting a deal that includes a $10.8 million 
signing bonus and could pay up to $56 million if Smith reaches all 
of his performance goals along the way. Realistically, he'll make 
less than that. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal contains one voidable year, meaning it will  
automatically shorten to six years if he's in for 35 percent of the 
plays in his first year or 45 percent any following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's contract includes base salaries of $175,000; $250,000;  
$325,000; $350,000; $375,000; $400,000 and $450,000. Various 
escalators would push those numbers higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The first round of escalators clicks in when he passes for 1,601  
yards, the second when he throws for 2,500 yards and appears in 
half of the plays. 
</P>
<P>
	The final two rounds of escalators have Smith finishing in the  
top five in various passing categories, and the Bengals winning a 
playoff game -- something the Bengals haven't done since the 1990 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch agreed to a seven-year, $48 million deal with Cleveland,  
while McNabb got a seven-year deal from Philadelphia that could 
reach $54 million.

	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Oliver Stone will enter drug rehab  
and plead no contest to drunken driving and drug possession as part

	Interest Rate Hike Expected Today  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in eight weeks, the  
Federal Reserve is poised to bump up interest rates in an effort to 
cool the economy and prevent an outbreak of inflation, private 
economists believe. Many analysts have been forecasting another 
quarter of a percentage point rate increase since Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan vowed last month to move ``promptly and forcefully'' at 
the first signs of inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee was 
meeting behind closed doors today to review interest rate policy 
with financial markets braced for a midafternoon announcement of 
their decision.

	GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) -- Zenith Electronics Corp. filed for  
bankruptcy as part of a long-planned overhaul of the struggling 
maker of televisions, VCRs and digital equipment. The company said 
the Chapter 11 filing yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 
Wilmington, Del., was one of the final steps in its restructuring, 
which is aimed at reducing debt and de-emphasizing manufacturing. 
Zenith announced last year that it would file for bankruptcy

	Rules Tightened for Fund Managers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mutual fund managers and employees are facing  
stricter federal rules governing their personal trading, following 
a move by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The tighter rules 
announced yesterday by the SEC came in the wake of several cases of 
mutual fund managers accused of improperly enriching themselves 
with investors' money. The market watchdog agency has been 
considering the move for more than a year. The changes adopted by 
the SEC give boards of directors of mutual fund companies more 
supervision over personal trading by managers and employees and 
require fuller disclosure of such trading.

	Russia, IMF Said To Seek Compromise

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia and the International Monetary Fund are  
inching toward a compromise that would allow Russia to receive more 
IMF loans, a news report said today. The sides are discussing the 
size of the primary surplus in the 1999 Russian federal budget. A 
larger surplus would be good for Russia as it shows the government 
is collecting more taxes. The IMF's approval of the budget is 
necessary for Russia to continue receiving funds from a $4.45 
billion loan program begun last month with the release of a first 
installment of $640 million.

was announced after a meeting of the Bank of Thailand's rescue 
fund, which is the major shareholder in state-owned Krung Thai, the 
country's second largest commercial bank. Krung Thai has been at 
the center of a political uproar following disclosure of a 
preliminary audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers estimating that 84

through the capital today to challenge President Thabo Mbeki's new 
government over wage increases. Two armored police vehicles 
shadowed the protesters and police and soldiers lined the march 
route through the capital, but the atmosphere was peaceful. 
Marchers, some carrying banners that read ``Negotiate in good 
faith,'' sang as they headed for the Union Buildings, where the 
offices of Mbeki and many other government officials are located. 
Union members also gathered in other cities across South Africa to 
push their wage-hike demands.

	UBS Announces Profits Up 13 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss banking giant UBS AG today said  
its first-half net profit rose by 13 percent, results that were on 
the lower end of analysts' expectations. Profit in the first half 
of 1999 was $2.64 billion, up from $2.34 billion in the same period 
a year ago. UBS, formed last year from the merger of Union Bank of 
Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp., said profits were within 
expectations. Analysts said UBS' profit was burdened by higher 
taxes and expenses and by revenues which grew less than expected.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Board Allows Star of David </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GULFPORT, Miss. (AP) -- A Jewish student told to hide his Star of  
David necklace at school may wear it freely, the school board said 
in reversing its ruling that the pendant could be viewed as a gang 
symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we made the decision last week, it was based on  
information from the security officers only,'' Harrison County 
School Board president Randy Williams said after Monday's vote. 
``But we realized that it infringed on freedom of religious 
expression, and that freedom supersedes the safety issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The School Board voted unanimously to exempt religious symbols  
from its policy prohibiting students from wearing anything that 
could be viewed as a gang symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Green, a junior at Harrison Central High School, wore his  
Star of David pendant at registration and on the first day of 
school early this month. He was told to tuck it beneath his shirt 
because it could be interpreted as a gang symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	Security officials had told board members that some gang symbols  
incorporate six-pointed stars, and that the Star of David could be 
confused as such. On Aug. 16, the board unanimously upheld the 
anti-gang policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan's parents asked school officials to reconsider the policy,  
and the American Civil Liberties Union on Friday asked a court to 
strike it down. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing increasing pressure and public attention, the school  
board met last week with members of the Jewish community and 
decided to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan's father, Tom Green, said he was excited about the  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful feeling,'' he said. ``We are truly joyous. As  
a father to a son this is the best principle I could teach him: 
Stand up for your rights.''

<HEADLINE> Oakley Near Deal With Raptors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Charles Oakley is close to signing a three-year,  
$18 million deal with the Toronto Raptors, according to Charlie 
Grantham, the player's agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could be signed as early as Wednesday, Grantham said,  
although the Raptors said there was nothing new to report on 
discussions with Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before he signs it, I want to make sure all the t's are  
crossed and the i's are dotted,'' Grantham told The Glode and Mail 
of Toronto on Tuesday. ``It's really just a matter of getting a few 
things done. The negotiations are done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley, 35, met in New York with Billy Diamond, his business  
agent, to review the contract Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	With Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald in Florida on a  
vacation with his children this week, an official announcement by 
the club on Oakley's return is not anticipated before next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9 veteran would be paid about what he made last year  
in his 14th NBA season. Under terms of the NBA's salary-cap 
guidelines, it is still substantially more than Oakley, 35, could 
have earned had he jumped to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Grantham, eight NBA teams were in serious  
discussions with Oakley, including the Los Angeles Lakers and the 
defending champion San Antonio Spurs. But those clubs are already 
over their salary caps and the best they could offer Oakley under 
the NBA's middle-class exception rule was $2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, economics are important and I don't want to in any  
way suggest they're not,'' Grantham said. ``There are some things 
that balance that out. I think that's one reason why you have to 
look at every single opportunity that presents itself. I think you 
have to do that once you become a free agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley started every game for Toronto last season, averaging 7  
points and 7.5 rebounds a game. The latter ranked second on the 
team, behind center Kevin Willis' 8.3.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke To Head for the Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke, the diplomatic  
troubleshooter who won Senate confirmation as U.N. ambassador after 
a 14-month battle, is going to head for the Balkans right after 
being sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
	It could signal a unique approach to his new job and set up a  
two-tier arrangement at the top of the U.S. diplomatic hierarchy: 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in the top spot, with the 
energetic Holbrooke not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Foley was at pains to point out  
Tuesday that Holbrooke's trip to the Balkans, after he takes the 
oath Wednesday at the U.S. mission in New York, has Albright's 
enthusiastic support. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, where Holbrooke will visit  
along with Bosnia, Albania and Macedonia, is a major undertaking by 
the United Nations. And Holbrooke has made a specialty of the 
Balkans, playing the leading role, for instance, in settling the 
ethnic conflict in Bosnia in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	By all indications, Holbrooke will be on the road a lot in his  
new post. He has long held a strong interest, for instance, in 
working out a settlement for Cyprus, the divided Mediterranean 
island partly occupied by Turkish troops for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke is going to the Balkans with Albright's approval,  
Foley said. ``And I have no doubt,'' he said, ``that she will not 
hesitate to deploy, as it were, Ambassador Holbrooke in appropriate 
circumstances as our diplomatic needs require.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke's predecessor, Bill Richardson, and Albright, when she  
held the job through President Clinton's first administration, also 
traveled extensively, Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. General Assembly will hold its annual special session  
next month, a busy period that brings scores of heads of state and 
government to New York for spirited diplomacy in U.N. corridors and 
occasionally on side trips to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing for the session is a major undertaking.  
</P>
<P>
	Also, Holbrooke faces the major task of assuaging hard  
international feelings over more than $1 billion in delinquent U.S. 
payments to the organization. The money has been held up by 
conservatives in Congress who complain the United States pays a 
disproportionate share of U.N. expenses and that the world 
organization is overstaffed and overspends. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke has backed cost-cutting changes and a reduction in the  
U.S. share of the U.N. budget from 25 percent to 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke's nomination followed a tortured path over 14 months.  
The former ambassador to Germany and assistant secretary of state 
for East Asia and the Pacific drew heavy praise for his negotiating 
skills from Democrats and Republicans alike. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nomination was stalled, first for eight months as the  
Justice and State departments conducted ethics investigations into 
his business dealings, and then by individual Republican senators 
refusing because of various unrelated issues to allow a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, 58, pledged to work with Albright and on Clinton's  
foreign policy team ``to advance our vital national interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While holding a lucrative post at the investment firm Credit  
Suisse First Boston, Holbrooke also served as an unpaid White House 
envoy to the Balkans, often negotiating directly with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic subsequently broke a cease-fire agreement he reached  
with Holbrooke, and the United States and its NATO allies bombed 
Yugoslavia to force withdrawal of Serb troops and special police 
from Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's major republic Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	An international commission in The Hague charged Milosevic with  
war crimes, and Foley said Monday that Holbrooke will not meet on 
his trip with indicted war crimes suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	On his Balkans trip, Foley said, Holbrooke will visit Pristina  
in Kosovo, Tirana in Albania, Skopje in Macedonia and Sarajevo in 
Bosnia. He will meet with U.N. and NATO officials and look into the 
issues of refugee resettlement, reconstruction and war crimes, 
Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he was before the Senate in his confirmation hearings, I  
think he made clear that his view, that certainly we share here in 
the department, that Kosovo and peace implementation in Kosovo and 
throughout the Balkans, and Bosnia as well, is a major test case 
for the United Nations,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary thought it would be very worthwhile for him to  
go to the region, update himself on the current conditions and 
circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was considered a rival candidate for secretary of  
state when Clinton deliberated on a successor to Warren Christopher 
in his second administration. Clinton's choice of Albright led to 
widespread speculation that Holbrooke might be a candidate again in 
the future, possibly in another Democratic administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley stressed Holbrooke's role in the months ahead ``will  
emerge from his conversations with Secretary Albright.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Plan Spurs Faster Federal Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's opponents will benefit from  
his record-setting fund raising because, with Bush forgoing 
taxpayer aid for his campaign, other candidates will get more of 
their money sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor -- who raised $37 million through midyear,  
more than all the other Republican primary candidates combined -- 
decided to give up federal matching funds for presidential 
candidates to avoid spending limits tied to them. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Federal Election Commission now says it will  
have enough money to give the other Republican and Democratic 
primary candidates all of their matching funds by next July, 
instead of making them wait until April 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 1, when the first payments are scheduled, the FEC will  
be able to give candidates 39 percent of the federal aid they are 
entitled to, rather than the 32 percent projected had Bush applied 
for a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a bigger share of the money sooner means candidates will  
be able to borrow less money against their total expected federal 
funds, reducing interest costs and giving them more to spend as the 
first caucuses and primaries are held. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means our anticipated bridge loan will be a slightly  
smaller bridge loan,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for 
Elizabeth Dole, one of five candidates so far to qualify for 
federal matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The others are Gary Bauer, Bill Bradley, John McCain and Dan  
Quayle. Vice President Al Gore also has said he will apply for 
matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC said it will have to pay out around $82 million in  
federal funds to presidential candidates instead of the $99 million 
originally expected now that Bush isn't accepting matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, who is largely paying for his campaign out of his  
pocket, is the only other major party candidate forgoing federal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government matches the first $250 of individual  
contributions to candidates who agree to limit spending. Candidates 
become eligible for federal funding by raising at least $5,000 in 
20 different states from individuals contributing no more than $250 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is separate from public funding of general election  
campaigns, which Bush could still accept if he becomes his party's 
nominee.

<HEADLINE> Jones, Greene on Pace for Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Two sprint doubles remain in the offing at  
the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100-meter gold medalists, Maurice Greene and Marion Jones,  
won their quarterfinal heats in the 200 Tuesday to continue their 
quests to add a second title. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after finishing third in the long jump, ending her bid for  
an unprecedented four world titles, a fatigued Jones won her 
morning qualifying heat of the 200 in 22.69 seconds and her evening 
quarterfinal in 22.45 seconds. They were the fourth-fastest times 
overall in each round. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she got only five hours of sleep and that she and other  
athletes were suffering from the ``very harsh conditions,'' 
referring to temperatures in the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaica's Beverly McDonald, who has never qualified for a major  
final, had the fastest time in both rounds of the women's 200 
(22.52 and 22.26). 
</P>
<P>
	Greene was not brilliant in his opening race, crossing the line  
only third, in 20.76 seconds. The American looked much stronger in 
his quarterfinal, easily putting space between himself and the 
field before shutting down in the last 10 meters and clocking 
20.23. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just caught me off guard,'' Greene said of his first  
heat. ``I wanted to take it easy and go as close to 21 (seconds) 
flat as possible, but they didn't let me do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's aiming to be the first man to pull off the 100-200 double  
at a World Championships. Carl Lewis was the last to do it in an 
Olympics, at Los Angeles in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greene is not nearly as comfortable at the longer distance  
as he is in the dash, for which he owns the world record of 9.79 
and won here in 9.80. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to work more on taking the curve,'' he said of the 200.  
``The curve could be better. It's getting there, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankie Fredericks, a former world champion, had the best time  
of the men's quarterfinals, 20.11, and appears to be Greene's top 
competition for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Fredericks did not show up for the 100 semifinals Sunday,  
though, and said Tuesday it was because he has a sciatic nerve 
problem in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	Reigning world 200 champion Ato Boldon, who pulled out of  
Seville with a bad hamstring, said training partner Greene will be 
put to the test if Fredericks is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankie is rolling. I think he pulled a bit of a psychological  
game in the 100,'' Boldon said. ``Frankie is going to give Maurice 
a run for the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene and Jones are in contention for three golds apiece, with  
each in a relay later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strenuousness of Jones' try for history appeared to be  
setting in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stumbled out of the blocks,'' Jones said of her quarterfinal  
run. ``I didn't feel as sharp as in the past. I feel a little 
winded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she put a positive spin on the day.  
</P>
<P>
	``All things considered, the fact I could come back even in this  
heat and run 22.4, that says a lot about my shape,'' she said. ``If 
I get a little rest tonight, I'll be ready to run fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Inger Miller, second to Jones in the 100, comfortably  
won both of her 200 rounds in 22.92 and 22.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending 200 champion Zhanna Pintusevich of Ukraine scratched  
from the quarterfinals, apparently due to an injury.

<HEADLINE> A Plan To Merge Golfing Cups  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Forgive the Americans if this cup business is  
getting old. 
</P>
<P>
	They play the Ryder Cup one year, the Presidents Cup the other.  
They can't seem to hang onto either one, and it might not be long 
before they can't seem to keep them straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Faldo set a record by playing on 11 straight Ryder Cup  
teams. Big deal. Barring injury or boredom, Tiger Woods will have 
played on his 11th straight U.S. team at the ripe young age of 31. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, the two cups may more closely resemble the Davis Cup --  
no one will care, including those who have to play it year after 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether the top players that are going to be asked to  
represent their country every year for the next decade will ever 
opt not to play, I don't know,'' Payne Stewart said. ``I hope that 
never occurs, but I think we're going to have to take a long, hard 
look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Samuel Ryder commissioned that gold chalice in 1926, he  
never dreamed the world of golf would stretch far beyond the 
Atlantic Ocean to places like South Africa, Australia, even 
Paraguay. The only world powers in golf back then were Britain and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine what Ryder would think if he could see all the talent  
assembled this week at Firestone Country Club for the NEC 
Invitational, the $5 million World Golf Championship bonanza for 
Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup players. 
</P>
<P>
	So many great players. So many cups.  
</P>
<P>
	In a downtown Atlanta hotel room last November, Jack Nicklaus  
first broached the idea of a ``tri-match,'' conceding that it might 
become harder every year to get the Americans motivated to play for 
a cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's pretty good the way it is,'' Nicklaus said.  
``Someday, probably sooner rather than later, that might happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how it can.  
</P>
<P>
	 *Plan A: The winner keeps playing    	
</P>
<P>
	Assume that Europe wins the Ryder Cup (again) next month at The  
Country Club. Europe then would have the right to meet the 
International team in the 2000 Presidents Cup. The winner of those 
matches would play the losing Ryder Cup team in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The only drawback is where to play.  
</P>
<P>
	Interest would be minimal if Europe and the International team  
were to play the next Presidents Cup in Virginia, just like it 
would be if the International team played the Americans at The 
Belfry in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The solution? The losing team would be the home team, giving it  
two years to prepare a site. It would help if each team stuck to 
one venue, although the International team should have more 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Each cup could keep its name, even if it lost some of its  
identity. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Plan B: The mother of all matches    	
</P>
<P>
	This is a little more complex, but a lot more compelling.  
</P>
<P>
	The United States, Europe and International team would each  
bring 12-man squads to the new and improved and globally correct 
Ryder Cup -- three teams playing every two years for one cup. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first two days, six best-ball matches would be played in  
the morning, followed by six alternate-shot matches in the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	For every session, the captain submits his pairings in what  
amounts to a blind draw. A U.S. team plays a European team in the 
first and fourth matches, Europe plays the Internationals in the 
second and fifth matches, and the Internationals play the U.S. in 
the third and sixth matches. 
</P>
<P>
	For Sunday singles, another blind draw. Six Americans would play  
six Europeans and the other six Americans would play six from the 
International team. The leftover six from Europe and International 
would play each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The team with the most points wins. In case of a tie, each  
captain submits one name to compete in a four-hole playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The only hangup is getting the PGA of America and the PGA Tour  
to agree on who runs the show and controls the dough -- a major 
obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it would help maintain pride and enthusiasm about playing  
for the flag, and it would reflect the global nature of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Purists no doubt will protest that the storied Ryder Cup should  
never be tainted. Then again, the rest of Europe was invited to the 
Ryder Cup in 1979 and it somehow managed to survive. Is it too much 
to invite the rest of the world to the dance? 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel Ryder surely would not have frowned on the inclusion of  
Seve Ballesteros, just like he wouldn't protest the inclusion of 
Ernie Els. 
</P>
<P>
	He would probably say the same thing he uttered to George Duncan  
that night in 1926 when the idea of the Ryder Cup matches was first 
hatched. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not?''

<HEADLINE> AOL Europe Has Free Internet in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- AOL Europe, a joint venture between America  
Online Inc. and Bertelsmann, began offering a free Internet access 
service in the United Kingdom Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers using the service, called Netscape Online, will not  
pay for access to the Internet but must pay local phone charges. 
European telephone companies charge per minute, even for local 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape Online will compete directly with a free Internet  
access service called Freeserve, which is Britain's largest 
Internet service provider with more than 1 million users. More than 
100 Internet service providers offer free access in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	So-called ``free'' Internet services make their money three ways  
-- from sharing in telephone revenues as subscribers dial up, from 
advertising, and from a cut on any purchases made via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Taiwan Jet Catches Fire; 28 Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A domestic passenger jet caught fire today  
after an apparent explosion during its landing in east-central 
Taiwan, injuring 28 of the 96 people aboard, officials said. There 
were no fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiery landing of the UNI Airlines MD-90 was the second  
accident involving a Taiwanese airline in just three days. In both 
cases, the planes were manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	As the jet touched down in today's accident, there was a loud  
noise from the front of the cabin, and thick black smoke poured 
from one of the overhead luggage compartments, said the airline's 
vice president, Si Chung-ching. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an explosion above us, and many people had burns on  
their faces or holes in their clothes,'' a passenger told the TVBS 
cable station. 
</P>
<P>
	Television footage showed black smoke belching from the plane's  
fuselage as firefighters struggled to douse the flames. Si said the 
passengers were quickly evacuated. It took about 30 minutes to put 
out the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Many passengers suffered facial burns. The two most seriously  
hurt, a man and a woman, were burned on over 60 percent of their 
bodies, Si said. Many others were treated and released from Tse-Chi 
Hospital, a doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following an initial investigation, Transport Minister Lin  
Fong-cheng said there apparently was some type of an explosion in 
the plane. Authorities have yet to determine what caused it. 
</P>
<P>
	Eyewitnesses reported a ball of fire on the runway after the jet  
landed at the Hualien Airport, 108 miles southeast of Taipei, 
following a 25-minute flight from the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's incident comes two days after a China Airlines MD-11  
jetliner flying out of Bangkok burst into flames as the pilot tried 
to land in Hong Kong. Two people aboard the Taiwanese carrier were 
killed and more than 200 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei today, a Taiwanese aviation regulator offered an  
explanation for that crash. He said the pilot tried to land in 
stormy cross winds that exceeded his safety threshold after getting 
faulty information from his co-pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-pilot, Liu Cheng-hsi, had told the pilot, Gerardo  
Lettich, that the winds were blowing at 26 miles per hour but in 
fact they were blowing at 30 miles per hour, said Chang Kuo-cheng, 
the deputy director general of Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether Liu Chen-hsi calculated wrong, or misread, or whether  
there was poor communication with the pilot -- that can be 
immediately discovered once the Hong Kong authorities analyze the 
cockpit voice recorder,'' Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong investigators recovered the ``black box'' cockpit  
recorder from the wreckage today, the Civil Aviation Department 
said in a statement. Heavy rains had stopped them from reaching it 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 211 injured people, 48 were still in the hospital this  
afternoon, including one in critical condition and three in serious 
condition, a Hong Kong government spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.S. safety investigators arrived in Hong Kong today.  
Representatives from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, 
aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and jet engine manufacturer Pratt 
&AMP; Whitney will assist the Hong Kong and Taiwanese teams already in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet, an MD-11, was also made by McDonnell Douglas, which has  
been purchased by Seattle-based Boeing.

<HEADLINE> Housing for Farmworkers Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARYSVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- His room is a dust-covered space with  
soiled bedsheets over the windows. A naked light bulb dangles from 
the ceiling. A padlock keeps prowlers away. 
</P>
<P>
	But 48-year-old farmworker Jose Riviera says what he dislikes  
most about the 10-by-10-foot room he shares with another worker is 
the vermin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's comfortable, it's fine,'' Riviera said Monday. ``Except  
for the rats -- I hate them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmworker advocates say Riviera's acceptance of his living  
conditions is typical of fieldhands who labor in California's 
Central Valley. Many live in poor conditions because they have no 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's sad,'' Roman Catholic Bishop William Weigand of the  
Sacramento Diocese said when told about Riviera's living 
conditions. ``We can do so much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weigand led religious and government officials Monday on a  
housing tour of this fruit-growing region in an effort to end what 
he called ``our country's own complacency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is America, this is not the Third World, and it's time  
that everyone knew what was going on and how we can do better,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While orchards owners aren't required to provide housing for  
workers, many let them stay on their property for little or no rent 
in shelters that often fall below state building codes. 
</P>
<P>
	Riviera pays $14 a week for his home. Weigand saw nicer but  
still bare-bones quarters at New England Orchards near Marysville, 
about 40 miles north of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone rang unanswered at New England Orchards when The  
Associated Press called Monday evening seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Weigand said an Aug. 9 van crash near Fresno that killed 13  
tomato pickers heightened his concern for farmworkers. The van, 
without seat belts and driven by an unlicensed driver, crashed into 
a truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The bishop said he hoped his tour would draw public attention to  
the problem and make Catholic charities aware of the need. He also 
urged the Legislature to pass a bill making it easier to build 
farmworker housing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilene Jacobs, director of litigation for California Rural Legal  
Assistance, said housing problems were aggravated by floods in 
January 1997 which damaged crops and buildings around Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still a tremendous amount of need,'' said Jacobs.  
``And the answer to so many problems is in federally and 
state-funded housing. People thrive when they like where they 
live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weigand took the delegation -- which included representatives  
from U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer and Diane Feinstein, both California 
Democrats -- to government-funded housing complexes for farmworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Mahal Plaza in Yuba City, the group toured a $7.5  
million, 98-unit housing complex built with state and federal 
money. Inside, the multi-bedroom homes were divided by manicured 
grass, a community center and a childcare facility. 
</P>
<P>
	To live in the complex, applicants must be farmworkers who do  
not collect welfare. Rent is 30 percent of an applicant's income. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is dignity,'' Weigand said. ``This is how society can  
provide people with a way out of poverty.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is down 44  
points in today's early going. Losers on the New York Stock 
Exchange hold a 8-5 lead over gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is down ten points and the S&AMP;P 500  
Index is down nearly three points. 
</P>
<P>
	Market analysts expect stocks to march in place for the next few  
hours, with the possibility of some selling after yesterday's big 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	But any market moves should be limited until about 2:15 Eastern  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the Federal Reserve is expected to announce its  
decision on interest rates, following today's policy-making 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts expect the Fed to raise short-term rates by a  
quarter point. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street rallied yesterday, on the growing expectation that  
after today, the Fed will stand pat on rates for the balance of the 
year.

<HEADLINE> Indian Gambling Initiative Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIEJAS INDIAN RESERVATION, Calif. (AP) -- Undeterred by a ban on  
Nevada-style casino gaming, tribal leaders promised to pursue new 
tactics to ensure gambling revenues remain on California 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll do whatever it takes, we'll spend whatever we have to  
spend to keep the right to govern ourselves,'' said Anthony Pico, 
chairman of the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribes were dealt a setback Monday when the state Supreme  
Court struck down a measure that voters approved in November 
legalizing video gambling machines and card games on reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 5 would have allowed 40 tribes with casinos to keep  
using video slot machines, which tribal officials estimate generate 
70 percent of the revenue at Indian casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was approved by 63 percent of the voters in  
November, after both sides injected nearly $100 million into the 
campaign, setting a national record for a ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would have set the stage for more of California's 107  
tribes to open casinos with video gambling terminals and card 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	In their 6-1 ruling, state justices said Proposition 5 violates  
a section of the state Constitution that forbids ``casinos of the 
type currently operating in Nevada and New Jersey'' -- a phrase that 
was undefined until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative was put on hold while the court reviewed the case  
after two legal challenges by a labor union and a group of 
homeowners and businesses backed by Nevada casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's decision now means tribes in three Southern  
California counties, which run some of the state's largest casinos, 
could lose their video slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribes in other parts of California previously reached  
agreements with federal prosecutors over the machines, said Thom 
Mrozek, spokesman for the Los Angeles U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides expect another formidable battle as they begin  
campaigning for a March 2000 ballot initiative on the same issue. 
This time, the tribes want voters to approve a constitutional 
amendment instead of a statute change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is a setback for them, but we should be realistic. They  
have shown time and time again that they're able to shower the 
political process with vast sums of money,'' Jim Mulhall of the 
Nevada Resort Association. ``They are a very determined group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal leaders vowed to pump as much money as necessary into the  
campaign. Anticipating an unfavorable court decision, they already 
began collecting the 670,000 signatures needed for a constitutional 
amendment allowing video slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
	At the two-story adobe-styled Viejas casino about 30 miles east  
of San Diego, word of the court decision rippled through the crowd 
of hundreds of gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just a legal question. It's a human question,'' said  
Lew Jones, head of security at the Viejas Casino &AMP; Turf Club. 
``There's about 2,000 people working here. A lot of them would be 
on welfare if they weren't working here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What the people vote for that's the way it should be,'' said  
George Piszczek, a regular patron who is a retired bookstore 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambling supporters expressed hope that tribes could still  
negotiate a favorable compact with Gov. Gray Davis, who issued a 
statement Monday saying he would ``work diligently to find a 
constitutionally acceptable means of implementing the people's 
expressed will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition to the benefits to the tribes themselves, I am  
mindful of the fact that some 16,000 Californians, currently 
employed by Indian gaming, may lose their source of employment if 
we cannot respond to this challenge,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees, though apprehensive about the possibility of losing  
their jobs, were optimistic that tribes will eventually win the 
right to run the type of casinos they want. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll continue the battle. We'll win it eventually,'' said  
Jones, a retired sheriff's deputy. ``The people are on our side. 
Eventually, we'll win, if for no other reason.''

<HEADLINE> Panda at Beijing Zoo Has Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A giant panda gave birth to twin cubs at the  
Beijing Zoo, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuanyuan's cubs were born four hours apart on Monday, Xinhua  
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	There are fewer than 1,000 of the highly endangered animals in  
China's bamboo forests and about 110 in captivity. The animals are 
not prolific breeders, and the survival rate for cubs is low. 
</P>
<P>
	Xinhua quoted zoo official Huang Zhouqiang as saying Yuanyuan  
was a ``hero mother'' because she has over the years given birth to 
nine cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Another giant panda gave birth to a rare three-cub litter Aug.  
18 in southwest China's Sichuan province, but the smallest of the 
three cubs has died, Xinhua reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The cub, which was born at the Giant Panda Breeding Research  
Center, died of a bladder disorder. It had been deserted by its 
mother when a caretaker found it, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two cubs were healthy, the report said.  
</P>
<P>
	There was another birth at the San Diego Zoo on Saturday. That  
cub is also doing well.

<HEADLINE>  Krayzelburg Sets Backstroke Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- When American Jeff Rouse broke the  
world 100-meter backstroke record in 1992, Lenny Krayzelburg was a 
17-year-old Russian migrant trying to start a promising swimming 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Krayzelburg broke Rouse's world mark at the Pan  
Pacific championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 23-year-old Californian was overshadowed by Australian  
Ian Thorpe, who broke his third world record in three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe lowered his own mark in the men's 200 freestyle -- set on  
Monday in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world record was my goal coming into the meet, but I was  
surprised it was so fast,'' Krayzelburg said after his 53.60-second 
performance, breaking the previous mark of 53.86 that Rouse set at 
the Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Krayzelburg, who began swimming when he was 5 years old with the  
Red Army club at his home in Odessa, came to the United States with 
his family in 1989 and became an American citizen in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he may return on the winner's podium Friday night when  
he goes after Spanish swimmer Martin Lopez-Zubero's 8-year-old 
1:56.57 record in the 200 backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can do it again,'' Krayzelburg said. ``The 200 has  
always been my favorite, so I'm feeling pretty confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-year-old Thorpe fought off fatigue to get a record for  
the third straight day running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't experienced anything this exciting for a long time,  
and I don't think I'll experience anything like it for a long time 
to come,'' Thorpe said. ``I'd never believed I'd be able to do this 
and now that I've done it was all worthwhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was close with countryman and world champion Michael Klim  
after 100 meters but then moved ahead over the next 50. Thorpe held 
the margin down the stretch and when he touched the scoreboard 
initially showed him at 1 minute, 45.7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The scoreboard fault cast some confusion on the result, but  
after a delay Thorpe was given a time of 1:46.0 -- breaking his mark 
of 1:46.34. Thorpe also broke the 400 record on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic 200 butterfly silver medalist Tom Malchow also had the  
fourth fastest time ever in the semifinals of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Malchow became the third fastest swimmer in the 200 fly. He said  
the record may be threatened, but it's not his primary concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal was to swim 1:55 and I've done that,'' Malchow said.  
``I'm just going to go in and have a good time and hope for a 
victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South African Penny Heyns won the 100 gold in the breaststroke  
but couldn't improve her record from the heats. American Jenny 
Thompson broke the other record in the 100 fly Monday.

<HEADLINE> Whitman To Purchase Rocky Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURANGO, Colo. (AP) -- Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory said it  
has accepted a $16.3 million buyout offer by Whitman Candies Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Durango-based chocolatier said Whitman, which shares offices  
with Russell Stover in Kansas City, Mo., offered to purchase its 
outstanding common stock for $6.25 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	That is 9 percent higher than an offer made by Whitman in May  
that was spurned by Rocky Mountain and represents a 4 premium over 
Rocky Mountain's closing price Tuesday of $6 a share on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	``After an exhaustive analysis of our strategic options (our)  
board of directors determined that it was in the best interest of 
our shareholders to accept Whitman's offer,'' said Franklin Crail, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Rocky Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed sale still requires shareholder approval, but Rocky  
Mountain said it expects the deal to close within the next few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory has been in business since  
1981. 
</P>
<P>
	It operates more than 200 stores and franchises in the United  
States, Canada and Asia, producing more than 2 million pounds of 
chocolate annually. The company had fiscal 1999 profits of $400,000 
on sales of $26.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 10, Whitman's Candies offered to pay $15 million for  
Rocky Mountain Chocolate, or $5.75 a share. At that time, Rocky 
Mountain's board stated that the tender offer was ``not in the best 
interests of Rocky Mountain or its shareholders.''

<HEADLINE> Bush May Be Deposed in Tobacco Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Five private lawyers who represented Texas in  
negotiations with the tobacco industry want to take a deposition 
from Gov. George W. Bush in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination  
next year, has criticized the attorneys for receiving a $3.3 
billion award for their work in the case, in which Texas is to 
receive $17.3 billion from tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys filed a motion Tuesday in U.S. District Court in  
Texarkana removing their objections to letting Bush enter the case 
but stating they want to question him at some point. The lawyers 
had asked U.S. District Judge David Folsom to speed their award of 
$3.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers also have a separate $2.3 billion fee claim against  
the state, which Texas Attorney General John Cornyn has called a 
``ransom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornyn claims the lawyers agreed to pick either the $3.3 billion  
award from a national arbitration panel or the claim against the 
state. The arbitration panel's award would be paid over an 
indefinite period of time, reducing its value. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush entered the fray, saying he would oppose any effort to  
collect money from Texas taxpayers and calling the lawyers' $3.3 
billion share of the state's settlement too large. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush, said late Tuesday that  
the governor's legal staff had not had time to read the motion and 
had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys -- John Eddie Williams and John O'Quinn of Houston,  
Walter Umphrey and Wayne Reaud of Beaumont, and Harold Nix of 
Daingerfield -- worked out their fee arrangement with former 
Attorney General Dan Morales, who hired them in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornyn's office is investigating the fee arrangement, and  
sources have told The Associated Press the FBI also is 
investigating. Morales' defenders have suggested the state 
investigation could be politically motivated: Bush and Cornyn are 
Republicans, Morales is a Democrat.

<HEADLINE> Violence May Delay East Timor Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- The United Nations is worried that an  
upsurge in violence could prevent a vote on independence in parts 
of East Timor, the world body's envoy said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Regions around the western towns of Maliana and Suai and the  
eastern town of Viqueque have suffered attacks by anti-independence 
militia groups, said Ian Martin, head of the U.N. Assistance 
Mission in East Timor, which is organizing the independence 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The security situation in these areas is less than ideal,''  
Martin told The Associated Press. ``The question of whether or not 
we can conduct polling there is real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If balloting in the regions must be postponed, it would be  
scheduled again as soon as conditions improve, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Martin expressed optimism that the Indonesian army and  
police will provide adequate security before the Aug. 30 vote, 
particularly in taking action against militiamen carrying weapons 
in public. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. and human rights organizations repeatedly have accused  
factions within the government and armed forces of attempting to 
derail the ballot through violence and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	They say authorities have organized and armed militants who have  
terrorized voters in the former Portuguese colony. Indonesia 
invaded the territory in 1975, triggering decades of civil strife 
and human rights abuses by the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``The East Timorese people live in a climate of terror and  
intimidation,'' Yayasan, Hak, a local human rights group said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless firm action is taken against anti-independence militias,  
``the East Timorese will be forced to participate in a ballot which 
is not free and not fair,'' the group said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The upcoming ballot will allow East Timor's 800,000 people to  
decide whether to remain part of Indonesia as an autonomous 
province or break away completely. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he was satisfied that government and military  
leaders in Jakarta were trying to fix the problems. But he 
expressed concern that lower- and middle-ranking officers in the 
field were not carrying out their orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some 2,000 opponents of independence staged a  
peaceful rally outside the governor's mansion in downtown Dili, the 
capital of East Timor. They carried banners and wore red-and-white 
headbands, the colors of the Indonesian flag.

<HEADLINE> Cable Show Chronicles a Wedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- As the bride put on her veil and nearly  
cried, the camera zoomed in and a producer asked how she felt. 
</P>
<P>
	When the groom played a pre-wedding round of golf with his best  
man, filmmakers sat in the back of the golf cart. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the couple visited the hospital where they were born  
three hours apart 26 years ago, that too was captured for national 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the five-person camera crew spent three days in July  
with Jill Curley and Ken Turley during the most important weekend 
of the Philadelphia couple's lives to create ``A Wedding Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show's first-person narration and intimate shots of how a  
marriage is made have helped ``A Wedding Story'' become one of the 
most popular shows on The Learning Channel. The 4-year-old series 
by Philadelphia-based Banyan Productions has spawned the network's 
No. 1 show, ``A Baby Story,'' the friends-focused ``Reunions'' and 
``A Dating Story,'' to debut this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just happy,'' said the bride's mother, Ann Curley, an  
avid fan of the show who urged her daughter to apply. ``I think she 
just really thought her story was romantic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show airs several times daily. Its ratings pale in  
comparison with top-ranked network shows, but still, it is one of 
the most watched daytime cable shows. It draws an impressive number 
of women aged 25 to 54 who tune in each afternoon to shed a tear at 
someone else's romance -- and sometimes to sneer at their choice of 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watch it to see the bride's dress, the bridesmaids' dresses,  
the flowers,'' said Brenda Chepolis, Jill Curley's maid of honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Jill Curley said she's more interested in how the couples got  
together. ``I like the first 15 minutes; I like hearing the 
stories.'' Her wedding is expected to air in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Wedding Story'' follows nearly the same formula during each  
30-minute episode. The couples talk about how they met and bring 
the filmmakers along while they water-ski, play touch football or 
go to their favorite restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the couple's own voice-over, the cameras track the  
traditional pre-wedding schedule: picking up the wedding dress; 
holding the rehearsal dinner; and going through the wedding morning 
activities -- including the obligatory shot of the bride's mother 
wiping her eyes as she compliments the wedding dress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want stories that people will say, `Aaaw,''' said executive  
producer Barbara Alfano-White. 
</P>
<P>
	Each show generally has ``a hook.'' One couple got married on  
horseback; another did it while skydiving. One couple won a ``Dream 
Wedding'' contest in New York City that included $70,000 in wedding 
prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	For a particularly dramatic wedding in San Diego, the groom --  
who was also a chef -- ran into trouble as he was making the wedding 
cake minutes before the reception. The pieces were shuttled in the 
back of a pickup truck -- along with a camera mounted in the 
truckbed -- and when Jason Holmes tried to put it together, the 
uneven top tier slipped off. 
</P>
<P>
	``That made for some dramatic moments,'' cameraman Darryl Rode  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes' cake was rescued by a cake-baking florist who covered it  
with freshly cut flowers. The cake disaster -- and the ``what did 
you expect'' response from most watchers -- have made the couple's 
wedding one of the more popular episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were walking with the dog just to go get coffee and this  
lady screams out the window, `Hey, I saw you guys on `A Wedding 
Story,''' Angela Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The show does not pay for any of the wedding, though some brides  
say they get better service from florists, hotels and bridal salons 
because of the publicity. Still, hundreds of couples write in each 
week eager to share intimate details of their courtship and planned 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 couples receive preliminary written applications, with  
finalists asked to send in videotapes. After phone interviews, some 
60 couples are chosen each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We select the stories that have something special -- the really  
good, classic love stories,'' Mrs. Alfano-White said. ``We're 
looking for a couple that can express themselves and their love for 
each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Holmes said she was spurred to apply by an interest in  
being different from some of the other shows she had seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched the show, and there's always this bride that's so  
neurotic about this perfect wedding. I knew I wasn't getting 
married for the wedding and thought it'd be a good contrast,'' said 
Mrs. Holmes, who was married in March at a military base in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	No taped weddings have ever ended without ``I do,'' though once  
a couple reported the wedding was canceled about a month before the 
crew was to arrive. The show does not keep track of whether couples 
stay married, but the producers hope their newlyweds fare at least 
a little better than average. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think because of the questions we ask the couples we pick,  
they have a better chance of making it,'' said producer Suzy Garra. 
``The people we pick are truly in love. If it's superficial love, 
then it will only take you so far in a 30-minute show.''

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves Likely To Keep Brandon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Free agent point guard Terrell Brandon was  
set to re-sign with the Minnesota Timberwolves today, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	A team spokesman would not comment on the signing Monday night,  
but did confirm the team would have a news conference at 11 a.m. 
CDT today to announce the signing of a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	According to WCCO-TV, Brandon was going to sign a six-year deal  
worth nearly $60 million. The Saint Paul Pioneer Press put the 
figure at $58 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon's agent, Bill Duffy, did not return phone calls from The  
Associated Press on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A first-round round draft pick out of Oregon by Cleveland in  
1991, Brandon was traded to Milwaukee in 1997. The Bucks sent him 
to Minnesota in a three-team, nine-player trade in March when it 
became apparent he would not re-sign with Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged 13.9 points and 8.6 assists last season, leading the  
NBA in assist-to-turnover ratio.

<HEADLINE> Raptors Win Rights to Radojevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- An arbitrator in England has ruled that Alek  
Radojevic, taken 12th overall in the NBA draft by Toronto, no 
longer has ties to a team in Yugoslavia and is free to join the 
Raptors, the club said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute between the Raptors and Buducnost of Yugoslavia was  
resolved under an arbitration procedure agreed upon by the NBA and 
FIBA, the world governing body of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Radojevic is a 7-foot-3 center who played at Barton County  
Community College last season. He averaged 15.4 points, 9.0 
rebounds and 4.0 blocked shots in 38 games with the junior college 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't win in their league without a talented big man and  
we expect Alek to develop into a valuable part of our team,'' 
Toronto coach Butch Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto drafted Radojevic knowing he was under contract to the  
Yugoslav team. He never played for Buducnost, however, and set his 
sights on the NBA instead.

<HEADLINE> HIV Mothers' Breastfeeding Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Babies of HIV-infected women have a 10 percent  
chance of getting the virus from their mothers if they breast-feed 
for two years, a study conducted in the African nation of Malawi 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is the first to show that mothers with the AIDS virus  
pass it along through their milk for as long as they breast feed. 
The risk is higher in the babies' early months, said the lead 
author, Dr. Paolo Miotti of the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Past studies have reported breast-feeding transmission rates of  
4 percent to 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Breast-feeding is not recommended for women with HIV in the  
United States, where infant formula is plentiful. In developing 
countries, where formula is scarce, the World Health Organization 
recommends women be informed of their risk and make their own 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, reported in today's Journal of the American Medical  
Association, involved 672 HIV-free newborns at a hospital. 
Forty-seven of the babies caught HIV from their mothers over two 
years of breast-feeding.

<HEADLINE> Two German Energy Giants in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Veba and Viag, two of Germany's largest energy  
firms, have confirmed that they held merger talks in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Viag's largest shareholder, the German state of Bavaria, said  
Monday that it was also involved in the talks, though a government 
spokesman refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger of the two diversified firms would create a new company  
with Germany's biggest electricity sales and a strong specialty 
chemicals business. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the website of the German business weekly  
WirtschaftsWoche said Bavaria wanted to start selling its 25.1 
percent stake in Viag to Veba by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavaria has said it wants to sell its stake in Viag, but has  
given no timeframe. One obstacle has been the location of the new 
company's headquarters, which Bavaria reportedly wants to have in 
Munich, where Viag is based. 
</P>
<P>
	A Viag spokeswoman said the three-way talks took place in early  
August and dealt with the companies' strategies in the German 
energy market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state of Bavaria wanted to know how the two companies  
would go forward in the changed market situation,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A source at Veba, speaking on condition of anonymity, also  
confirmed the talks.

<HEADLINE> TV Host Montel Williams Has MS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Talk show host Montel Williams held back tears  
as he revealed that he has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, 
a debilitating neurological disease that has no cure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how long I've had it for, but I've been  
misdiagnosed for 10 years,'' Williams, 43, said Monday at a 
Manhattan news conference. ``There have been some mornings when I 
thought it would be better if I stayed in bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he vowed: ``This disease is not going to stop me.''  
</P>
<P>
	The host of the nationally syndicated ``Montel Williams Show,''  
which has been on the air for eight seasons, said he will continue 
to work as long as he is physically able. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a former naval officer who vaulted into television  
after a career as a motivational speaker, said he recently informed 
his immediate family of his condition and told his staff Monday, 
shortly before the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	His physician, Dr. Michael Olek, said they have been discussing  
several recently approved drug therapies. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his illness, Williams said he had been working  
18-hour days to direct his first feature film, a drama titled 
``Little Pieces.'' He maintained his commitment to his career as a 
talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if this gets worse in five or 10 years from now, I will  
still force myself out of my bed,'' said Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest part Montel has with this disease is not having  
control,'' his wife, Grace, said. ``He's had control of everything 
in his life, from being a naval officer to his talk show.'' She 
allowed herself a joke, adding, ``But not his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's got control there,'' agreed Williams, kissing his wife.  
</P>
<P>
	About 300,000 Americans have MS. They have such symptoms as  
unusual tiredness, loss of balance and muscle coordination, slurred 
speech, tremors and difficulty walking. In severe cases, they are 
partly or completely paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams announced the creation of a multiple sclerosis research  
fund. He said he hoped his coming forward ``will maybe increase 
people's donations so that in the next five years we can cure 
this.''

<HEADLINE> Giants' Petitgout Back to Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Left guard Lance Scott sprained his right  
knee in practice on Tuesday afternoon, opening a position on the 
New York Giants' offensive line for first-round draft pick Luke 
Petitgout. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who apparently nailed down the starting job Monday,  
sprained his medial collateral ligament during a 7-on-7 passing 
drill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just heard it,'' quarterback Kent Graham said. ``Someone  
just came right at his leg. I just heard him screaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury comes just one day after coach Jim Fassel moved  
Petitgout from the backup left guard to backup right tackle because 
starter Scott Gragg was not performing up to par. 
</P>
<P>
	The move ended as soon as Scott was hurt. For the rest of the  
practice, Petitgout played left guard with the first team. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, also the snapper on punts and field goals, was carted off  
the field. An MRI was planned at a local facility Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Russell Warren, the Giants' orthopedic surgeon, will examine  
Scott at the University at Albany training camp Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel guessed Scott could be out as little as two weeks, but he  
said Warren's examination would tell more. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup guard Jason Whittle and tight ends Pete Mitchell and Todd  
Pollack are the other snappers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel said Scott and Petitgout were both playing well, noting  
he moved Petitgout to tackle in an attempt to get his best five 
players on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was happy with their progress,'' Fassel said. ``They both  
started slow and they were getting better. They were kind of in the 
same category. I think Lance was doing a good job. Lance was 
holding the job, so I wasn't going to replace him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gragg was the player on the spot until the injury. Called for a  
couple of illegal procedures in the opening two preseason games, he 
miffed the coaching staff. Then he blew three blocking assignments 
on Saturday night against Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott started at center the past two years, but he was moved to  
guard with the return of longtime center Brian Williams from an eye 
injury and the loss of guard Greg Bishop to free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott appeared to be blocking rookie Ryan Hale, while Williams  
took on Christian Peter, when the injury occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he kind of got slung down on a routine play,'' Hale  
said. ``I don't know if I landed on him or who landed on him. All I 
know is when I got up he was hurt. I feel terrible.''

<HEADLINE> Who's To Blame for Investor Hype? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) --The decade long bull market has been a boon for  
the financial publishing industry. But do the scores of magazines, 
newsletters and Web sites devoted to mutual funds really serve the 
best interests of investors? 
</P>
<P>
	Professional fund advisers warn that the information barrage can  
have a negative impact in that many publications attempt to lift 
themselves above the pack by promoting a get-rich-quick attitude 
among investors. 
</P>
<P>
	A popular tactic for grabbing attention is by touting endless  
Top 10 performer lists, which can lead inexperienced investors to 
second guess their portfolios and jump all over the map in an 
effort to catch the latest trend. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Burt Greenwald, a Philadelphia-based mutual fund  
consultant, estimated that the average length of time an investor 
holds a mutual fund has fallen in the past decade from seven to 10 
years to two to four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Many financial publications track the mutual fund industry on a  
monthly basis, Greenwald said, publishing articles and lists that 
promote the most recent performances of high-flying funds. ``That's 
madness,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwald cited the recent explosive popularity of Janus funds  
as an example of how investors can get burned by jumping on the 
bandwagon. Money poured into Janus funds after several years of 
extraordinary performances and a lot of media attention, he said. 
But when the stock market's mood shifted earlier this year and 
large stocks fell out favor, Janus' performance fell, hurting 
investors who had jumped into the funds late. ``People are buying 
after the fact,'' Greenwald said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these magazines look at the funds du jour or the  
strategy du jour. But most people should resist that type of 
temptation,'' added Jack Piazza, managing principal of Sensible 
Investment Strategies, a Wheaton, Ill., investment advisory firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza said shifting money from one fund to another makes little  
sense because the fees and taxes assessed when money is transferred 
in and out of mutual funds is likely to offset any slight 
performance gain the investor might reap. 
</P>
<P>
	``On an after-tax basis, you're probably losing money anyway. So  
what's the point,'' he said, adding that a long-term strategy that 
includes a diverse investment portfolio is still the time-tested 
method for fulfilling financial goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Another common mistake made by investors overloaded on  
information is to add to their portfolios hot funds that 
essentially duplicate funds they already own. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Wiener, who manages $150 million in Vanguard funds as  
president of Adviser Investment Management, said many of the 
hundreds of index funds available to investors include essentially 
the same stocks. But some investors mistakenly believe that if 
owning one type of successful fund is good, than ``owning three 
(similar funds) must be better,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fund advisers agree that too much of a good thing can be a  
negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than adding to their portfolios, investors should instead  
be looking at the funds they currently own that need to be 
unloaded, said Doug Fabian, a Huntington Beach, Calif., investment 
adviser and author of a recent online article at 
MutualFundFlash.com titled ``Top Five Reasons to Ignore Top Ten 
Lists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reason number four states, ``Top Ten Funds Hold Similar Stocks  
from the Same Sectors,'' and notes that the list of best performing 
funds from July 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999 was loaded with 
technology funds. Holding more than one of those funds amounts to 
duplication and leaves investors overexposed to technology, Fabian 
explained in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of spending money on a buffet of different funds with  
similar holdings, investors should simply buy more shares of the 
successful funds they already own. ``Top Ten lists are cocktail 
conversation,'' Fabian said. ``Investors should find a strategy and 
stick with that strategy.''

<HEADLINE> Miller Park Repairs Will Cost $50M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- It will cost $50 million to $75 million to  
repair the damage caused when a 567-foot crane collapsed on the 
partially-built Miller Park, a stadium board official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That estimate includes materials such as steel and concrete,  
labor, transportation, architectural and engineering fees, 
specialized equipment, and demolition and debris removal, stadium 
board chairman Bob Trunzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the board will meet Wednesday to approve an  
additional $42 million to cover the repairs and the City of 
Milwaukee's infrastructure payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrowing that money will allow the project to continue with a  
three-month delay, and it will not impact taxpayers because the 
project's insurance carrier will reimburse it, Trunzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miller Park project is estimated to cost $400 million,  
according to an estimate by the Legislative Audit Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's announcement was the first official assessment of  
damage from the July 14 accident that killed three ironworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers are insured for up to $20 million for revenue they  
might lose because of a delayed opening. Officials haven't been 
able to determine if the ballpark will ready for opening day next 
season.

<HEADLINE> Transgender Librarian in Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A battle is brewing over whether a school  
librarian who was once named David but is now called Debra can use 
the women's restroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Debra Davis, who had been employed in Minneapolis' public  
schools for almost 28 years as David Nielson, has been working as a 
woman since last year at Southwest High. 
</P>
<P>
	She is considered transgender, which usually describes people  
who live and dress as the opposite sex but have not necessarily 
undergone a sex change. Davis has not said whether she has had 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher, Carla Cruzan, filed a complaint with the state in  
October about having to share the bathroom with Davis. ``I have a 
right to privacy and modesty which the school district must 
respect,'' Cruzan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Center for Law and Justice, founded in 1990 by  
religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, sent a letter Monday on 
Cruzan's behalf to the state Human Rights Department. The Virginia 
Beach, Va.-based group asked that Cruzan get a prompt hearing and 
that Davis be banned from the women's restroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said she is using the proper bathroom and has no plans to  
change: ``It's too bad people are so unaccepting and intolerant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota is the only state that affords protection by law to  
those who identify themselves as transgender. 
</P>
<P>
	Principal Robert McCauley said, ``To our best knowledge, we are  
operating within the law.''

<HEADLINE> Italian To Finish Prison at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An Italian woman was permitted Tuesday to return  
to her country to finish a prison term for helping plot armed 
robberies to fund leftist terrorists in the United States, 
including one robbery that left a guard and two policemen dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll have to come to Italy -- have a big vacation,'' Silvia  
Baraldini told supporters in the federal courtroom where the 
transfer was approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Elizabeth Fink, said Tuesday was the culmination of  
a bitter fight to win a transfer to Italy, where her supporters 
hope to win her freedom sooner than a 2008 scheduled release date. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the end, the United States government did everything in  
their power to make her life miserable,'' Fink said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baraldini, 51, was to leave the United States on an Italian  
state plane and arrive in Italy Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Justice said Baraldini was permitted to return  
to Italy only after that country guaranteed she would serve the 
remaining nine years of her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Baraldini has served 16 years of a 40-year sentence on  
conspiracy and racketeering charges. She is scheduled for mandatory 
release in 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say she participated in a string of 16 robberies and  
attempted robberies that included the 1981 holdup of a Brinks truck 
near Nyack, N.Y. A guard and two police officers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	She was also convicted of kidnapping prison guards during the  
1979 escape of a Black Liberation Army leader, Joanne Chesimard. 
Chesimard, who was serving a life sentence for killing a New Jersey 
state trooper, received asylum in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States had rejected five previous requests from Italy  
for Baraldini's release. An obstacle was removed a month ago when 
an appeals court in Rome formally recognized U.S. prison sentences.

<HEADLINE> Burglar Sues Homeowner for Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEVILLE, Mich. (AP) -- A man who broke into a house is suing  
the owner, saying she was responsible for the beating he took when 
he returned to the home the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassidy L. VanHorn, 21, suffered two broken arms, a broken jaw  
and other injuries in the July 1997 attack at the home of Diana 
Folbigg, his attorney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	VanHorn is seeking at least $25,000 in damages.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Ms. Folbigg did not take part in the attack, she owed a  
duty to VanHorn to provide a safe environment at her home when she 
``lured'' him back, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said: `Come on back, forget about what happened ... Let's  
party,''' lawyer David Femminineo said. ``He's kind of slow, not 
the most intelligent guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived and arrested VanHorn along with one of his  
attackers. That man pleaded guilty to assault and battery. 
</P>
<P>
	VanHorn later pleaded guilty to breaking and entering and to an  
assault and battery charge, and spent 85 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Folbigg's lawyer did not return telephone messages left at  
his office.

<HEADLINE> Bears Pick Up Burton From Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- The Chicago Bears on Tuesday claimed  
defensive lineman Shane Burton off waivers, a day after he was cut 
by the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, 25, started eight games as a rookie in 1996 and four  
games in 1997, but the 6-foot-6, 305-pounder slipped to third team 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins wanted to cut his salary, but the Bears agreed to  
the full $934,000, Burton's agent, Drew Rosenhaus said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to work out really well for Shane. He's going to  
make more money than the Dolphins were willing to pay him, and he's 
going to get more playing time,'' the agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton has played both end and inside on the defensive line, and  
Rosenhaus said the Bears are going to take a look at him at both. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Burton had 23 tackles and two sacks in 15 games.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Thurmond To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Strom Thurmond, the oldest member of  
Congress at 96, has decided to undergo prostate surgery several 
months earlier than planned after he was hospitalized following a 
collapse last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly I think he's relieved to get this procedure out of the  
way and get some relief,'' Thurmond spokesman John DeCrosta said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond, R-S.C., entered Walter Reed Army Medical Center Sunday  
night complaining of tiredness after a busy schedule in South 
Carolina, a statement from his office said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was released from a Columbia hospital Friday night after  
tests following his collapse earlier that day at a reception at the 
University of South Carolina. He appeared unsteady as he left the 
hospital, but he continued his weekend schedule, which included a 
wedding for a former aide in Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Thurmond decided to go ahead with his  
prostate surgery because the chronically enlarged gland had given 
him more trouble in recent months. The surgery had been scheduled 
for November but now will be done Wednesday. He is expected to 
remain hospitalized through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	DeCrosta said that Thurmond was in good spirits while awaiting  
the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I spoke to him this morning he certainly sounded strong  
and chipper,'' DeCrosta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond was first elected to the Senate in 1954 and became the  
oldest person to serve in Congress at age 93. At 94 he became the 
longest-serving senator ever. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been hospitalized briefly several times in recent years,  
including for a day in Washington after he became dizzy in October 
1997. He also spent several days in a military hospital for a 
respiratory infection that December and earlier that year was 
hospitalized in Washington recovering from the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	DeCrosta said the senator received his annual physical at the  
Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston last week and 
was pronounced healthy.

<HEADLINE> Purdue's Offense Looks Like a Brees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The line starts forming whenever word gets out that Drew Brees  
is home. 
</P>
<P>
	Big kids and little kids, budding athletes, and even a few who  
still trip over their feet. From all over the Austin, Texas, 
neighborhood they come to the Brees doorstep, asking for their 
buddy. It doesn't matter that he's twice their age. Or twice their 
size. 
</P>
<P>
	``They come and knock on our door and say, `Can Drew come out  
and play?''' his father, Chip, said with a laugh. ``He gets out 
there and plays touch football with the kids. He's the designated 
quarterback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guy nobody wanted out of high school is everybody's favorite  
quarterback these days. He turned the Big Ten upside down with his 
3,983 yards passing and 39 touchdowns last season, and the Kansas 
State Wildcats still haven't figured out how he beat them in the 
Alamo Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the quarterback for No. 23 Purdue is a Heisman Trophy  
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never would have thought. Uh-uh,'' he said. ``It's kind of  
overwhelming at times. But it doesn't mean anything unless you go 
out and prove you're worthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a position I want to be in,'' he added. ``I want to be in  
a leadership position. I want to be in a position where it's on me 
to make decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brees seemed destined to be a big-time quarterback. His  
grandfather, Ray Akins, is one of the winningest coaches in Texas, 
a state where prep football ranks right up there with eating and 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	His uncle, Marty Akins, was a standout quarterback at Texas. And  
Brees and his younger brother, Reid, were playing the game as soon 
as they could walk. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they'd had their way, they'd be outside playing with the  
ball 24 hours a day,'' Chip Brees said. ``It just seemed natural 
for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Football wasn't Brees' only sport. He played baseball and  
basketball in high school and was once one of the top-ranked junior 
tennis players in Texas. But he loved football the best, and 
whenever he played, he had to be quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like being in control, having the ball in your hands,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't play tackle football until high school. His middle  
school only had a flag team, and while there was a public league, 
most of Brees' buddies were playing flag football. 
</P>
<P>
	He was too big for the public league, anyway.  
</P>
<P>
	``Only by three pounds,'' he said. ``But they weigh you before  
each game to make sure you make the weight limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he got to Austin Westlake High School, opponents wished  
there was still a weight limit. Austin Westlake went 28-0-1 in 
Brees' junior and senior years in Class 5A, the toughest in Texas. 
He threw for 5,461 yards and 50 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	But while his teammates got phone calls and letters from schools  
nationwide, no one seemed to want Brees. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it was the knee injury during the playoffs in his junior  
year, although he did lead Austin Westlake to a 16-0 record and the 
Class 5A title the next season. Maybe it was his lack of a quick 
release. Maybe it was being only 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reason, Texas wasn't interested. Neither was Texas  
A&AMP;M, his parents' alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he got a call from Joe Tiller, who was taking his  
``basketball-on-grass'' offense from Wyoming to Purdue. Brees had 
watched Wyoming play once that year and remembered that offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember thinking, `They're throwing the ball a heck of a  
lot, that would be kind of fun to play in,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He visited Purdue and Kentucky, where his host was Tim Couch.  
Purdue's academics -- the industrial management major retook an 
accounting class this summer so he'd have a shot at academic 
All-American -- and the Big Ten's history won out. 
</P>
<P>
	He played sparingly his freshman year, enough to show he was  
picking up the offense but not enough to win Tiller over 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went out and recruited a junior college quarterback. True  
story,'' Tiller said. ``We thought, `Hey, we like this young guy, 
but he's a young guy. Will he be able to handle it or won't he?''' 
</P>
<P>
	In a word, yes. By the time that junior college quarterback  
arrived, the job was Brees' and no one was taking it away from him. 
In just his fifth game, he threw for 522 yards and six touchdowns 
against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yards just kept compiling, you didn't even realize it,'' he  
said. ``It was like playing catch out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next week, at Wisconsin, he set NCAA records with 55  
completions and 83 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, everyone was talking about Brees.  
</P>
<P>
	``He just started so fast,'' Tiller said. ``If we were surprised  
at anything, it's the way he started and carried on from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Alamo Bowl against K-State, he took the Boilermakers 80  
yards in the final minute to upset the Wildcats 37-34. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what really started the Heisman hype, a subject Brees  
hates. Ask him about volunteering at a local grade school each 
week. Ask him about his family. Ask him about his fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ask him about anything else. Please.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's just a down-to-earth guy,'' Tiller said. ``He likes to be  
thought of as one of the good guys. If he was to write a 
biographical sketch of himself he'd like to say, `I'm a good guy.' 
He's a refreshing guy to be around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The kids in Brees' neighborhood agree.

<HEADLINE> Car Strikes Teen, Body Carried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- A bicyclist was struck and killed by a  
car moving so fast that his friends didn't know what happened, and 
his body apparently was carried on the car for 13 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	A damaged car believed to have been involved in the hit-and-run  
accident was found today, and police were seeking the owner, who 
also may have been involved in an earlier accident that injured 
another bicyclist. 
</P>
<P>
	John Lee LaBord, 18, of Orange was struck late Sunday while  
riding his bicycle home from work at a shoe store. He had just 
greeted friends who were walking nearby when a small car ran into 
him, said Sgt. Joe Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accident happened so quickly that nobody saw what kind of  
vehicle it was,'' Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They looked around and saw the crumpled bike and a sneaker,  
but not the victim,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBord's body was found early Monday along a highway about 13  
miles away. Officials said it may have been lodged in the car's 
windshield. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the force of the impact, the entire right side of the  
windshield was caved in,'' Vargas said. The car was found several 
miles from where the body was found. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was to be conducted to determine when LaBord died and  
whether he could have survived if he had been treated right away, 
Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas said the car belongs to Isidro Calderon Hernandez, 26,  
believed to be a resident of both Anaheim and Buena Park. Hernandez 
also was believed to have been involved in a hit-and-run accident 
May 22 in which another bicyclist suffered scrapes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the same vehicle and same suspect,'' Vargas said.  
</P>
<P>
	LaBord had been scheduled to start his first day of classes  
today at Santa Ana College, relatives said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vacation: Read, Rest, Sun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- No fund-raisers, no parties, no dinner  
out. The president read. The first lady nursed a summer cold. They 
joined their daughter on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday was a quiet, relaxed vacation day for Bill, Hillary and  
Chelsea Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House press office brushed aside attempts to stir  
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Washington, a spokesman for the White House counsel's  
office told a newspaper that, as was said during his 1992 campaign, 
the president had never used cocaine. Not once. 
</P>
<P>
	At the vacation press center on the Massachusetts island of  
Martha's Vineyard, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said 
the denial of cocaine use was ``both authorized and accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart had told reporters on Monday that the president has  
expressed no interest in news stories discussing whether Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential 
nomination, ever used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the cigar. The White House spokesman said it  
wasn't lit. 
</P>
<P>
	Enterprising photographers snapped the president Monday on the  
second hole of the Farm Neck golf club here chomping on a large 
stogie. A story said he had lit it and was puffing on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen the president light a cigar,'' Lockhart said  
when asked about it. ``I've seen him, obviously, chew on the end of 
it. I don't think he had a lit cigar. I've seen the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no smoking gun, as the case may be.''  
</P>
<P>
	After five straight nights of fund-raisers and social  
engagements, the Clintons spent the night at their borrowed Oyster 
Pond vacation home. Lockhart described the first lady's nagging 
summer cold as ``nothing serious'' and said that when he saw the 
Clintons, they were on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the Clintons wanted to unwind and relax before  
heading to New York state this weekend for a busy round of money 
raising for Democrats generally and for the first lady's 
near-certain run for a New York Senate seat in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll try to enjoy themselves as well as they begin their  
second vacation week in the Hamptons on Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect he'll have some time to relax there and enjoy the  
wonderful, natural surroundings,'' Lockhart said. ``The ocean, the 
beach and potentially some fine golf courses.''

<HEADLINE> Mazel Trick To Miss Pacific Classic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Mazel Trick, the probable favorite in  
Sunday's $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar, was injured Tuesday 
morning in his final prep and will miss the ninth running of the 
1 1/4-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky-bred chestnut colt was in the midst of a  
five-furlong workout when he was pulled up on the far turn by 
jockey Chris McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
	Transported to trainer Bobby Frankel's barn by horse ambulance,  
Mazel Trick was diagnosed by veterinarians to have suffered 
fractured sesamoids in his right foreleg. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is not believed to be life threatening, but the  
4-year-old son of Phone Trick will undergo surgery, perhaps as soon 
as Wednesday, a Del Mar spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers said Mazel Trick was injured when he seemed to take a  
bad step on the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazel Trick most recently won the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar  
on Aug. 7 by six lengths in 1:40 3-5 for his fourth straight 
victory since Frankel transferred him from grass to dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazel Trick has won six of his 10 lifetime starts and earned  
$435,662. 
</P>
<P>
	The defection of Mazel Trick will probably make Malek the  
favorite in the Classic, won last year by Free House in 2:00 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Other probable starters are General Challenge, Lazy Lode, River  
Keen, Jack Grandi, Smile Again and Barter Town, who is also trained 
by Frankel.

<HEADLINE> Bush Plan Spurs Faster Federal Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's opponents will benefit from  
his record-setting fund raising because, with Bush forgoing 
taxpayer aid for his campaign, other candidates will get more of 
their money sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor -- who raised $37 million through midyear,  
more than all the other Republican primary candidates combined -- 
decided to give up federal matching funds for presidential 
candidates to avoid spending limits tied to them. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Federal Election Commission now says it will  
have enough money to give the other Republican and Democratic 
primary candidates all of their matching funds by next July, 
instead of making them wait until April 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 1, when the first payments are scheduled, the FEC will  
be able to give candidates 39 percent of the federal aid they are 
entitled to, rather than the 32 percent projected had Bush applied 
for a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a bigger share of the money sooner means candidates will  
be able to borrow less money against their total expected federal 
funds, reducing interest costs and giving them more to spend as the 
first caucuses and primaries are held. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means our anticipated bridge loan will be a slightly  
smaller bridge loan,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for 
Elizabeth Dole, one of five candidates so far to qualify for 
federal matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The others are Gary Bauer, Bill Bradley, John McCain and Dan  
Quayle. Vice President Al Gore also has said he will apply for 
matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC said it will have to pay out around $82 million in  
federal funds to presidential candidates instead of the $99 million 
originally expected now that Bush isn't accepting matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, who is largely paying for his campaign out of his  
pocket, is the only other major party candidate forgoing federal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government matches the first $250 of individual  
contributions to candidates who agree to limit spending. Candidates 
become eligible for federal funding by raising at least $5,000 in 
20 different states from individuals contributing no more than $250 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is separate from public funding of general election  
campaigns, which Bush could still accept if he becomes his party's 
nominee.

<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Mihaela Melinte of Romania won the first  
women's hammer throw gold medal at the World Championships today, 
beating Russian Olga Kuzenkova. Lisa Misipeka of American Samoa 
took the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Melinte, the world record holder, took the lead from her first  
throw, steadily improving to win with a throw of 246 feet, 9 inches 
on her last attempt. Kuzenkova was the only other woman to break 
the 70-meter mark, winning silver with 238 feet, 1 inch on her last 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Melinte had set a world record of 249, 2 1/2 on May 13 in Rome.  
</P>
<P>
	Melinte is the 24-year-old daughter of a shot putter.  
</P>
<P>
	Because it was the first time the event was held at the  
championships, the winner won only $30,000, half the customary 
amount.

<HEADLINE> City Wants Hearing on Chronicle Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Board of Supervisors and  
Mayor Willie Brown are asking the U.S. Justice Department to get 
community input as it considers antitrust issues raised by the sale 
of the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials say the sale could deprive the city of newspaper  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hearst Corp. is trying to sell its newspaper, the San  
Francisco Examiner, to a qualified buyer. If no buyer is found, the 
afternoon Examiner would be merged into the morning Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	In an Aug. 20 letter to U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, Brown  
offered the city's help in finding potential reasons to block the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``I offer the city's full cooperation and assistance in your  
department's investigation of the potential anti-competitive 
effects caused by the proposed merger,'' wrote Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Supervisors asked the Justice Department to hold  
public hearings on the proposed sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hearst promised not to lay off employees, the  
supervisors passed a resolution Monday asking the Justice 
Department to legally block any job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department had no comment on the city officials'  
request. No public hearings are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're basically asking the attorney general to do  
her job, and I have every confidence she will,'' Examiner Publisher 
Timothy White said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department can block a merger of the papers, which  
would end a government-approved joint operating agreement under 
which the Chronicle and Examiner share some business and production 
departments.

<HEADLINE> Bennett Apologizes to Black Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sen. Bob Bennett said he didn't mean to  
offend anyone when he predicted that George W. Bush will be the GOP 
presidential nominee unless ``some black woman comes forward with 
an illegitimate child that he fathered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I make a mistake, it's a beaut,'' Bennett, R-Utah, said  
Monday after a private meeting with civil rights leaders. ``There's 
no question this was a mistake. I had no intention of offending 
anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett had said he regretted making the ``clumsy'' remark to  
the editorial board of the Standard-Examiner newspaper in Ogden on 
Aug. 13. Bennett said he was thinking of the movie ``Primary 
Colors'' and its portrayal of a fictional Southern governor's 
womanizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless George W. steps in front of a bus or some woman comes  
forward, let's say some black woman comes forward with an 
illegitimate child that he fathered within the last 18 months, or 
some other scenario that you could be equally creative in thinking 
of, George W. Bush will be the nominee,'' Bennett told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was simply a clinical description of the state of politics  
in America, but it was not received that way, and I should have 
been smart enough to realize it probably would not be received that 
way,'' Bennett said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told him that was a very poor excuse,'' Jeanetta Williams,  
president of the NAACP's Salt Lake City branch, said after meeting 
with Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only Sen. Bennett can give you a clear explanation about what  
was in his mind,'' said Edward L. Lewis Jr., president of the 
NAACP's Utah, Idaho and Nevada branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of  
Colored People also are upset with comments made by Utah's other 
Republican senator, Orrin Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	``People of color can't do anything about their color,'' Hatch  
said recently. ``But I do believe gay people have a choice to live 
within the legal rules or not. It's up to them, they do have a 
choice, where an African-American has no choice with regard to the 
color of their skin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Lewis criticized Hatch for contrasting gays and  
blacks in terms of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not equate being gay or being lesbian with 300 years of  
slavery and being black in America. It is not the same thing,'' 
Lewis said. ``However, we do feel that everyone should have their 
civil rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch was hosting a golf tournament and was not immediately  
available for comment Monday. His spokeswoman, Heather Barney, said 
Hatch has ``done an awful lot for the minorities' communities and 
he takes his responsibilities very seriously in representing 
everyone in Utah.''

<HEADLINE> While Clinton Away, Work Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton away on vacation, White  
House employees took advantage of the less-hectic schedule to 
spruce up the place -- and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	A few of Clinton's top aides got haircuts. Work crews,  
meanwhile, refurbished West Wing offices and a formal lobby this 
week, removing heavy oil paintings and carpets to patch and paint. 
</P>
<P>
	Some senior aides scheduled getaways to coincide with President  
Clinton's two-week family vacation in Martha's Vineyard and New 
York State. Other staffers remained in Washington with decidedly 
more leisurely schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, where a 12-hour workday is considered normal  
and top staff carry cell phones and pagers for those 4 a.m. 
presidential queries, the slower pace means a less formal dress 
code and a little extra snooze time in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The first, small meeting of the president's closest aides begins  
at 8:15 a.m., a half hour later than normal. The larger, general 
staff meeting is pushed back an hour to 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nine o'clock meeting is a little bit shorter,'' than  
usual, deputy White House spokesman Barry Toiv said. ``No, it's a 
lot shorter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So short, in fact, that a tardy staffer who arrived at 9:06 a.m.  
on Monday was only there in time to catch a bit of grief before 
chief of staff John Podesta adjourned the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta used the first weekend of Clinton's trip to visit the  
barber. Apparently fearing it might be a long while until he had 
another chance, Podesta showed up Monday morning with only the 
barest hint of stubble on his tanned pate. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other senior male staffers who had weekend shearings  
were Toiv and fellow deputy spokesman Jake Siewert. 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv went the haircut one better and shaved his mustache for the  
first time in 20 years -- a bit of a shock for his wife and children 
who had never seen him without it. 
</P>
<P>
	His boss, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, took vacation  
ahead of the Clinton family trip, and is now on duty shepherding 
reporters around Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy chief of staff Maria Echaveste took advantage of the  
Clinton vacation to get married. 
</P>
<P>
	Others decided to get out of the country for a while.  
Communications director Loretta Ucelli headed to Rome. Domestic 
policy adviser Bruce Reed was in Australia for 10 days. Senior 
adviser Doug Sosnik packed off to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the White House's most notoriously hardworking aide --  
economic guru Gene Sperling -- was getting out of town. But Sperling 
may have missed a memo. Someone should tell him that a Federal 
Reserve conference -- even in chic Jackson Hole, Wyo. -- is not a 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the exodus of a good portion of the White House staff of  
1,500, the place runs pretty much as usual. The tight security 
around the building remains in force, the lawns and gardens are 
tended as always and long lines of tourists still wait their turn 
for a tour of the White House public rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly out of tourists' view, the painters are at work and the  
quiet is pierced by the bang and whine of construction equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're doing a lot of ... basic maintenance on the systems, a  
lot of painting,'' spokesman Siewert said. ``A lot of deep cleaning 
they can't do with people in the building.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Campaigns in Lap of Luxury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore can stretch out on a sleeper sofa in  
his private cabin aboard Air Force Two. Bill Bradley must fold his 
6-foot-5 frame into a coach seat, or dip into his own frequent 
flier miles to upgrade to first class. 
</P>
<P>
	From motorcades that make traffic tie-ups melt away to  
tax-policy help from the White House's economic adviser, the perks 
of the vice presidency give Gore advantages over the former New 
Jersey senator and pro basketball star in the chase for the 
Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gore has to catch a campaign flight, a Marine helicopter  
whisks him from his official residence at the Naval Observatory, 
flying high above Washington's infamous congestion for the 20-mile 
trip to Andrews Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	A campaign aide drives Bradley to Newark Airport in a rented,  
beige Chevy Corsica. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, Florida and elsewhere, local police clear highways to  
speed Gore's motorcade along. A White House photographer snaps 
souvenir shots for local VIPs. If it's a political trip, the 
campaign reimburses the government per photo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole remembers feeling outclassed by the perks of incumbency  
-- first in his 1988 primary campaign against Vice President George 
Bush, and again in 1996 when he challenged President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's intimidating. People go out just to see (Air Force One)  
land and then we'd pull in with our little twin-engine,'' Dole 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	TV journalists on the Gore beat often file their reports from  
beside the White House's North Portico, Dole noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows this guy must be presidential. The other candidates  
are standing out in the corn field, or whatever. All these things 
add up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So do the costs:  
</P>
<P>
	-- $622.14 for a round-trip helicopter shuttle between home and  
Andrews. Gore, who could opt for a cheaper limo ride, took 14 of 
those chopper trips for campaign purposes during April, May and 
June, according to his latest quarterly filing with the Federal 
Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	-- First-class commercial fares reimbursed to the U.S. Treasury  
for each seat that Gore and his aides, excluding Secret Service and 
military personnel, occupy on Air Force Two. On the well-traveled 
route between Washington and Des Moines, Iowa, that fare recently 
listed at $689 one way. Not that the ride isn't first class. Each 
wide leather seat has a footrest and a telephone. There are free 
movies -- and a photocopier in the rear cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in the first six months of this year cost Gore $8.3  
million to the $4.3 million that Bradley spent. Gore's 120 or so 
campaign aides -- helped at times by about 70 White House staffers -- 
outnumber Bradley's team of some 80 paid aides. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sperling, head of the president's National Economic  
Council, helped Gore develop the tax cut plan he proposed in July. 
The rule on this crossover help, Gore aides said, is that 
government-paid workers can volunteer time to the campaign as long 
as they log 40 hours on official duties each week. 
</P>
<P>
	There may be a political price to incumbency.  
</P>
<P>
	In early states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, where candidates  
must mix with voters, the Secret Service can be an unwanted buffer. 
And official business can eat into a campaign schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley ``has a natural advantage in this process,'' said Iowa's  
Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack, who's neutral but whose wife endorses 
Gore. ``He can spend more time and the time he spends is more 
personal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Bradley's West Orange, N.J., headquarters, campaign manager  
Gina Glantz, whose cell phone rings to the tune of the ``Lone 
Ranger'' theme, framed the race as ``corporate culture vs. scrappy 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The keeper of the bottom line, Glantz all but boasts of  
traveling staffers' complaints that, even in budget motels, they 
have to double up and share rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidate, who gets his own room -- sometimes in a separate,  
nicer hotel, Glantz allowed -- did not have his own work space at 
first. Until the campaign moved its headquarters from nearby 
Newark, Bradley shared an office with Glantz and campaign chairman 
Doug Berman. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Gore advantages do trouble Glantz. As Clinton's preferred  
successor, the vice president gets the political goodies -- federal 
disaster aid, child care grants, environmental preservation money -- 
to dispense along the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's the power of the government and his ability to do  
things for people. We can't announce government programs,'' Glantz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the incumbent's most potent tool, said Bob Teeter, a  
Republican pollster who worked for Bush when he was vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gore courted union leaders for their endorsement, he  
invited them to the West Wing and to his impressive residence at 
the Naval Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can get people involved in White House events to curry  
favor,'' Teeter said. ``That has a certain cachet to it, a lot of 
prestige and stature.''

	CARLTON, Pa. (AP) -- A 17-year-old boy gave minors alcohol he  
made with a still built according to a design he found on the 
Internet, state police said.

<P>
	The boy, whose name was not released, is accused of using the  
stainless-steel still to make moonshine whiskey and to turn wine

concoctions.

<HEADLINE> Real Grass To Debut at Superdome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- An experiment in sports horticulture unfolded  
Tuesday in the Superdome, where an Alabama company installed real 
grass on which the Saints and Packers will play Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real test will be when the players start cutting and  
turning on it in practice and on game day,'' Saints general manager 
Bill Kuharich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints paid $30,000 for 28 semi-trailers to truck the 90,000  
square feet of turf to the Superdome. It took crews all day to roll 
out the 300 sections of a ``natural grass rug'' developed by 
Southern Turf Nurseries of Robertsdale, Ala., onto the dome's 
cement floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Each section of grass measures 8 feet wide and 50 feet long and  
is 100 to 120 days old. A special machine unrolled it, because each 
section also weighs up to 8,000 pounds. Using rakes, workers then 
merged each section together, pushing and pulling until the grass 
fit like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL is supervising the installation because the Superdome's  
groundskeepers have no experience with grass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints won't get to practice on it until Thursday; Green Bay  
gets its shot on Friday. After Saturday's exhibition game, workers 
will roll up the field and truck the sections back to Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	The company hopes to prove the removable grass could be just as  
easily shipped to a field near New Orleans, rejuvenated by sun and 
water, and returned to the Superdome for every home game. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Thornton, who manages the dome, said officials were using  
this week's experiment to assess the feasibility of using the grass 
for an entire season and to assess the conversion time and labor 
costs involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to evaluate just how effective using this would be on  
an ongoing basis,'' he said. ``People forget, the Superdome is more 
than just a football stadium. It's a convention center and an 
arena. If we're able to minimize the conversion time and if it's 
cost effective, I could see using this field again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Barnett, a spokeswoman for Southern Turf Nurseries, said  
the field laid down Tuesday will last at least 11 days. ``It could 
probably survive longer, we just haven't tested it past that 
point,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Woerner, STN's owner, ultimately believes his field will  
be better than grass grown by Mother Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``On normal grass, the roots grow longer and there's less  
durability,'' he said. ``We've condensed the roots so they're much 
more compact and there's much more stability and it's a lot 
stronger. You'll see just that on Saturday night.''

<HEADLINE> Zenith Files for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) -- Zenith Electronics Corp. filed for  
bankruptcy as part of a long-planned overhaul of the struggling 
maker of televisions, VCRs and digital equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Glenview-based company said the Chapter 11 filing on Monday  
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., was one of the final 
steps in its restructuring, which is aimed at reducing debt and 
de-emphasizing manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	Zenith announced last year that it would file for bankruptcy  
after coming up with a turnaround package that would essentially 
remake the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our operational restructuring -- transforming Zenith into a  
sales, marketing and technology company -- is proceeding on 
schedule,'' said Jeffrey Gannon, president and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's chief stockholder, LG Electronics of South Korea,  
has agreed as part of the restructuring to exchange $200 million of 
its debt claims for 100 percent ownership of the reorganized 
Zenith. 
</P>
<P>
	Zenith earlier this year obtained a $300 million line of credit  
from Citicorp North America Inc. to cover its debts during the 
restructuring period. 
</P>
<P>
	LG Electronics, which owns 55 percent of Zenith's outstanding  
shares, acquired its majority interest in November 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koo, LGE's vice chairman and chief executive officer, said  
the company remains committed to the restructuring ``because we 
believe that a restructured, refocused Zenith can be an effective 
competitor in the North American television industry.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Rehire Hart Investigator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said today it has dropped plans  
to suspend or discipline a veteran Defense Department background 
checker for allegedly asking intrusive questions about former Sen. 
Gary Hart's personal life. 
</P>
<P>
	``After further review of the circumstances, it was decided that  
no adverse actions will be taken'' against the investigator, David 
Kerno, said Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood. 
</P>
<P>
	That closes the case, Flood said. ``No further actions will be  
taken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart had complained about questions asked during a background  
check required to grant him the top-secret security clearance 
needed to serve on a defense oversight board. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerno, 53, a 19-year Denver-based investigator with the  
department, had questioned three of Hart's law firm colleagues and 
apparently asked several questions about Hart's sexual conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart complained to the Pentagon earlier this year that the  
questions went beyond the bounds of what is necessary for a 
security check and suggested that such inquiries would discourage 
people from serving in voluntary positions on defense boards, 
according to Tyrer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon removed Kerno from investigatory field work and  
assigned him to a desk. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics suggested that Kerno was punished because of Hart's  
close relationship with Cohen. Both are former senators and wrote a 
novel together. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cohen said last month that he did not intervene in the case,  
although he sympathized with the basic thrust of Hart's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerno learned of his reinstatement as an investigator in a short  
letter Friday informing him that the disciplinary action had been 
dropped, said his lawyer, Daniel Minahan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's 1988 run for the Democratic presidential nomination  
collapsed amid publicity about his relationship with Donna Rice, an 
aspiring actress and part-time model.

<HEADLINE> California Senate OKs Gun Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California lawmakers have approved a  
bill that would ban the sale of cheap, poorly made handguns like 
Saturday night specials. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, which Gov. Gray Davis is expected to sign, would  
give California one of the toughest gun safety laws in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Senate voted 24-13 on Monday to make it a misdemeanor  
to make or sell an unsafe handgun in California after Jan. 1, 2001. 
The guns would have to have a safety device and pass firing and 
drop-safety tests in independent laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is aimed at Saturday night specials or junk guns that  
police say are popular with criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not allow the importation of these so-called junk guns  
into the United States,'' said one of the bill's supporters, Sen. 
Bruce McPherson, a Republican. ``Why should we allow them to be 
manufactured in the state of California?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the bill was poorly drafted and would deprive  
law-abiding citizens of protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you prohibit those in high-crime areas from purchasing  
the most basic self-defense tools all you are doing is encouraging 
criminals to shoot at them,'' said Republican Sen. Ray Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, lawmakers approved bills that require trigger locks  
on guns, an effort to prevent accidental shootings. Between 1987 
and 1996, nearly 2,200 children under the age of 15 died in such 
shootings nationwide, said Democratic Sen. Tom Hayden.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Down 16.46 at 11,283.30 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite some initial confusion, investors  
welcomed the Federal Reserve's long-expected decision to raise 
interest rates, sending most stocks higher Tuesday even as 
blue-chips fell back slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.46 to close at  
11,283.30. The Fed's announcement of a quarter percentage point 
increase sparked a volatile afternoon on Wall Street, as the index 
jumped more than 65 points from Monday's record high close, then 
tumbled as much as 105.43 before regaining ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators ended higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
rose 3.28 to 1,363.50. The Nasdaq composite index, helped along by 
strong gains in technology stocks, rose 32.80 to 2,752.37. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed surprised few by increasing the federal funds rate, the  
interest banks charge each other on overnight loans, to 5.25 
percent. Fed policy-makers had already boosted the rate on June 30, 
and chairman Alan Greenspan made it clear that any signs of 
inflation would prompt the Fed to raise rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	But some market players were thrown off guard by the Fed's  
decision to also raise the discount rate -- the interest it charges 
for direct loans to banks. Analysts were unsure whether that 
quarter-point increase to 4.75 percent was part of the Fed's 
continued inflation battle, or simply to bring the discount rate up 
to date. The discount rate had remained unchanged since Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The fed funds increase ``was the second most widely anticipated  
change in monetary policy in years,'' said Peter Canelo, U.S. 
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, noting that 
the last increase in June was also widely expected. ``It has been 
taken very well by stock and bond markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices, which have improved steadily over the past week,  
rose again Tuesday. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 
5.93 percent, from 5.98 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, which are highly sensitive to inflation, drew support  
from the Fed's statement that the latest increase ``should markedly 
diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward.'' The central 
bank also held to a neutral bias, indicating that it may leave 
rates untouched in the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes for stable rates moved the markets higher, analysts said.  
Higher rates can hurt stocks by cutting to corporate profits as it 
becomes more expensive for businesses to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally, stocks and bonds don't like rate increases until  
they feel the Fed has done enough,'' said Dan Laufenberg, chief 
domestic economist at American Express Financial Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services companies, usually among the first to feel  
the pinch of higher rates, rose following the Fed's announcement. 
Chase Manhattan rose 7/8 to 86 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology companies held up well throughout the session.  
Applied Materials, a maker of equipment used in building 
semiconductors, rose 2 7/8 to 69 3/4, and Microsoft rose 5 3/4 to 92 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft got a boost from a court ruling on a dispute over  
Microsoft's use of the Java programming language, which is 
copyrighted by Sun Microsystems. A federal appeals court ordered a 
judge to reconsider a November injunction that prohibited Microsoft 
from using its own modified version of Sun's products. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said technology shares also benefited from the belief  
that interest rates may remain stable. Their often high prices 
become less appealing to investors when interest rates are rising. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, however, was the worst-performing Dow stock, falling 2 7/16  
to 122. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Volume of all NYSE-listed shares totaled 
891.93 million shares, compared with 673.77 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.13 to 437.12.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.76 percent.  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.1 
percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.2 percent higher.

	Notra Trulock, the Energy Department's deputy director of  
intelligence attacked a report issued by the agency's inspector 
general last week that failed to back him up and hold Clinton 
administration officials liable for security failures, The 
Washington Post and The New York Times reported in today's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the time has come for me to move on,'' Trulock told  
the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock could not be reached by telephone for comment Monday  
night, but the Energy Department confirmed his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Department spokeswoman Brooke Anderson issued a statement saying  
Secretary Bill Richardson was ``disappointed' by Trulock's 
decision, believed he ``performed valuable work and recently 
awarded him a $10,000 bonus for his role in helping uncover 
evidence of espionage and for his persistence in pursuing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Richardson stands by the findings of the IG's  
report, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock had come under criticism in recent weeks, as two  
government reports and other intelligence and security officials 
questioned whether he should have made a Chinese-American scientist 
at Los Alamos, Wen Ho Lee, the prime espionage suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Other officials participating in the investigation have said  
they believe Trulock and the FBI singled out Lee mainly because of 
his ethnicity. Lee, a Taiwanese-born nuclear physicist and U.S. 
citizen, has denied the allegations of espionage and has not been 
charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three other Energy Department employees have filed  
grievances against Trulock for alleged discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock was demoted to deputy director last year after serving  
as the Energy Department's intelligence director for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Post interview, Trulock denied focusing on Lee because he  
was Chinese.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Patricia Beer, the British poet lauded by her  
American contemporary Robert Lowell for her wry handling of eternal 
themes, died of a stroke Aug. 15 at their residence at Honiton, in 
southwest England. She was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Beer was born in Exmouth, southern England, into a family of  
strict Plymouth Brethren -- a religious link she later severed, but 
which profoundly influenced her. 
</P>
<P>
	In her 1968 prose memoir, ``Mrs. Beer's House,'' she gives a  
compelling account of her life in the stern, inward-looking 
religious community until the age of 14. 
</P>
<P>
	After Exmouth Grammar School, Exeter University and Oxford, she  
went to Italy, lecturing at the University of Padua from 1946-48, 
at the British Institute in Rome from 1948-50, and the Ministero 
Aeronautica in Rome from 1950-53. 
</P>
<P>
	On her return to Britain in 1953, she began writing poetry for  
the first time since her schooldays, exploring the themes of death, 
aging and faith in immaculately described English landscapes 
inspired by her heroes, William Wordsworth and Thomas Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
	She published her first collection, ``The Loss of the Magyar and  
Other Poems,'' in 1959, and continued to produce a small volume of 
new poems every four or five years for the rest of her life. 

</P>
<P>
                       *James Patrick Peecock    	
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- James Patrick ``Jim'' Peecook, a longtime  
Associated Press technician and leader of the union representing 
AP's technical employees, died Monday of complications from a 
stroke. He was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Peecook headed the Communications Workers of America negotiating  
team in each of the last four contract talks with the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Peecook had been hospitalized since suffering a stroke Feb. 26.  
He had undergone three heart operations, most recently in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim had the respect of people on both sides of the bargaining  
table and his death is a loss for all of us,'' said James M. Donna, 
AP vice president and director of Human Resources in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Peecook started his AP career in 1960 as a 19-year-old office  
assistant in Cleveland. He moved up to ``operator attendant'' in 
1961 and transferred to Atlanta in 1968 as an ``automatic 
operator,'' typing news copy on the Teletype machines that 
distributed Associated Press stories around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	As computers replaced Teletypes, Peecook became a technician in  
1974, installing and repairing equipment in AP offices and member 
newspaper and broadcast stations throughout Georgia and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	He was active in union affairs throughout his career, becoming  
chairman of the General Committee of the United Telegraph Workers 
in 1987. When the UTW merged with the CWA later that year, his 
title changed to president of CWA Local 1314. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Terri; three children, Renee, Jimmy  
and Lenny; two grandchildren, his mother and three brothers.

</P>
<P>
	TRENTO, Italy (AP) -- Othmar Winkler, the official sculptor for  
Italian dictator Benito Mussolini who went on to become an 
anti-fascist, anti-clerical artist, died Saturday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1930s, Winkler sculpted busts for Mussolini and for  
Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, but then fled Italy 
and became a fierce opponent of the regime. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, he started working on religious themes, with a  
provocative and anti-clerical style. His sculptures of a Christ 
with a hammer and sickle engraved on his face and that of a 
cardinal riding a pig sparked Catholic protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Winkler's works are in private collections, although  
many of his more traditional, wooden sculptures adorn churches 
throughout Alto Adige, or South Tyrol, the German-speaking Italian 
region where he was born.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Trade Hoying to Oakland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles traded quarterback  
Bobby Hoying to the Oakland Raiders on Tuesday, reuniting him with 
his former offensive coordinator, Jon Gruden. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoying, 26, thrived under Gruden late in 1997, but lost his  
starting job and confidence last year during the Eagles' 3-13 
season. The Eagles, who have Doug Pederson starting at quarterback 
with rookie Donovan McNabb as the backup, get a conditional draft 
pick in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to make sure that he was in good hands when he left  
here, and I think that's a very good situation for him,'' Eagles 
coach Andy Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoying, who had left practice when the deal was announced, will  
vie with Wade Wilson for the backup job behind Rich Gannon in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoying, the Eagles' third-round draft choice from Ohio State in  
1996, had some brilliant performances after taking over for Ty 
Detmer and Rodney Peete in Philadelphia for the last six games of 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 20-for-23 with two touchdowns in his first win as a  
starter against Pittsburgh, then was 26-for-42 for 313 yards and 
four touchdowns in a victory over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles anointed him their quarterback of the future, but  
Gruden left to become coach of the Raiders in 1998. Hoying 
struggled from the start under new coordinator Dana Bible, and 
never recovered his confidence or passing touch. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hoying was one of the Eagles' few pleasant surprises in  
training camp this year under Reid, holding his own in the chase 
for the third quarterback spot with Koy Detmer. Hoying was 4-for-9 
for 64 yards and directed Philadelphia's only scoring drive in its 
first preseason game, a 10-7 loss to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby has done a nice job here throughout our minicamps and  
training camp,'' Reid said. ``As a coaching staff and an 
organization, we appreciate everything that he did for us. This 
will be a good situation for him, having him reunited with Jon 
Gruden. He'll be able to step right in and I'm sure work into that 
second position for them.''

<HEADLINE> Bono, Staff Gets Restraining Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge has issued a temporary  
restraining order against a man who prosecutors claim has been 
harassing Rep. Mary Bono and her staff. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Paez granted the order Monday  
against Steven Sanberg, said Kim Waltrip, district director for 
Mrs. Bono, R-Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanberg allegedly barged into Mrs. Bono's Palm Springs office  
last month and told members of the media he was holding a news 
conference. Staffers told Sanberg he had to leave and he yelled at 
them, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also claimed Sanberg harassed a female intern with  
telephone calls and by following her in his pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The restraining order prevents Sanberg from coming within 100  
yards of Mrs. Bono and her staff and forbids him to contact them 
without court permission. She had earlier obtained a temporary 
restraining order from a state judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bono was sent to Congress after a special election in April  
1998 to fill the seat held by her late husband, Sonny Bono. She was 
re-elected to a full term in November 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone number for Sanberg, 44, could not immediately be  
located. He has said that Mrs. Bono is worried about him because he 
plans to start a recall drive based on her voting record on human 
rights.

<HEADLINE> China Said To Move Jailed American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China is willing to transfer a seriously  
injured American linguist, possibly outside the country, and has 
promised to quickly resolve whether to file a case against him, the 
State Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Daja Mizu Meston, 29, an expert in the Tibetan language, has  
been detained in Xining province since Aug. 15. He was held along 
with Australian scholar Gabrielle Lafitte, 50, who was expelled 
from the country. The two were arrested at the site of a 
controversial Chinese government irrigation dam project funded by 
the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Meston is hospitalized with serious spinal injuries. The Chinese  
said he was hurt when he jumped from a window in an attempt to 
escape authorities after he had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have said his injuries are consistent with that  
account. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Foley said provincial  
authorities in China have agreed that Meston can be transferred to 
another hospital. The clear implication, he said, is that the 
facility could be outside China. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have received assurances from the Chinese authorities that  
the case will be handled as quickly as possible ... in accordance 
with Chinese law,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He described Meston's injuries as those of parachutists when  
they land hard on their feet. ``His heels were -- I don't know if 
they were fractured, but they were hurt, and his spine of course, 
and some internal injuries,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not in good shape. He's in serious condition,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese alleged that Meston and Lafitte illegally covered  
and photographed activities in a restricted area. 
</P>
<P>
	The dam project in Dulan County is opposed by the U.S.  
government, the Dalai Lama, Tibetan exile groups and environmental 
and human rights activists. Critics contend the Chinese will use 
the project to push ethnic Tibetans out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has been pressing China to release Meston for  
medical attention. A consular officer has visited him and consulted 
with his doctors. Meston's wife is also in China expecting to see 
him soon, Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley said he did not know whether charges would be brought  
against Meston. He noted that Chinese authorities had indicated 
their willingness at the time of the World Bank approval of the 
project to allow international visitors to view the region and the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	``On that basis we believe his (Meston's) application for a  
visa, his going to China, was legitimate,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, however, that the Chinese have a right to decide who  
enters their country and noted assertions that the sites the two 
men visited were marked in English that photography was prohibited.

<HEADLINE> TV Host Montel Williams Has MS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Talk show host Montel Williams held back tears  
as he revealed that he has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, 
a debilitating neurological disease that has no cure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how long I've had it for, but I've been  
misdiagnosed for 10 years,'' Williams, 43, said Monday at a 
Manhattan news conference. ``There have been some mornings when I 
thought it would be better if I stayed in bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he vowed: ``This disease is not going to stop me.''  
</P>
<P>
	The host of the nationally syndicated ``Montel Williams Show,''  
which has been on the air for eight seasons, said he will continue 
to work as long as he is physically able. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a former naval officer who vaulted into television  
after a career as a motivational speaker, said he recently informed 
his immediate family of his condition and told his staff Monday, 
shortly before the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	His physician, Dr. Michael Olek, said they have been discussing  
several recently approved drug therapies. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his illness, Williams said he had been working  
18-hour days to direct his first feature film, a drama titled 
``Little Pieces.'' He maintained his commitment to his career as a 
talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if this gets worse in five or 10 years from now, I will  
still force myself out of my bed,'' said Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest part Montel has with this disease is not having  
control,'' his wife, Grace, said. ``He's had control of everything 
in his life, from being a naval officer to his talk show.'' She 
allowed herself a joke, adding, ``But not his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's got control there,'' agreed Williams, kissing his wife.  
</P>
<P>
	About 300,000 Americans have MS. They have such symptoms as  
unusual tiredness, loss of balance and muscle coordination, slurred 
speech, tremors and difficulty walking. In severe cases, they are 
partly or completely paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams announced the creation of a multiple sclerosis research  
fund. He said he hoped his coming forward ``will maybe increase 
people's donations so that in the next five years we can cure 
this.''

<HEADLINE> Onex Seeks Airlines in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- A Canadian conglomerate is offering $1.2 billion  
to buy and combine Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, in a bold move 
to preserve the nation's airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A single airline, which would retain the Air Canada name and its  
Montreal headquarters, would be more efficient and financially 
stronger than the separate operations, said Gerald Schwartz, the 
president and chief executive of Toronto-based Onex Corp, which 
made the offer Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of Calgary, Alberta-based Canadian welcomed the Onex  
plan in a statement saying it offered the chance of a ``truly 
national airline for Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada said it had been informed of Onex's ``unsolicited,  
below-market offer'' but would have no further comment until 
completing a review of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Airlines, with 14,000 employees, has been seeking new  
investors to keep flying. It has said it needs up to $500 million 
to allow it to restructure and move away from what has been a 
chronic cash crisis over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Onex, one of Canada's largest companies, controls such diverse  
companies as Sky Chefs airline catering, Lantic Sugar Ltd. and 
American Buildings Co. It offered $1.2 billion in cash and stock to 
acquire the companies and said it also would assume $2.6 billion in 
airline debt for a total obligation of $3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyout and merger would involve the loss of 5,000 jobs,  
Schwartz told a news conference. The cuts would be handled mostly 
through retirements and normal attrition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good deal for Canada and for all Canadians,'' said  
Schwartz, a takeover specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers were confused. Some said they feared reduced  
competition would raise air travel costs. Others said efficiencies 
of a merger could lead to lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would give U.S.-based American Airlines greater ties to  
Canada. AMR Corp., the parent of American, which is helping Onex 
finance the proposed takeover, now has 25 percent of the voting 
stock in Canadian Airlines, which is part of its Oneworld alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The much larger Air Canada, however, is part of the Star  
Alliance with American's rival United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross Healy, president and chief executive officer of  
Toronto-based Strategic Analysis Corp., said the deal makes a lot 
of sense for American but that the proposed merger is no sure 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real issue is Air Canada,'' Healy said. ``There is no  
possible way Air Canada can be forced to accept this deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government can't even force them to do that because they  
don't own control of the company anymore.'' The Canadian government 
privatized Air Canada through stock sales in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Air Canada asked the Canadian government to approve a  
takeover of Canadian's international business while the smaller 
airline focused on domestic routes. But Canadian Airlines rejected 
the proposal, saying its international routes were the most 
profitable part of its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal-based Air Canada, with 23,000 employees, would not  
disclose financial terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has relaxed antitrust laws temporarily so the two  
airlines and any other interested investors could share sensitive 
financial data to keep Canadian flying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know the Canadian airline industry cannot maintain the  
status quo,'' said Schwartz. ``This is the time for a bold step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz, who is also a prominent Liberal Party fundraiser, has  
already submitted the plan to federal Transport Minister David 
Collenette. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ottawa, federal Industry Minister John Manley said the  
government would ask the federal Competition Bureau ``what a 
restructured industry might look like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Onex is offering Air Canada shareholders approximately $5.53 a  
share in cash or a share in a newly formed company to be known as 
AirCo in exchange for each Air Canada share. 
</P>
<P>
	Onex offered Canadian Airlines shareholders about $1.34 in cash  
or 0.2424 common share of AirCo for each of their shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Onex said its new AirCo unit would invest approximately $6.7  
billion in the venture, with help from Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, Onex said it would hold a 31 percent stake  
in the merged airline. It said AMR would hold nearly 15 percent 
interest and that the public would own 54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR now has a 33 percent investment, representing a 25 percent  
voting interest, in Canadian Airlines' operating subsidiary. Onex 
said AMR intends to be a passive investor and eventually to sell 
its stake in the merged airline.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Threatens Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The World Bank is threatening to halt  
funding for Indonesia if it doesn't swiftly conclude an 
investigation into a banking scandal involving the ruling Golkar 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this case is not resolved early and satisfactorily, it is  
difficult for us to provide budget support to the government of 
Indonesia,'' Mark Baird, the World Bank's director for Indonesia, 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the World Bank provided about $1.6 billion to  
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal broke last month after an audit into Bank Bali found  
its directors had used government bailout money to pay a $80 
million fee to a debt collection company controlled by a senior 
official of the Golkar Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure has sparked an uproar in Indonesia, unsettled  
financial markets and threatened its economic recovery. It has also 
led to calls for senior officials -- including the finance minister 
and central bank governor -- to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The money, which has since been returned, was disbursed by the  
central bank as part of a government guarantee program. It was 
supposed to compensate Bank Bali for funds owed it by a bank that 
closed. But the funds were then transferred from Bank Bali to a 
firm controlled by Golkar's deputy treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of Golkar allege the money was to be used to bankroll  
President B.J. Habibie's campaign to retain the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie's main rival in the presidential race is Megawati  
Sukarnoputri, whose party won the largest share of seats in 
parliamentary election in June, Indonesia's first free ballot in 44 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the International Monetary Fund called for an audit  
of the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF is leading a $43 billion program to bail out Indonesia's  
moribund economy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, central bank deputy governor Achjar Iljas confirmed  
that an international firm will be allowed to audit Bank Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Bank's vice president for East Asia, Jean-Michel  
Severino, also urged the government to swiftly look into the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that the Bank Bali case has major macroeconomic  
and microeconomic implications,'' Severino said in Jakarta. ``I 
imagine that the World Bank can't carry on its activities unchanged 
if the issue isn't satisfactorily resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The World Bank says Indonesia needs to fully disclose the  
findings of its investigation and punish any wrongdoers.

<HEADLINE> Crude Futures Sink Near Summer End  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures dropped sharply Tuesday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange as sellers took profits in anticipation of the 
traditional falloff in gasoline demand as vacationers head home at 
summer's end. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, soybean futures retreated and wheat also fell  
on the news that Iran may have bought 1 million tons of Canadian 
wheat -- again turning its back on the recently reopened U.S. 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude futures fell by about 2 percent as several factors  
combined to bring prices down. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Bret helped push back prices, with investors  
anticipating that the weekly report by the American Petroleum 
Institute due out Tuesday night would reflect industry disruption 
wreaked by the hurricane late last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Some refineries in Texas were shut down as a result of the most  
powerful hurricane to strike that state in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market's looking for a pretty big decline because of the  
disruptions,'' said Bill O'Grady, an energy analyst for A.G. 
Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Also partly responsible for the price dip, analysts said, was  
the announcement of an oil sale by Germany, which is putting about 
32 million barrels of crude on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline demand is expected to start falling off as summer  
holidays end, possibly driving crude prices lower over the next 
couple of months, O'Grady said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices had been rising to their highest level in nearly  
two years amid unusual cooperation by producers in working to end 
world overproduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and its products finished sharply lower.  
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for October delivery plummeted 37 cents to  
$21.47 a gallon; September heating oil was down .73 cent to 57.73 
cents a gallon; September unleaded gas was down .73 cent to 65.22 
cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	September natural gas declined 5 cents to $3.059 per each 1,000  
cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
October tumbled 35 cents to $20.63 a barrel at the International 
Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean and grain futures all fell on the Chicago Board of  
Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures declined based on reports of Iran's purchase of  
wheat from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a U.S. ban on wheat sales to Iran, one of the world's  
largest grain importers, was lifted in July, the Iranians have 
shunned the United States while buying from Europe and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was down 3 1/2 cents to $2.84 1/2 per  
bushel; December corn closed down 3 1/2 cents to $2.16 1/2 a bushel; 
December oats were down 1/4 cent to $1.13 3/4; and November soybeans 
closed down 3 3/4 cents at $4.67.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Swing on Interest Rate Hike / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices swung sharply today as the Federal  
Reserve's long-expected decision to raise interest rates renewed 
concerns that higher borrowing costs will cut into corporate profit 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 58.57 at 11,241.19. After the Fed's 
announcement, the index jumped more than 65 points from Monday's 
close before dropping again. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 0.86 at 1,359.36. The Nasdaq composite index, which 
was sharply higher in morning trading, had dropped back to a gain 
of 24.32 at 2,749.38. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed surprised few with its decision to increase the federal  
funds rate, the interest banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, a quarter-percentage point. Fed policy-makers had already 
boosted the rate on June 30, and chairman Alan Greenspan had made 
it clear that any signs of inflation would entice the Fed to raise 
rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's increase ``should markedly diminish the risk of rising  
inflation going forward,'' the Fed said in a statement. The central 
bank also held to a neutral bias, indicating that it may leave 
rates untouched in the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Fed had a surprise for the market, a decision to raise  
the discount rate -- the interest that it charges for direct loans 
to banks -- also by a quarter point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the move to a neutral bias, I think they wanted to  
give the impression that they may not be finished,'' said Dan 
Laufenberg, chief domestic economist at American Express Financial 
Advisors. ``There isn't much of a current inflation risk, but the 
Fed wants to be forward-looking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders suggested that the surprise of a higher discount rate  
may have knocked the market temporarily off-balance. Also, 
investors may have been primed to sell stocks following Monday's 
rally, when the Dow rose 199.15 points to a new record close. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on long-term bonds held steady at 5.95 percent, its  
level just before the rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan, which led the Dow on Monday amid optimism over  
interest rates, slipped back today as investors took profits. It 
was down 13/16 at 138 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Semiconductor maker Applied Materials was up 1 7/8 at 68 3/4, and  
Microsoft rose 4 13/16 to 91 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft got a boost from a court ruling on a dispute over  
Microsoft's use of the Java programming language, which is 
copyrighted by Sun Microsystems. A federal appeals court ordered a 
judge to reconsider a November injunction that prohibited Microsoft 
from using its own modified version of Sun's products. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 9-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 579.70 million 
shares, ahead of Monday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 1.30 at  
435.95.

<HEADLINE> Remnants of Hurricane Claim 4 Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAREDO, Texas (AP) -- The remnants of Hurricane Bret sloshed  
across southern Texas, soaking the region with up to a foot of rain 
and sending about 3,500 people to higher ground along the 
U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
	The most powerful hurricane to strike Texas in 20 years unwound  
from 125 mph at the coast to 40 mph winds on Monday during its 
inland trek toward the Rio Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we're still following and worried about is the  
rise in the river,'' said Laredo Mayor Betty Flores. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rains that washed over the area were blamed for a Monday  
crash in which four people died. A tractor trailer jackknifed just 
south of Laredo and hit a pickup, killing the big rig driver and 
two women and a man in the truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the only reported deaths from the storm that crossed  
the coast on Sunday evening midway between Corpus Christi 
(population 300,000) and Brownsville (132,000). Bret blew into the 
cattle country of Kenedy County, where cows outnumber people 60,000 
to 458 and where damage was considered light. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might call it the great escape. I think the city of Corpus  
Christi is very fortunate,'' said Mayor Loyd Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in Laredo braced for flooding, but by Monday night the  
threat appeared to have diminished. Nonetheless, Laredo businesses 
were ordered to close, and the Laredo International Airport and all 
three bridges linking Texas with Mexico were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always worry that people will lose their lives or their  
property,'' said Ms. Flores. ``Thankfully, we've been able to 
avoid, for now, a serious situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bret moved slowly across Texas' southern tip with drenching rain  
of 8 to 12 inches after landing. About 3,500 people on both sides 
of the Rio Grande left their homes for higher ground as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service said early today that the storm  
could produce an additional 5 to 10 inches of rain along the Rio 
Grande watershed. 
</P>
<P>
	Janie Mena and 11 family members took refuge in the Laredo Civic  
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in a mobile home and since the wind was blowing pretty  
hard we came,'' the 17-year-old said. ``I wish other people would 
do it, too, because you never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marla Reyes and 13 members of her Corpus Christi-area family ran  
from the storm -- but they headed to Laredo, directly in the path of 
what they were running from. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got out of one and came to another,'' said Ms. Reyes of the  
severe weather, which kept them stuck at the civic center Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the coast, Texans streamed back to their mostly  
unscathed homes Monday after Bret cleared the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled out of our minds, is what we are,'' said Corpus  
Christi teacher Rita Clark, whose home had only a downed tree limb 
in the yard. ``It was nice enough to fall gently against my 
house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane damage was substantial in Falfurrias, a town of 5,800  
about 60 miles southwest of Corpus Christi, Mayor Michael Guerra 
said. The wind ripped roofs from homes and businesses and up to 90 
percent of the town had no electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Major damage also was reported in Port Mansfield, about 50 miles  
north of Brownsville, especially to mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado that was spun off by Bret between Rockport and Aransas  
Pass destroyed a mobile home and damaged several other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four downed high voltage lines that bring  
electricity to southern Texas were functioning again Monday, and 
the fourth was expected to resume operation today. The number of 
customers without electricity dropped from 16,000 to 11,000 on 
Monday, the Public Utility Commission reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The King Ranch in Kenedy County reported downed trees but no  
livestock losses on one of the country's largest cattle operations. 
Ranch President Jack Hunt said all 300 people who live on 825,000 
acres tending the livestock were evacuated before the hurricane 
hit.

<HEADLINE> Star of David OK'd by School Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GULFPORT, Miss. (AP) -- A school board has overturned its  
controversial decision that prevented a Jewish student from wearing 
a Star of David necklace to school. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harrison County School Board voted unanimously Monday to  
exempt religious symbols from its policy prohibiting students from 
wearing anything that could be viewed as a gang symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	``My decision was based entirely on the safety of the students.  
But after consideration and a lot of soul searching, I think it's 
justifiable that he and any other student get to express their 
religion,'' board member T.J. Harder said after Monday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of 11th-grader Ryan Green asked school officials to  
reconsider the policy, emphasizing that the Star of David was a 
religious symbol, not a gang symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	Security officials had told board members that some gang symbols  
incorporate six-pointed stars, and that the Star of David could be 
confused as such. On Aug. 16, the board unanimously upheld the 
anti-gang policy. 
</P>
<P>
	When pressure and national attention mounted after its decision,  
the board met last Thursday with members of the Jewish community 
and decided to reconsider its decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realized that it infringed on freedom of religious  
expression, and that freedom supersedes the safety issue,'' said 
Randy Williams, the board's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Green, Ryan's father, declared the reversal a victory.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful feeling,'' he said. ``We are truly joyous. As  
a father to a son this is the best principle I could teach him: 
Stand up for your rights.''

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Grain Futures Tumble / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures retreated Tuesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade as rains again pelted the driest crop areas. Grain 
futures also fell. 
</P>
<P>
	November soybean futures prices rose early in the session after  
a weekly report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, released 
late Monday, showed a surprisingly steep decline in crops. 
</P>
<P>
	But the gains were reversed by closing time as investors reacted  
to heavy rain beneficial to key growing areas in the eastern 
Midwest and the Mississippi River Delta. 
</P>
<P>
	The dip in soybean prices also was spurred by a late drop in  
corn futures prices, with December corn falling to a 3 1/2-week low. 
Traders said the slide was in reaction to the USDA crop report's 
confirmation of an early corn harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures declined on the news that Iran may have bought 1  
million tons of Canadian wheat. Since a U.S. ban on wheat sales to 
Iran, one of the world's largest grain importers, was lifted in 
July, the Iranians have shunned the United States while buying from 
Europe and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was down 3 1/2 cents to $2.84 1/2 per  
bushel; December corn closed down 3 1/2 cents to $2.16 1/2 a bushel; 
December oats were down 1/4 cent to $1.13 3/4; and November soybeans 
closed down 3 3/4 cents at $4.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mixed and pork higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .20 cent to 64.90 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose .10 cent to 77.87 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs fell .55 cent to 45.87 cents a pound; February pork rose 
2.48 cents to 60.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Mussina MRI: No Significant Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY (AP) -- An MRI on pitcher Mike Mussina's right  
shoulder showed no significant damage, according to Baltimore 
Orioles officials 
</P>
<P>
	Mussina is doubtful for his scheduled start on Friday against  
the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Frank Wren said the pain and swelling in the  
shoulder has to go down first. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of when the swelling goes down, so he can  
begin throwing again,'' Wren said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mussina was struck on his right shoulder by a line drive in the  
third inning in Sunday's 9-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Rhodes saw a hand specialist Monday. Wren said Rhodes'  
injury is a sprain of the last knuckle of his left index finger. 
Rhodes had to leave Sunday's game after being struck by a batted 
ball.

<HEADLINE> Ohio State Names Winner of QB Duel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- While fans weighed in on Internet sites,  
argued in sports bars and made their cases in letters to 
newspapers, Austin Moherman quietly made points with Ohio State's 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he was declared the ninth-ranked Buckeyes' starting  
quarterback against Miami in Sunday's Kickoff Classic. Steve 
Bellisari dropped to No. 2 on the depth chart, ending Ohio State's 
most recent quarterback duel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has not been torturous,'' Moherman said. ``I went out every  
day and did what I could do. I tried to show the coaches. I didn't 
focus on the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bellisari said he doesn't consider the competition over and  
thinks the decision will be made on the field during games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever is making plays, has good production, puts points on  
the board and wins games, that should be the starter,'' Bellisari 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The job appears to be Moherman's -- for as long as the Buckeyes  
offense flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot tell you right now in my mind who I think the best  
quarterback is, but we think the one who deserves to start in this 
first ballgame is Austin,'' coach John Cooper said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Bellisari would definitely play against the 12th-ranked  
Hurricanes, Cooper said, ``I didn't say that. We've said we're 
going to start Austin in the ballgame and we're going to do 
everything we can to win the football game. If we start Austin and 
he played fantastic, played great -- why take him out?'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a change from the 1996 and 1997 seasons when Stanley  
Jackson and Joe Germaine were listed No. 1 and 1-A at quarterback, 
sharing playing time, but not a love for the uncomfortable position 
they were in. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson started all but one game in those two seasons, but never  
received the full confidence of the coaching staff. He was almost 
always replaced in the second quarter by Germaine, who usually 
played when a game hung in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going into this ballgame saying, `Austin, you're  
going to play the first two series, then Steve you're going in,''' 
Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you there's probably a good chance that somewhere  
during the game Steve will go in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two have jousted for the job since the first practice of the  
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither has established much of a college track record.  
Bellisari, a sophomore from Boca Raton, Fla., was 3-for-5 passing 
in one game last season, while Moherman, a redshirt sophomore from 
Mission Viejo, Calif., misfired on his only attempt in the same 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	But Moherman at least was a full-time quarterback for his two  
years at Ohio State and was able to learn from Germaine, who passed 
for 3,330 yards while leading the Buckeyes to an 11-1 record and a 
No. 2 spot in the final polls last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellisari played on special teams and at defensive back last  
season, sharing the award for top special team's player and 
finishing tied for 11th on the squad in tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did Moherman get the nod over Bellisari?'' Cooper  
repeated. ``Well, he's had the nod. He's been our first-team 
quarterback. Normally, when we start out in the spring, seniority 
rules and he was of course a quarterback last year and started out 
a little ahead of Steve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the Ohio State players said they were happy to have  
the situation clarified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am just relieved so people won't be like, `Who's going to  
start?' I'm glad to have that part over with,'' wide receiver 
Reggie Germany said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said Moherman also had the edge in the team's August  
workouts in preparations of meeting the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main reason that we will start Austin in this ballgame is  
that we grade them every day in practice, we keep charts on 
completions, interceptions, total yardage and bad plays. For 
whatever reason, Austin has graded out slightly ahead of Steve -- 
particularly in the last couple of scrimmages we've had in the 
stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said Sunday's game would determine if -- or when --  
Moherman stayed on the field or Bellisari replaced him. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it will be based on feel, a gut decision that you  
make during the ballgame,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rate Hike Expected Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve is poised to bump up  
interest rates for the second time in eight weeks in an effort to 
cool the economy and prevent an outbreak of inflation, private 
economists believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts have been forecasting another quarter of a  
percentage point rate increase since Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan 
vowed last month to move ``promptly and forcefully'' at the first 
signs of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Open Market Committee, composed of Fed board members  
in Washington and the presidents of the Fed's 12 regional banks, 
was meeting behind closed doors today to review interest rate 
policy with financial markets braced for a midafternoon 
announcement of their decision. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Wall Street appeared to take the view that today's  
expected rate increase will be all the Fed needs to contain the 
inflation threat. The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 199.15 
points and closed at a record 11,299.76. By late morning today, the 
index had lost about 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists offered mixed opinions on whether the central bank  
will boost rates again in the fall as they eagerly awaited the 
Fed's announcement, seeking a clue about its possible future 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed continues to face the conundrum of a hot economy and  
cool inflation and the issue they are facing is to what extent they 
turn up the air conditioning,'' said Tim O'Neill, chief economist 
for the Bank of Montreal and Harris Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the economy has slowed in recent months, it is still  
expected to grow almost 4 percent this year, a brisk pace that has 
pushed unemployment down to its lowest level in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	While that's good news for workers, it is worrisome to the Fed,  
which is concerned that employers foraging for workers are wooing 
them with higher wages and benefits -- something that could drive up 
prices and spark inflation down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed is fearful that the economy is expanding too strongly,  
that labor markets are too tight and that inflationary pressures 
will develop if things don't slow down,'' said economist Mark Zandi 
at Regional Financial Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan would tend to argue that ``small pre-emptive moves now  
are more appropriate than waiting and being forced to tighten even 
more later,'' said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, Zandi, O'Neill and some other economists believe Fed  
policy- makers will raise interest rates again at their next 
meeting Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts see the Fed's goal this year as taking away some  
of the stimulus it provided last fall when it cut interest rates 
three times to counter a growing threat that the Asian crisis could 
topple the United States into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	But economists were split on whether the Fed will keep its  
policy directive, which signals the future course of interest 
rates, at neutral or switch it to one leaning toward raising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 30, the Fed nudged up its target for the federal funds  
rate -- the interest banks charge on overnight loans -- by a 
quarter-point to 5 percent, the first increase in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the Fed switched its policy directive to  
neutral. That caused financial markets to rally, boosting stock 
prices and pushing long-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Greenspan tried to correct the situation by sounding  
more hawkish in an appearance before Congress, pledging to move 
``promptly and forcefully'' to counter inflation. Those remarks 
were taken as strongly signaling an August rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed critics contend the world economy is still too fragile to  
embark on a series of rate increases, especially with American 
manufacturers and farmers struggling to cope with lost export 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deflation is far more of a danger today than inflation as  
farmers across the country can tell you,'' Republican presidential 
candidate Steve Forbes said Monday in urging the central bank not 
to raise rates Tuesday. ``Jacking up interest rates now would be a 
pre-emptive strike against American prosperity, not against 
inflation.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Talks of Racial Unity in NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley  
told a Harlem audience that if elected he would fight to raise 
children out of poverty and grant health care to all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still 14 million children in America who live in  
poverty,'' Bradley said Monday night at a forum hosted by the Rev. 
Al Sharpton. ``There are still 45 million people in America without 
any health insurance. In an economy that's as good as ours ... the 
question is how can we make sure that more people in America have 
health care and fewer children in America live in poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, told the crowd of about  
500 at the headquarters of Sharpton's National Action Network that 
racial unity ``is not for me a political position. It's who I am. 
It's what I believe, it's what I care most about, it's one of the 
main motivations for me to get into politics in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who trails Vice President Al Gore in the polls, said  
that as president he would work to tighten gun controls, raise the 
minimum wage, reform campaign financing and make it easier for 
low-wage workers to be represented by unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour forum in a sweltering auditorium included questions  
from a panel featuring former New York City Mayor Edward Koch, who 
has joined Sharpton in proposing a second-chance initiative that 
would wipe clean the criminal records of some non-violent 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Audience members queried Bradley about issues ranging from  
abuses in the foster-care system to President Clinton's proposed 
clemency for members of a violent Puerto Rican nationalist group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was warmly received but drew scattered boos when he said  
he was not prepared to support reparations to black Americans for 
slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed stumped by a question about the genetic engineering of  
food but said he would study it. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience included several figures who have been linked to  
racially charged events in the New York region, such as Million 
Youth March organizer Khallid Abdul Muhammad and Moses Stewart, 
whose 16-year-old son, Yusuf Hawkins, was killed by white youths in 
Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, 10 years ago.
