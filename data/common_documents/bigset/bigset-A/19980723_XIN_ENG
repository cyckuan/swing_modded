<HEADLINE> Swiss President Urges Clinton to Stop Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Swiss President Flavio Cotti has
urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to take decisive action to
prevent a number of American states and cities from imposing
sanctions against Swiss firms active on the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
The threat by the American states and cities "is undermining
the traditionally good relations that exist between Switzerland
and the United States," Cotti told Clinton in a letter to be
delivered to the White House late Wednesday by Swiss Ambassador to
Washington Alfred Defago.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Cotti referred to the exceptionally intense
economic relations now between the two countries and to the fact
that Switzerland ranks as one of the largest investors in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Cotti noted that the U.S. government has already expressed its
condemnation of the "unjustified, unlawful and counter-productive"
sanctions in a joint declaration with the Swiss federal government
on March 26.
</P>
<P>
While appealing to the U.S. government to block the sanctions,
Cotti reaffirmed his government's determination to clarify the
role Switzerland played during World War II "in a spirit of
historical accuracy, justice and solidarity."

<HEADLINE> Canada Capital Investment to Remain at Record Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Canadian business and government
investment in plant and equipment is expected to remain at record
levels with spending of 125.4 billion dollars (84 billion U.S.
dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
That will be 6.6 percent higher than that of 1997, Statistics
Canada said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
High capacity utilization rates, improving profits and the
relatively low interest rates are sustaining investment spending
by both businesses and governments, the statistics agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Canadian manufacturers plan to invest 20.7 billion dollars
(13.9 billion U.S. dollars) this year, up 8.2 percent over that of
last year. The increase is most notably in the chemical,
electrical and electronic industries.
</P>
<P>
Government spending on capital is expected to reach 14.1
billion dollars, 9.9 percent higher than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the transportation sector is now forecast to grow
by 29.3 percent to 9.5 billion dollars (6.4 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1998, due in large part to increases in the pipeline and truck
transportation industries.
</P>
<P>
Spending by electric power utilities will be up sharply to 6.7
billion dollars (4.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, in large part
due to spending in Quebec and Ontario provinces after the January
ice storm, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas industry is expecting investment of 12.6
billion dollars (8.4 billion U.S. dollars) this year, down 4.1
percent from 1997.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Condemns Killing of 4 U.N. Staff in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees Mrs Sadako Ogata has expressed outrage at the ambush
killing of four staff members of the U.N. Mission of Observers in
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply shocked and saddened by yet another assault on
people who have dedicated their lives to the service of peace and
humanity," Ogata said here Wednesday. "These cowardly attacks must
be stopped."
</P>
<P>
The four killed Monday were U.N. Civil Affairs Officer Yutaka
Akino of Japan, two U.N. military observes from Poland and Uruguay
and their Tajik translator. A French aid worker was abducted in
Tajikistan and died during a rescue attempt eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
"The latest slayings will undoubtedly make our efforts to
improve the lives of people in Tajikistan doubly difficult," Ogata
said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has been involved in the repatriation of Tajik refugees
who fled their country following the outbreak of civil war in
1992. Since 1993, UNHCR has helped repatriate 53,000 Tajik
refugees from Afghanistan and Turkmenistan.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Bug to Slow World Economy: Think Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The costs of fixing the millennium
bug will lead to slower economic growth and higher inflation until
well into the next century, a leading think tank said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The costs of coping with the problem, and the disruptive
effects of computer systems crashing will slow world gross
domestic product (GDP) growth by 0.3 percent a year, according to
a new study from Oxford Economic Forecasting (OEF).
</P>
<P>
In the United States alone, 0.3 percent of the U.S. economy is
worth 30 billion U.S. dollars. OEF calculates that, in today's
money, the cumulative cost of tackling the millennium date change
is about 6 percent of world GDP.
</P>
<P>
A total of 450 billion U.S. dollars will be spent on converting
computer systems worldwide. However, with most of the money
wasted, the spending does little to improve the efficiency of the
economy, which as a result will be more prone to overheating and
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Although it is hard to estimate the disruptive effects of
computer systems crashing, OEF said that firms may take some
preventions as closing down for a week after the 2000 new year,
even if the effects turn out to be fairly limited.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure failures such as the breakdown of electricity or
telecoms networks would be most costly, the study said, when
computer programs cannot tell the difference between the year 1990
and 2000.
</P>
<P>
The problem, which arises because earlier computers store the
year using the last two digits, could also trigger a stock market
crash, according to OEF.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The ceaseless torrential rains have
been pelting down in Wuhan City, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, in the past two days and turned it into a vast expanse
of water as its trunk streets have been submerged with waist-high
floodwater.
</P>
<P>
In a number of major streets, boats have replaced motor
vehicles as a major means of transport. And in some
seriously-flooded districts, men of the People's Liberation Army
were seen paddling pneumatic boats to evacuate elderlies and
children from flooded residential areas to safe places.
</P>
<P>
A 50-year-old woman told Xinhua that she has moved to live with
her daughter since the water in her home is already
knee-high. "I've never seen such heavy floods in my life," she
said with sorrow.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains came to a halt at around six this evening, but
more rainstorms hit the city again from late in the evening and
likely continue tomorrow, according to local weathermen.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says No Decision Yet on Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Wednesday that Britain was prepared to look at alternative
ways of conducting the Lockerbie trial, but no final decision had
yet been made.
</P>
<P>
Blair told the British Parliament Wednesday that a third
country was being considered because no progress had been made in
bringing the two Libyans accused of bombing Pan Am flight 103 in
1988 to trial in Scotland or the United States.
</P>
<P>
A report in Britain's Guardian newspaper published Tuesday said
that Britain and the United States had agreed the two Libyan
agents could face trial in the Hague under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Blair noted the London government had discussed the issue with
the United States and the Netherlands, but "no final decision had
yet been reached" because of the complexities.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan government has repeatedly made clear it would not
hand over the two suspects unless the trial was held in a neutral
venue, while London and Washington had insisted that the trial
could only be held in Scotland or the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed strict sanctions on Libya in
1992 for failing to hand over the two suspects, who were accused
of killing 270 people in the Lockerbie bombing.

<HEADLINE> France Expected to Attain 3 Percent GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- France is expected to attain a 3
percent growth in its gross domestic product (GDP) which will
allow the creation of 400,000 jobs in 1998, said the French
government Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Public spending of France will be around 35 billion francs (5.1
billion U.S. dollars) this year and will be focused on employment,
social justice and improvement of daily life, said the government
in a communique.
</P>
<P>
This represents a 1 percent increase of public spending over
1997 but is almost the same as the increase rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance and Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn told a
press conference that France's public deficit will be kept at 3
percent of its GDP in 1998 and will be cut to 2.3 percent of the
GDP in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 0.7 point reduction in the public deficit will
be the biggest among European Union countries except Denmark.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that France's public deficit will be below 2
percent of the GDP from the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Greece Unhappy Over U.S. Official Presence in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday expressed its
unwillingness to the presence of U.S. officials earlier this week
in northern Cyprus at events marking the 24th anniversary of the
Turkish invasion.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that such
behavior should not necessarily be associated with certain
results, but it should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin reportedly
explained that officials of the U.S. embassy had attended the
events in their free time and unofficially, and their presence did
not indicate recognization by Washington to northern Cyprus which
declared independence in 1983, but recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
As for a statement made by the German Foreign Ministry to
advise those planning holidays in Cyprus to watch closely the
situation there, Reppas said that the advisory did not indicate
that there was a threat to the safety of visitors traveling to
Cyprus, but it did contain a warning.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the two communities in Cyprus rose last year
after the Cyprus government announced plans to purchase
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles and Turkey has
threatened to use force to prevent the deployment of the missiles.

livestock development project while the rest will be used for
educational development.

<HEADLINE> HK Adopts Measures to Prevent Spread of Enterovirus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Some departments of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government have taken
proactive measures to educate the public on enterovirus infections
and to prevent the spread of hand-foot-mouth diseases in
institutions with large numbers of children.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Inter-departmental Working Group on EV-71, who
met here Wednesday noted that the Department of Health (DH) had
inspected some 383 childcare centers in Hong Kong. Although the
hygiene conditions in these institutions in general were
satisfactory, health education on EV-71 was given to childcare
staff during the visit.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the 769 kindergartens here had been inspected
and the rest of them were to be visited in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Guidelines on general health education had been issued to
childcare centers and schools. Seminars for childcare staff and
for teachers and principals of schools and kindergartens had
either been held or planned.
</P>
<P>
The municipal services departments had undertaken to maintain
hourly checks on free residual chlorine level at local public
swimming pools to ensure the disinfecting effectiveness. And
monthly checks on bacteriological would be continued.
</P>
<P>
Instruction on hygiene had been given to places of public
entertainment and inspection of these places would be completed
within this week to ensure that they maintain a high level of
hygiene standard.
</P>
<P>
On the surveillance on hand-foot-mouth diseases in Hong Kong, a
spokesman for the Working Group said the number of cases seen at
sentinel centers and in public hospitals remained relatively
stable in the past week and the slight increase in the cases at
sentinel centers could be attributed to increased public awareness
and seasonal increase in summer months.
</P>
<P>
As by Wednesday, the laboratory result had confirmed 19 cases
of EV-71 infection and listed 11 cases as suspected ones. All
these patients had no complications and had fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
"So far, no severe form of EV-71 with serious complications had
been reported," the spokesman said. And the best prevention
against enterovirus infections, including EV-71 and Coxsackie
virus, is to maintain good personal hygiene, he said.

<HEADLINE> Oslo Architect Initiates New Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition lawmaker
Yossi Beilin, one of the architects of the Oslo Accord, proposed
to extend the deadline for a final Israeli-Palestinian peace pact
from May 1999 to January 2001.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the plan at a news conference here Wednesday, Beilin
also proposed to return 50 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians and recognize a demilitarized Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The May 1999 deadline was set by the Oslo Accord, but it is
likely to be missed in view of a prolonged deadlock in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have vowed to declare an independent state
regardless of a final agreement or not, evoking fear for an armed
conflicts between the sides and the expected destruction of what
have been achieved since the Oslo process began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Beilin said he has lobbied Palestinian, Jordanians and
U.S. officials in the last few weeks for support for this proposal.
</P>
<P>
The former Labor minister accused the Likud government of
playing tricks to avert an agreement on the second further
redeployment in the West Bank in an attempt to avoid being toppled
by various coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
He did not expect an agreement with the Palestinians before
July 29, when the Knesset (parliament) begins a three-month recess.
</P>
<P>
He said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is spreading false
information that there would be an agreement with the Palestinians
so to prevent the central factions from tabling a no-confidence
vote in the Knesset before the recess.
</P>
<P>
Even if an agreement is reached before July 29, Beilin said, it
will take another 12 weeks to carry out the redeployment. And
after that, the third stage of further redeployment remained to be
negotiated and carried out.
</P>
<P>
So it will be very difficult for the final status agreement to
be achieved before the Oslo deadline of May 1999, Beilin said.
</P>
<P>
In this case, "a sure collision" will occur next year, he added.
</P>
<P>
To avoid this scenario, Beilin suggested that the third and
the last stage of redeployment, which should be carried out no
later than mid-1998 according to the Hebron agreement signed last
year, be completed by January 1999, and accordingly the deadline
for a final agreement will also be postponed to January 2001.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Israeli government to accept a 10 percent third
stage withdrawal rather than the 1 percent proposed by Netanyahu,
thus transferring a total of 50 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians at the end of the interim period.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the postponement of the deadline on the final
talks, Beilin recommended that Israel express its willingness to
recognize a demilitarized Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
If the Palestinians are assured that such a state will occur,
"they will not need to unilaterally declare one in May next year
that could trigger violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the year 2000, new elections will be held in Israel for the
people to choose a new government among the Likud and Labor.
</P>
<P>
If the deadline is postponed, then the current Likud government
will be pushed to take a serious attitude toward the peace process
in order to win the next elections, Beilin explained.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Security Under Control: Police Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Security in Uganda is not as bad
as people expected and is under strict control by the police, a
senior police commander said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a hour-long interview with Xinhua, Central Regional Police
Commander Chris Bakesiima said the numbers of murders, sex
offences, armed and simple robberies as well as traffic offences
are relatively low.
</P>
<P>
In his region which covers seven districts in Uganda, there
are 152 murders, 229 rapes and defilements, 80 armed robberies,
73 simple robberies and 197 traffic offences in the first five
months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the matter of illegal guns in northeastern Karimonja he
said it is related with Uganda's history.
</P>
<P>
In 1979 when Idi Amin's government was collapsing, some of his
soldiers abandoned their barracks, leaving behind their guns and
other belongings. The guns were later picked up by civilians
there.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, some soldiers from that district deserted their units
taking their guns with them.
</P>
<P>
It is not easy to collect these guns from civilians, but the
government is trying its best to solve the matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
On road accidents, he held that the two rainy seasons saw more
accidents because the heavy and frequent rains made the feeder
roads in the country almost impassable, adding that the poor
quality of the roads should also be responsible for the
accidents.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Denies Holding Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah denied Wednesday the Iraqi allegations that
there are Iraqis still held in Kuwait, the official news agency
KUNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after attending a parliament session,
Sabah said Kuwait "is open to everyone who seeking to know that
there is a single Iraqi detainee here."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi National Council has reportedly said in a
statement that Kuwait had concealed information about the fate
of 1,037 Iraqis who went missing in action during its
military operations.
</P>
<P>
KUNA said Sabah expressed sorrow at these false allegations
eight years after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Sabah said the International Committee of the Red Cross has
not registered any Iraqi Prisoner of War (POW) in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iraqi allegation was meant to cover up its
continued holding of Kuwaiti POWs.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait said Iraq has been detaining over 600 Kuwaitis since the
end of the Gulf War, but Iraq has denied the claim.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Opposes U.S. Officials' Participation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus opposes any U.S. official's
participation in events organized by the Turkish Cypriot regime in
northern part of the island, even in their personal capacity, a
government spokesman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Christos Stylianides was commenting on statements made Tuesday
by U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin that the
unofficial presence of U.S. embassy employees at celebrations by
the Turkish Cypriot regime to mark the 24th anniversary of Turkish
invasion "is in no way an endorsement of the event."
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent troops and took over the northern third of the
Cyprus island 24 years ago with a claimed aim to protect the
Turkish Cypriots there in the wake of a failed coup attempt by
Greek Cypriots to seek union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots established a breakaway republic in 1983,
but only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
With the U.S. embassy staff's presence, "they give the illegal
regime a legal backing and they are acting contrary to the spirit
of Security Council and U.S. Congress resolutions," Stylianides
said at his daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, "it is positive that Mr. Rubin officially
stated that there was no official American participation in these
events."
</P>
<P>
Stylianides called on the U.S. government to examine this
issue, because "even in their personal capacity the employees
give a legal backing to some acts."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot regime in northern Cyprus held a series of
events over the weekend and on Monday to mark the Turkish military
intervention with the participation of Turkish Premier Mesut
Yilmaz.

LUANDA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Another oil field has been found
on the sea bed of the waters near Luanda, capital of Angola by
Angolan State-run oil company and the ESSO Angola Development
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The oil field, the third found in the area, is found on the
1202 meter-deep sea bed about 360 km northwestern of Luanda.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued recently by the Angola state-run oil
company said that they are still investigating the reserves and
its economical value.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the ESSO Angola Development Ltd. has found four
fields, of which three are in trial production with a daily
production of 15,900 barrels.
</P>
<P>
The new finding is the fifth oil field found on Angola's

<HEADLINE> Study Links Fathers' Sperm Cells to Leukaemia in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Children whose fathers have been
exposed to radiation may be at greater risk of developing
leukaemia, a new study by British scientists have found.
</P>
<P>
A team at the Paterson Institute for Cancer Research in
Manchestr, the UK, has shown that sperm cells exposed to radiation
can produce offspring vulnerable to a second "cancer attack."
</P>
<P>
However, the findings, published in the latest issue of British
Journal of Cancer, stressed that increased risk was triggered only
if the second generation of cells were exposed to a cancer-causing
agent, which will nearly double the risk of developing leukaemia.
</P>
<P>
Researchers exposed mice to radiation at a level that was too
low to cause them any visible damage. Their offsprings were
outwardly normal, compared with control groups whose parents had
not been irradiated.
</P>
<P>
But the second generation turned out to have two oddities in
their bone marrow, a main source of blood cells, and there were
also signs that cells here had excess DNA damage.
</P>
<P>
After being given a second "hit" of a cancer-inducing
substance, some 65 percent of the mice developed leukaemia
compared with 38 percent in the control groups.
</P>
<P>
The study shows for the first time a potential way in which
paternal irradiation can lead to an increase in leukaemia risk for
the next generation, said Brian Lord, who led the research.
</P>
<P>
"It shows us how DNA defects can be passed from generation to
generation." he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian-Egyptian Cooperation Reaches Peak: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Ambassador to Jordan Hani
Riyad Wednesday hailed the cooperation between Egypt and Jordan on
the peace process, saying it has reached its highest level.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian diplomat said this was demonstrated by the
frequent exchange of visits by Jordanian King Hussein and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and the regular meetings held
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Riyad made the remarks in a statement to mark the occasion of
Egypt's celebration on the 46th anniversary of the 1952 Revolution
that ended Egypt's monarchy.
</P>
<P>
"This coordination comes as part of the keenness of his
Majesty King Hussein and President Hosni Mubarak to achieve
permanent, just and comprehensive peace in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation is based on both sides' common interests in
restoring the legitimate rights of the Palestinians and
implementing the United Nations resolutions concerning the peace
process, Riyad added.
</P>
<P>
He said both Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab countries that
have sealed peace with Israel, consider peace as a strategic
option and reject all forms of terrorism and the means of war to
solve disputes.
</P>
<P>
Jordan unilaterally recognized Egypt in September 1984,
becoming the first Arab state to do so after most Arab League
countries cut their ties with Cairo in 1979 to protest the
Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, Canada Sign 95-Million-Dollar Accord on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon and Canada signed an
agreement Wednesday to help rehabilitate Lebanon's out-dated
postal service, involving Canadian investment of 92 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian investment will be made over 12 years, the
state-run National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Profac, a Canadian company, was selected to process the
agreement. It will set up another company in Lebanon with a
capital of 20 million dollars to run the country's postal service,
according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Profac will own two-thirds of the shares of the new company
which will be mainly in charge of mail handling, express mail,
facsimile and sales of stamps. The rest of the shares will be sold
to private Lebanese investors.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulated that Lebanese Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications will receive 5 percent of the company's annual
revenues from mail-handling services, which will rise to 40
percent after 12 years and 50 percent if the contract is renewed.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also receive 10 percent of revenues from
express mail and facsimile services. The figure will rise to
possible 60 percent on renewal.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, also minister of posts
and telecommunication, and Canadian Minister of Public Works and
Government Service Alfonso Gagliano attended the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Gagliano said after the ceremony that he hoped the agreement
would help modernize Lebanon's postal service sector and bring
about positive effects on the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Postal operations, like other public services in Lebanon, were
set back by the 1975-1990 civil war. It takes up to several months
for a letter to reach its destination within the country.

JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Domestic flights at the
Johannesburg International Airport were disrupted Wednesday as
hundreds of baggage handlers went on strike, South African media
reported.
</P>
<P>
At least 21 flights were delayed due to the strike,
inconveniencing 3,000 passengers, South African Airways (SAA)
spokesman Leon Els said. According to him, more flight delays
were expected.
</P>
<P>
Airports in the major cities of Durban and Cape Town were also
affected by the delays at the Johannesburg International Airport,
reports said. But overseas flights were generally not affected.
</P>
<P>
About 350 members of the South African Railways and Harbors
Workers' Union (SARHWU) went on strike Wednesday morning to
protest the South African Airport Company's decision to invite
tenders from outside the company for the ramp handling
operations.
</P>
<P>
The company placed an advertisement in the media on Monday to
invite tenders for the job. Employees claimed the move would
result in the retrenchment of half of apron services workers.
</P>
<P>
Baggage piled up outside the terminal buildings and the
situation at the airport was still chaotic late on Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A company spokesperson said they contracted a private
transport company to ferry people from planes to the arrival
terminals as a stop-gap measure.
</P>
<P>
Two police officers were reportedly wounded in the morning in
running battles between police and strikers. The situation calmed
down in the afternoon but the strike went on.
</P>
<P>
The airports company said the management, workers'
representatives and SARHWU leaders were still locked in
negotiations.

The South African Airport Company operates nine airports
around the country.

<HEADLINE> Plenary Session of Burundi Peace Talks Adjourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The plenary session of the
second round of Burundi talks was adjourned again following a
request from the Burundian government delegation.
</P>
<P>
Through the international mediator on Burundi, Julius Nyerere,
the Burundian government delegation requested more time for
negotiations on whether the issue of "nature of Burundi conflict"
should be tackled at the plenary or at a sub-committee level,
reports reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen parties are taking part in the talks in Arusha, north
Tanzania, trying to end a bitter ethnic conflict in which more
than 150,000 people have died since October 1993 in a series of
bloody conflicts between the Tutsi-dominated army and rebels who
claim to represent the country's Hutu majority.
</P>
<P>
The second round of Burundi peace talks under the chairmanship
of Nyerere, the former president of Tanzania, started on Tuesday
morning, but negotiations of conflicting parties proved to be
tough.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian government officials at the peace talks are of
the opinion that the issue of "nature of Burundi talks" should be
handled by a sub-committee and its proposals be forwarded to the
plenary session whereas the armed groups -- CNDD, FROLINA and
PALIPEHUTU wanted it to be directly discussed at the plenary
session.
</P>
<P>
To allow leaders of all conflicting parties to discuss the
issue, Nyerere adjourned the plenary session from Tuesday to
Wednesday, and on Wednesday he had to postpone the session for a
second time.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A thorough and proper
understanding of the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action
(VDPA) is the prerequisite and basis for the review of its
implementation in the past five years, China stressed here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, Chinese deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, made the remarks at the meeting held by the
Economic and Social Council to carry out a comprehensive review of
the implementation of the VDPA which was adopted at the World
Conference on Human Rights in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Shen said the VDPA is a comprehensive document,
which has defined the shared objective of the international
community to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms and has
stressed that the protection of human rights should be achieved in
accordance with the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter
and relevant provisions of international law.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that while recognizing the universality of human
rights, VDPA requires that in activities aimed at promoting and
protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, consideration
should be given to the significance of national and regional
particularities as well as various historical, cultural and
religious background.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the VDPA points out that all human rights are
interrelated and indivisible and should be treated with the same
emphasis and that poverty and external debt are stumbling blocks
to the enjoyment of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the VDPA reaffirms that the right to development is
an inalienable right and an integral part of human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
</P>
<P>
He said that in reviewing the five-year implementation of the
VDPA, the international community should have a balanced
perspective instead of only highlighting some principles and
commitment in the VDPA in one aspect while overlooking the views
and positions expressed in it in some other aspects.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Pledges Continued Efforts on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) envoy for
Cyprus pledged here Wednesday the EU would continue its efforts to
break the impasse in the Cyprus peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of his three-day
visit to the divided island, Sir David Hannay said the EU would
make systematic and hard efforts in the months ahead to resume the
intercommunal dialog in Cyprus that has been halted since nearly
one year ago.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Hannay held talks with Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides to discuss the U.N.-sponsored peace process,
Cyprus' EU membership talks and security matters, including the
controversial plan to deploy missiles.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash refused to see Hannay
during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing suggestions that he was here to demand concessions
from the Greek Cypriots, Hannay said he did not seek to change the
framework of the U.N.-sponsored talks, a precondition placed by
the Turkish Cypriots for resuming the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that his visit failed to get the two sides back to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The peace process hit a snag last August after Denktash walked
out of the U.N.-sponsored peace talks with Greek Cypriot leader
Clerides to protest against the EU decision to start accession
talks with the Cypriot government led by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said he would not resume the intercommunal peace
talks unless his breakaway entity in northern Cyprus is
recognized and Cyprus withdraws its application for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Hannay gave his backing to Clerides' proposal for the
demilitarization of Cyprus, describing it as "extremely serious".
</P>
<P>
"We think an approach which starts with some part of these
proposals may be a useful one," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hannay, also Britain's Special Representative for Cyprus, said
Britain supports a moratorium of overflights of Greek and Turkish
warplanes in Cyprus, as proposed by the United States, in order to
reduce tension.
</P>
<P>
The British diplomat also said that the Denktash's refusal to
see him did not limit his ability to do his job, but hurt the
Turkish Cypriot leader's own influence on countries vital to the
future of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops took over the northern third of the island after an
abortive coup launched by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been mounting on the island since early last year
when Cyprus ordered a Russian anti-aircraft missile system, which
is scheduled to be deployed late this year. Turkey has threatened
to launch preemptive strikes against the missiles if they are
delivered to the island.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov
Wednesday sacked two first deputy defense ministers for failure to
protect U.N. staff stationed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of Abdullo Khabibov and Sodik Bobodzhanov
followed the murder of four members of the U.N. mission Monday in
eastern Tajikistan, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Abdurakhmon Azimov and Defense Minister Sherali
Khairulloyev were also reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov, meeting Jan Kubis, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's envoy to Tajikistan, earlier Wednesday, pledged to find
the murderers and bring them to justice.
</P>
<P>
The president condemned the attack as a terrorist act with
political undertones.
</P>
<P>
"People who committed this outrageous act are traitors of Tajik
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The four victims were Otaka Akino of Japan, Ryszard Szevczek of
Poland, Adolfo Siarpegu of Uruguay and a Tajik national who worked
as a driver and interpreter.
</P>
<P>
They were killed on their way from the district of Tavildara to
the town of Labidzhar, which is 170 kilometers east of the capital
Dushanbe. All bodies showed gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the assassination, Kubis said all staff
members of the U.N. mission in Tajikistan are recalled to the
capital from the regions.
</P>
<P>
Khabib Sanginov, head of the Dushanbe-based military
subcommission of the National Reconciliation Commission, said the
murder was a premeditated act representing a stab in the back of
the whole peace process in Tajikistan and undermining the
country's prestige on the international arena.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged the media not to rush to premature
conclusions implicating some side in the crime, Itar-Tass
reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dialogue and cooperation should be enhanced to remove the major
obstacles to the implementation of the follow-up actions of the
VDPA, Ambassador Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Shen said history has proved that due to their differences in
social system, ideology, cultural tradition ans level of
development, countries naturally differ in their emphasis in the
promotion and protection of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Shen said all countries need to promote and protect their
people's human rights, and they should respect each other, seek
common ground while putting aside differences, enhance mutual
understanding and cooperation, and work to have more dialogue
instead of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Shen said adopting a presumptuous, arrogant and
biased approach on the question of human rights, teaching others a
lesson on flimsy grounds, pursuing double standards or
politicizing the question of human rights will do no good but harm
to the cause of promoting and protecting human rights.
</P>
<P>
Shen said more and more countries have conducted human rights
dialogue and exchanges on the basis of equality and mutual
respect. The United Nations should take effective measures to
further accelerate this trend among countries as well as relevant
bodies within the U.N. system, he said.

<HEADLINE> Developed Nations Asked Not to Pour Arms to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- An international conference
on Africa's demilitarization opened Wednesday in Arusha, northern
Tanzania, calling on the industrialized countries, especially the
United States to stop pouring their arms to the poor African
continent.
</P>
<P>
In his key note address, former president of Costa Rica Oscar
Arias told more than 100 senior military experts and politicians
from African countries and other parts of the world that Africa
spent nearly eight billion U.S. Dollars on arms imports from the
developed countries while getting less economic aid from them.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is responsible for 45 percent of all
weapons deliveries in the world," said Arias, a 1987 Nobel Peace
laureate. "This figure is simply appalling considering that
Africa has the highest proportion of the poor in the world."
</P>
<P>
At the Conference on Leadership Challenges of Demilitarization
in Africa, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa urged African
countries to cut down on military expenditures and instead to
promote their economies.
</P>
<P>
"The military expenses must reflect a realistic assessment of
external threat, if any, or the amount of resources at disposal,"
Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
The best way to decrease military expenditures is to promote
the socio-economic development which demands infusion of greater
resources, both private and official, said the president.
</P>
<P>
However, Mkapa said, the aid from the developed countries to
Africa has drastically dropped from a total of 368 billion U.S.
Dollars in 1996 to 272 billion U.S. Dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Aid from the richest countries, G7, is a mere 0.19 percent of
their collective national incomes, far below the target of 0.7
percent set by the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa underscored that African countries should build up a
consensus that a speedy socio-economic development will help
Africa to boost its capacity to move away from confrontations and
wars.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference was organized by the Arias Foundation
for Peace and Human Progress in collaboration with the African
Leadership Forum and the United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The delegates, including former Haitian President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide and former President of Panama Guillermo
Ondara, are expected to share their experience in peace-building
and demilitarization.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Parliament Rejects Censure Motion on PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish parliament on Wednesday
rejected a censure motion against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
The parliament announced that only 230 deputies voted for the
motion, 46 votes short of the required absolute majority to pass
such a motion.
</P>
<P>
The motion, submitted by the opposition Virtue Party, charged
that Yilmaz had illegally assigned a plot of land belonging to a
state-owned paper mill in Izmit, near the largest city of
Istanbul, to the auto company Ford Otosan, which is associated
with the industrialist giant Koc Group.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, if the prime minister is toppled
by a censure motion, the government has to step down.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the criticism, Yilmaz stressed that the
ground-breaking ceremony for building an automobile factory on
that land would be held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On April 22, the Turkish parliament decided to investigate the
allegations that Yilmaz had also omitted some shares in Turkey's
Finance Bank between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the inquiry into Yilmaz's private wealth
was a retaliation launched by the opposition True Path Party for a
probe into its leader Tansu Ciller's private property.

Attention should be given to research in the economic, social
and cultural rights and the right to development, and the
imbalance in the United Nations' activities in the field of human
rights should be gradually redressed, the Chinese ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang said that in today's world, most countries are
developing countries and a vast majority of the world population
live in developing countries. To them, the political and civil
rights are important, but the social, economic and cultural rights
and the right to development are just as important, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Shen said, in the field of human rights of the United
Nations, the economic, social and cultural rights that the
developing countries are concerned about are not given due
attention, while the right to development is still far from being
realized.
</P>
<P>
Shen said evaluating the implementation of the VDPA over the
past five years, the international community shall not fail to
fully realize this fact, and it should promote the research and
realization of economic, social cultural rights and the right to
development by revising the agenda of the Human Rights Commission
and expanding activities in the relevant U.N. bodies so that the
various human rights cited in the VDPA will be treated equally and
given same emphasis.

<HEADLINE> France to Greatly Cut Tax to Push for Growth, Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The French government will greatly
cut taxes on enterprises and daily necessities such as housing,
gas and electricity in its 1999 budget plan to push forward
economic growth and employment.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance and Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the
government will cut tax by 16.6 billion francs (2.8 billion U.S.
dollars) next year, including a 8.9 billion franc (1.5 billion
dollar) reduction on enterprises and a 7.7 billion franc (1.3
billion dollar) reduction on families.
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular measure is a five-year plan to eliminate
charges on hiring employees by enterprises in the tax paid by
professional people.
</P>
<P>
The French government expects to create 400,000 jobs this year
and attain a 3 percent growth of the gross domestic product (GDP)
this year.
</P>
<P>
The government will also reduce by 45 to 50 percent the tax on
the properties of enterprises, in order not to "penalize
productive efforts and guard confidence and the re-found growth,"
said Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.

<P>
This tax reform will answer the needs of the daily life of the
French people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The subscribers to the electricity and gas supplies will have
their VAT tax fall from 20.6 percent to 5.5 percent, while the tax
on holding an identity card and driver's license will also be
reduced or abolished.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the enterprises will benefit from the new
tax policy, which will reduce the costs for employing workers by
4-5 percent and will help create 100,000 jobs, said Strauss-Kahn.
</P>
<P>
The government will also gradually reduce taxes on local
housing, which is regarded as one of the "injust" of the taxes,
and on environmentally friendly gases.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the TF1 television, Strauss-Kahn said that
the budget is clearly one of the leftwing which is good for family
and jobs.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform has been welcomed by both the left and the right
parties as one good for jobs and growth.

<HEADLINE> 2ndLd Writethru: Iranian Majlis Approves Naming of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Against their will, the
conservatives at the Iranian Majlis (parliament) on Wednesday let
the new Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari pass the vote of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Lari, who is vice president for legal and parliamentary
affairs, won the vote of confidence following a four-hour heated
debate at the 270-seat Majlis' opening session
</P>
<P>
Lari won 177 votes out of a total of 266, with 67 against and
22 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
President Mohammad Khatami nominated Lari for the post on July
15, after the former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, who bore
the brunt for allowing pro-government political demonstrations
across the country, was impeached by the Majlis last month.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives decided to approve the vote of confidence
after questioning Lari at a factional meeting on Tuesday night
about his belief in the supreme leadership, his attitude towards
the Guardians Council and the Constitution as well as his future
program.
</P>
<P>
Factional struggle has become sensitive after Nouri was ousted,
and Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, a close ally of Khatami,
put on an open trial on embezzlement charges last month.
</P>
<P>
In order to convince the right-wing parliamentarians, Khatami
personally attended Wednesday's session and urged the lawmakers to
support his government through a vote of confidence to Lari.
</P>
<P>
He praised Lari as a "clear-sighted, rational and committed
personality" in the country, "who is fully capable of performing
his duties, and serves as a consolidating factor within the
government."
</P>
<P>
Khatami said he believed Lari's experiences in and knowledge
about the Majlis would help consolidate the relations between the
government and the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Lari, 44, once served as a Majlis member and was appointed a
vice president after Khatami was elected president in May last
year in a landslide victory over the conservative candidate,
Majlis speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Majlis' approval of the new interior minister, the
hardliners are expected to put more pressure on Khatami due to the
wide differences over political development and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of President Khatami accused the conservatives of
weakening the government by setting hurdles on its way of
political development. However, the conservatives argued that the
government should give priorities to solving economic problems
rather than political development.
</P>
<P>
Defending his future programs, Lari has vowed to continue the
government's programs on political development to involve people's
further role.
</P>
<P>
Echoing his predecessor's tune, Lari called for a suitable
atmosphere for the expression of different views.
</P>
<P>
In a warning reply, the conservatives said if problems of the
previous interior minister are repeated during Lari's tenure, the
majority faction will treat him in the same way as to his
predecessor.

<HEADLINE> Hussein in Minnesota for Cancer Diagnosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein is
expected to stay at a clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for a cancer
diagnosis of lymphoma, the clinic said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mayo Clinic issued a brief statement confirming a letter
King Hussein had sent to his brother and heir apparent, Crown
Prince Hassan, saying he might begin chemotherapy if the cancer
diagnosis is confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The clinic quoted the king's letter as saying, "My general
condition is better although I still suffer from bouts of fever. I
am still on antibiotics and I am in high spirits."
</P>
<P>
The king arrived at the famed clinic on July 14 to obtain a
precise diagnosis for a recurrent fever he had been suffering for
the previous two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone said although all the symptoms point to me having
lymphoma, they cannot until now diagnose this for certain," the
king said in the letter, which was read on Jordanian television.
</P>
<P>
Since undergoing cancer surgery at the clinic six years ago,
the king has returned for regular checkups. He had an operation on
his prostate last year and later had a swollen lymph gland
removed. He was also treated in London for a bacterial infection
that caused him extreme exhaustion and recurrent fever.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Rejects Clinton's Air Force Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Services Committee of
the U.S. Senate Wednesday rejected, on a tie vote, President Bill
Clinton's nomination of Daryl Jones, a Florida state senator and
former fighter pilot, to be secretary of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Questions about his flight history and business dealings doomed
the nomination, detractors said.
</P>
<P>
Supporters moved to report the nomination to the Senate floor
without a recommendation of approval or rejection, but even that
motion failed, 9-9.
</P>
<P>
Jones would have been the first black to serve as Air Force
secretary.
</P>
<P>
But witnesses at a nine-hour confirmation hearing last week
said Jones, as an Air Force Reserve pilot, almost ran out of fuel
on one occasion, flew the wrong way on another and damaged his
aircraft by scraping the plane's tail on four occasions.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the only
one of 10 Republicans on the panel to support Jones, said Jones
had been the subject of "rumor campaigns and personal attacks."
</P>
<P>
Thurmond said, "I do not believe that anyone has been able to
prove that Mr. Jones knowingly sought to misrepresent his
credentials, to defraud the government, or to mislead this
committee."
</P>
<P>
P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for Clinton's National Security
Council, said the administration was "profoundly disappointed"
with the vote and would consult with supporters of the nomination
before deciding how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, senior Democrat on the
committee and Jones' chief defender, dismissed allegations against
Jones as "smoke."
</P>
<P>
"Where there is smoke, there is sometimes fire. But sometimes
when there is smoke -- there is only smoke," he said.
</P>
<P>
But others said they were troubled by Jones' history, including
allegations that he was grounded as an unsafe pilot -- but
insisted to the panel that he stopped flying voluntarily, that he
accepted flight pay from the Air Force years after he stopped
flying, and that he pressured enlisted men to buy Amway household
products from him.
</P>
<P>
His detractors said he was the wrong man to lead the Air Force
at a time when morale is low and the service is having an
increasingly difficult time keeping pilots.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen reiterated his strong support
for Jones as recently as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton nominated Jones in October to replace Sheila Widnall,
who resigned.
</P>
<P>
After serving as a pilot in the Air Force, Jones joined the Air
Force Reserve, flying out of Homestead Air Force Base near Miami.
</P>
<P>
Jones, 43, did not dispute his bad flying record but blamed it
on his devotion to public service. He insisted it would not
interfere with his ability to oversee the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
But his former squadron commander and other former colleagues
told the panel that Jones had refused to stop flying on his own
despite repeated suggestions -- and had to be grounded.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator John Warner, a former Navy secretary, said
he had concluded that Jones would be "unable to serve as a leader
and inspire those who served under him, particularly those in
uniform."
</P>
<P>
Senator John Glenn, a Democrat and former Marine pilot and
astronaut, said none of the allegations against Jones had been
proved, nor had his accusers been put under oath.
</P>
<P>
"We're about to wreck a man's career, and that's a tough one
for me to accept," Glenn said.

Shen said that since 1993, all United Nations organs, bodies

Shen said China is of the view that human rights-related
activities are an important aspect of the work of the U.N. system,
but they cannot take the place of or diminish the work and
function of other aspects.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the relevant U.N. bodies should, within the context
of their respective mandates, conduct activities to promote human
rights and fundamental freedoms and evaluate the impact of
relevant policies and programs on the enjoyment of human rights.

ANKARA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said on Wednesday that his country is seeking greater role in
the region and the world, saying the country "is emerging as a
global power."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the presentation of the Foreign Ministry's "Turkey
and the world in 2010-2020" report, Cem stated that his country is
seeking "an important economic and political role in Eurasia."
</P>
<P>
He said peripheral roles for Turkey in the international arena
can no longer be considered.
</P>
<P>
"We want to be a part of Europe but our vision is not confined
to Europe... Turkey is no longer confined to the outskirts of
Europe and it is emerging as a global power," said Cem.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the international conjuncture abruptly changed
after the end of the Cold War and the new climate has provided
Turkey with many opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"We have profound historical and cultural links with 26
countries which gained independence after the end of the Cold War
and this constitutes a unique chance for Turkey to convert itself
into a global power," stressed Cem.
</P>
<P>
The study presented Wednesday draws a rosy picture with
respect to Turkey's economic development in the next two decades
and predicts that it will become one of the five major economies
within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD).

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Astronaut Alan Shepard, the
first American to fly in space and the fifth human to walk on the
Moon, died at athe age of 74 late Tuesday in a community hospital
near Monterey, California, The Associated Press reported here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Alan Shepard, a former Navy test pilot, made a 15-minute
suborbital flight -- five of those minutes in space -- on May 5,
1961, aboard the Freedom 7 Mercury spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, after conquering his serious inner-ear
disorder that affected his balance for six years, Shepard entered
space for his second and the last flight as commander of Apollo 14
on Jan. 31, 1971. This was the third of the six U.S. Apollo lunar
landings and made Shepard one of the dozen people to have walked
on the Moon.
</P>
<P>
After learning Shepard's death, President Bill Clinton said,
"Those of us who are old enough to remember the first space
flights will always remember what an impression he made on us and
on the world."
</P>
<P>
Shepard spent 33 hours on the Moon during the third landing
mission and on that flight Shepard spent nine days in space.

WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration

available to 16 communities for programs designed to reduce youth
crime, gangs and truancy.
</P>

The help for 16 communities is "a big first step," President
Bill Clinton said in announcing the grants at a White House

Saying "16 is not enough," Clinton urged Congress to pass his
1999 budget proposals providing more money for such programs.

<P>
Each of the communities will get 135,000 dollars in grants
under what Clinton called a "values-based violence prevention
initiative." It is based on a Boston model, and Boston Police

<HEADLINE> AL Welcomes Fresh Developments in Lockerbie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Wednesday hailed the
U.S. and Britain's acceptance of having two Libyans, suspected of
exploding a U.S. jetliner over Scotland, tried in a neutral
country.
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly what the Arab side has been calling for,"
Mohamad Zakaria Ismail, the league's assistant secretary general
for political affairs, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the development as a "diplomatic and political
victory for the Arab world."
</P>
<P>
Certain legal measures remained to be finalized regarding
moving the court from Scotland to the Netherlands, he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 270 people were killed when a bomb ripped apart Pan
Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair Wednesday announced his
readiness to have the two Libyan nationals tried in a neutral
country under Scottish law. The U.S. State Department Spokesman
James Rubin has also said Washington is now ready to accept the
change of the trial venue.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, directly involved in the Lockerbie case as
litigants against Libya, had for long been insisting on holding
the trial in Britain or the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The U-turn came as opposition to U.N. sanctions on Libya grew
in the Arab world and Africa. Recently, a number of Arab and
African leaders flew to Tripoli in defiance of a ban on air travel
to and from Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based Arab League is ready to undertake the handing
over of the two suspects and ensuring their security, Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
The official also demanded the lifting of the sanctions on
Libya, imposed in 1992 after Tripoli failed to extradite the two
men.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Defends Spokesman over Wedding Secrecy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Wednesday came to the defense of his embattled
spokesman Parks Mankahlana, saying that he had full confidence in
the ability of Mankahlana.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana has been criticized by both South African and
international media for allegedly lying about Mandela's impending
marriage to Graca Machel, which has raised question marks about
his credibility.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Mandela as
saying in Brazil that "he (Mankahlana) did not know. The only
person who knew was (Deputy President) Thabo Mbeki."
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I did not inform him (led to him being)
convinced that the (marriage) reports were completely untrue and
I was not in a position to come out and say, `Look, you're wrong,
we are actually planning to (marry)`."
</P>
<P>
The media's attack on Mankahlana was therefore unfounded,
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's planned wedding on Saturday was disclosed by media
Thursday. But Mankahlana repeatedly denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
As late as Friday afternoon, he said: "The rumors are false
and we would like the president and his family to enjoy the
tranquility they deserve on his 80th birthday (last Saturday).
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana Monday shrugged off media attacks, saying the
wedding was a private affair.
</P>
<P>
There were allegations that one publishing company had bought
the rights to cover the wedding for an undisclosed amount of
money.
</P>
<P>
But the company, Mafube Publishing, denied the allegations.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. fact-finding delegation led
by former Portuguese President Mario Soares arrived here Wednesday
for a two-week visit to Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The mission was dispatched at the request made by Algerian
Foreign Minister Ahmed Al-Attaf to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
Attaf also sent similar messages to Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity Salem Ahmed Salem and Secretary
General of the Arab League Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
In his messages, Attaf called for sending an international
fact-finding mission to learn about the real situation in Algeria,
which has been struck by an Islamic insurgence since 1992, in
which about 75,000 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
The six-member delegation also included some other former
government leaders and diplomats, such as former Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul Karim Al-Kabariti, former U.S. Ambassador to the
U.N. McDonald Henry, and former Kenyan Justice Minister Wamson
Wako.
</P>
<P>
This visit was unprecedented because in the past Algeria had
rejected it as interference in its internal matters.
</P>
<P>
Attaf said that his invitation showed Algeria's keenness on
giving the international community a clear vision and accurate
understanding of the true situation in Algeria in all its
dimensions without any distortion or confusion.
</P>
<P>
"The mission of the international delegation is the
fact-finding rather than investigation," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The mission will present a report to Annan after the visit to
make suggestions on how to end the Algerian bloodshed.

He said the increases were necessitated by escalating input
costs the parastatal had been absorbing.

<P>
"As a business entity," Mondhani said, "we have to adapt and
respond to the dictates of our operating economic environment."
</P>
<P>
The increases come at a time many Zimbabwean companies are
reeling under the effects of a harsh economic environment
characterized by high rates of interest and inflation and a weak
currency.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Secretary Expresses Determination to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam Wednesday expressed her determination to keep
the peace process forward despite tensions still remaining in the
province.
</P>
<P>
"There is a determination in Northern Ireland that we are not
going back" to the years of conflict, Mowlam told reporters at a
breakfast before meeting congressional leaders and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's Protestant and Catholic parties reached a
Good Friday agreement in April for a peaceful settlement to the
the conflict that had lasted several decades causing heavy
casualties. After that a new assembly is expected to be set up.
</P>
<P>
But tensions remain with splinter groups, which are outside
the deal, preparing to use violence to disrupt the agreement.
Three Catholic boys were killed in a fire bomb attack on their
home last week.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said the police had intercepted 10 bombs being brought
to Northern Ireland from the south in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
She urged Irish Americans, who have backed the nationalist
struggle in the past, not to support splinter groups because
these groups are determined to continue their campaign with
violence.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam also expressed gratitude to President Bill Clinton for
his personal role in pushing the rival parties to reach the Good
Friday agreement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is due to visit Northern Ireland and the Republic of
Ireland in the first week of September on his way back home from
a visit to Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Aerospatiale airspace and
aeronautics group and the Lagardere-Matra high technology defense
and electronics group Wednesday decided to merge to build Europe's
first airspace and defense conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
The Aerospatiale will remain half public for the time being,
and the stocks of the new conglomerate will be sold at the stocks
step by step, said the two merging groups.
</P>
<P>
The Lagardere group will own 30-33 percent of the new
conglomerate, whose staff will be encouraged to take a great part
of the shares of the conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
This is a major step by the Socialist government to privatize
France's big public enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The new group will be listed on the stock exchange and will
offer its staff the possibility of acquiring a substantial
fraction of the titles put into the market," said the two merging
groups.
</P>
<P>
"The capital could be later open to other French industrial
shareholders or European private shareholders in view of future
European alliances," they said.
</P>
<P>
The new conglomerate will officially come into being on January
1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Parliament Rejects Censure Motion on PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish parliament Wednesday
rejected a censure motion against Motherland Party (ANAP)
Chairman and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Parliament's deputy speaker announced that 230 deputies had
voted to censure Yilmaz, saying that 46 votes far from the
required absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
The motion submitted by the opposition Virtue Party (FP)
charged that Yilmaz had illegally assigned a plot of land,
belonging to the state-owned paper and pulp company SEKA in Izmit
near Istanbul, to the Ford Otosan company, associated with the
industrial giant Koc Group.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Constitution, if the prime minister is
toppled through a censure motion, the government also has to step
down.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz has asserted that those opposing this investment would
be traitors, while opposition parties said that the land was a
state-owned nursery on the coast, and that an automobile plant
would pollute the environment.
</P>
<P>
Despite all reactions, Yilmaz stressed that the plant's
ground-breaking ceremony near Istanbul, the largest city of
Turkey, would be on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On April 22, the Turkish parliament decided to investigate the
allegations that Yilmaz had embezzled some shares in Turkey's
Finance Bank between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the inquiry into Yilmaz's private wealth
was a retaliation launched by the True Path Party (DYP) for a
probe into its leader Tansu Ciller's private property.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Bans Controversial AIDS Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government Wednesday
outlawed the controversial treatment for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Jackson Kalweo also ordered the closure of
clinics and health centers administering the drug, whose brain
child is British scientist Basil Wainwright alias Dr. Stone.
</P>
<P>
The operations of Dr. Stone and the application of his
untested therapy are "both illegal and untenable in Kenya,"
Kalweo told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stone came to Kenya in 1996 when he introduced the therapy
which is a form of oxygen gas, used in the treatment of AIDS,
diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, renal diseases, among others.
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to warn that any medical professional
involved or found to be abetting this treatment is breaking the
law and should stop such actions forthwith," Kalweo said.
</P>
<P>
"The treatment Mr. Wainwright claims to offer has no proven
scientific basis as no research work has ever been conducted on
such a mode of cure in this country or anywhere else," Kalweo
said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stone could not be reached for comment on the day.
</P>
<P>
The ban came at the time when the ozone therapy controversy
bounced back to the limelight after South African's former first
lady Winnie Madikizela-Mandela voiced her support for the
therapy.
</P>
<P>
During her visit to Nairobi early this month, Winnie accused
the Western world of rejecting any invention from Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government banned another AIDS-related treatment --
Pearl Omega -- initiated by Professor Arthur Obel in 1996, on the
ground that its efficacy was in doubt.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Stick to Macroeconomic Policy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- South African Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel Wednesday reaffirmed the Reserve Bank's
independence, saying that the recent turmoil on financial markets
had only strengthened the government's resolve to stick to its
macroeconomic policy.
</P>
<P>
Manuel made the remarks during a special debate on the ailing
currency in parliament, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We have come too far, endured too many hardships and made too
many sacrifices to reverse the course we have embarked on," he
told the National Assembly in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Monetary policy, which was aimed at achieving price stability,
remained the exclusive domain of the Reserve Bank, Manuel said,
adding that its independence is not open to debate.
</P>
<P>
At a media briefing after the debate, Manuel said that if
exchange rate volatility and high interest rates persisted, it
was common cause that government's growth targets would be
exceedingly hard to reach.
</P>
<P>
Finance Department officials are working on a series of
simulations to determine the effect of the Rand's recent fall,
said Manuel.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was any way government could use fiscal policy
to bring down interest rates, Manuel said: "There isn't in truth
a lot of room to manoeuvre on the fiscal side."
</P>
<P>
He defended the decision to appoint former labor minister Tito
Mboweni to succeed Chris Stals as Reserve Bank governor next
year, saying that after careful consideration it had been decided
Mboweni was the best man for the job.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni's appointment was criticized by opposition parties
which feared that his position in the ruling African National
Congress would hurt the independence of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Manuel vigorously denied the accusation from the opposition
National Party (NP) that he personally spurred fierce speculative
attack on the Rand.
</P>
<P>
NP finance spokesman Theo Alant said that according to party
sources, Manuel had conveyed information on Mboweni's appointment
to certain overseas bankers.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Tea Yield Expected to Hit New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenya can expect its best tea
crop in history this year, thanks to heavy rainfall together with
Mombasa said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, Africa Tea Brokers (ATB)
Managing Director Norman Wilson said that tea yield in the east
African country may rise by 26.9 percent to 280 million kilograms
this year, compared with 220.7 million kg in 1997 and the record
257 million kg in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The rains are well spread across the country and the
production of tea continues to be on course for a record," Wilson
said in Kenya's Indian Ocean port Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
The report said that new varieties, more or new inputs,
innovative planting and production methods, improved pest and
disease control techniques and modern processing procedures had
all combined to great increase of productivity.
</P>
<P>
Wilson estimated the production in the first half of 1998 at
155.22 million kg, a 60.5 percent increase over the 96.73 million
kg produced in the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that tea output is traditionally low between July
and September but it would pick up from October to December.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Tea Board officials also expressed optimism that the
country is to regain its position as the world's top exporter of
black teas.
</P>
<P>
Kenya replaced Sri Lanka as the world's largest tea exporter
in 1996 but lost the position last year.
</P>
<P>
The main buyers of Kenyan teas are Britain, Pakistan, Egypt,
Afghanistan, Iran, Sudan, Ireland, Yemen and the United States.

RIO DE JANEIRO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Vasco da Gama of Brazil and
Barcelona of Ecuador will vie for the title of the South American
Libertadores Cup after both sides qualified into the final on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vasco fought out a vital 1-1 away draw with Argentine giants
River Plate on Wednesday night after substitute Juninho scored
from a 20 meter free kick with seven minutes to go of their
semifinal second leg.
</P>
<P>
The goal gave Vasco a 2-1 aggregate win. Juan Pablo Sorin had
put River Plate ahead with a headed goal in the 22nd minute.

<P>
In the other semifinal, Barcelona eliminated Paraguay's Cerro
Porteno in a penalty shoot-out in Asuncion after two teams tied
2-2 on aggregate.

took Cerro into the penalty shootout, which Barcelona won
4-3.

The first match of the two-leg final is scheduled for August 16

BONN, JULY 23 (Xinhua) -- Leading German carmaker BMW said
Thursday its group profits increased by 17.5 percent to 511
million marks (284 million U.S. dollars) in the first half of the

</P>

The good result was achieved on a group turnover of 30.95
billion marks (17.19 billion dollars), up 6.3 percent from the

Earlier in the day, the Opposition National Party Tourism

Appelgryn said.

Lorna Burke, spokeswoman for the company's Johannesburg branch,
denied the statement. However, she said that Air France's Southern

hold a press conference next Wednesday regarding the company's
future operations to South Africa.
</P>

If the company was to cut back its local operations, it would be

<HEADLINE> HK Promises to Be Leader in Asia in DTTB, Says DVB Project Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong promises to be a
leader in Asia in Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting
(DTTB) which is the digital TV for terrestrial environment, said
Peter Macavock, manager of Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB)
project, here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Senior executives from the DVB project, a consortium of over
230 broadcasters, manufacturers, network operators and regulatory
bodies in more than 30 countries worldwide, gathered here to
introduce to local broadcasters the DVB terrestrial system, DVB-T,
for use in broadcasting High Definition TV (HDTV) -- the next
generation of TV.
</P>
<P>
Macavock said that the DVB-T uses sophisticated COFDM (Coded
Orthogonal Frequency Divisional Multiplexing) modulation to enable
HDTV to be received on a set-top antenna. The rugged signals which
make this possible mean that services can now be targeted even to
mobile receivers.
</P>
<P>
"Super high quality pictures will truly bring the cinema to the
home. On top of this, a whole host of interactive applications
mean digital TV will be something you do as well as watch," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are three alternatives for DTTB systems in
Europe, the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Senior executives from the DVB project expressed the belief
that the DVB-T will also probably be applied in the Chinese
mainland, especially in Beijing and Shanghai because the market
there is huge.
</P>
<P>
A seminar on Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting will
be held here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Organized by Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB), Asia
Television Limited (ATV) and the Radio Association of Hong Kong
(RAHK), the seminar will also feature a live DVB-T High Definition
TV demonstration, the first of its kind in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Strike Called Off with Major Issues Unsettled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Korean Confederation of Trade
Unions (KCTU) Thursday canceled a planned general strike set for
the day after the South Korean government agreed to accept eight
of the KCTU's 10 demands Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to temporarily postpone the strike scheduled for
today and to negotiate further with the government," Lee Kap-yong,
head of the KCTU told a press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee warned that the confederation would push ahead
with a general strike if the government failed to solve the two
unresolved questions.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came as the government agreed to accept eight
of the 10 demands, including pledging a parliamentary hearing on
the causes of the nation's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
But government and labor negotiators failed to reach a
compromise on two fundamental issues -- Hyundai Motor Co.'s mass
layoff plan and the state enterprises' restructuring.
</P>
<P>
During the 12-hour talks which began Wednesday night, labor
representatives demanded that the government prevent Hyundai from
laying off 2,678 workers, and that the state enterprises'
restructuring be discussed after a law on a tripartite committee
of labor, management and government is enacted.
</P>
<P>
Government delegates, however, insisted that the Hyundai issue
should be resolved peacefully between labor and management, and
the restructuring of state enterprises should be discussed at the
tripartite committee.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite committee was established in February to discuss
ways of evenly sharing the painful aftermath of economic
restructuring among workers, management and the government.
</P>
<P>
Tens-of-thousands of KCTU members initially planned to stage an
indefinite general strike starting from Thursday to protest the
rising layoffs.
</P>
<P>
As the strike was canceled, thousands of KCTU members,
including about 1,300 workers of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway
Corp., returned to work Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The planned strike would have been the second wave of strikes
this month by local workers who are opposed to the increasing
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Since the economic crisis started last November, the nation's
jobless rate has nearly tripled, with the jobless number hitting
1.529 million last Month.

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns Murder of U.N. Workers in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday condemned the
murder of four members of the United Nations mission in Tajikistan
as "a provocative act of terror."
</P>
<P>
"The incident shows that there are forces in Tajikistan who are
not interested in the progress of the peace process, and who are
capable of lifting up their hands against representatives of the
most distinguished international organization," Foreign Ministry
spokesman Valery Nesterushkin told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The four victims were Otaka Akino of Japan, Ryszard Szevczek of
Poland, Adolfo Siarpegu of Uruguay, and a Tajik national who
worked as a driver and interpreter.
</P>
<P>
The workers were killed Monday on their way from the district
of Tavildara to the town of Labidzhar, 270 kilometers east of the
Tajik capital of Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
Jan Kubis, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's envoy to
Tajikistan, has recalled all staff members to the capital from the
regions.
</P>
<P>
Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov, enraged by the murder,
Wednesday sacked two first deputy defense ministers for their
failure to protect the U.N. workers.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Abdurakhmon and Defense Minister Sherali
Khairulloyev were also reprimanded.

<P>
CAIRO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syrian Agriculture Ministry sources estimated the
total wheat harvest for the current season at approximately 4
million tonnes, an increase of 600,000 tons compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
Economic sources in Damascus said the government paid some 6
billion Syrian liras (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) as a result of
exporting about 500,000 tons of wheat. The deficit resulted from
export the wheat reached 6.19 billion liras in 1997, the Al Hayat
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Syrian government pays to the farmers prices higher than world
wheat prices, the report added.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- Algeria began Wednesday the privatization of 11
brick factories, 10 hotels across the country and 12 plants for
soft drinks, the Al Hayat reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new privatization step was taken within the framework of an
overall plan to privatize 1000 public companies and sell their
shares to the workers before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt had a bigger share in the volume of oil and
natural gas discoveries among the Arab states over the past year,
the Egyptian daily Alam Al Yom reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's share accounted for 63 percent of Arab petroleum
discoveries, or 35 among the total number, and 77 percent of
natural gas discoveries, or 20 among the total number.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC),

Meanwhile imports until the end of May rose to 3.39 billion
dollars from 3.38 billion dollars in 1997, an estimated increase

<HEADLINE> Uganda Airlines Sale Hits Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The planned sale of Uganda
Airlines, expected to be completed by September, has hit a snag
after it lost its lucrative routes to rival carriers recently.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's New Vision daily quoted Privatization Unit sources
as saying Wednesday that the lack of designated routes, a major
determinant of an airlines' value, has drastically slowed down
the divestiture pace of the 20-year-old parastatal.
</P>
<P>
The profit-making routes allocated to Alliance Air and other
carriers include: Entebbe-London, Kigali, Dubai, Nairobi,
Dar-es-Salaam, Lusaka and Harare, among others.
</P>
<P>
Leonard Muganwa, the Executive Director of the Enterprise
Development Project confirmed the situation of the airline,
saying: "It is true we have faced a major hindrance in selling
Uganda Airlines because of its designated routes which were given
away to other companies."
</P>
<P>
Four international airlines were pre-qualified to purchase
Uganda Airlines. They are British Airways, Sabena Airlines, Kenya
Airways and Air Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the employees of the airline protested the inclusion
of Alliance Air as one of the bidders for the national
flag-carrier. They also demanded their terminal benefits before
the airline is sold out.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Allows Mt. Kumgang Project Despite Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korea plans to allow the
Hyundai Group to go ahead with its Mountain Kumgang tourism
project in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),
despite escalated tension in inter-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to prevent Hyundai officials from visiting
the North to discuss details of the project," Hwang Ha-soo,
director for intra-Korean exchanges and cooperation of the
Unification Ministry, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai signed a landmark agreement with the DPRK to develop
the Mountain Kumgang tourism project when its head, Chung Ju-yung
visited the the DPRK last June.
</P>
<P>
On returning from the DPRK, Chung announced that Hyundai would
operate cruise boats between the ports of the South and the North
on the east coast of the East Sea, from September.
</P>
<P>
However, the ambitious project hit a snag when a DPRK submarine
was caught by the South Korean military on June 22 after it was
spotted entangled in a fishing net in South Korean waters. Twenty
days later, the body of an armed agent was found washed ashore on
South Korea's eastern coast.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the South Korean government decided to hold back the
Mountain Kumgang project and other inter-Korean economic
cooperation programs until the DPRK apologized for the two
incidents and promised not to repeat them.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang refused to meet Seoul's demands, accusing it of
fabricating the armed agent incident.
</P>
<P>
The two incidents escalated tension in the Korean peninsula,
whose two sides have been technically at war since the Korean War
of 1950-53.
</P>
<P>
Seoul's plan to give the go-ahead to Hyundai is seen as the
continuation of President Kim Dae-jung's "Sunshine Policy,"
although Kim recently vowed to take stern and resolute actions
against military provocations from the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai said it is planning to send a group of technicians to
the DPRK next Tuesday to discuss details of the project with the
DPRK, including the construction of a wharf for cruise boats
carrying South Korean tourists to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry of Unification made the decision in favor of the
Hyundai officials' visit based on a judgment that preparations for
the project can be pursued before the North apologizes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hwang disclosed that Hyundai received a letter guaranteeing
South Korean tourists' safety from the DPRK Ministry of Public
Security early this month.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will set up a joint arbitration committee
consisting of officials from Hyundai and the DPRK's Asia-Pacific
Peace Committee, which signed the contract of the Mt. Kumgang
project.
</P>
<P>
The commission will settle possible disputes involving South
Korean tourists in the DPRK, the director said.

BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Public
Security recently issued a notice demanding that individuals turn
in banned rat poisons to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The campaign against banned potent, fast-acting rat poisons
aims at minimizing both intentional and accidental poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Recently in some areas of China, according to the notice,
people have been poisoned by the banned substances and there has
been a series murders related to the poisons.
</P>

poison market has resulted in the easy accessibility of these
fatal poison which have wound up killing people, cattle, poultry
and rat predators.
</P>
<P>
The notice calls on public security organs and related
government departments at all levels to collect banned rat poisons
and equipment and the raw materials for their production.
</P>
<P>
Individuals should be encouraged to voluntarily turn in the
poisons, and collection should be forced upon those who do not,
the notice says.
</P>
<P>
Public security bureaus should punish, in accordance with the
law, those who are involved in the illegal production and sale of
the poisons, and those whose sloppy management was taken advantage
of by murderers.
</P>
<P>
The notice also demands that the purchase of deadly rat poisons
only be allowed at designated stores with approval by public
security organs.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Jobless Rate Hits Record 1.5 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korea unemployment skyrocketed
to 1.5 million last month, a record high since March 1978, the
National Statistical Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate in June soared to seven percent from 4.5
percent in January, an addition of more than 300,000 to the ranks
of the unemployed over the past five months, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The number of employees fell 5.6 percent to 20.18 million last
month from May's 20.22 million, maintaining a downward trend over
the five months amid economic reform in the crisis-hit nation.
</P>
<P>
Among the hardest hit are the construction and manufacturing
sectors, which witnessed a drop of 22.9 percent and 15.1 percent
respectively in employment.
</P>
<P>
The average unemployment rate in the first half of this year
stood at 6.3 percent, in the wake of the financial crisis
triggered by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial
institutions late last year.
</P>
<P>
The actual jobless figure is estimated at 2.1 million with the
inclusion of 460,000 who work less than 18 hours a week, and
another 182,000 on temporary leave from their work, said the
office.
</P>
<P>
About 1.43 million jobless, 93.3 percent of the total, held a
less-than-one-year working position, while about 418,000 were laid
off due to enterprise restructuring which includes early
retirement, dismissals and business closures.

<HEADLINE> Writers Association Admits New Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- An additional 329 people have been
approved this year as members of the China Writers Association
(CWA), meaning that they were officially given the title of writer.
</P>
<P>
The CWA, the largest non-governmental organization for
literary people in China, now has 5,800 members, according to
CWA sources.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Chinese enjoy writing novels, short stories and
poems, and one of their goals is to become a member of the CWA and
be called a writer for life. Otherwise, they are only viewed as
amateurs.
</P>
<P>
Joining the CWA also means closer ties with senior officials,
as the association is now guided by the Publicity Department of
the Communist Party of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Many members are paid by the CWA, regardless of the quality of
their work. Disputes have thus flared in recent years with many
critics suggesting the smashing of such an "iron bowl," saying it
actually cultivates dignitaries rather than writers, and causes
writers to become lazy.
</P>
<P>
China churns out some 500 novels every year -- and most of them
are produced by CWA members. Critics say only about 10 of them are
worth reading.
</P>
<P>
Some local writers associations, including the one in Beijing, has
stopped recruiting lifetime members and developed a contract
system to inspire writers' creativity. Agreements signed between
writers and the CWA specify that the writers have no
permanent position in the association and must complete a number
of worthwhile books within a certain time span.
</P>
<P>
Critics say that this will cause some changes in literary
circles, though the trend will be slow, especially in some
established and large organizations such as the CWA.
</P>
<P>
This year, some 750 people have submitted applications to join
the CWA, 400 of them are under the age of 50. Most have a
university education background.
</P>
<P>
There are about 20,000 people in lower-level writers
associations in cities and provinces hoping to become members of
the prestigious CWA.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Boss Urges Government Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The boss of Daewoo, one of South
Korea's top five conglomerates, or chaebols, has urged the
government to intervene in businesses exchanges among
conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
"In economic and financial crises, the government needs to
intervene in business swaps among conglomerates," said Kim
Woo-choog in a lecture Thursday to the nation's lawmakers of the
ruling National Congress for New Politics.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top five business groups -- Hyundai, Daewoo,
Samsung, LG and Sungkyong -- are engaging in business swaps among
themselves as part of their corporate restructuring in the face of
a battered economy.
</P>
<P>
The economic turmoil has raged through South Korea, once an
economic powerhouse in the world, since late last year, leading to
a standstill in the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the government demanded core-business
concentration and business exchanges by the conglomerates in a
cost-saving effort to tide over the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
But Kim, who is also the chairman of Federation of Korean
Industries, a special interest group representing large
conglomerates of the country, hoped the government would do more
in the reform of conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
Business swaps can be left to market forces only when the
nation's economy remains stable, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In advanced nations, governments often intervene. If it
insists on market principles when the market itself fails to
function properly, the government is virtually showing that it has
no confidence in itself."
</P>
<P>
The government should help corporations reform, otherwise, they
would not survive the economic crisis, said the Daewoo boss.

NEW DELHI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- India has appointed two lobbying
firms in the United States to help improve trade and technology
transfer between the two countries, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
PTI quoted Minister of State for External Affairs Vasundhare

<P>
KUNMING, China, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Bodies of 17 missing
climbers from a Sino-Japan joint expedition seven years ago have
been found in Mount Meili of Southwest China's Yunnan Province,
the Chinese Mountaineering Association (CMA) announced on Thursday
.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were discovered by local villagers last Saturday at
the 4,000-meter height of Mt. Meili, which sited in Deqing County
of Yunnan, CMA told a new conference. CMA didn't reveal the
specific numbers of the found bodies.
</P>
<P>
Specialists later recognized them as the Sino-Japan expedition
members dying from an accident on January 3, 1991.
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, a group of 17 climbers, including 11 Japanese
and six Chinese, made an attempt at the virgin Meili but never
came back after heavy snowfalls in the Mountain.
</P>
<P>
The climbers went missing at the 5,100m No.3 Camp and the
rescue team failed to reach the site due to nasty circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The 6740-meter Mt. Meili has yet to be conquered by any
mountaineering expedition. The Sino-China joint team tried three
times in 1989, 1991 and 1996, but without avail.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The year's second flood-peak
passed Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, today, but consistent
rainfall in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has created a
third flood peak, according to flood-control headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Some Yangtze River areas experienced early flooding this year,
and concentrated rainfall since June 10 has caused the water
levels of many of the Yangtze's tributaries to rise, bringing
floods to many places.
</P>
<P>
By July 2, water levels along the trunk section of the Yangtze
River between Yichang city in central Hubei province and Nanjing
of east China's Jiangsu Province had risen above the warning line.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three weeks, some 800,000 people in central
China's Hubei and Hunan provinces, and east China's Anhui, Jiangxi
and Jiangsu provinces have been manning the dikes, maintaining a
round-the-clock patrol and making timely repairs at more than
1,800 endangered spots, according to flood-control headquarters.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Environment-Friendly Detergents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission Thursday
recommended that more environment-friendly household laundry
detergents be produced in order to reduce the negative effects of
detergents on the environment.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of European detergent producers will be
affected because the recommendation was made based on a proposal
by the detergent industry association (AISE -- Association
International de la Savonnerie, de la Detergence et des Produits
d'Entretien).
</P>
<P>
But the recommendation is a voluntary measure as it is based on
a code of conduct proposed by the industry.
</P>
<P>
The commission recommends that the total amount of energy used
per wash cycle should be reduced by five percent by 2002; the
consumption per-capita of household laundry detergents and
packaging of these products should be reduced by 10 percent, and
the content of poorly biodegradable organic ingredients for this
product group by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended that consumers should be informed on how to
use household laundry detergents in a way that saves resources as
well as improving water and environment quality.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, made an earlier recommendation in 1989 on the
labelling of household laundry detergents.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Thursday mounted a nationwide campaign against malnutrition and
hunger, which he said has affected millions of Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the launching rites, Estrada described the
crime of malnutrition and hunger as "worse than a massacre or a
heinous crime because it victimizes not just a few, but millions
of innocent men and women."
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics, Estrada said an estimated 17 million
Filipinos suffer from some form of malnutrition that can be
prevented.
</P>
<P>
To date, 2.4 million pregnant and lactating women suffer from
iron-deficiency which predisposes their unborn children to anemia
resulting in various forms of retardation and developmental delay.
</P>
<P>
Estrada pointed out that the campaign will combat malnutrition
through the cooperation of the private poor, non-government
organizations, civic groups, the religious and concerned citizens.
</P>
<P>
He urged the citizenry to adopt poor communities in both rural
and depressed areas and to initiate nutrition activities among the
poor.
</P>
<P>
Estrada again promised to give utmost attention to agricultural
development and food security during his six-year term.

KIEV, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Kiev and Washington signed a joint
statement and several documents on bilateral cooperation during
United States Vice President Al Gore's visit to Ukraine, which
ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides said in the statement that the strategic
partnership between Ukraine and the United States bore a positive
impact on European security and international relations.
</P>
<P>
Gore came to Ukraine to attend the second meeting of the
"Kuchma-Gore" committee, which was established in 1996 and aims to
strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the committee was held in Washington in
May last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the documents on bilateral cooperation, Ukraine and the
United States will work together in dealing with criminal cases,
developing trade in textiles and clothing, improving the safety of
Ukraine's civil nuclear facilities and establishing a laboratory
for research on radiation and ecology in the International
Chernobyl Center.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear power plant in Chernobyl exploded in April 1986,
resulting in serious radiation which caused many deaths and
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The high-level exchanges between the two countries are
fruitful, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and Gore told the
press after the meeting, which ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma hoped that the United States would expand investment in
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Gore expressed satisfaction with measures Ukraine had taken in
economic restructuring and promoting a stable recovery of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine was likely to obtain more loans from the International
Monetary Union and the World Bank if it continued the reform
process and maintained social unity, Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Russia-China Strategic Partnership Significant for Security and Stability: Russian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Maksimovich Primakov considers the further development of the
Russia-China strategic and cooperative partnership significant for
safeguarding world security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Primakov made his remark here this evening at a press
conference after meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The world is moving toward multi-polarization, he said, and in
the process the world must face many challenges, such as the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts,
organized crime and drug. Cooperation between Russia and China in
many fields thus far is vital for safeguarding regional and global
security and stability, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Primakov, China, now in the process of rapid
development, is one of the key poles in the contemporary
multi-polar world. "The enhancement of Russia-China strategic and
cooperative partnership has a very important position in Russia's
foreign policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister said he expects Jiang's scheduled
visit to Russia this fall to boost the comprehensive development
of bilateral ties. "The two heads of state then will have an
extensive exchange of views on bilateral, regional and
international issues at the summit," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-China relationship, characterized by equality and
mutual trust, is not an alliance and does not target any third
country, Primakov told the press.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Keep Israel in Dark Over Resumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Keeping the Israelis in the
dark, the Palestinians said Thursday they would give an answer
within 48 hours as to whether they will continue the direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) spokesman Nabil Abu
Rudeineh said in Gaza that PNA President Yasser Arafat would meet
with Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani on Friday
before the PNA gives a reply to Israel's call for continuing the
newly-resumed talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Thursday
urged the Palestinians to return to the talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said the only solution to break the deadlock in the peace
process was for the two sides to sit down and conclude the talks
in the shortest time.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky said during
the day that Israel has asked United States Middle East envoy
Dennis Ross to mediate between the two sides in person.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that "the whole process will be wrapped
up in two or three days" with Ross' help.
</P>
<P>
The first Israeli-Palestinian direct talks in months were
resumed Sunday between Mordechai and PNA's deputy head Mahmoud
Abbas. But the talks quickly hit a snag Wednesday after the second
round of lower level talks because of the huge gaps over the
U.S. plan for a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has already accepted the proposal since it was
introduced in January, but Israel has rejected it citing security
concerns. The Jewish state insists that any withdrawal exceeding 9
percent will endanger its security interests.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, the Palestinian negotiators refused any Israeli
attempt to change the U.S. proposal. The Israeli delegation
reportedly proposed that Israel withdraw from 10 percent of the
West Bank and turn the rest 3 percent into "nature reserves,"
where no construction will be permitted.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians stressed that the percentages in the American
pullback plan were "non-negotiable." They decided to halt the
talks Wednesday, charging that Israel did not bring about any new
idea except rejecting the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai on Wednesday appealed to the U.S. for help to
persuade the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table. But
Washington rejected the call, saying the two sides should work
harder to reach an agreement by themselves.
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports, however, over the Palestinians'
response to the Israeli call. Some reports said the Palestinians,
following the intervention of Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan, have
agreed to renew contacts on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Still, upon return to the Palestinian self-rule area Wednesday
after a one-day visit to Jordan, Abbas denied that the talks would
resume.
</P>
<P>
"We have not agreed on holding further meetings with Mordechai
after the Palestinian leadership decided to stop negotiations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Abbas and Mordechai were originally scheduled to hold more
talks on Tuesday and Wednesday, but they have not meet again after
Sunday's first meeting.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, China Expect Boom in Bilateral Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
called Thursday for more effective joint efforts to boost
Sino-Kenyan economic cooperation into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with a Chinese delegation led
by Sun Guangxiang, Vice-Minister for Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation and Li Yanling, Vice-Minister of
Finance.
</P>
<P>
"We want your country (China) to participate positively in
investment or in all areas of economic development (in Kenya),"
Moi said, adding that Kenya enjoys long-term and deep friendship
with China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope for new areas of cooperation to be explored
between the two sides and more Chinese to visit the east African
country for business and also for sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is a key gateway to east Africa and the Great Lakes
Region as its Indian Ocean port Mombasa, through a network of
roads and railways, serves Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, eastern
Democratic Republic of Congo, southern Sudan and so on, Moi
noted.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the two countries have been conducting effective and
smooth cooperation in various areas over recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will surely make further efforts to
expand the two-way trade and cooperation with Kenya which plays
an important role in promoting economic integrity and easing
tensions in the east African region, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sun signed a series of economic agreements with Kenyan Finance
Minister Simeon Nyachae, after his meeting with Moi.
</P>
<P>
Under the pacts, China will provide Kenya an interest-free
loan worth 262 million Shillings (some 4.4 million U.S. Dollars)
in the next five years starting from August 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will offer Kenya another two grants
worth 75 million and 42 million Shillings (1.27 million and 0.7
million Dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
The grants will be used to rehabilitate the Moi International
Sports Center located in Nairobi and to build a 12.5-kilometer
road in western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member Chinese economic and trade delegation arrived
here early Thursday morning for a three-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton signed into law Wednesday the most
significant overhaul of the Internal Revenue Service in decades,
ushering in what he called a new era of customer service and
enacting voter-friendly rules intended to curb the excess of
overzealous tax collectors.
</P>
<P>
-- The sweltering heat that has proved deadly elsewhere in the
country descended on the Washington area Wednesday. The heat wave
with temperatures nearing 37.8 degrees Celsius strained the
resources of local governments and created a health emergency as
thousands of residents spent most of the day without electricity.
</P>
<P>
-- A Senate panel blocked the nomination of Daryl Jones to be
Air Force secretary Wednesday as Republican members concluded that
lingering concerns about the Florida state senator's integrity and
judgement made him unsuited to lead a military service.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Two high-ranking Republican Senators said they might try to
hold up the nomination of Bill Richardson to be Energy Secretary
unless the Clinton Administration moved to establish a temporary
repository of nuclear waste from civilian reactors.
</P>
<P>
-- Scientists from Hawaii said Wednesday that they had made
dozens of adult mouse clones and even cloned some of those
clones. The announcement, coming after months of rumors, stunned
biologists when they heard the details. It means, they say, that
advances in cloning are coming faster than even the most confident
scientists had imagined.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton attacked Republican tax-cut plans as
"a return to irresponsibility." The president opposes using
surplus for that purpose until a plan to shore up Social Security
is in place. Aides say Clinton will pound away at the issue
heading into midterm elections, but House leaders, undaunted,
endorse a plan for 702 billion U.S. dollars in cuts and 698
billion dollars for the retirement program over 10 years. Senate
Republicans and Fed chief are less enthusiastic on cuts that big.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- The House Wednesday upheld President Clinton's decision to
renew normal trade relations with the China.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Province Opposes Taiwan Nuclear Waste Disposal Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Environmental officials in east
China's Fujian Province have expressed bitter opposition to a
Taiwan power company's plans to dispose of nuclear waste on an
off-shore island in the vicinity of Putian County in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Yang Mingyi, director of the Fujian Environmental Protection
Bureau, said that the people of Fujian Province have "voiced great
concern and exhibited strong indignation over the proposed plan".
</P>
<P>
Recent reports carried by Taiwan newspapers indicate the power
company is proceeding with the plan and is currently engaged in
site preparation on Wuqiu Island.
</P>
<P>
The disposal of nuclear waste presents wide-ranging problems
related to health and environmental protection. Yang stressed that
Wuqiu Island should not be used as a disposal site for unclear
material.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan authorities will encounter strong opposition from
people on both sides of the straits if they persist in plans to
use Wuqiu or any other small island in the region for the disposal
of nuclear waste," Yang said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Official Urges Nepal to Use Aid More Effectively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A visiting official from the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) has cautioned the Nepali government
that the bank will increasingly link levels of assistance to the
effective use of funds provided.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Thursday, Geert van der
Linden, ADB's director for programs (west), said that he had been
focusing on three general points in meetings with senior officials
of the Nepali government.
</P>
<P>
First of all, he stressed that resources must be used
effectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In times of scarce resources, donors will give priority to
countries which can use the funds most effectively and with the
highest development impact," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, experience in other countries has shown that better
governance leads to more rapid development, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that government institutions must be stronger and
clear and consistent policies are important. He said that success
of projects in Nepal is below the ADB average.
</P>
<P>
Ali Shah, resident representative of ADB in Nepal, complained
that only 30 percent of the projects are implemented in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, low level of economic growth in Nepal is also a
concern to ADB, Linden said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country's economic growth has slowed to less
than two percent per year, and poverty is on the increase.
</P>
<P>
He observed that without good policies on agriculture, energy,
education and health, it will be a major challenge for Nepal to
achieve the target of 6 percent growth rate as envisaged in the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002) document published recently by
the government.
</P>
<P>
Linden is on a four-day visit to Nepal to discuss with the
government issues affecting ADB's operations here. He is scheduled
to meet Nepali Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala Friday, the
last day of his visit.
</P>
<P>
He told the press conference that ADB has started a major
review of its work in Nepal, which will evaluate the impact of its
projects so far and lessons learned.
</P>
<P>
"A strategy will then be formulated, identifying areas where
bank operations will have the highest development impact and where
resources are used more efficiently," he said.
</P>
<P>
ADB began operating in Nepal in December 1966 and its
cumulative lending to the country has reached 1.6 billion U.S.
dollars covering 92 projects, of which agriculture and energy
account for over 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it has provided to Nepal technical assistance valued
at 82 million dollars for 203 projects, the bank said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
ADB is currently financing 24 projects in the Himalayan
kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Euro-zone Prepares to Fight Counterfeiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The 11-country euro-zone is
bolstering preparations against potential counterfeiting of the
single currency due out in three years' time.
</P>
<P>
A senior European Commission official said on Thursday it had
become important that public confidence in the euro was to be
fully maintained by the time it was launched on January 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
Claus Sorensen, an official in the cabinet of the European
Commissioner for Anti-Fraud, Anita Gradin, told the press on
Thursday that the commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and
Europol are cooperating to work out a legal framework. This had to
be in place at least 12 months before the official introduction of
the euro on a trial run.
</P>
<P>
The financial, law enforcement and technical cooperation will
focus on personnel training, establishing a database and
agreements on cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sorensen said the database had to have a common format and
accessibility, as well as the obligation to report to it.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, pledged to work closely with the ECB, Europol and relevant
national authorities to strive for a European-wide framework.
</P>
<P>
Problems are expected to arise from different regulatory
systems in European Union member states.
</P>
<P>
Some member states punish those convicted of counterfeiting
with two years in jail while others permit severe punishment of 15
years jail.
</P>
<P>
The official said the moment when the euro is officially
launched will be a great temptation for counterfeiting. Both
euro-zone countries and countries outside the single currency zone
have to get ready to fight it.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader Optimistic Over Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada Thursday
expressed optimism that the dispute between the management of
Philippine Airlines (PAL) and its striking ground crew union will
soon be resolved.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like they have softened their stand," Estrada said,
confident that eventually, the two sides will be able to meet half
way and put an end to the labor problems of the national flag
carrier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma Thursday
expressed the hope that the dispute between the PAL management and
striking employees would be settled amicably with the parties
coming to terms voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
The airline resumed its normal flight operations Thursday
morning as about 85 percent of the ground crew returned to work in
defiance of calls from the Philippine Airlines Employees
Association (PALEA).
</P>
<P>
The PALEA called an indefinite strike early Wednesday morning
protesting the layoff of some 5,000 employees under a downsizing
program the debt-ridden airline began to implement last month.
</P>
<P>
The PALEA's strike is the second hitting the ailing airline
this year which was forced to massively downsize its operations
after its 625 pilots staged a 22-day crippling strike on June 5.
</P>
<P>
Estrada Wednesday night met with labor leaders of PAL in the
hope of ending the PALEA's strike to save the national flag
carrier from closing down.
</P>
<P>
The union has been asserting that the retrenched workers should
be called back to work while the management has been insisting
that it does not have the financial capacity to employ so many
workers at a time when it has already streamlined its operations.

<HEADLINE> UN Commission Calls for Sustainable African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Economic Commission
for Africa (ECA) Thursday stressed that Africa should try to
embark onto a way of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
African countries and their development partners are facing a
challenge of "how to move many of the African economies onto a
path of long-term sustainable development and improving living
standards for the majority of the african people," Lalla Ben
Barka, ECA Deputy Executive Secretary said.
</P>
<P>
In her opening statement at the first meeting of the working
party of African Board of Governors of the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank here, Ben Barka said, "Africa is emerging
as the final frontier of global investment. This continent with
an abundance of natural and human resources can develop and yet
Africa remains the most underdeveloped region of the world."
</P>
<P>
Referring to Africa's positive developments recent years, Ben
Barka pointed out that economic landscape of the continent has
changed significantly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Improved policies have continued to fuel Africa's recovery,
strengthening the momentum of reform and resolve of African
countries and donors to work together, and sub-Saharan Africa's
economic recovery has both accelerated and spread to more
countries, She said.
</P>
<P>
"In more than thirty-five countries, political systems are
opening up, reforms to free up the energies of the private sector
are underway, and public debate on the future of economic and
social reform is becoming more open," she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted: "In many African countries, exchange rates have
been liberalized, many restrictions on imports and foreign
investment have been removed, tariffs have been reduced, and
price controls on agricultural and manufactured goods have been
dismantled."
</P>
<P>
Despite these positive developments, she said, economic and
political reforms in many of these countries remain fragile.
</P>
<P>
"Poor income growth, as well as environmental and population
pressures keep almost half of Africa's 590 million people in
poverty, living on less than one Dollar a day," the ECA official
said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Minister of Finance Sufian Ahmed said that three top
priority issues will be discussed at the meeting, i.e. firstly
African countries have already suffered balance of payments and
other adverse macroeconomic effects from the east Asian crisis;
secondly there has been a growing interaction between the World
Bank,IMF and African countries; thirdly African governors
are looking forward to substantial support from the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting will prepare and finalize documents with
African countries present to the annual meetings of the World
Bank and IMF in October, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Deny Hiring Foreign Mercenaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) Thursday belied earlier reports that some
300 Indonesian mercenaries were hired to help the group train new
recruits.
</P>
<P>
The MILF said there are Indonesians visiting its camps in the
southern Philippine island of Mindanao, but they are missionaries
preaching Islam.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a national broadcaster quoted an intelligence report
that some 300 members of Indonesian Islamic Liberation Army (ILLA)
were employed by the MILF to introduce to them modern techniques
of guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
"There are Indonesians coming to visit our camps, but they are
not members of any organization. I do not even know of such ILLA,"
said Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs.
</P>
<P>
Though admitting that they have been training new recruits,
Murad claimed that there is no need for them to hire foreign
instructors "as we already have plenty of well-trained
combatants."
</P>
<P>
"In fact our local Mujahideens (freedom fighters) are even
better than foreigners," Murad boasted of the MILF's capability to
topple down enemies.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader appealed to military authorities to stop
suspecting all foreigners visiting their camps as they have no bad
intention other than to preach Islam to Muslim communities in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The military ordered early this week to secure Mindanao from
the entry of foreign mercenaries and smuggled arms.

<HEADLINE> Bodies Discovered at Glacier in Yunnan May Be Mountaineers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in northwestern Yunnan
Province last weekend discovered bodies on a snow-covered mountain
which are believed to be the remains of the mountaineers missing
in a Sino-Japanese joint expedition in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were found on a glacier on Mt Meili 4,000 meters
above sea level in Deqin County. The China Mountaineering
Association and the Yunnan Provincial Sports Commission have
instructed that the bodies remain at the site intact for further
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, 17 members of the mountaineering team died at the
No.3 camp ground 5,100 meters above sea level on January 3,
1991. At that time, bad weather prevented rescue workers and a
Sino-Japanese task force from recovering the bodies.
</P>
<P>
This latest discovery is expected to provide clues to the
causes of death of the mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
With an elevation of 6,740 meters, the Meili is a
snow-covered mountain which has never been conquered by mountain
climbers. The Chinese and Japanese launched three expeditions in
1989, 1991 and 1996, but they failed to reach the peak each
time.

<HEADLINE> Maskhadov Blames "Special Services" for Attempt on His Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- President Aslan Maskhadov of
Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya said Thursday that
"special services" were behind the attempt on his life earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference in Grozny: "This may have been a
joint work by several special services, who carried this out with
local allies craving for power and money," the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A parked car exploded when the presidential motorcade was
driving by. Maskhadov's car caught fire and was hit by a lot of
shrapnel, but he survived because his car was armored.
</P>
<P>
One of his bodyguards was killed and four others wounded.
</P>
<P>
After the attempted assassination, Maskhadov was visited by
almost all his allies and generals of the Chechen armed forces,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Russian President Boris Yeltsin also visited
him.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been running high recently in Chechnya, where
Maskhadov declared a state of emergency one month ago in an
attempt to curb rampant crime and violence by various forces in
the breakaway Russian republic.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Launches Fisheries Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Fisheries Week 1998 began Thursday
throughout Bangladesh with a view to integrating all sections of
the people towards this vital sector.
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin Ahmed and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
issued separate messages on the eve of the week.
</P>
<P>
In his message, the president called for effective utilization
of the vast scope of fish and shrimp cultivation in meeting the
demand of protein of the country's population and earning foreign
exchange through export.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister in her message called for turning the fish
cultivation and preservation into a social movement by encouraging
people's participation to face the challenges in the 21st century
of creating jobs and alleviating poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Fisheries Week, an annual promotional and program-based
event, is organized by the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock as
well as other concerned bodies to create awareness among the
people to increase fish production, expand pisciculture program
and preserve fish resources.
</P>
<P>
Some high-ranking officials are scheduled to release fish fries
in Dhaka and other places during the week.
</P>
<P>
Seminars, rallies and other activities related to pisciculture
are to be held in the capital city and different places of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the country's radio and TV stations will make special
programs in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries sector contributes 4.7 percent to the GDP (gross
domestic product) and 8 percent to the total annual export income
of the country, and nearly 200,000 people are directly involved in
the sector while 12 million people are part-timers.
</P>
<P>
The government in its fifth five-year plan has allocated 5.86
billion taka (125 million U.S. dollars) for the sector, and the
total fish production has been targeted at 2.075 million tons for
2001-2002, against the 1.492 million tons produced during July
1997-June 1998 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President to Visit South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel Arap
Moi is to pay his first state visit to South Africa from August
13 to 15, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and his Kenyan
counterpart, Adhi Bonaya Godana, said Moi's visit would further
cement the already good relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A number of agreements in areas such as tourism and investment
protection would be signed during Moi's visit, Nzo and
Godana told a news briefing after talks in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said South African President Nelson Mandela and Moi would
discuss the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit, scheduled to be
held in Durban, South Africa, at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
He said he had briefed Godana on preparations for the NAM
summit.
</P>
<P>
Godana pointed out the the trade balance between South Africa
and Kenya had moved from a one-to-eight ratio in 1996 to a
one-to-17 ratio this year, both in favor of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
This was an issue which would have to be looked at, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both countries are the dominant economies in their respective
regions.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said Godana had briefed him on the Ethiopia-Eritrea
problem, and they had also discussed problems in the Comoros,
where one of the islands was threatening to break away from the
Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
Godana would have talks during his current visit with other
South African ministers, including Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan
and Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is currently South Africa's largest trading partner in
Africa outside the Southern African Development Community. South
African exports to Kenya reached 1.6 billion Rand (320 million
U.S. Dollars) in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Leaders to Go On Fund-Raising Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced Thursday that he and Special
Functions Minister Tun Daim Zainudin will travel overseas soon to
promote government bonds to raise funds for key infrastructure
projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that details of the fund-raising drive would be
announced later.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also finance minister, said at a press conference
here that during the tour, they (he and Tun Daim) would also
explain to the parties abroad the state of the Malaysian economy.
</P>
<P>
The government has planned to raise a total of 53 billion
ringgit (12.771 billion U.S. dollars at present rate) worth of
funds through bonds, of which 25 billion ringgit (6.024 billion
U.S. dollars) is for the asset management company which will buy
non-performing loans from financial institutions, 16 billion
ringgit (3.855 billion U.S. dollars) for the recapitalization of
local banks, 7 billion ringgit (1.686 billion U.S. dollars) for
the additional economic stimulus package and 5 billion ringgit
(1.204 billion U.S. dollars) for infrastructure package.
</P>
<P>
On the fund-raising effort by the government, Anwar said the
World Bank had committed 1 billion U.S. dollars to Malaysia, of
which 300 million U.S. dollars had been received and another 700
million U.S. dollars are expected to be disbursed by the end of
this year.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Franchises Prove Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's first franchised hotel --
"Jingjiang Star" -- has recorded great success after only a few
months in operation.
</P>
<P>
The first two franchise operations were built in Shanghai, a
metropolitan area with a glut expensive hotels but a shortage of
affordable accommodations for Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
The franchise operations offer air conditioning, television,
telephones and modern bathrooms. One hotel is located near the
Jingjiang Amusement Park and the other in the Pudong New Area. The
facilities offer room rates between 118 yuan (14.21 US dollars)
and 158 yuan, levels consider easily affordable for ordinary
Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Occupancy rates for the first six months hovered between 60-90
percent, with the demand for rooms on weekends and holidays far
outstripping demand.
</P>
<P>
The Jingjiang Hotel Management Group, China's largest hotel
management organization -- has decided to open up eight franchise
operations within the year, with hotels scheduled for Shanghai,
Suzhou and Ningbo. The group expects to build 20 franchise
operations by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> EDS-details added China Welcomes US House Vote on Normal Trade Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China today welcomed the vote by
the U.S. House of Representatives approving President Bill
Clinton's decision to maintain normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, pointed out that reciprocal arrangement is conducive
to the normal development of bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The change from Most Favored Nation (MFN) to Normal Trade
Relations (NTR) reflects mutually beneficial trade ties in a more
precise manner.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wenjing, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of
International Trade and Economic Cooperation, pointed to the vote
as a "pragmatic and wise" move.
</P>
<P>
However, the annual renewal practice on the U.S. side is
detrimental to the establishment of normal, long-term and stable
Sino-US economic and trade relations, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Robert Kapp, president of the US-China Business Council which
is supported by nearly 300 leading US firms, welcomed the vote and
expressed his belief that the annual renewal practice is
outmoded. He also expressed hope for greater efforts to develop
bilateral economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday vote followed heated debate and Clinton's
decision was endorsed by a vote of 264 to 166.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the vote, President Clinton signed a bill on reform of
the Internal Revenue Service which included a clause changing MFN
to NTR.
</P>
<P>
Clinton notified the Congress on June 3 that he had decided to
extend China's MFN trading status for another year.
</P>
<P>
The MFN system, which provided favorable tariffs between the
trade partners, has been put to a vote in the US Congress on an
annual basis since 1980. Nonetheless, past debate have
consistently failed to revoke China's MFN status. The Wednesday
vote clearly indicated that a number of congressmen altered former
positions to back Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Beijing analysts note that permanent NTR status for China
remains a key for ensuring the continuous and steady development
of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Various forms of interference should be properly handled to
ensure realization of Clinton's commitment in this regard,
according to the analysts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by Chinese Customs show that the Sino-US
trade volume for the first half of this year hit 24 billion US
dollars, up 13 percent on the 1997 period. The increase was
substantially higher than the average 5.2 percent monthly increase
in China's total foreign trade volume for the first six
months.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Improve Fish Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
extended the relief period granted to Sri Lanka by another seven
months to improve its hygienic conditions to export fish to the
EU, according to Fisheries Ministry sources here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This follows an application by the Sri Lankan government this
year for the extension. Accordingly the new relief period will end
in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The EU had given the relief period for the second time to
improve Sri Lankan harbors and post-harvest technology as they had
acknowledged the action that had already been taken to restructure
the fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the first period of relief given by the EU to
improve Sri Lanka's standard of fish export lapsed in July 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's exports of fish to the EU account for just 10
percent of the total exports. Last year it exported 7,590 tons to
EU.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Sri Lanka's fish exports earned Rs 4.4 billion (73.33
million U.S. dollars), an increase of 7.5 percent over the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Floods Force Closure of Three Gorges Lock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The sudden rise of the Yangtze
River water level caused by torrential rains in the upper reaches
of the river has once again forced authorities to close the
temporary lock at the Three Gorges Dam Project.
</P>
<P>
The closure represents the third time the lock has been closed
this year.
</P>
<P>
Heavy flooding has hit the dam project site in central China's
Hubei Province twice this month halting navigation on July
2-6 and July 10-21.
</P>
<P>
The lock resumed operations for a second time on July 22
allowing the passage of 1,098 vessels and 165,000 stranded
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The water level in the Three Gorges area started rising again
on Wednesday evening, with the flow rate hitting 45,000
cu.m/second at 13:00 (Beijing time) today.
</P>
<P>
The flow rate accelerated to 47,300 cu.m./second this afternoon
and authorities promptly closed the lock to ensure safety.
</P>
<P>
The local government also initiated immediate efforts to evacuate
the stranded passengers through upstream Maoping Port. Some 4,800
passengers have already been safely moved from the area.
</P>
<P>
The temporary lock operates at a maximum normal flow rate of
45,000 cu.m./second, with the diversion canal built to facilitate
dam construction operating at a minimum flow rate of 35,000
cu.m./second.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Vow to Find Oldest Human Stone Tools  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's archaeologists may
discover the oldest man-made stone tools in the country in a
couple of years, a leading paleoanthropologist said here today.
</P>
<P>
"A great number of anthropoid ape and human fossils, and the
paleolithic stone artifacts which have been unearthed in China,
makes it a real possibility that Chinese scientists may find human
origin in China," Zhang Senshui, research fellow at the Institute
of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He and his scientific group made an encouraging find recently
somewhere in the country, but he declined to reveal details at the
present time, claiming that the discoveries still need further
scientific analysis.
</P>
<P>
The existing oldest cultural-relics site of human beings in
China is located near Yuanmou County in southwestern China's
Yunnan Province, where archaeologists excavated human fossils
dating back 1.75 million years. However, Zhang said he believes
even older human fossils may be found in China.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the country organized a group of its most
authoritative archaeologists and paleoanthropologists to look for
human remains and stone artifacts which are olders than two
million years.
</P>
<P>
This endeavor, with current financial support of 750,000 yuan
(about 90,000 U.S. dollars) from the state, has been listed as a
national advanced scientific project, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"According to our research, human beings may have been in China
between two and four million years ago," said Zhang, who has
worked in the field for several decades.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Court Rejects National ID System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court
declared Thursday as unconstitutional the computerization
identification system espoused by the administration of former
president Fidel Ramos in 1996 as a means to fight crimes.
</P>
<P>
The court, in its decision, declared null and void the Ramos
administration's order requiring all Filipino citizens to secure
uniformed national identification card.
</P>
<P>
The court said the order, which is designed to weed out from
urban and rural communities suspected criminals and terrorists,
violates the constitutional right to privacy of every individual.
</P>
<P>
The court's ruling, which upheld the petition of Senator Blas
Ople to reject the order, also said that such order should first
be the subject of legislation by Congress before approval by the
president.
</P>
<P>
Ramos issued the order, without Congress' passage of any bill
similar to it, in early 1996, as a measure to curb a series of
terrorist activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
But the order, seen as a prelude to martial law to allow the
extension of Ramos' tenure, was not implemented due to strong
opposition from many quarters including Congress.
</P>
<P>
Ramos stepped down on June 30 this year after his
constitutionally-mandated single six-year term expired.

In addition, archaeologists have found many anthropoid ape
fossils dating from four to eight million years ago in Kaiyuan,
Lufeng and Yuanmou in Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
"The ape may have evolved into human beings rather than
disappeared. We must speed up the search to find the
 missing link in the human development," Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
The latest international discoveries show that Africa has the
most treasured cultural relics of the oldest human being. In the
1970s, archaeologists found 2.45 million-year-old stone artifacts
near Lake Turkana in Kenya. Most world authorities now acknowledge
that human beings most likely originated in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, 67-year-old Zhang said that the African stone
artifacts are not the oldest because of their comparatively
developed technique and diversity of styles.
</P>
<P>
"The history of man-made stone artifacts may go further back. I
prefer several human origins, including in China, rather than a
single origin in Africa." Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, Huang Wanbo, research fellow with the
same institute, and his team found stone artifacts about two
million years old in Wushan County of Chongqing
Municipality. Considered together with the human fossils found at
this exact site in 1985, experts regard Wushan as a flourishing
area of early human activity.
</P>
<P>
"We should seek fossils in even older geological layers," said
Zhang, citing their focus on the Yuanmou Basin, the Nihewan Basin
in northern China's Hebei Province and the Three Gorges region
along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"We also need concerted efforts nationwide to achieve our
goals," Zhang said.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia Thursday pledged
that it would not walk away from Malaysia but would remain engaged
in business activities here throughout the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
Thursday, "Australia is a friend of Malaysia not only during easy
time but in a long haul. I made it clear to the prime minister
(Mahathir Mohamad) that Australian businesses throughout the
economic crisis will remain engaged and will not just walk away
during this difficult time."
</P>
<P>
Australian businessmen know that Malaysia needed time to
recover and they too could benefit much from that recovery,
Downer, who arrived here Wednesday on a three-day visit, said
after meeting with Mahathir here.
</P>
<P>
"They (Australian businessmen) also realize that if they walk
away now from the Malaysian economy, they will find it very hard
to get back into the Malaysian market when the good time returns,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said that his discussions with Mahathir focused on the
forthcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting
to be held here in November and that he had suggested to Mahathir
that APEC members develop a system for them to address the Asian
economic crisis and assist each other in overcoming it.

<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will kick-start a project in October to connect
its power network with those of Arab and European countries, the

</P>
<P>
The project will first supply electricity to Amman, capital of
Jordan, and two months later to Syria's capital Damascus, then to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
It will also link with the power grid of the Arab Maghreb
countries, including Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, and then

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Slumps Below 62-U.S.-Cents Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar slumped in
late afternoon trade Thursday, feeling the aftershock of news
Japan's debt rating was on review for possible downgrade.
</P>
<P>
International rating agency Moody's Investors Service placed
Japan's AAA sovereign debt rating on review Thursday afternoon and
the Japanese yen spiraled up to 141.70 against the U.S. dollar,
pushing the Australian currency down through the 62.00 U.S. cents
level.
</P>
<P>
The local unit slid to 61.84 U.S. cents on the news and reached
lows of 61.75 in late afternoon trade.
</P>
<P>
It closed the session here at 61.93 U.S. cents from 62.37.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank senior manager of foreign exchange Kurt
Magnus said the Moody's news had lent a bearish tone to the
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
He said the Australian dollar would trade between 61.80 U.S.
cents and 62.30 until the result of Japan's race for the position
of prime minister was known.
</P>
<P>
Magnus said the foreign exchange market was looking for a
Japanese prime minister who would immediately promise fiscal
reform and responsibility. And it was only then will global
investors shy away from selling yen and the Australian dollar, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the federal government's backdown on the full
privatization of Telstra had also impeded gains despite a positive
reaction to wages data.
</P>
<P>
Average weekly ordinary time earnings for full time adults rose
0.4 percent in the May quarter, easing from the 1.4 percent growth
seen in the February quarter, and maintaining a year-to-May rate
of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The wages report showed annual wages growth remains moderate,
just below the Reserve Bank of Australia's unofficial wages
ceiling of around 4.0 to 5.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
While on the foreign exchange market, the Australian dollar
also closed at 87.75 yen from 87.81 and 1.1081 German marks from
1.1138.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Formulates Health Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
formulated a five-year national health policy aimed at providing
necessary and better health services to people of all walks of
life, the national news agency the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Health and Family Welfare Minister Salahuddin Yusuf, chairman
of the 26-member National Health Policy Formulation Committee
established in December 1996, handed the policy over to Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Health services should be ensured for building a healthy and
developed nation, Hasina said. "We want to reach the medical-care
facilities to the doorstep of the general masses," she said.
</P>
<P>
She asked the Health Ministry to take both preventive and
treatment measures to render services to the flood-affected people
through supply of essential drugs, including water purifying
tablets and anti-diarrhea medicines.
</P>
<P>
Millions of people have been hit by flood since the monsoon
season began in the country in early July, and contagious diseases
have been reported in some places.
</P>
<P>
Yusuf told the prime minister that his ministry has set up a
monitoring cell and medical teams are ready to carry out relief
and rescue work.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the health policy are to ensure easily
available health care system to all, particularly the rural and
poor urban population, to reduce malnutrition in children and
mothers, and to reduce mortality rate of both children and mothers
to an acceptable level in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The health policy also suggests formulating rules and
regulations for running medical colleges and private clinics and
calls for special health care facilities for the mentally-retarded
and physically-handicapped people.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Set Up Social-Ill Management System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is to set up a
system to manage social ills to ensure effectiveness of programs
tackling social problems, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed system, different from previous approaches which
only emphasized governmental roles in combating social problems,
would take into account the role and involvement of
non-governmental organizations, parents and individuals, he told
reporters after chairing a meeting of the Cabinet special
committee on social problems here.
</P>
<P>
The system will be part of the government's social action
masterplan and a secretariat under the National Unity and Social
Development Ministry which runs the programs has been tasked with
identifying the concept and mechanics of the proposed system,
Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed system would galvanize the efforts of
government departments and agencies into a machinery to implement
all programs meant to tackle social problems.
</P>
<P>
"It won't suffice if we just highlight the problems without
doing anything effective," he said. "We'll be concentrating on the
solutions at the grassroots level."
</P>
<P>
Anwar described the number of Malay youths involved in social
ills as still at a serious level compared with that of the other
communities (Chinese and Indian).
</P>
<P>
However, he said, percentage-wise, Indian youths were
increasingly involved in social problems.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said there was a connection between the current economic
slowdown and increasing social problems.
</P>
<P>
"Given that economic problems will have greater social impact
we have to take measures to check the situation from getting
worse," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also attributed social problems affecting youths to lack
of parental training, supervision and awareness.

housing cost and prices of miscellaneous items dipped by 0.1
percent; costs of transport and communication rose by 0.4 percent

<HEADLINE> China Committed to Protect Copyright: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China, a late comer in terms of
copyright legislation, has made a great leap forward in protecting
the rights of Chinese and foreign copyright owners in the past
several years, a Chinese official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Huapeng, director-general of Copyright Department of the
National Copyright Administration, made the remarks when
addressing the Asian Publishing Conference held in conjunction
with the annual Hong Kong Book Fair.
</P>
<P>
China formulated the Copyright Laws in September 1990, which
were put into effect on June 1, 1991. "After seven years of
implementation, the Copyright Laws have played an important role
in arousing copyright awareness of the public, increasing the
capability of the copyright owners in protecting their own rights
and intensifying the fight of law enforcement agencies against
piracy," the Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
Later in September 1992, China joined the World Copyright
Convention and the Berne Conventions for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works, "which facilitated the entry of works
of copyright owners abroad into the China market and opened up the
door for international and regional copyright trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
But China's Copyright Laws are far from perfect in many
aspects, Wang noted. A revised and supplemented edition is being
drafted and expected to be presented to the top legislature of
China, the National People's Congress, for discussion in late 1998
or early 1999.
</P>
<P>
Turning to law enforcement, Wang told the conference that over
the past decade or so, the inter-departmental fight against
illegal and pirated publications was carried out across China
annually, which greatly deterred the pirates and educated the
general public.
</P>
<P>
To achieve better results, an anti-piracy alliance is to be
formed within the year, uniting the large number of copyright
owners, organizations representing their interests and
law enforcement departments to deal a harder blow to the pirates.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland, Taiwan,
and the United States spoke at the one-day Asian Publishing
Conference.

ISLAMABAD, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad is leaving here for Colombo Thursday evening to
participate in the SAARC Standing Committee meeting which begins
its work on July 25.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary will be meeting his counterparts for
discussions on bilateral relations and matters relating to the
seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), whose 10th summit is to be held in Colombo, capital of
Sri Lanka, late this month.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary will in particular hold discussions with
his Indian counterpart to prepare the ground for the meeting
between the prime ministers of Pakistan and India on the sidelines
of the SAARC Summit, said a press release issued by the Foreign
Office Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign secretaries will focus on the mechanism for the
resumption of the bilateral dialogue which broke down in September
last year, it said.
</P>
<P>
The talks have to be put back on track especially in view of
the drastically transformed atmosphere on account of the
nuclearization of South Asia, it said, adding that the SAARC
summit in this scenario has assumed an extraordinary significance.

HONG KONG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) forces stationed in Hong Kong here Thursday held a
ceremony to mark the awarding of class two commendation to the
infantry brigade of the garrison by the Central Military
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commendation was issued by Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
who is also the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, late
last month for the good performance of the brigade in the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Senior officers of the Guangzhou Military Command and Commander
Liu Zhenwu of the Hong Kong garrison presented certificates of
merit and souvenirs to the brigade.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
extended his congratulations to the officers and soldiers of the
honor-winning brigade.
</P>
<P>
Tung spoke highly of the contribution of the PLA garrison in
the HKSAR to the maintenance of prosperity and stability of Hong
Kong and praised the garrison as a well-disciplined force.
</P>
<P>
The brigade was formed in 1993 and entered Hong Kong on June
30, 1997 to take over the defense of Hong Kong as China resumed
its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Exports Continue to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's exports have continued
to decline in U.S. Dollar terms despite the significant
depreciation of the local currency, the weekly Business reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from the Zimbabwe trade organization, Zimtrade,
show that total exports fell last year by 14 percent to 1.99
billion U.S. Dollars compared to 2.3 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This development has been largely attributed to poor commodity
prices on the international markets, a weak domestic capacity to
develop and maintain export markets, poor performance by the
clothing and textile industry and drought.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's key exports are tobacco, ferro-alloys, gold,
nickel, ginned cotton, sugar and molasses, cereals, textiles and
clothing, cork, wood and related products. There has been a
notable decline in export figures for tobacco and clothing and
textiles.
</P>
<P>
With the fall of the local currency failing to stimulate the
much needed growth in exports, industrialists and economists have
urged the government to reintroduce export incentives, restore
corporate foreign currency accounts and give preferential tax
rates for larger exporters as a matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
The government has indicated that it would soon reintroduce
export incentives for certain selected products. No timetable
has, however, been given yet but this is likely to be delayed
until at the next national budget in October.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's economic reform program is underpinned by an
export-led strategy that envisages an annual export growth rate
of 14 percent, but this has been failing to materialize with
exports continuing to decline, Business reported.

<HEADLINE> Thai Tourism Authority to Focus on New Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of Thailand
(TAT) has overhauled its market plan for 1998/99 to focus on new
target countries and new niche market segments, according to a
press release issued by TAT Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The refocusing of strategies is in line with changing market
conditions as well as changing lifestyle patterns.
</P>
<P>
The TAT's launch of Amazing Thailand 1998-99 campaign is
targeted to attract 7.72 million visitor arrivals in 1998 and 8.28
million in 1999, with estimated revenue of 272,362 million baht
(6,642 million U.S. dollars) and 309,672 million baht (7,548
million U.S. dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
These targets are viewed to be attainable as TAT is directing
its marketing strategy towards a wider diversity within the
industry.
</P>
<P>
The new marketing directives involve looking at traditional and
exclusive market segmentation, such as golfers, honeymooners, the
elderly and the youth backpackers, athletes, and cruise-lovers,
among others.
</P>
<P>
One relatively new area is to get film crews to do more
movie-shoots here, using Thailand as a backdrop. Efforts are also
being made to re-attract the once-buoyant Islamic market.
</P>
<P>
The search for new territories is also on. Countries on the
agenda are Eastern Europe, Israel, Vietnam, India, South Africa,
Middle East and South America.
</P>
<P>
The marketing method is turning more direct in its approach,
making greater use of the databases of travel agency chains,
frequent flyer programs, associations and special interest groups.

<HEADLINE> W. African 1st Ladies to Discuss Peace in Accra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- First Ladies in west Africa will
hold a two-day "peace mission" conference in Accra, capital of
Ghana next week, Ghanaian Foreign Minister James Victor Gbeho
said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, with a theme of "African Ladies Strive for
Peace", will be under the auspices of Nana Konadu Agueman
Rawlings, Ghana's First Lady and the First Vice-Chairperson of
the West African First Ladies, a report from Accra said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a follow-up to the one held in Abuja, capital
of Nigeria in 1997 to get women more involved in the resolution
of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Gbeho told reporters Tuesday that about 12 First Ladies in the
sub-region have confirmed their participation in the July 27-28
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the initiative of the First Ladies follows the
realization in international circles that although women and
children are the hardest hit during conflicts, they are the least
represented on peace missions.
</P>
<P>
"The search for solutions to conflicts in Africa have not been
totally successful. The future rests on our ability to pool
resources... to rid the continent of this phenomenon in order to
protect the lives of millions of innocent victims of conflict,"
Gbeho said.
</P>
<P>
"Such initiatives as those of the First Ladies... offer real
prospects that the scourge of conflict and pain may at last be
engaging our most serious attention," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference will decide whether the First Ladies
should form a separate mediation team on the resolution of
conflicts or join forces with peace delegations set up by such
organizations as the United Nations and the Organization of
African Unity.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Mozambique to Build Border Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has announced
that it will set up a high-tech border post linking Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
A daily newspaper The Star Thursday quoted Jackson Mthembu,
senior transport official of Mpumalanga Province bordering with
Mozambique, as saying that the first American-style one-stop
border post was due to open for business in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
The border post will operate 24-hours a day and will offer
travelers drive-through passport control similar to the booths
currently found at the toll gates.
</P>
<P>
Mthembu said the new facility, which costs 150 million Rand
(23.8 million U.S. Dollars), will be jointly manned by South
Africa and Mozambique. It would serve as a model for similar
projects on the former's borders with Zimbabwe and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
It might be named in honor of President Nelson Mandela's
marriage to Graca Machel, widow of the late Mozambican President
Samora Machel. The two married on July 18.
</P>
<P>
The new high-tech border post forms part of the 35 billion
Rand (5.5 billion U.S. Dollars) Maputo corridor highway, linking
industrial heartland of Gauteng Province, South Africa, with
Maputo's deep-water port of Maputo.
</P>
<P>
It will feature express lanes for passenger vehicles, with
computerized swipe-through passport control, as well as separate
lanes for travelers wanting VAT (valued added tax) refunds and
with goods to declare.
</P>
<P>
Pedestrians and passenger buses will also have their own
separate facilities.
</P>
<P>
Mthembu added that other unique features include an autonomous
freight-handling and inspection center and joint railway
facilities in an international neutral zone.

<HEADLINE> First Yellow River Flood Peak Flows into Bohai Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- This year's first flood peak on the
Yellow River flowed into the Bohai Bay on Wednesday at 14:30
(Beijing time) to end 11 days of surging waters in the river
valley.
</P>
<P>
The flow rate of the flood peak dropped dramatically from the
more than 6,000 cu.m./second recorded 10 days ago in the upper and
middle reaches of the river to the the current rate of 2,400
cu.m./second.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that the first flood peak resulted in limited
runoff, high water levels, and overflows. The dangerous situation
was compounded by heavy siltation in the river channel.
</P>
<P>
The experts warn the torrential rains will quite likely cause
another flood peak in the upper and middle reaches of the river.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A British satellite manufacturer
has begun negotiations with an Australian consortium to build a
scientific research satellite FedSat to be launched in late 2000.
</P>
<P>
The governing board of the Cooperative Research Center for
Satellite Systems (CRCSS), whose core participants are four
Australian universities and a leading national research body in
Australia, said it has authorized contract negotiations with Space
Innovations Limited of England, for the supply of a satellite
shell (or platform) for the FedSat mission.
</P>
<P>
The participants include the Commonwealth Scientific,
Industrial Research Organization, the University of Technology in
Sydney, University of South Australia, Queensland University of
Technology, and Auspace Limited of Canberra.
</P>
<P>
CRCSS Executive Director Brian Embleton said the satellite
project was announced by the Australian government in the 1996
budget.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will conduct engineering tests and scientific
experiments in atmospheric studies, communications, computing,
magnetic fields, navigation, solar power, and solar physics.
</P>
<P>
Space Innovations said it planned to use the project to gain a
foothold in the Asia Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Spaceport Starts in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a spaceport
for United States-based Kistler Aerospace began Thursday in
southern Australia.
</P>
<P>
At a ground-breaking ceremony to mark the beginning of
construction of the spaceport in Woomera, South Australian State,
Kistler Aerospace Chairman Robert Wang said the satellite
communications market was large enough to support the launch site
at Woomera and another to be built at Nevada of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The fast-growing Asian market was likely to use Woomera, and
U.S. and European companies will use Nevada, Wang was quoted by
the Australian Associated Press (AAP).
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard announced in April his
government had signed an agreement with Kistler Aerospace Corp to
launch satellites from Australia's rocket-launching town of
Woomera, a remote desert area of the size of Britain.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Kistler put 45 million U.S. dollars in the launch
facility at Woomera, which was established in 1947 as the launch
pad for British experimental rockets and was the center of
Australia's space industry in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Kistler expects to launch up to 100 of its re-usable vehicles,
used to send satellites into low-earth orbit, each year when it
goes into full operation.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the spaceport should be completed late this
year, with the first test flight to be held at the end of this
year or in early 1999 before the first commercial payload is
launched, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Australian federal Industry Minister John Moore and Defense
Minister Ian McLachlan welcomed Kistler's investment in
Australia, with McLachlan saying he anticipated the spaceport
would draw other aerospace companies to the region.

<HEADLINE> Bank of China Grants Loans for Power Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua ) - The Bank of China (BOC) plans to
grant loans totalling 2.45 billion yuan (296 million US dollars)
to two power projects in southern Guangdong Province as part of an
effort to support infrastructure projects and promote economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The loan agreement, inked today by the bank and the Guangdong
Electric Power Holding Company, calls for the former to provide
loans enabling the latter to construct two power plants, one each
in Shaoguan and Lianzhou.
</P>
<P>
The two plants will be completed in two years and will have
respective installed generating capacities 700,000 kilowatts and
250,000 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the BOC dramatically increased loans to
infrastructure projects between January-June 1998. The bank
increased Renminbi loans by 4.8 billion to 14.85 billion yuan, and
US dollar loans by 560 million to a total of 1.95 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The power industry received loans totalling 4.45 billion yuan
and 476 million US dollars during the period, bringing the total
amount to 9.44 billion yuan and 7.46 billion US dollars by the end
of June.
</P>
<P>
The BOC also signed a separate cooperative agreement with the
power group naming the latter as a priority client and agreeing to
provide comprehensive services, including loans, settlements and
consulting.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong Electric Power Holding Company ranks first in the
local power industry in terms of total installed generating
capacity and annual output. The company has a generating capacity
of 28.12 million kilowatts and annual output of 98.1 billion
kwh. The BOC has provided the company with loans totalling 250
million US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed higher on
Singapore Stock Market Thursday, propped up by late buying in bank
shares and selected blue chips by foreign institutions.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index (STII) gained 9.60
points to close at 1,062.26 points, nearly recovering to Tuesday's
level.
</P>
<P>
The total volume increased to 135.46 million shares, valued at
231.30 million Singapore dollars (about 135.94 million U.S.
dollars). There were 168 losers against 111 gainers, while 308
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Renong was the most active stock as it finished on a turnover
of 10.83 million units. It was followed by M Res that had 9.49
million counters done. Mid-Cont was next with 7.08 million shares
changing hands.
</P>
<P>

Singapore dollars to close at 24.00 Singapore dollars. Creative 50
shed 50 cents to end 19.80 Singapore dollars. KepFELS was down 26
cents to finish at 3.60 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said shares were mixed Thursday as the stock market
became lower at midday but edged up later in the day.
</P>
<P>
They said the renewed weakness in the Japanese yen and in U.S.
stocks overnight contributed to the early fall while expectations
of increasing rally in the finance sector spurred the late rise.
</P>
<P>
Some market players said expectation that Japanese Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi will take the post of Japanese prime
minister has led to selling of the yen as he has been viewed as
being cautious on reform.
</P>
<P>
They also said the late rise was fueled by a rumor that DBS
Bank and POSBank, two of Singapore's largest banks, are planning
to announce a merger Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Urges Pakistan to Sign CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott on Thursday reiterated Washington's call for
Pakistan's signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT),
saying the interest of entire world including Pakistan lies in
adherence to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
He was talking to reporters after wrapping up his three-day
talks with Pakistani officials mainly on nuclear non-proliferation
issues. The two sides made no specific progress during the talks
but agreed to continue the talks in August in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We believe along with virtually rest of the international
community that it is in every body's interest including the
interest of Pakistan to have universal adherence to CTBT," Talbott
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is a signatory to the 1996 global
accord outlawing nuclear tests and the Clinton administration is
working with Congress and the Senate for the ratification of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said the talks between U.S. and Pakistani officials
focused on "very very tough issues."
</P>
<P>
He said Islamabad has most vital security interests and
Washington too has several interests at stake in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official expressed his hope for a reconciliation
between Islamabad's vital security interests and Washington's
non-proliferation concerns.
</P>
<P>
"What we are talking about is reconciling with national
interests -- and since Pakistan and the United States are both
friends, and since the United States wants nothing but the best
for Pakistan, we feel that will be reciprocated from the Pakistani
side," he said.
</P>
<P>
"(Pakistani) Foreign Secretary (Shamshad Ahmad) and I are
dealing with some very very tough issues and we are going to the
very core," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For Pakistan it is the most vital national security interests
-- the U.S. has several interests at stake here as well -- We have
an interest in the strength and prosperity, security and stability
of a democratic Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
"We also have a vital national interest in the sustenance and
enhancement of the global non-proliferation regime -- these are
two interests and we are reconciling them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, talking to reporters after the talks, Shamshad said
that Pakistan will sign the CTBT only when the country's security
concerns are fully safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
"I would not do it under any coercion," he declared.

LANZHOU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Customs Office in Lanzhou in
charge of foreign trade of two northwestern provinces, Gansu and
Qinghai, is providing new preferential terms to help trade.

<P>
The office says it will do its best to expedite customs
procedures on imports and exports related to state key projects,
agro-technology, and ecological and environmental protection
projects.

exemption has not been received the goods can pass customs,
provided they arrived after January 1, 1998 and provided bank
guarantees or a bond is deposited.
</P>
<P>
The office is also trying to speed up approval of tariff
reduction and exemption procedures and to increase the regional

<HEADLINE> Philippines Willing to Change Anti-foreign Debt Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada on
Thursday expressed willingness to change his administration's
anti-foreign debt policy, saying the poor state of the economy
warrants that the government avail of fresh loans from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Estrada and other officials have previously stressed that the
government should limit its foreign borrowing, especially at a
time when the value of the local currency has depreciated against
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Estrada told reporters that he may change his mind if the loan
will uplift the living standard of the Filipino people, especially
in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was reacting to an offer from the World Bank of two new
loans totaling 190 million U.S. dollars to increase the
Philippines' agricultural production and reduce rural poverty.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he does not mind being accused of backtracking on
his earlier policy against availing of new foreign debts, "as long
as I can feed our people."
</P>
<P>
He said he will order his economic managers to work out the
terms of the loan since "right now, we are bankrupt."
</P>
<P>
Estrada reiterated his earlier sentiment that the 11 million
voters who elected him to his post during the May 11 polls are
expecting too much from him, but his hands are tied by the limited
funds under the disposition of the national government.
</P>
<P>
"People are expecting so much from me, if we don't have the
money, how can I move? So we will not be able to accomplish
anything without funding," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines presently has a total of 45 billion U.S.
dollars in foreign debt.

DALIAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The coastal city of Dalian on the
Bohai Sea in northeast China's Liaoning Province has been
collecting fees for the use of offshore ocean resources since
1997, according to Dong Yantao, deputy director of the Dalian
Oceanic Administration.
</P>

More than 1,300 work units have been granted licenses to use
40,000 hectares of sea area, Dong said.

The city has a regulation detailing annual per-hectare fees as
follows: no less than 3,000 yuan (375 U.S. dollars) for port
construction, 2,250 yuan for coastal tourism, 1,500 yuan for
building on the sea and 600 yuan for aquaculture.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Resumes Normal Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The strike-bound Philippine
Airlines (PAL), the country's flag carrier, continued its
unhampered operations on Thursday with 14 domestic and two
international flights dispatched as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
All flights as of 11:30 a.m. Thursday departed on schedule
despite the fact that its thousands of ground crew began an
indefinite strike Wednesday morning, the PAL management said.
</P>
<P>
PAL expects no major delays in the remaining seven domestic and
five international departures out of Manila for the rest of the
day.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, PAL was able to mount all 19 domestic and
international flights, including those bound for Los Angeles and
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Full manpower complement as well as mobilization of contingency
measures enabled the airline to maintain normal operations at the
Manila and provincial airports and stations.
</P>
<P>
At 3:00 a.m. Wednesday, some 8,000 members of the Philippine
Airlines Employees Association (PALEA) went on strike following a
breakdown of talks with the management to reinstate 5,000
retrenched workers.
</P>
<P>
The union said 88 percent of its members had observed the
stoppage, which followed a 22-day strike by 625 PAL pilots last
month.
</P>
<P>
The crippling pilots' strike almost paralyzed the PAL's flight
operations and plunged the already financially-troubled company
into a deeper financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The loss-making and debt-ridden airline was forced to massively
downsize its operations last month to survive the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the downsizing program, the company laid off 5,000
workers or more than one-third of its 13,500 employees, suspended
many international and domestic routes, and planned to dispose 40
of its 54 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The PAL, which is already under the receivership of the
Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission, said that the
ground crew's strike "has put in jeopardy any proposed
rehabilitation plan for the airline, and with it, our last hope
for survival as well."
</P>
<P>
Airline officials said the strike might prompt regulators like
the Securities and Exchange Commission to take drastic action,
including closing the airline.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada has appealed to PAL's management and
striking employees to be open to an amicable settlement since the
continued labor unrest is harmful to the economy and offered to
mediate a lasting solution to the problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. men's 4x400-meter relay

squad cracked the world record and Jackie Joyner-Kersee bid her

farewell to heptathlon with a sweet triumph at the Goodwill Games

here today.
</P>
<P>
It was a big day for Michael Johnson and his American one-lap

runners again when the quartet shattered the world record with a

fabulous time of two minutes 54.20 seconds, knocking off the old

mark by 0.09 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. squad included Jerome Young, Antonio Pettigrew, Tyree

Washington and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who ran the year's fastest time in the world

yesterday, went on to show his sizzling form in the

final leg, blazing down on the track in commanding style. The

Olympic double champion eased up in his final strides, but the

time was still well inside the old world record.
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee, 36, two-time Olympic heptathlon winner,

competed in her farewell multi-event with heart and determination.

The first lady in track and field, who will retire this Saturday,

scored a total of 6,502 points to win the seven-event gold.
</P>
<P>
Javier Sotomayor of Cuba, world record holder and reigning

world champion, edged American Olympic champion Charles Austin to

win the men's high jump at 2.33 meters.
</P>
<P>
Austin, who also cleared the height in his first try, had to

settle for the second position due to height difference.
</P>
<P>
U.S. world champion Maurice Greene, who took the men's 100

meter crown yesterday, added another gold to his credit when the

fastest man on earth right now anchored the U.S. team to win the

men's 4x100-meter relay title, with a meet record time of 37.90

seconds.
</P>
<P>
Donovan Bailey of Canada, who wound up a disappointed seventh

in the men's 100 meters showdown, regained some recognition from

the local crowd on the American soil today, running a brilliant

last leg to a silver finish.
</P>
<P>
A meet record fell in the women's triple jump through the

effort from Sarka Kasparkova of the Czech Republic, who bounced

and jumped to 14.76 meters, 19 centimeters more than the old mark.
</P>
<P>
Kenya swept an one-two finish in the women's 10,000 meters

through Tegla Loroupe, 32:15.44, and Sally Barsosio, 32:50.16.

China's Dong Yanmei returned home fourth.
</P>
<P>
The women's 4x100-meter relay was won by the United States,

who clocked 42.06 seconds to better the meet record of 42.12.

Jamaica claimed the women's 4x400-meter relay title in 3:24.76.
</P>
<P>
The men's hammer's gold went to Russia's Vasili Sidorenko, who

tossed 80.89 meters. Kenya's Kipkosgei Luke snatched the men's

5,000 meters top honor in 13:20.27.
</P>
<P>
In the gymnastics competition, the United States overhauled

three out of four golds in the men's and women's individuals

contest. Chris Lamorte landed the rings gold medal with 9.700

points, Kristin Maloney claimed the women's balance beam title

with 9.775, and her teammate Vanessa Atler won the floor exercises

with 9.775.
</P>
<P>
The only title evaded the host's hands was the men's vault,

which was won by Sergei Fedorchenko of Kazakhstan with 9.650.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so excited right now, especially since it is my second

gold medal. It is my first time winning my new floor routine and I

love it," said Fedorchenko after his victory.
</P>
<P>
In the water polo final, Russia overpowered Spain 11-5 to take

the gold, while Italy edged the United States 8-7 to gain the

bronze.
</P>
<P>
The track and field and water polo competitions wrapped up

today. Diving and beach volleyball competition will start

GUANGZHOU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangdong Province
reported 9.9 percent year-on-year growth in retail sales during
the first half of this year, 2.9 percentage points higher than the

</P>
<P>
Consumer demand has become a major force in the region's

industrial output by 11.9 percent, revenues by 17.9 percent, and
exports by 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The buyer's market has made market competition a bit more
tense, as consumers become more quality and brand conscious.
</P>
<P>
However, people's incomes are not increasing quite so fast
because of a slowdown in the nation's economy, so growth of retail
sales in the province was 4.5 percentage points less than the same
period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Transport, Logistics Industry Encouraged to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior officer from
Singapore's Trade Development Board (TDB) said the country's
transport and logistics industry should continue to step up
efforts to maintain a high level of efficiency and productivity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the official launch ceremony here Thursday of the
newly-developed Air Pallet Trailer (APT), TDB Chief Executive
Officer Barry Desker said, "we need to build up leading-edge
terminal handling capabilities and logistics management
competencies" in a bid to turn Singapore into a premier transport
and logistics hub.
</P>
<P>
Desker said the transport and logistics industry contributes
nine percent to Singapore's economy and forms an integral part of
the backbone infrastructure supporting manufacturing industry and
trade.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore has augmented her infrastructure in terms of
port facilities, telecommunications as well as information
technology architecture over the years.
</P>
<P>
But soft infrastructure should be boosted as it is an important
element of a value-added distribution gateway, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, Singapore launched a multi-agency project
called Logistics Enhancement and Applications Program (LEAP) to
explore and identify strategies to advance the country's
competitiveness as a logistics hub. Within the framework of a
number of special interest groups formed under the LEAP, the
government and the private sector cooperated with each group to
explore initiatives to enhance the industry's capability.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the Air Pellet Trailer is one of the first
projects to be completed under the Leap.
</P>
<P>
The Air Pallet Trailer, equipped with pneumatic roller-beds
that can be raised or lowed and with a size of 20 meters in
length, 2.6 meters in width and 4.2 meters in height, allows for
trucking 4 main-deck pallets of air cargo at one delivery. With
the APT, freight forwarders can build up air pallets in their own
warehouses or even factory site outside the airport, airport
airfreight terminal operators can boost efficiency and derive cost
saving, and cycle time needed to collect and deliver air cargo
will be shortened by up to 30 percent.

PARIS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The resumption of growth in France has allowed the
government to cut tax by 16 billion francs (2.7 billion
U.S. dollars) next year, as the Minister of Finance and Economy
Dominique Strauss-Kahn Wednesday presented his tax plan for 1999,
in which the fruits of economic growth will be shared between
employers and employees. The most spectacular is the planned
elimination of tax on hiring employees within five years to
encourage the creation of jobs by small- and medium-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva
Wednesday sharply criticized Algeria for its report on human
rights submitted to the commission. While expressing no doubt
about "the fullness and horror" of the terrorism in Algeria, the
commission's president, Christine Chanet, estimated the situation
in Algeria as "particularly serious" because the people no longer
have confidence in the security forces and the government has
failed to protect them.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- British officials in charge of secret archives revealed on
Wednesday the plans by British secret service to kill Hitler
during World War II. The British once planned to kill the
dictator in Berchtesgaden or on his special train. The documents
showed that the British knew the habit of Hitler to the smallest
details. Other archives also showed the distrust of the British
toward General de Gaulle, whom London first suspected to be a
dictator with a plan to establish a "Gaullist legion" at the end
of the war.
</P>
<P>
-- The French airspace and aeronautic group Aerospatiale will
be privatized by merging with the Matra Hautes Technologies of
the Lagardere group. The new conglomerate will be Europe's first
defense and aeronautics consortium and the fourth largest in the
world with a capital of 80 billion francs (13.3 billion
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> 3rdld Writethru: Karbaschi to Appeal against Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The convicted Tehran mayor,
Gholamhussein Karbaschi, would appeal against the court verdict,
Karbaschi's lawyer Bahman Keshavarz announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Keshavarz said that the court decision did not came as a
surprise and the defense team had "expected such a verdict," the
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The court announced earlier Thursday that Karbaschi was found
guilty of corruption and sentenced to five years imprisonment and
60 lashes with a probation of four years.
</P>
<P>
The mayor was banned from holding public office for 20 years
and fined 1 billion rials (about 180,000 U.S. dollars at market
rate).
</P>
<P>
Judge Mohseni Ejaei said that Karbaschi can appeal within 20
days after the verdict was pronounced. He told reporters that
Karbaschi will remain free on bail until the appeal.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi did not appear before the court and was represented
by his lawyer Keshavarz. More than 200 people, including some 40
domestic and foreign reporters and photographers crammed the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
In a 39-page ruling read out in more than an hour, the court
repeated all the charges against the mayor and refuted each and
every of his defense.
</P>
<P>
The mayor, a famous reformist and a close ally of President
Mohammad Khatami, was the highest-ranking official charged for
corruption since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The case highlighted the political struggle between the
moderates and conservatives, pushing political groups and even the
media in the country to line up against each other.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was accused of corruption ranging from embezzling
millions of dollars to mismanagement and giving loans to private
sector without legal documents.
</P>
<P>
The major rejected as baseless all the charges during the seven
sessions of the open trial started on June 7.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, Karbaschi was temporally detained by the
conservative judiciary, but was released 11 days later following
direct interference of the top Iranian leadership.
</P>
<P>
The moderates believed the case was politically motivated with
the aim to weaken the government of Khatami, who enjoyed strong
support from Karbaschi and his followers since the presidential
elections in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was hated for financing Khatami's presidential
campaign, which brought about a landslide victory over the
conservative candidate, Majlis (Parliament) Speak Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives vowed to punish any one violating
the country's law and attacked the moderates for abusing freedom
and democracy proposed by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The new president is trying to push forward social reforms and
bring changes to people's lives.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces Economic Recovery Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is embarking upon
its economic recovery plan with focus on the objectives and key
areas that will stabilize the market and strengthen economic
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the plan drawn by the National Economic Action
Council (NEAC) at a press conference here Thursday, NEAC Executive
Director Tun Daim Zainudin said the plan has outlined six
objectives as the main thrust for the economic rehabilitation
program.
</P>
<P>
They are: to stabilize the ringgit, restore market confidence,
maintain financial market stability, strengthen economic
fundamentals, continue the equity and socio-economic agenda, and
restore the adversely affected sectors.
</P>
<P>
In order to stabilize the ringgit, Tun Daim, who is also
Minister of Special Functions, said the NEAC recommends that an
appropriate exchange rate regime be chosen, over-dependence on the
U.S. dollar be reduced, a balanced interest rate policy be adopted
and Malaysia's external reserves be increased.
</P>
<P>
To restore market confidence, the NEAC has mapped out six
measures to be taken including improving transparency and the
regulatory environment, establishing rules for assisting
industries and companies in trouble, increasing consistency of
policies, adopting liberal and market-based policies, improving
public relations and improving the dissemination of economic
information.
</P>
<P>
To maintain financial market stability, the council says the
integrity of the banking system must be preserved and this
requires Malaysia to establish agencies along the lines of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Resolution Trust
Corporation in the United States besides developing its own
private debt securities market.
</P>
<P>
Other measures recommended by the NEAC in order to achieve this
objective are to recapitalize the banking sector, to monitor
closely the overall credit expansion and to improve the capital
market.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen economic fundamentals, it recommends six
measures, which are to increase the quality of investments,
improve the balance of payments, maintain a balanced public sector
financial position, maintain an appropriate monetary policy,
maintain price stability and increase labor competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
For socio-economic agenda, the NEAC says that steps must be
taken to ameliorate the hardship from poverty, and employment
opportunities must be expanded.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia also needs to meet the challenge of expanding tertiary
education, address the problem of graduate unemployment and
control the influx of foreign workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addressing the sixth objective of revitalizing the sectors
badly affected by the economic crisis, the council identified 12
sectors which are considered most vulnerable to the currency and
stock market crisis.
</P>
<P>
They are the primary commodities and resource-based industries,
mining and petroleum, manufacturing, information technology and
the Multimedia Super Corridor, motor industry, construction,
property, infrastructure, transportation, freight forwarding,
tourism, industrial development finance institutions and insurance
and reinsurance.
</P>
<P>
Many of these sectors have been affected by the ringgit
depreciation, poor stock market performance, financing problems,
high interest rates and economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
"All recommendations already approved by the Cabinet two weeks
ago must be implemented without any undue delay," Tun Daim said.
</P>
<P>
He said the NEAC would closely monitor the implementation
process and make required adjustments based on the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Confirming that 1998 would be a recession year for Malaysia,
Tun Daim said after 1999, Malaysia might record a growth of 5 to 6
percent but this would depend on how much confidence returns.
</P>
<P>
For 1999 itself, he said the outlook still remains "uncertain".
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's gross domestic product (GDP) growth fell by 1.8
percent during the first quarter 1998 and the GDP growth for the
whole year was officially projected to be negative 1 to 2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Loses Heavily to Unwholesome Land Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government loses no
less than three billion U.S. Dollars annually through unwholesome
agricultural and land use practices, a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Such huge losses would continue unless there was an efficient
land management in Nigeria, according to Umaru Abubakar,
Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and
Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
"The need for efficient land management to improve land
quality was therefore sine-qua-non for optimum crop production,"
he told a five-day seminar on land use, quoted by the official
daily New Nigerian Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He urged a developmental balance sheet that would indicate
developmental assets and liabilities of each area which would
take into consideration the rising needs of land for housing,
industry, recreation, wild-life and forestry, livestock, mining
and communication.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to ensure that the use of land for any
of these purposes did not engender depreciation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He particularly mentioned the issue of indiscriminate
devegetation which occurs as a result of the action of rural
dwellers searching for sources of fuel and fodder or even as a
result of farmers' resort to "slash and burn" technique of
keeping the land bare and in an easy farm condition.
</P>
<P>
Unless the land use problem was solved, the government
strategies to increase food production and average farm income as
well as ensure self-sufficiency and poverty alleviation, would
never be fully realized, he warned.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Sign CTBT When Security Concerns Fully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad on Thursday said Pakistan will sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) only when the country's vital
security concerns are fully safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to reporters at the conclusion of the third
round of talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
here Thursday morning. The two sides made no specific progress in
the talks but agreed to resume their talks in late August in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said the timing of Pakistan's signing CTBT "can be
determined only when we are absolutely sure that our vital
security concerns have been fully safeguarded."
</P>
<P>
While arriving at a decision about signing the CTBT, he said,
Pakistan will consider what are vital national interests.
</P>
<P>
"I would not do so under any coercion," he declared.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, he said, Pakistan emphasized that there
should be no duress in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he stated, there has to be a clear demonstration of
collective engagement on the part of the major powers in the
process of peace and security in South Asia "which has to focus on
Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
"Because as far as situation of peace and security in South
Asia is concerned it is entirely predicated on how we proceed on
Kashmir," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of talks with India in the forthcoming Colombo
Summit, he said, Pakistan will see how the situation evolves there
between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart
Atal Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see to what extent the Indians are now ready to
reciprocate our sincerity of purpose in addressing the core issue
of Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
He underscored that unless the Kashmir dispute is addressed
"meaningfully, purposefully, we believe that the cause of peace
and security in this part of the world will remain totally
elusive."
</P>
<P>
"The Americans are convinced that Kashmir dispute has to be
addressed," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sets Terms for Croatia to Join Western Alliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright Wednesday set the conditions for Croatia
to join western alliances, saying it should improve its compliance
with the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic,
Albright listed steps Croatia should take to improve on its
compliance with the 1995 Dayton accord which ended the fighting in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The steps include the plans for the return of Serb refugees and
for reconstruction, of which, Albright said, the U.S. wants to
see rapid implementation by the Croatian government so as to win
Washington's support for its hope of joining western alliances.
</P>
<P>
Granic pledged that Croatia would take immediate steps to
resolve any problems that arose during the refugee return process.
</P>
<P>
Some 180,000 ethnic Serbs fled Croatia after the collapse of
their self-proclaimed state in 1995, and most of their homes were
destroyed by vengeful Croats following the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Croatia would like Washington to support its admission into
western institutions, including Partnership for Peace, North
Atlantic Organization Treaty, and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued after Albright-Granic meeting noted
that Croatia's application for the Partnership for Peace and other
Euro-Atlantic organizations was a major topic.
</P>
<P>
The tone of relations between the two countries has improved
since last year when Albright lambasted Granic for his country's
treatment of Serbs.

NANNING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region spent 8.7 billion yuan (1 billion U.S. dollars)
on fixed assets in the first half of this year, a 16 percent
increase year on year, and a reversal of the downward trend for 2
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
This may have contributed a great deal to the 9.1 percent
growth in the GDP in the first half, compared to a national rate
of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the first half is also a good sign on the road to
an annual goal of 10 percent and for revenues, market analysts say.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Bank Negara
(Central Bank) has worked out a format for the setting up of a
clearing house for trade settlement between countries, Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad disclosed here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The settlement house would, among others, record the import and
export transactions in the country, he told reporters after a
two-hour dialogue here Thursday with chief executive officers
(CEOs) of local companies.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, details would be announced by the central
bank later.
</P>
<P>
On the National Economic Recovery Plan released by the National
Economic Action Council (NEAC) hours ago, Mahathir said his
government would adopt the NEAC's recommendations under the plan,
which spells out various measures to lift the country out of the
current economic downturn, in full unless there are specific
objections.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that he had received encouraging response from
the CEOs and they had agreed to support the government's recovery
plan.

<HEADLINE> 2ndld Writethru: Tehran Mayor Sentenced to 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian court on Thursday found
Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi guilty of corruption and
embezzlement, and sentenced him to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The mayor was banned from holding public office for 20 years
and also sentenced to 60 lashes with a probation of four years.
</P>
<P>
He was also fined 1 billion rials (about 250,000 U.S. dollars
at market rate).
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi can appeal the verdict.
</P>
<P>
In a 39-page ruling read out for more than an hour, the court
repeated all the charges against the reformist mayor and refuted
every and each of his defense.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi did not appear at the court and was represented by
one of his defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The trial seemed to have gripped attention of the whole
nation. The court at the Imam Khomeini Judicial Complex is crowed
with journalists and riot police have been on alert.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a popular moderate and a close ally of President
Mohammad Khatami, was the highest-ranking Iranian official
arraigned for embezzlement since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The case highlighted the political struggle between the
moderates and conservatives, pushing political groups and even the
media in the country to line up against each other.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was accused of corruption ranging from embezzling
millions of dollars to mismanagement and giving loans to private
sector without legal documents.
</P>
<P>
The major rejected as baseless all the charges during the seven
sessions of the open trial started on June 7.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, Karbaschi was temporally detained by the
conservative judiciary, but was released 11 days later following
direct interference of the top Iranian leadership.
</P>
<P>
The moderates believed the case was politically motivated with
the aim to weaken the government of Khatami, who enjoyed strong
support from Karbaschi and his followers since the presidential
elections in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was hated for financing Khatami's presidential
campaign, which brought about a landslide victory over the
conservative candidate, Majlis (Parliament) Speak Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives vowed to punish any one violating
the country's law and attacked the moderates for abusing freedom
and democracy proposed by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The new president is trying to push forward social reforms and
bring changes to people's lives.

fifth straight win over Wheaton and 6-3 overall as "we've grown up
together. There is no guesswork at what's going to take place out

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Dashang Group Co. Ltd.,
headquartered in the northeast China city of Dalian, signed an
agreement on Wednesday to purchase three stores in Liaoning
Province, one each in the cities of Fushun, Jinzhou and Yingkou.
</P>
<P>
The merger, the first of its kind in China in terms of size and
areas involved, is considered to be a bold step for distributing
enterprises in order to realize low cost expansion.
</P>
<P>
The three stores are highly efficient comprehensive retail
enterprises with excellent reputations in their respective cities.
</P>
<P>
The stores will be registered as limited liability companies
and will become founding members of the Dalian Store
Co. Limited. Workers in the enterprises will enjoy all legitimate
rights and benefits offered by the Dashan Group.
</P>
<P>
The parent company will also establish a northeast China
company responsible for unified management and operations by
forming a commodity delivery and marketing network covering the
region.
</P>
<P>
Stores involved in the merger will be under the industrial
administration of their respective local governments, and existing
tax remittance channels will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Dashang Group reported total sales of 3.25 billion yuan in
1997, with pretax profits hitting 130 million yuan. The merger
increased the group's total assets to three billion yuan, with
projections calling for annual sales of over four billion yuan and
pretax profits of 200 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Dashang President Niu Gang pointed to the merger as the group's
first step to build a nationwide marketing network.
</P>
<P>
He said the group will evolve into a large industrial
distribution venture featuring the combination of production,
distribution, science and technology, finance and services. He
added that the focus over the next two years will center on trade
activities.

<P>
"Brazilian football authorities informed us they could not make
the visit because the future direction of its team would be under

The Brazilians also asked for a scheduled friendly against
South Korea to be postponed until October for "internal problems".

<HEADLINE> Births in S. African Fall by Half in 30 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South African women are
having half the number of children than they were 30 years ago,
said a recent population report.
</P>
<P>
Figures are down from between 6.5 and 6.9 children per woman
in the 1960s to 3.2 in 1997, says a report in the
Washington-based journal Population Bulletin, the Star newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, South Africa has experienced the most
significant fertility decline in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The total fertility rate for the white population fell to
replacement level (2.1 children per woman) as early as the
mid-1970s. For Indian and colored populations, the fertility rate
reached just above replacement rate in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
But the country could not have undergone a fertility decline
without a substantial drop in the fertility rate of the black
population, says the report by Thomas Goliber.
</P>
<P>
Black women fertility started declining in the 1960s and by
the late 1980s had fallen to around 4.6 children per woman.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the fertility rate for South Africa was estimated at
3.2 children per woman, a level more common in Asia or Latin
America than in Africa.
</P>
<P>
This fertility transition came about through strong government
support for family planning in the 1960s, says the report
entitled Population and Reproductive Health in Sub-Saharan
Africa.
</P>
<P>
This support was driven in part for fear that rapid population
growth would undermine South Africa's prosperity and economic
development, but also by concern among white political leaders
and administrators that the fast growing black population would
overwhelm the smaller number of whites.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1963, the government provided substantial funding
for private and public family planning services and provided free
contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, the government launched the well-funded national
family planning program, the results of which were impressive and
unprecedented in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
By 1983, more than half of the women eligible for
contraception were using it. In 1984, the country adopted a
population development program to intensify the family planning
program and encourage social and economic changes that increased
contraceptive demand.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the 1980s, 58 percent of women aged 15 to 49,
including about half of all black married women, were using some

<HEADLINE> China Develops Way To Treat Waste From Gold Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A gold plant in Laizhou in China's
Shandong Province has developed technology that reduces pollution
caused by gold extraction.
</P>
<P>
Cyanide is commonly used to extract gold in China, but the
cyanide discharged in the process is so toxic that only 0.1 gram
can kill a person, and even gold producers that meet national
standards pose a threat to the environment.
</P>
<P>
With the new technology, workers can extract copper, lead, zinc
and other impurities from the waste water and recycle cyanide
water in production, and save 12,000 cubic meters of water and
recover 93 tons of copper and 21 tons of sodium cyanide annually,
yielding an additional profit of 1.8 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Laizhou is China's third largest gold production center. Six of
its major gold mines yield 15 tons of gold a year.
</P>
<P>
Song Zhenguo, Laizhou's mayor, has asked the six to make
widespread use of the technology in the next two years.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The historical Chinese city of
Luoyang in Henan Province has told 349 enterprises to deal with
their pollution problems over the next three years and to hold
discharge levels to certain standards.
</P>
<P>
This city is trying to get all enterprises to meet
environmental protection standards by the year 2000, local
sources say. It used to have more than 700 major water and air
polluters.
</P>
<P>
But, 400 of these have begun to act in accordance with State
Council requirements, and this has meant some improvement in the
city's environment. The remaining 349 consist of 196 causing water
pollution and 153 causing air pollution that have been given three
years to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Counties or districts with polluters won't be allowed to give
permits to new construction projects if the polluters fail to
address the pollution problem in a certain amount of time.
</P>
<P>
Luoyang was the capital for six dynasties in China and has a
great number of cultural and historical sites like the Longmen
Grottoes and Baima Temple and it had 5 million tourists last year,
68,200 of them from overseas.

<HEADLINE> Fiscal System Supports Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's financial departments have
adopted effective measures to support key state reform projects,
with particular emphasis on the reform of state-owned enterprises
and grain marketing system, according to Finance Minister Xiang
Huaicheng.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national fiscal work conference earlier this
week, Xiang said that guaranteeing the basic living expenses of
workers laid off by state-owned enterprises and implementation of
the reemployment project are crucial to social stability and the
success of the restructuring of such enterprises. The fiscal
system actively raised funds during the first half of this year to
ensure the smooth progress of the reform effort.
</P>
<P>
Xiang pointed out that the ministry has allocated 5.4 billion
yuan to pay for the basic living expense of laid-off workers formerly
working for enterprises directly under the State Council. He noted
that an additional three billion yuan has been used to subsidize
the living expenses of laid-off workers in central and western China
and in the country's major industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a series of preferential policies governing taxes
and fees have been formulated to support enterprises which provide
jobs for large numbers of unemployed workers.
</P>
<P>
Financial departments at various levels have worked to ensure
reform of the grain marketing system by earnestly overcoming
losses suffered by grain enterprises and actively raising funding
for grain risk funds.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance had provided 3.36 billion yuan for
grain risk funds by the end of June, with local departments
allocating an additional 2.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Related departments have opened special accounts in the
Agricultural Development Bank to improve the management of grain
risk funds. Central government subsidies supplemented by funding
from local governments will be allocated to grain firms through
special accounts which will provide safeguards against
misappropriations.

<HEADLINE> Jorner-Kersee Sings her Song of Swan with Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Jackie Joyner-Kersee, perhaps the
most multi-talented female athlete in history, completed her "Song
of Swan" with a sweet victory in the heptathlon at the Goodwill
Games here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The world record holder scored 6,502 points to win her farewell
multi-event with heart and determination. That was a perfect
goodbye for the two-time Olympic champion and three-time world
title winner.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, she will perform a farewell long jump in suburban
St. Louis, and then retire. Besides, heptathlon, she once held the
long jump world record and known as an excellent basketball
players. All the scores over 7,000 points in heptathlon were
created by her, nobody else in the world.
</P>
<P>
Her grandmother named her after Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
because she wanted her to grow up to be "the first lady of
something". Joyner-Kersee fulfilled her grandmother's dream. She
retires this week at 36 as the greatest female athlete of her
generation, the first lady of track and field.
</P>
<P>
From modest beginnings in her childhood, Joyner-Kersee began
her long-jumping career on the front porch. She and her two
sisters walked to a nearby park, loaded sand in potatochip bags,
carted the sand home and fashioned a jumping pit.
</P>
<P>
She was called a tomboy for years, the girl in pigtails,
cut-off jeans and a T-shirt who hopped the railroad tracks and
became so accomplished at local recreation center that the phone
at home rang off the wall, driving her mother to distraction,
strangers wanting Jackie to play on their basketball and softball
and volleyball teams.
</P>
<P>
She quit being a tomboy and became simply an athlete during her
sophomore year in high school, when her teams won the state
basketball and track titles. The girls got the gym after school
and it was the boys who had to trundle back for practice after
dark.
</P>
<P>
One sport was never enough for Joyner-Kersee, who would play
basketball, and would win three Olympic gold medals, two in the
heptathlon, a third in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
She will perform a farewell long jump in suburban St. Louis
this Saturday. She leaves knowing that her place in history is
secure and that there is another queen, Marion Jones, to whom to
hand her crown.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who made a sprint double at the current Games, said that
Joyner-Kersee was her childhood idol. "In my mind, she is the best
female athlete who ever lived. If I can achieve one-quarter of
what she achieved, I'd be happy," Jones said.
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee was most illuminating in defeat and adversity,
always smiling. At the 1991 world championships in Tokyo, she
injured her leg during the 200 meters in the heptathlon, but still
gave interviews while she lay on a gurney. At the 1996 Summer
Olympics, after dropping out of the heptathlon with a hamstring
injury, she willed herself to a bronze medal in the long jump,
leaping from sixth place to third on her final attempt.
</P>
<P>
Always, she had to overcome asthma that sometimes forced her to
run while wearing a mask and left her gasping for breath. And she

Summer Olympics that she and her sister-in-law, Florence Griffith

NANJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded enterprises in
Wuxi in east China's Jiangsu Province did 938 million U.S.
dollars worth of export business during the first half of this
year, a 43 percent rise from the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
They accounted for nearly 70 percent of local exports, mainly
as the result of increased overseas investment in the city and
exports of electronic and machinery products.
</P>
<P>
During the six-month period, the existing 42 overseas-funded
enterprises added 340 million dollars of overseas investment,
accounting for more than half of the total for this year.
</P>
<P>
The increased number of overseas-funded enterprises were hardly
affected by the financial crisis in Southeast Asia, mainly because
they provide parts and components for big Japanese, American, and
European companies.
</P>
<P>
A growing amount of electronics and machinery exports business
has been done by multinational-funded companies, and 19
overseas-funded enterprises had more than 5 million dollars worth
of exports each during the first half of the year, and 6 had more
than 10 million dollars worth.

<TEXT>
<P>
Karbaschi was accused of corruption ranging from embezzling
millions of dollars to mismanagement and giving loans to private
sector without legal documents.
</P>
<P>
The major rejected as baseless all the charges during the seven
sessions of the open trial started on June 7.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, the mayor was temporally detained by the
conservative judiciary, but was released 11 days later following
direct interference of the top Iranian leadership.
</P>
<P>
The moderates believed the case was politically motivated with
the aim to weaken the government of Khatami, who enjoyed strong
support from Karbaschi and his followers since the presidential
elections in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was hated for financing Khatami's presidential
campaign, which brought about a landslide victory over the
conservative candidate, Majlis (Parliament) Speak Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives vowed to punish any one violating
the country's law and attacked the moderates for abusing freedom
and democracy proposed by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The new president is trying to push forward social reforms and
bring new changes to people's lives.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investment in Angola Tops $4 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Commerce Department
official has revealed that the U.S. investment to Angola has
reached four billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Millard Arnold, the U.S. Commerce Department envoy in charge
of southern African business affairs, made the disclosure to the
press here Wednesday after concluding a 24-hour visit to Angola.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investment in Angola is mainly in the petroleum industry.
However, Arnold believed that investment could be increased in
other areas such as agriculture, coffee plantation, tourism,
provided that armed conflicts would end soon.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a partnership between U.S. and
Angolan entrepreneurs is very significant to Angola's
development. Bilateral cooperation has boosted the development in
the country's petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
At present, the oil production by U.S. companies in Angola has
taken up 90 percent of the southern African country's total
national production.
</P>
<P>
Arnold was surprised by the business advancement of the U.S.
Coco Cola Corporation in Angola, saying this indicates the broad
prospects for bilateral trade development.
</P>
<P>
He urged the two sides to make positive efforts to explore the
channels for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Angola is of major importance to the development and expansion
of the Southern African Development Community, he said, adding he
will take the message back home so that more U.S. business people
will come to Angola for investment.
</P>
<P>
Arnold arrived here Tuesday night in a bid to get acquainted
with the Angolan market and seek opportunities to increase
bilateral trade and U.S. investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Angola is the No. 2 African country for U.S.
investment. It is also the third trade partner for the U.S. in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been assisting the reconstruction of
Luanda water supply system, sugar manufacturing and coffee
planting in addition to cooperation with Angola in industry and
trade.

<HEADLINE> Thai Tourism Enjoys Highest Growth in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- International visitors arrivals in
Thailand surged by 10.55 percent to 630,349 in April this year
compared with the same period last year, the Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was the second highest growth for that month, the TAT said
in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The increase reflects the continuing strength of the Thai
tourism industry as the Amazing Thailand campaign begins to take
hold.
</P>
<P>
The increase "is even more stunning" because April is
traditionally the start of the low season when visitor arrivals
begin to flatten off, the release said.
</P>
<P>
This April saw sharp increase in visitors from Europe, the
Americas, South Asia, Oceania, Middle East and Africa,
compensating for a 2.97-percent fall in visitors from East Asia
and the Pacific due to the regional economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
TAT Governor Seree Wangpaichitr said the increase showed that
Thailand is very much on track with its new marketing focus in the
Amazing Thailand campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to continue this trend by exploiting new markets,
diversifying target segments, inducing value-added tourism,
promoting facilities, supporting the Asian Games and cooperating
with neighboring countries," said Seree.
</P>
<P>
Thailand launched the Amazing Thailand campaign last year,
hoping to attract 16 million foreign tourists in the 1998-99
fiscal year and earn 580 billion baht (14.5 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Muslim Market Improves Life In Remote Chinese Village (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Laoheqiao was a backward village
in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, but a Muslim
cattle and sheep market has helped improve life there.
</P>
<P>
The 500-some families living there hardly made ends meet no
matter how hard they worked on their meager amount of farmland
until the early 1990s, when the city government of Wuling spent
450,000 yuan on a wholesale market.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia's 1.78 million Muslims account for a third of its
population and animal husbandry has been their major business for
a long time. So, the 3,200-sq.m.market, which has the same name as
the village, has been quite successful.
</P>
<P>
For more than one year, Ma Yingjie, along with an imam from a
nearby mosque, has been cutting the throats of the cattle and
sheep for sale in the market to keep the meat pure. "I go to the
mosque before daybreak everyday," he says, "and after religious
services, I come to the market."
</P>
<P>
On one busy day, Ma had to cut the throats of 700 sheep, 21
cattle, and five camels that were then taken to Muslim butchers
market. Because of this, the market became known for its purity.

<P>
Some herdsmen of the Erdos Prairie in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region prefer driving their cattle and sheep to the
Laoheqiao Market on foot to be slaughtered and then transport the
beef or mutton back to sell it.
</P>
<P>
And, an increasing number of business people from across the
country are coming to Laoheqiao to purchase beef, mutton, and
hides. "The meat sold here is a hundred percent Muslim," said a
businessman from Inner Mongolia, "and the Laoheqiao Market stamp
on the meat is like a pass. It makes the meat sell good."
</P>
<P>
So, the market has expanded quickly and was designated by
China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce as the
country's largest Muslim beef and mutton market in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the market sold 350,000 head of sheep, 30,000
cattle, 360 camels that produced 2 million kg of beef and mutton
and 130 million yuan in sales.
</P>
<P>
The flourishing market has created jobs for Laoheqiao's farmers
as well, and more than 90 percent of the village's farmers have
some connection with the market and a number of processing
factories have been established.
</P>
<P>
Per capita net income in the village was over 3,000 yuan in
1997, seven times what it was before the market was founded, and
the village has become one of Ningxia's first group of villages
with a "relatively comfortable standard of living".

gold medal. It is my first time winning my new floor routine and I

love it," said Fedorchenko after his victory.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Hand Over Loss-making State-owned Textile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Nine loss-making state-owned textile
mills will be soon handed over to their workers and employees, The
Daily Star newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made at a meeting of the government committee
on loss-making industries in jute and textile sectors held here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, headed by Finance Minister S.A.M. Kabria, at the
meeting gave full authority to the textile ministry for handing
over the mills to the workers to fulfill Prime Minister's earlier
commitment in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The workers who will take over the mills will form companies
and bear the long-term loans of the mills, and payments against
the long-term loans will be made in phases after three years of
takeover, according to the decision,.
</P>
<P>
The nine mills incurred a total loss of around 2.1 billion taka
(44.68 million U.S. dollars) over the years.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry is a major sector in Bangladesh with a
total of over 170 jute and cotton textile mills making a quantity
of raw materials for the country's fast-growing ready-made garment
sector.
</P>
<P>
Due to mismanagement and other reasons, a number of state-owned
textile mills have become loss-making ones. Therefore, the
government has decided to hand over some selected ones to workers
to make them profitable as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Giving Imperial Palace A Good Cleaning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing plans to spend 600 million
yuan (72 million U.S. dollars) improving the area around the
Imperial Palace, which is known to tourists as the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is expected to be completed within a year
and half, will involve dredging the moat around the palace and
stopping nearby sources of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now is one of China's major cities with serious
pollution problems and the moat has become seriously polluted by
waste water from nearby residences, restaurants, and shops.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 families and work units near the moat are being moved
to other places to make way for the project.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Imperial Palace, which covers 720,000
square meters and has some 9,000 rooms, began in 1406. It was home
to 24 emperors of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911)
dynasties. It is the largest and best-preserved ensemble of
traditional Chinese architecture still standing.
</P>
<P>
The palace is protected by a wall 10 meters high and the
52-meter-wide moat outside it is meant to make the Palace
inaccessible.

<HEADLINE> China Stops Major Violent Crime Gang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's public security
departments arrested 18 people accused of being involved in
violent crime in Hong Kong and other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Public Security Ministry said that the gang
is suspected of being involved in several violent crimes since
1990. In January of this year, they smuggled more than 800
kilograms of explosives, over 2,000 detonators, and 500 meters of
blasting fuse for terrorist acts and blackmail into Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Between January and November of 1995, the group arranged two
murders and robberies in southern China in the cities of Guangzhou
and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Between May, 1996 and September, 1997, they held hostages at
gunpoint in Hong Kong and got 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars in
blackmail payments.
</P>
<P>
In June, 1991 and March, 1993, they robbed 7 Hong Kong gold
shops of more than 7 million Hong Kong dollars worth of goods
using guns smuggled in from other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Public security departments in Guangzhou and other cities
seized some of the arms, explosives, and goods and money taken
during the robberies.
</P>
<P>
The investigation involved a great deal of cooperation of the
police of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region .

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, U.S. to Resume Nuclear Talks in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and the United States
Thursday decided to resume their talks on nuclear
non-proliferation in August as the current round of talks ended
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Pakistani
Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad concluded their third session of
formal talks Thursday morning, failing to make any specific
progress, reported Pakistan Television (PTV),
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides agreed to continue their talks in August
in Washington on issues relating to peace and security in South
Asia and nuclear non-proliferation, PTV said.
</P>
<P>
An official press release on the talks is expected to be issued
soon. Except for a few U.S. correspondents and PTV men, other
local and foreign reporters were kept away from the talks.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the U.S. side assured Pakistan that the U.S.
government will not obstruct the loan of the International
Monetary Fund to Pakistan, which is facing serious financial
difficulties due to the economic sanctions imposed by the West,
PTV said.
</P>
<P>
On the Pak-Indian relations, the U.S. team said they are
attaching great importance to the forthcoming meeting between
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal Behari
Vajpayee in Colombo on the side lines of the 10th summit of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, PTV said.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad, who is leading the Pakistani side, apprised the U.S.
officials of the country's security concerns in the region over
signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and other related
agreements, PTV said.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the U.S. officials on the issues such as
Kashmir, Afghanistan and Pak-Indian relations, PTV said.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who flew into here Tuesday afternoon from New Delhi,
will leave Pakistan shortly after the talks. Besides his
three-session talks with the Pakistani Foreign Secretary, he also
called on Prime Minister Sharif and Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub
Khan.
</P>
<P>
Talbott's visit to the region is seen as part of the U.S.
efforts to try to convince India and Pakistan to sign the CTBT and
other related non-proliferation agreements.
</P>
<P>
He had held similar inconclusive talks with the Indian
leadership in New Delhi and the two sides also agreed to resume
the talks in August in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Twenty-nine Charged With Drug Smuggling in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-nine people have been
charged with smuggling and selling heroin and cocaine that led to
five overdoses -- four of them fatal -- in the well-to-do Dallas
suburb of Plano, Texas, in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The federal indictment released Wednesday accused the
defendants of conspiring to distribute black tar heroin and
cocaine from Mexico to young adults and juveniles in this city of
188,000.
</P>
<P>
"The indictment further alleges that the conspirators
specifically targeted Plano and the young people of the community
of Plano as a new market for their drug, a new market to
distribute this deadly poison," U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
Plano has seen 20 overdoses -- 17 of them deadly -- since
September 1994. The deaths prompted the formation of a task force
to investigate.
</P>
<P>
The task force was "able to tease out the distribution of the
drugs that caused the deaths," said Paul Villaescusa, a spokesman
for the Drug Enforcement Agency.
</P>
<P>
Villaescusa said the task force investigated with an eye toward
bigger sentences for the participants.
</P>
<P>
Most of the suspects are in their early 20s and were already in
custody on state and federal charges. Twenty-four of the
defendants could face prison sentences of 20 years to
life.

<HEADLINE> US House of Representative Voting Down Draft Resolution "Revoking MFN for China" Is Wise: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Tang Guoqiang said here today that China has noticed that the US
House of Representatives has voted down a draft resolution on
"revoking MFN (most-favored-nation trade status) for China."
</P>
<P>
"This is wise," he said in response to a question raised by a
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mutual granting by China and the United States
of the MFN trade status on the basis of reciprocity constitutes
the foundation for the development of normal economic relations
and trade between the two countries, serves the interests of both
China and the US, and reflects the common aspiration of the two
peoples.
</P>
<P>
he said, "The outcome of the voting demonstrates that it has
become increasingly unpopular to use the granting of the MFN trade
status as a means to undermine China-US relations and their trade
and economic ties."
</P>
<P>
he pointed out that the annual review by the US side of the MFN
trade status to China has not only added a destabilizing factor to
the economic relations and trade between China and the US, but is
also detrimental to the stable development of bilateral relations as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
he expressed the hope that the US side will comply with the
trend of the time and work out a permanent resolution to China's
MFN trade status at an early date, so as to create conditions for
sustained, sound and stable development of economic cooperation
and trade between China and the US.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here Wednesday that the United Nations supports the
Mexican government's efforts to peacefully solve the conflict in
the southern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, Annan spoke to
reporters and urged rebels in the state to resume talks with the
government.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the government and the rebels have been
deadlocked since 1996, and clashes between pro-rebel and
pro-government groups have been on and off.
</P>
<P>
Annan, on the last leg of a five-nation Latin American tour,
emphasized that he has no intention of having the United Nations
step in as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. does not get involved in internal affairs of this
nature ... unless there is a request from the government. There
has been no such request and I have not offered to get involved,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also praised Mexico's active role in
cooperating in the fight against drugs and in the
Central American peace process.

<HEADLINE> Giant Swiss Company Sets up Biotech Lab in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The giant Swiss company
Novartis has announced that it is committing 600 million
U.S. dollars to build and operate a lab specializing in plant
genetics in La Jolla, Southern California of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, the international pharmaceutical and
agribusiness conglomerate announced plans for a 250-million-dollar
lab in the same area devoted to work in human genetics.
</P>
<P>
La Jolla is nicknamed "Biotechnology Beach" because of a big,
thriving biomedical community.
</P>
<P>
The plant genetics lab will employ some 200 scientists and
technicians in efforts to develop plants that would have higher
yields or resistance to pests, and plants that could produce
medicines or products such as plastics or industrial lubricants.
</P>
<P>
The institute focusing on human genetics will seek treatments
for major diseases, including diabetes, cancer, heart diseases and
neurological illness such as Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
The two Novartis institutes will have an annual budget of about
75 million dollars. Novartis has the right to review discoveries
coming from the labs and license those it chooses for potential
product development.
</P>
<P>
Both labs are conceived to take advantage of a period when
research in molecular biology moves beyond simply identifying
genes that give rise to characteristics and diseases and moves
toward gaining more understanding of how genes actually
works.
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope to manipulate the genes and the systems the
genes influences, to treat diseases or change characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Novartis, with headquarters in Basel, Switzerland, is the
second-largest seed company in the world.
</P>
<P>
Genetic manipulation might lead to seeds to grow plants that
resist pests without the need for chemical pesticides, or plants
that are hardier in drought or produce bigger fruit or grain
yields.

<HEADLINE> Baht Is Expected to Slide to Hit Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The exchange rate of baht against
the U.S. dollar could slide back to 50:1 at the end of this year
and 60:1 at a longer term, an international research institute
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Schroeder, director of the SG Securities Research Ltd.,
said that the possibility for the baht exchange rate to fall to
62 against the dollar is 54 percent, the possibility to fall to 55
is 70 percent and to 50 is 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The baht nose-dived to 57 against the dollar in January this
year but gradually appreciated to the current 40 level.
</P>
<P>
"The baht has remained relatively stable amid the yen turmoil
but we can't help (with this forecast)," Schroeder was quoted as
saying by the Nation Newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder backed his forecast by saying that the daily baht
structure is a bit "dizzy" at the moment though the weekly posture
clearly indicates a short-term appreciation to 38 baht or 36 bath.
</P>
<P>
The medium-term range is predicted at 49-50 and longer term 60,
he said, adding that if the 40 baht level gives way now, 36 baht
will be possible before the currency will further slide to the 50
and 62 targets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another global research institute, Dresdner
Klienwort Benson, expected the baht to fall to 50 this year-end
because it estimated Thailand's gross domestic product (GDP) will
contract steeply by 11.6 percent, against the government's 4-5.5
percent forecast.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder also believed that Thailand's stock index would fall
to 220-240 points in the first week of August as the Thai economy
has not shown any improvement.

The negative factors for the exchange rate and the Thai stock
index this year has led Schroeder to assume that some Thai banks
might be shut down by the end of the year before the stock market
bottoms out.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would recommend "a buy" for Thai shares when
the baht reaches 55 and the stock market bottoms out with the

According to the SG Securities Research, Asia is entering "a
high-risk July" period and will then witness "a major August
rally". Asia has structural property, debt, banking and employment
problems to overcome. An economy recovery should begin in the year
2000 but markets will reach domino bottoms beginning in late 1998
through mid 1999.

</P>
<P>
-- During the talks with a high-level U.S. delegation
Wednesday, Pakistan is believed to have indicated flexibility on
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and other items on the U.S.

<HEADLINE> US Business Hails House Vote on Trade with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Major American business
organizations hailed the House vote Wednesday to maintain normal
trade relations with China, calling it a right step forward.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas J. Donohue
said shortly after the voting that the House of Representatives
"took the right step by approving normal trade relations with
China."
</P>
<P>
After long hours of heated debate, the House approved President
Bill Clinton's decision to extend for another year the current
trade status for China by a vote of 264 to 166 thanks partly to
the business organizations' lobbying efforts.
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is clear - a stable U.S.-China commercial
framework will open markets for U.S. exports, generate more jobs
for American workers, and create the environment for an expansion
of democratic values in China," Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
It is officially said that exports to mainland China and Hong
Kong have created 400,000 well-paid jobs in the United States,
benefiting hundreds of thousands of families.
</P>
<P>
Without normal trade, tariffs on U.S. imports from China would
dramatically increase by 30 to 50 percent and "these tariff hikes
would impose a tax increase of at least 300 U.S. dollars on the
average American family, which would fall hardest on low-income
and working American households," Donohue warned.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world's largest business
federation representing more than three million businesses and
organizations of every size, sector and region.
</P>
<P>
As part of its lobbying efforts, the chamber organized a press
conference on Capitol Hill Tuesday, where a report entitled "Small
Business Success Stories in China" was released to highlight the
importance of continued normal trade with that most populous
country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was not alone in pushing for more
business with China. The Business Roundtable (BRT), an association
of some 200 chief executive officers of leading U.S. corporations
employing over 10 million people, launched months ago a trade
education campaign designed to promote free global trade.
</P>
<P>
The BRT ad features two toddlers - one American, one Chinese -
with an emphasis on building bridges between people, cultures and
countries to ensure the social, political and economic welfare of
future generations.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton signed Wednesday into law a bill which
changed the Most-Favored Nation (MFN) trade status into Normal
Trade Relations (NTR), ending decades of debate over whether China
should enjoy the MFN that almost all U.S. trade partners do.
</P>
<P>
"NTR is the key to continued constructive engagement with China
because it will advance important U.S. national security, foreign
policy and economic interests," said Dana G. Mead, chairman and
chief executive officer of Tenneco and chairman of the BRT.
</P>
<P>
Ranking Democratic House Representative Lee Humilton expressed
the same belief during Wednesday's debate. The strong advocate of
normal trade relations with China warned that revoking China's NTR is
equal to declaring war against that country.
</P>
<P>
Critics at the House voiced concern about the human rights
conditions in China and the trade imbalance between the two
countries. They said the Clinton Administration's China policy
of engagement had failed and a new one is needed to advance the
American interest.
</P>
<P>
However, proponents believe that isolation or containment of
China could lead nowhere but push the one-fourth of the world
total population away from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
American business, eager to see normal trade relations with
China continue, may be fully aware that more uphill fights must be
fought before a permanent solution to the problem can be found.
President Clinton and business have vowed to strive for that
goal.

<HEADLINE> China, Trinidad and Tobago Pledge to Strengthen Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago, July 22 (Xinhua) --
Visiting Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen and leaders of Trinidad
and Tobago pledged on Wednesday to strengthen the friendly and
cooperative relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Qian at the President's Office, Acting President Ganace
Ramdial expressed satisfaction with the development of
bilateral relations and promised to continue to strengthen them, a
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Ramdial highly praised the cooperation between his country and
China in all fields, believing that such cooperation will be
consolidated through joint efforts of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Qian, in reply, said that the Chinese government praised the
constant efforts Trinidad and Tobago made in safeguarding its
independence and sovereignty and economic development in the past
30 years since independence.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that strengthening the cooperation between China
and Trinidad and Tobago is in the basic interests of both peoples
and the future for such cooperation looks bright.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is willing to work with Trinidad and
Tobago to ensure a stable, full-wing and sustained development of
the relations," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Ramdial, Qian discussed bilateral
relations and international affairs with Prime Minister Basdeo
Panday.
</P>
<P>
Panday, expressing his gratitude to China for the economic,
technological and other assistance, said he hopes the cooperation
in all fields including economic and trade links will be promoted.
</P>
<P>
Qian told Panday that the Chinese government is willing to
construct a long-term stable cooperative relationship with
Trinidad and Tobago in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Panday reiterated that Trinidad and Tobago will continue to
uphold the one-China policy while the Chinese vice premier
expressed his appreciation for it.
</P>
<P>
Panday and Qian also discussed international affairs and
reached common views on a wide range of important issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of bilateral trade and economic relations, Qian said
the two sides are searching for new ways and areas for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi
and Foreign Minister Ralph Maraj of Trinidad and Tobago signed the
Exchange of Letters for Grant of 2 million rmb yuan (about 240,000
U.S. dollars) for supply of goods and other projects agreed upon
by the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Trinidad and Tobago, which is a member of the
British Commonwealth of Nations, and China reached 10.8 million
dollars in 1997, an 15.2 percent increase from 1996. The two
countries established diplomatic relations in June 1974.
</P>
<P>
Qian arrived here on Tuesday from Georgetown after a two-day
visit to Guyana. He is expected to leave Trinidad and Tobago on
Thursday for Havana, Cuba.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The consumption of food in Venezuela
has fallen between 5-10 percent in the last 45 days because of
lower earnings by the people and their loss of purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Milk and its bi-products, rice, flour, corn and meat are the
products most effected by inflation, the Venezuelan Chamber of
Food and Industry said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government is taking fiscal emergency measures to attempt
to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The food industry will also attempt to assist by conducting
sales and promotions at supermarkets and other outlets, while
reducing production expenses that increase inflation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Exempt Batam Island From Value Added </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian president B.J. Habibie
will exempt Batam island from value added and luxury taxes in a
bid to boost investment in the special industrial zone, local
press Thursday quoted an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
After reporting to Habibie here on Wednesday, Head of Batam
Development Authority Ismeth Abdullah told reporters that the
planned tax exemptions were intended to help turn Batam island,
which is located 15 kilometers south of Singapore, into a more
attractive industrial site for investors.
</P>
<P>
"It has now been agreed to abolish value added and luxury taxes
so that the island can become a true industrial zone," he added.
</P>
<P>
The island earned the nation 4.5 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign exchange last year and employed a work force of 135,000
people.
</P>
<P>
However, the reintroduction of value added and luxury taxes by
the finance minister in March had made locating on Batam island a
much less attractive proposition for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Minister of Investment Hamzah Haz told
reporters on Tuesday that his office had cut some of the
bureaucratic procedures that foreign investors must go through to
invest in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign investors are no longer required to get a
principal licence from the governor of the province in which they
plan to locate.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, investors will no longer be forced to locate in
designated industrial estates. From now on they are free to choose
where to build their plants.
</P>
<P>
And most importantly, Hamzah Haz said, the government would
grant 10 year tax holidays to foreign investments which met
certain criteria.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes US House Vote on Normal Trade Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China today welcomed the
U.S. House of Representatives' approval Wednesday of President
Bill Clinton's decision to maintain normal trade with China.
</P>
<P>
"The approval is a wise decision and will be conducive to the
advancement of the China-US trade relations," Hu Zhaoqing,
spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, told Xinhua via telephone.
</P>
<P>
The voting took place Wednesday after long hours of heated
debate and Clinton's decision was endorsed by a vote of 264 to 166.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the voting, President Clinton signed into law a
bill on reforms in the Internal Revenue Service which quietly
changed the term MFN (Most Favored Nation) to NTR (Normal Trade
Relations).
</P>
<P>
On June 3, Clinton notified Congress that he had decided to
extend China's MFN trading status for another year.
</P>
<P>
Congress has taken up China's MFN annually since 1980 for
debate but never succeeded in revoting the status for China. This
Wednesday voting showed that some congressmen have changed their
minds to back Clinton.

WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The attorney for Betty Currie,
U.S. President Bill Clinton's personal secretary, said Wednesday
she apparently has completed her grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
With Currie standing behind him, attorney Lawrence Wechsler
said his client has been given no date to return to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
"We believe Mrs. Currie has completed her grand jury
testimony," he said. "Mrs. Currie is happy to have this experience
behind her and she looks forward to returning to work."
</P>
<P>
Currie was the first witness to testify in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation on January 27. She made her fifth appearance
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors now can compare her testimony in key areas to that
of Secret Service officers testifying under court order, and to
Pentagon employee Linda Tripp, whose tape recordings of former
White House intern Lewinsky's telephone conversations triggered
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
A CBS News poll released Wednesday shows Americans remain
unenthused about the investigation. Only 20 percent of the 979
adults surveyed said Clinton should say more about the Lewinsky
matter, and 47 percent said they would be satisfied if Clinton
never saids another word about the charges.
</P>

The poll was conducted by telephone July 19-21 and has a margin
of error of plus or minus three percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Direct Sale Firm Shifts to Launch Retail Outlets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- AMWAY (China) Co, one of the
country's biggest direct sales companies, has been approved to
restart its business by changing sales means after a nearly
three-month suspension.
</P>
<P>
"We will shift the company's traditional sale means to open
retail outlets and conduct whole-sale business, in accordance with
the revised plan of operation approved by the Chinese Government,"
Audie Wong, vice-president of Amway China, said at a press
conference held here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The State Council late April banned all direct selling in
China, saying that consumers in the domestic market are not mature
enough for direct selling. Criminals and cultists were said to use
the cover of travelling salesmen to bilk people, spread
superstition and carry out illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign-funded direct sales enterprises have started their
sales restructuring in responding to the circular encouraging
those firms to shift their sales means, jointly issued by the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and The State
Administration for Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Wong said the company's sale representatives must sell the
products to customers at a fixed price. Previously, company sales
persons resold the products to earn a price spread.
</P>
<P>
The company's existing product distribution centers located in
China's 36 cities will be made into Amway stores.
</P>
<P>
Amway has a registered capital of around 80 million U.S.dollars
in China and a 58,000-square-meter factory in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The shifts of sales means for the foreign-funded firms are
expected to be finished by the end of October, 1998, according to
the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.

</P>
<P>
Dini briefed Mihailova on his recent diplomatic moves designed

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Wins Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government, led by Romano
Prodi, won a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies (the
lower house) on Wednesday. The vote was 324 for and 269 against.
</P>
<P>
The Senate's (upper house) vote of confidence for the
government came on Tuesday; it was 176 to 119.
</P>
<P>
Prodi agreed to submit to a review of his government's policy
after the Communist Refoundation refused last month to vote for
NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Prodi asked for parties in the coalition to
give their "strong backing" for the government's long-term reform
plans, which would give priority to the economically depressed
south. He also promised to invest 36 trillion lira (20 billion
U.S. dollars) in the south where the unemployment rate is high.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford the luxury of a weak, short-term government.
We can't allow political instability, makeshift decisions and
eternal postponements," he told the lower house.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's vote, the Communist Refoundation backed Prodi's
government.
</P>
<P>
But the Refoundation's party leader, Fausto Bertinotti, said
his party had voted what he has termed "critical confidence" in
the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
He said the 1999 budget, due to be unveiled in September, would
be "a real test" for Prodi's reform plans.
</P>
<P>
He said the party's continued support depended on whether the
next budget provided enough funds for the creation of more jobs
and investment in the depressed south.

LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Serhiy Rebrov found net four times
to give Dynamo Kiev an 8-0 thrash of Welsh titlists Barry on
Wednesday in the Champions Cup first qualifying round, first leg
in Kiev, Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Kiev, who reached quarterfinals last season, showed their
overwhelming domination as they led the first half 4-0.
</P>
<P>
The two met at the same qualifying stage last season when Kiev
won 6-0 on aggregate.
</P>

The Scottish champions Glasgow Celtic came across a big trouble
as they were held a goalless draw at home by the semi-pro Irish
club, St. Patrick's Athletic.
</P>
<P>
In the UEFA Cup, Glasgow Rangers were more lucky as they came
back from three goals deficit to win 5-3 over Irish Shelbourne.
</P>
<P>
The Rangers scored their five goals in just over half an hour
as both Jorg Albertz and Gabriel Amato scored twice, while
Giovanni van Bronkhorst added the other.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel
Wednesday appointed a new minority government, completing a power
shift to the left for the first time since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen ministers, 18 of them from Milos Zeman's Social
Democratics (CSSD), were sworn in a ceremony held at the Prague
Castle after CSSD won 74 seats in the 200-seat Chamber of Deputies
in the elections last month.
</P>
<P>
Zeman was named by Havel on July 17 to head the cabinet, which
is consisted of one prime minister, four deputy prime ministers,
one of them also holding a ministerial post, and 15 ministers.
</P>
<P>
The only non-CSSD member is Justice Minister Otakar Motejl,
also chairing the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The new government is expected to survive a vote of confidence
in the parliament on August 18.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal with Zeman, parliament speaker Vaclav Klaus, head
of Civic Democratic Party (ODS), will lead his 63 deputies out of
the chamber during the vote, thus ensuring the new government's
approval.
</P>
<P>
In return for its tacit support, the ODS will take the key post
-- chamber chairmanship, to be in a position to set the
government's legislative agenda.

<HEADLINE> Panamanian President: Negotiations Over CMA Very Difficult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 22 (Xinhua) -- President of Panama Ernesto
Perez Balladares said Wednesday that negotiations with the United
States over an Antidrug Multilateral Center (CMA) are very
difficult.
</P>
<P>
The position of the United States on CMA is understandable,
even if Panama does not share it, Balladares said in his weekly
address.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the CMA, Balladares said, should be basically to
fight drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
But the United States insists that it should be allowed to
perform other kind of activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Balladares stressed that Panama will not allow the
establishment of a foreign military base in its territory.
</P>
<P>
According to the Agreement of Torrijos-Carter of 1977, the
United States should close its last military site by December 31,
1999, and return full control of the Canal to Panama.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Panama proposed to establish a multilateral
drug-center by using facilities in the would-be extinct
U.S. military base.

<HEADLINE> Low Demand Forces Many Steel Plants to Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Low demand and higher production
costs have forced many Indonesian steel-related companies out of
business, the Jakarta Post Thursday quoted an industry executive
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most steel factories were now producing at less than 50 percent
of their normal capacity because most construction projects had
been halted since the monetary crisis started July last year,
Chairman of the Federation of Indonesian Steel Industries
(GAPBESI) Zainal Musa told members of the House of Representatives
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Some steel producers have reduced production and some
factories have even stopped all their production activities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The country's 12 producers of welded wire mesh under GAPBESI
had stopped producing. The 13 companies grouped in the Association
of the Iron Sheet Truncation in Indonesia were only utilizing 10
percent of their maximum capacity. The 15 local producers of steel
pipes in the country were only using 15 percent of their
production capacities.
</P>
<P>
Zainal told members of the House that the recent high increase
in electricity loan expense tariffs had further depressed the
steel industry.
</P>
<P>
The industry had experienced huge increases in power bills
since the government raised the load expense tariffs in May.
</P>
<P>
GAPBESI demanded no more tariff rises for at least four years
or the cancellation of the plan to raise the basic electricity
tariffs, he added.

<HEADLINE> Infant Deaths Drop in U.S. Thanks to Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The rate of sudden infant
death syndrome (SIDS) cases in the United States has been cut in
half over the past five years thanks to a public-health campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to the Journal of the American Medical Association
(JAMA), the 1992 "back to sleep" campaign, in which parents were
told to let babies sleep on their backs, has succeeded in curbing
infant deaths.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1996, the rate of SIDS dropped 38 percent;
preliminary 1997 data suggests the rate has fallen 56 percent
since 1992. About 3,200 deaths per year are attributed to SIDS,
down from 4,900 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Assessing the impact of the campaign, JAMA researchers link the
decline in SIDS to the fact that fewer infants are sleeping on
their stomachs, thus reducing the dangers of suffocation.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, parents used to place babies on their stomachs
on the assumption that they would sleep more soundly and not gag
if they regurgitated milk.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1996, annual federal surveys of parents found
that the proportion of parents putting babies to sleep on their
stomachs declined from 70 percent to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three studies in the journal also found that some
parents just ignored the advice on appropriate sleep
positioning. Mothers who favored face-down position were mostly
young, African-American or Hispanic.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Phosphorus Key to Healthy Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The ban on phosphorus has proved
to be an effective method of lowering the unchecked growth of
algae in lakes and rivers, according to a research group in
southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Lakes and rivers are becoming clogged with algae is a concern
worldwide, along with the problem of heavy metal pollution, said
senior engineer Zhang Mingshi, director of the Analysis and
Testing Center of Guizhou Teachers University.
</P>
<P>
The fast growth of algae in lakes and rivers is mainly brought
about by internal biological processes. However, the external
input of phosphorus and nitrogen into the waters will undoubtedly
speed up the process, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Tests and monitoring at Hongfeng Lake, the province's largest
artificial lake, show that high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen
by themselves will not stimulate sudden algae growth, but
discharges of these two elements into the lake in inappropriate
proportions will certainly lead to the overgrowth of algae.
</P>
<P>
What is worse, the discharges create large amounts of poisonous
materials. Tests show that two milligrams of such algae pulp
injected into white mice can cause death in 16 hours.
</P>
<P>
At this time, water in the lake remains clear despite the annual
average 1,400 tons of waste water discharged by a nearby chemical
fertilizer plant. Scientists attribute this to a lack of phosphorus
in the discharges.
</P>
<P>
"This is more evidence that the ban on phosphorus is the key to
healthier lakes and improved water quality,"  Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> New Drug Cleared for Treatment of Chinese Gymnast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Just hours after China's female gymnast Sang
Lan suffered a paralyzing spinal cord injury at the 1998 Goodwill Games here
yesterday, an experimental drug has been chosen as part of her treatment,
according to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
It was announced by Dr. Vincent Leone, the attending physician who treated
Sang upon her arrival at the Nassau County Medical Center trauma unit.
</P>
<P>
Sang Lan, a 17-year-old Chinese vaulting champion last year, apparently lost
control during a practice vault before last night's gymanstics competition at
the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. She landed head first on the surface and
was later diagnosed with a fracture-dislocation of the C-6 on C-7 veetebrae.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference today, hospital officials said that Sang has no
movement in her lower extremities.
</P>
<P>
Sygen, a synthetic protein designed for nerve damage and structural repair
in paralysis cases, has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for use in the United States, pending further clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Leone said that the extreme nature of Sang's case prompted the FDA to
allow Sygen as a treatment aid for her on a compassionate basis.
</P>
<P>
"Sygen has yet to prove completely successful, so I have an obligation to
the patient to remain skeptical," said Leone. "But we're willing to look at any
kind of treatment to help Sang Lan walk again."
</P>
<P>
The Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in New Jersey is currently using
Sygen in its acute and chronic paralysis cases. Kessler officials delivered a
supply of Sygen to Dr. Leone and Dr. Brock Schnebel, Chief Medical Officer for
the Goodwill Games, by helicopter later today.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Keep Ancient Villages From Disappearing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- When Sheng A'xiang moved out of
her hundred-year-old house today, she took a long look at the
carved beams and the faded paintings, but was not nearly as
reluctant to leave as she was the last time about half a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
The last time was to leave it to get away from the war, but
this time it's in order to save the house, the 79-year-old woman
explains, looking at the smoke-blackened beams.
</P>
<P>
In fact, she's moving into a new house over on the other side
of town. She lives in Longmen in Zhejiang Province, 300 kilometers
southwest of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Longmen was the home of Sun Quan, an emperor of the Wu Kingdom
(222-280) during the Three Kingdoms Period. It is now home to 427
of his descendants who live in old buildings that have been around
for hundreds of years. The whole village is dotted with pavilions
and surrounded by scenic hills and river.
</P>
<P>
"This region was very prosperous and highly developed in water
transportation in ancient times," according to Sun Beiqiang, a
descendant of Sun Quan, "but it went into decline when the
communications hub shifted in modern times. And, because it's hard
to get here, the village has maintained its ancient appearance."
</P>
<P>
However, most of the old buildings are in need of repair and in
recent years some valuable old buildings have disappeared when
wealthier farmers pulled them down and built new ones.
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, villagers reached an agreement about the
old buildings and decided to keep their original appearance and
develop tourism to help raise money to better protect the ancient
village.
</P>
<P>
This year, farmers have contributed more than 10,000 yuan
(1,200 U.S. dollars) and have renovated 5 old buildings, and has
had at least 10,000 tourists.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Keep Ancient Villages From Disappearing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are many similar villages scattered throughout some
inaccessible mountainous parts of China that lived through the
Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911), and a few left over from the
Song Dynasty (960-1279).
</P>
<P>
These ancient villages reflect a harmony between man and nature
and many contain folk relics and works of art from an earlier age.
</P>
<P>
After China had some initial success in preserving about 100
historic cities, many old villages like Longmen began to attract
the attention of Chinese academics and government figures.
</P>
<P>
Some specialists have pointed out that an alarming number of
ancient villages have lost their uniqueness or have been destroyed
by social development and a blending of different cultures and say
that studies of these ancient villages and preservation should be
a part of development. They warn that if they are not protected, a
third of them could easily be gone for good within ten years.
</P>
<P>
A State Cultural Relics Bureau official says that they are
taking a closer look at these villages and residences that have
great cultural and artistic value and protection laws and
regulations are expected to be worked out in the near future.
</P>
<P>
China's first local law on protecting traditional residences
took effect in Anhui Province on January 1 this year and cultural
relics departments have purchased the 200-year-old village of
Dingcun in Shanxi Province and have moved the villagers into newer
housing. Dingcun has become a museum of folk customs.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese farmers have also had their consciousness raised
and have come to see that these beautiful sights, the ancient
villages and their historic legacy are their unique property. So,
the practice of preserving these ancient villages with money
generated by tourism has begun to spread.

<HEADLINE> Residents Around Indonesia's Merapi Volcano Suffer From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- People living on the slopes of Mt.
Merapi in Central Java, Indonesia, are suffering from eye disease,
cough, diarrhea and respiratory disorders after the volcano
erupted on July 11, reports reaching here Thursday from Magelang
district, near Merapi, said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Edy Suharso, chief of the public health service center in
Dukun sub-district was quoted as saying on Wednesday that the
number of patients treated at the center continued to increase
over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
on average 25 patients came to the center each day compared to
15 before the volcano erupted two weeks ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 126 patients, most of them with eye disease, cough,
diarrhea and respiratory disorders have received medical
treatment, while 30 others have not, he added.
</P>
<P>
Suharso regretted that the number of masks provided by the
Central Java administration was much less than expected. "We have
asked for 7,000 masks but only 1,000 were given," he said.
</P>
<P>
The activity of Mt. Merapi, Indonesia's most active volcano,
entered a critical phase on Sunday (July 19), forcing 6,000
residents fled to safer areas.
</P>
<P>
The volcano spewed hot clouds to the west as far as 8,000
meters from its crater, reports said.
</P>
<P>
No casualty has been reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior official, who visited the affected areas on
Wednesday, said the government will continue to provide aid for
victims of the recent eruption of Merapi.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare Haryono Suyono said
in Semarang, Central Java, that the victims who badly needed aid
were those who were evacuated from their home villages.
</P>
<P>
Central Java Governor Soewardi also said his administration had
sent food and other necessaries to 6,000 evacuees.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that most of the 6,000 evacuees had returned
to their homes as from last Monday as the Merapi showed no
dangerous activities.
</P>
<P>
However, the local administration has called on them to always
be on the alert because the behavior of the volcano was
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Merapi, 2,968-meter high, last erupted in November 1994,
killing at least 60 people, prompting the evacuation of more than
8,000 people from nearby villages.

SHANGHAI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The tele-conference has become a
popular way of doing business in Shanghai, where 104
tele-conferences were held in the first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Shanghai's Long-Distance Telecommunications
Office, that means one for each working day on average and
the numbers have been increasing over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The office says that the first users were Communist Party and
government offices because of the rapidity with which central
government documents can be sent to provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
But now, more companies are holding tele-conferences
domestically and internationally.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. Squibb Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. has held several
global tele-symposiums since the beginning of 1997, with people
from the U.S., Britain, Australia, and some Southeast Asian
countries exchanging ideas with their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
So, the Shanghai Long-Distance Telecommunications Office is now
focusing on marketing the idea regionally.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Travel Agencies Get Debt Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven Chinese tourist
enterprises have received more than 30 million Japanese yen
(214,000 U.S. dollars) in payment for debts incurred by Japan's
Kansai Travel Agency, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although the sum paid was a small portion of the total debt
kept by the travel agency, which went bankrupt in early 1997, the
result was deemed satisfactory because it was a difficult case.
</P>
<P>
"China's travel agencies should draw a lesson from the loss and
stick to the 'paying first' principle in their future dealings
with foreign travel agencies," said Zhang Xilong, an official in
charge of the Asian and Pacific markets of the International
Market Promotion Department of the China National Tourism
Administration (CNTA).
</P>
<P>
In early 1997, Kansai Travel Agency announced its bankruptcy
with debts of more than 300 million yen, more than 200 million yen
of which were owed to 54 Chinese travel agencies or hotels.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven Chinese enterprises claimed Kansai agency owed
them 120 million yen. The remaining Chinese enterprises either
gave up or sought independent settlements.
</P>
<P>
Although the Japanese agency refused to co-operate in settling
claims, the Japan Association of Travel Agents, an entity
supervising the performance of travel agencies, held about 70
million yen in guaranty bonds submitted by the agency.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Sugar Output, Exports to decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's sugar production and
exports are expected to decline in the next two years due to
financing problems and drought, according to the Federation of
Thai Sugar Cane Planters.
</P>
<P>
Shipments are likely to drop from 3.7 million tons last year
to 2.5 million tons this year, and 2.3 million tons next year, the
federation estimated.
</P>
<P>
Sugar production would decline from five million tons last
year to 4.2 million tons this year and four million tons next
year.
</P>
<P>
Output could fall further if the industry was unable to get
financing, Theerachai Seankaew, secretary general of the
federation, was quoted Thursday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
the industry needed at least 50 billion baht (1.2 billion U.S.
dollars) in credit to support growers for the next harvest.
</P>
<P>
the federation said exports of sugar in the first half of this
year totaled 1.72 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is one of the major sugar exporters in the Would.

<HEADLINE> Rios Advances in Stuttgart Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Marcelo Rios won in straight
sets on Wednesday to avoid the rash of upsets that swept the
Stuttgart tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Rios, who would pass Pete Sampras at the ATP rankings if he
reaches the final, defeated Germany's Jens Knippschild, 7-6 (7-5),
6-2 in the second round of the 1.04 million US dollars tournament.
</P>
<P>
Also advancing was German Boris Becker who beat France's Cedric
Pioline 7-6 (7-5), 6-1 in his bid to claim a clay court title
after six aborted attempts.
</P>
<P>
Becker, 30, came close two weeks ago at the Swiss Open, said "I
can't reach the same level as on hard courts or grass. I always
come up one match short."
</P>
<P>
However, the three-time Wimbledon winner proved he's still has
the form against Pioline, ranked 20th. After slamming an ace to
decide the first set, he rolled to victory in one hour 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Former French Open winners Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia and
Thomas Muster were among the victims of seeds. But Carlos Moya,
the current champion at Roland Garros, breezed over fellow
Spaniard Julian Alonso 7-6 (8-6), 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Czech Bohdan Ulihrach ousted fourth-seeded Kafelnikov 6-3, 3-6,
6-3 while France's Fernando Vicente downed 10th-seeded Muster 6-3,
6-7 (7-5), 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Rios, who jumped to the world top ranking for a brief period
this spring, survived an early break in the first set as the
German charged the net and slammed winners all over the court.
</P>
<P>
But Rios took control of the match after Knippschild let a 4-1
lead slip away in the tiebreak, then capped a string of errors by
hitting a double fault at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
France's Guillaume Raoux swept past No. 8 seed Alberto
Berasategui of Spain 6-1, 6-2, Spain's Albert Portas edged No. 12
Fabrice Santoro of France 1-6, 6-2, 7-6 (9-7) and Germany's
Hendrik Dreekmann upset No. 15 Magnus Larsson of Sweden 6-4, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Albert Costa of Spain, the No. 6 seed, also advanced by rolling
past Argentina's Franco Squillari 6-3, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Considering Investing in Highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese goverment is
considering further increasing investment in highway construction
as part of its effort to bolster the country's economic growth,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, some 46.5 billion yuan, or 29 percent of
the 160 billion yuan originally earmarked for highway projects,
had been used, a Communications Ministry spokesman told a press
conference in Beijing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yongguang, the spokesman, said that the proportion of the
investment completed is basically satisfactory, because, based on
past experience, an average of 30 percent of the annual investment
is used in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The State Council earlier this year decided to invest 160
billion yuan in highway construction, 40 billion more than the
previously planned figure.
</P>
<P>
Sixty billion yuan of the fund will come from banks. By the end
June, 31.3 billion yuan, or 53.5 percent of the money had already
been confirmed. The government is now considering a further
increase in the investment to support the construction of key
projects.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry source, prolonged rainy weather in
the past few months has caused significant damage to highways. The
ministry reports say that 36 bridges have been destroyed
completely and 210 damaged. In Hunan, Fujian, Jiangxi, and
Zhejiang provinces alone, about 730 million yuan has been lost in
consequence of highway damage caused by floodwater.

<HEADLINE> US Firms Doing Well in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Three-quarters of the investors
from the United States in China have passed their payout period,
and are generally turning a profit, today's China Daily quoted a
survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (Moftec), covered more than 50 US companies
operating in large cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Qingdao, Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, China had attracted 17.5 billion US dollars
of investment from US firms, making the United States China's
second largest source of direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The US investment has reached almost every major industry of
the country, with that in the service sector especially impressive.
</P>
<P>
Moftec officials said that American companies win the trust of
Chinese customers because of their use of the latest technology
and advanced equipment and products they have brought to China.
</P>
<P>
The US investors are also good examples of abiding by China's
law and regulations, and contributing to China's society.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that since the 1980s, the IBM company has
contributed five million US dollars worth of PCs to the State
Education Commission (now Ministry of Education) and to dozens of
universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Moftec believe that the investment of American
companies has contributed much to easing China's domestic funds
shortage, upgrading its management level and gearing its
production and consumption closer to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
American companies in China have created a great number of job
opportunities. The 35 largest American companies throughout China
employ from 1,000 to 9,000 Chinese people each.

<HEADLINE> Floyd to Coach Chicago Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls has found a
new coach Tim Floyd, whom superstar Michael Jordan said earlier he
wouldn't play for, local TV said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Floyd will show up in a news conference on Thursday, and he is
coming to Bulls as coach, ESPN said.
</P>
<P>
However, another source said Floyd will be named director of
basketball operations, with the coach to be determined later, and
the Bulls also declined to confirm Floyd's hiring.
</P>
<P>
Floyd arrived in Chicago on Wednesday morning, a few hours
after resigning at Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
"I really can't comment any further right now," Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
As the Bulls' coach-in-waiting the past two years, Floyd's
hiring hardly comes as a surprise. But Jordan's dislike of Floyd
is no secret, either, saying just last week that he wouldn't play
for him.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know Tim. I don't have anything against Tim Floyd,"
Jordan said on July 16, "To (play for him) is like starting all
over again and that's what I don't want to do. He may want to do
that, but I don't."
</P>
<P>
Jordan did not react publicly to news of Floyd's hiring.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Expert Urges Government to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian expert urged the
government to improve marine resource management to ensure optimum
benefits for local people and reduce exploitation by "stronger
parties", the Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cliff Marlessy of the Indonesian Biodiversity Foundation
believed that applying reform in marine resource management should
start with better laws governing the sector.
</P>
<P>
"Several regulations must be reviewed in order to give back to
the people their rights (over marine resources) and to reinstate
their (traditional) roles," Marlessy said on the sidelines of a
discussion on reform in the marine sector here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He cited a 1979 law on village administration which displaced
the indigenous people's environmentally friendly traditional coral
reef management in the country's northeast province of Maluku, in
which local people manage, conserve and harvest from nature.
</P>
<P>
The law gave village administrators the authority to grant
concessions to private companies to exploit coral reefs, often
leading to damage.
</P>
<P>
"(In this era of reform), let the people get their rights back
and play their roles (in marine management)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gayatri Lilley of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
recommended the establishment of a special ministry or agency
under the title "Ministry/Agency for Marine Affairs" to minimize
frequently reported conflicts of interest between existing
government ministries.
</P>
<P>
Among the new agency's main tasks would be to initiate policies
on marine resource management and review and establish regulations
and laws regarding marine management, he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the world's eighth largest fish producer with sea
spanning 5.8 million hectares and an estimated 6.7 million tons of
annual fish production.
</P>
<P>
Some people argue the industry provides more benefits to big
companies rather than local people. "To some extent, it has even
impoverished local people," Marlessy said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government to Keep Tariff Cut Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will keep
the country's schedule of import tariff cuts on track,
particularly those on the automotive and home appliance
industries, a newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Felipe Medalla, chief of the National Economic and Development
Authority (NEDA), was quoted as saying the Philippines will not
back down from the 2003 deadline imposed by the ASEAN Free Trade
Area (AFTA) agreement on tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
But tariff barriers on some products may be adjusted before the
AFTA is put into place by the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), said Medalla, quoted by the newspaper "Today".
</P>
<P>
"That a reduction of some tariffs may be reconsidered is true.
But not all tariffed commodities deserve a slowdown in reduction,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Medalla clarified the government's position on economic
liberalization in reaction to proposals from the private sector
for a one-year freeze on tariff reductions.
</P>
<P>
Medalla, who is also socio-economic planning secretary,
reiterated his previous stance opposing delays in the scheduling
of tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
But he said the government was looking into the private
sector's suggestion that would allow some industries to catch up
in light of the economic slowdown hurting many companies.
</P>
<P>
Medalla, however, maintained that the government will not slow
down on the liberalization of commodities where tariffs are
already high, such as cars and home appliances.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Seeking Open Market Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is "seeking open
market access and deep cuts in tariffs, and seeking the
elimination and prohibition of export subsidies," NZ Minister for
Agriculture and International Trade Lockwood Smith said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national agricultural industry conference, which
started here this morning, Smith noted that trade restrictions
imposed by the United States, Japan and the European Union have
created great difficulties for the exports of New Zealand's meat,
wool and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
He said that for NZ exports, "primary one is our lack of market
access." Because of trade restrictions, he added, New Zealand, one
of the major meat, wool and dairy producers in the world, has
"access to only half a percent" of the U.S. butter and cheese
markets.
</P>
<P>
"We are almost completely cut out of the Japanese butter market
because of out-of-quota tariffs of 600 percent," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the EU butter market, Smith said that the EU takes
"such a large chunk of the 500 million NZ dollars (260 million
U.S. dollars) in tariffs that the New Zealand Dairy Board pays
each year before it can start to sell anything in those tariff
markets.
</P>
<P>
"For the EU high-quality beef market, we have quota access for
300 tones. That is not much more than I produce on my own farm. If
we want to export any high quality beef above that 300 tones, we
face tariffs which make it uneconomic."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Canadian butter market, Smith said that the
only organization New Zealand can sell to is the Canadian Dairy
Commission. "the Canadian Dairy Commission marks the butter up 60
percent before on-selling it. That means that the Canadian Dairy
Commission gets more than one third of the value of our butter,
for merely passing it along to the next person in the value
chain."
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand cannot fully benefit from marketing many of our
key export products" in North America, Japan and the EU, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley told in
Auckland the American Chamber of Commerce in New Zealand, that
tariff barriers to some of New Zealand's exports, notably dairy
products, and the continued use of export subsidies in the United
States, "cause us some frustration."

<HEADLINE> Maradona Wants to Coach Argentina's National Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Diego Maradona said on
Wednesday that he has the know-how in the sport of soccer and want
to take the helm of the Argentina's national squad.
</P>
<P>
"I feel I have the experience and know-how to coach the
national team. The truth is I'm dying to coach the team, but it's
a question of the directors," he said, referring to the Argentine
Football Association (AFA).
</P>
<P>
However, the four-time World Cup star who said he would have
taken the job minutes after Argentina was defeated by the
Netherlands in the quarterfinals of the World Cup finals, still
awaited a meeting with AFA's president Julio Grondona.
</P>
<P>
Coach Daniel Passarella resigned just after the World Cup and
local media reports indicated Jose Pekerman, coach of the
Argentina's youth team, is the leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
Maradona retired from football last year, but has tried many
times to get back into the game. And earlier this year, he even
explored the possibility of serving as player/coach for an
Argentine second division team.

<HEADLINE> New Pollution Control Technology In Eastern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The city of Zibo in east China's
Shandong Province has applied new technology to pollution controls
for better environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Zibo, one of the province's major industrial centers, has
building materials, chemical, metallurgical, power, and coal
industries whose output was worth 48 billion yuan (6 billion
U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Its concentrated industrial production has wreaked havoc with
the city's environment, and the waste water, dust, and automobile
emissions are a haunting reminder of this to residents who
complain frequently to the city government.
</P>
<P>
The city has spent a large amount of money on new environmental
protection research since 1993, and has applied some of the
research findings.
</P>
<P>
New technology has been developed to deal with the waste water,
and new dust treatment methods have helped 112 cement producers
improve discharge levels, cutting the amount of dust by 90,000
tons each year.
</P>
<P>
New ways have been found to re-cycle waste materials to produce
various products.

WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Jim Courier survived the heat
to beat Marcos Ondruska of South Africa, winning his second round
match of the Legg Mason Classic tennis tournament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The seventh-seeded American, who helped the United States to
win over Belgium last weekend in the Davis Cup, outwitted the
South African twice in the tiebreakers 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (8-6) in the
afternoon's sweltering heat.
</P>

However, Wade McGuire, victim of the heat who was hospitalized
for six hours Tuesday night, was unable to resume the first-round
tie against Jimmy Arias on Wednesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Establish Commission on Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Wednesday agreed to the establishment of the National Commission
on Violence against Women and called for a thorough investigation
into the recent cases of rape that took place last May.
</P>
<P>
"This commission is very important for the continuation of our
national culture. It will also search for those who planned,
executed and engineered these criminal actions and make them
responsible to the law," Habibie was quoted by local press
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Several women's groups and non governmental organizations have
said more than 160 women were raped during mass riots in Jakarta
and other cities in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
"We will not tolerate a repetition of such crimes in Indonesia.
I order the armed forces chief to fight such criminals," Habibie
added.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be chaired by Saparinah Sadli, a member of
the National Commission on Human Rights. Habibie also appointed
the Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs to
assist in the formation of the commission.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Habibie, Sadli said that the commission is an
independent one and will report directly to the president.
</P>
<P>
The commission will also be empowered to report all findings to
the public in a transparent manner, she added.
</P>
<P>
From May 13 to 15, Indonesia saw the worst looting and rioting
in decades in Jakarta, Medan and Solo. More than 1,000 lives were
claimed, and thousands of buildings and vehicles were damaged.
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups have said the violence was organized,
systematic and targeted specifically at women of ethnic Chinese
origin.

<HEADLINE> China Initiates New Grain Allocation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China has a new national grain
allocation system, replacing the decades-old state mandatory plan
with contracts among the various local governments.
</P>
<P>
This shows that both grain growers and buyers have come to
realize they should rely on the market and contracts to adjust the
grain supply among the various regions, said Sun Hongling, a
professor at the Zhengzhou Grain Institute.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi, Hubei and Hunan Provinces, the country's leading paddy
rice growers, have combined their efforts with Guangdong Province
and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, two major rice buyers,
to work out a regional grain purchasing plan.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed recently by Hubei and
Guangdong Provinces, Hubei will sell one billion kilograms of
grain a year, a quarter of its annual marketable output, to
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the four leading maize producers in north and
northeast China, Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin Provinces
and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, unified the minimum grain
purchasing price for the region at a joint meeting held this month.
</P>
<P>
The annual output of these four grain bases accounts for
one-sixth of the national total. And the total amount of maize
stored in the four areas makes up three-fourths of China's total.
Jiangxi, Hubei and Hunan Provinces provide 6.5 billion kilograms
of surplus grain to other parts of China annually.
</P>
<P>
However, these grain bases have long been faced with a common
problem. They had to store all their harvested grain when normally
grain-short areas were reluctant to buy grain in bumper years, and
sell their grain to them later at a state-set low price in
poor-harvest years. In this way, the state incurred economic losses
of 100 billion yuan over the past seven years by subsidizing grain
allocation.
</P>
<P>
During the ongoing reform of the grain-marketing system, grain
growing and buying areas have readjusted the relationship of their
interests and conducted trans-regional grain trading in accordance
with contracts.

<HEADLINE> Paralyzed Sang Shows Courage After Tragic Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China's female gymnast Sang Lan
showed her courage after fracturing a bone in her neck during
warm-ups for the women's vault yesterday, but the 17-year-old
paralyzed girl is obviously frightened.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference early today, Michael Plant, president of
the 1998 Goodwill Games, said they had contacted Sang's parents,
and both governments are involved to help her parents arrive here
by Friday.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Vincent Leone, a physician of Nassau County Medical
Center, said this morning: "She was very brave and courageous. She
never complained of being in discomfort. I guess the only word I
would use is courageous."
</P>
<P>
The doctor said: "We just examined her about 30 minutes ago.
This is a very tragic type of injury. It's a very unstable injury,
it's unpredictable, so for us to make a comment about her
prognosis in the face of this unpredictability is difficult."
</P>
<P>
Sang, China's vaulting champion last year, landed on her head
after losing control following a forward vault.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Gulotta, Nassau County Executive, told the press: "I was
able to spend time with her this morning, and I would first like
to say that Sang Lan is an incredibly courageous and brave young
lady. She is obviously very frightened. She is a gymnast and she
understands the seriousness of the injury.
</P>
<P>
"She is an incredible young lady who is prepared to fight this
through to victory. I assured her that everything that can be done
is being done and she has and will continue to receive the very
finest in medical care."
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred shortly before 7:00 p.m. yesterday. The
call was received by the medical center at 7:04. The patient
arrived at the medical center within 12 minutes, at 7:16.
</P>
<P>
The Emergency Medical Technicians and the doctors fo the
Goodwill Games initially tended her at the scene. Ultimately, the
Woodmere Fire Department transported her to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Leone, an orthopedic spine surgeon, said: "the pattern of
spinal injury that she has incurred is the incomplete injury, mea
ning that certain parts of te spinal cord work, certain parts of
the spinal cord do not. That is certainly a better condition than
to have a complete injury to the spinal cord where you have
immediate and permanent paralysis.
</P>
<P>
"So we are not trying to be evasive, we are trying to relate to
you as accurately as we can her current condition which is still
guarded and we expect her to make some improvements, the extent of
which we cannot really comment on."
</P>
<P>
Asked about what kind of treatment given to Sang, the doctor
said: "the medical director of our facility has made an emergency
application to the FDA to try to obtain neuorpeptides on a
compassionate basis. We have up to 72 hours to start it, and so we
are continuing the steoid trauma protocol currently."
</P>
<P>
Plant told the press that Ted Turner and Gerry Levin called him
personally this morning to express their concern and reaffirmed
that the support is there to help Sang Lan and her family.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there will be an outpouring of support - cards, le
tters - please send those to the medical center. This collective
effort will help to get her to the next level."
</P>
<P>
The president also said: "We have several levels of insurance
that are part of this tragedy that will take care of her immediate
medical needs. I can't speak to the long-term, but it is our
commitment to do what we can. We have a lot of insurance that will
provide adequate care for Sang Lan."
</P>
<P>
Tu Mingde, Secretary General of the Chinese Olympic Committee,
claimed: "We feel awfully scared and sorrowful over this accident,
but fortunately the Organizing Committee and our American friends
gave a quick response and quick medical treatment to our young
athlete Sang Lan. "
</P>
<P>
It was told that Sang Lan left the vaulting board and her body
was turning over. Her plan was to put her hands on the horse, turn
over and land on her feet, but she went a little bit past her feet
and hit her head on the mat.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a highly difficult vault, it was not a difficult
maneuver. It was a mistake," said Peter Kormann, U.S. gymnastics
team coordinator.
</P>
<P>
What Gulotta said at the press conference touched everyone's
heart. "She is going to turn this terrible tragedy into a victory
in her own life because she will overcome. I ask everyone to keep
her in their prayers."

CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian federal government Wednesday dumped a core
plank of its budget strategy by retaining majority public
ownership of telecommunications giant Telstra while the coming
federal election was under the pressure from the coalition partner
Australian National Party.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Relief authorities have sent shooting parties into the
tsunami-ravaged West Sepik coastline in Papua New Guinea to kill
abandoned dogs and pigs which have begun digging up bodies of
victims, as concern mounted about a serious disease risk.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- It's hard to find a coalition MP who believes Prime Minister
John Howard is an asset to the Australian federal government and
many voters around the country describe the prime minister as
spineless, weak, indecisive and bland.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Construction of Melbourne's 1.32 billion U.S. dollar City
Link road project is set to shut down due to a bitter contractual
dispute between its main contractors.

<HEADLINE> After Dolly, Here Come Cloned Mice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- An international team has produced
50 cloned mice using the similar technique that led to the birth
of Dolly the sheep, the BBC reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Their research, to be published in the British scientific
journal Nature on Thursday, is the most important step in genetic
engineering since the birth in 1996 of Dolly, the first mammal
cloned from adult, the BBC said.
</P>
<P>
Their work will appear in Nature along with two other genetic
studies intended to prove that Dolly the sheep is indeed a clone
from an adult animal.
</P>
<P>
"These are exciting results. They suggest that it will be
possible to produce adult clones from a range of different cell
types and species." Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute, who cloned
Dolly, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The team, led by Ryuzo Yanagimachi of the University of Hawaii
in Honolulu, has made three generations of clones and now has 50
mice that are all genetically identical.
</P>
<P>
The first of them, a little brown mouse named Cumulina, was
born on 3 October 1997. However, its birth was kept a secret.
</P>
<P>
The cloned mice were created with the so-called cumulus,
tissues surrounding egg cells that provide nourishment.
</P>
<P>
Researchers extracted the genetic material from the cumulus
cells and this was then transplanted into another mouse cells from
which the original genetic material had been moved.
</P>
<P>
This technique is a little more straighforward than the one
that produced Dolly. Researhers said that it might be easier to
apply to cattle, pigs and other animals.
</P>
<P>
However, the efficiency of the technique is still very low,
with only 2 percent of the cloned embryos developed into healthy
mice.

<HEADLINE> Head of UN Relief Coordination for Iraq Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations relief
coordinator for Iraq, Denis Halliday, is leaving his post at the
end of September, his spokesman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Eric Falt, Halliday's spokesman, told reporters that Hallday's
dissatisfaction with the U.N. relief effort and the tough
sanctions program was probably among his reasons for leaving.
</P>
<P>
Halliday, of Ireland, replaced Staffan de Mistura, a Swede, in
September last year as the humanitarian coordinator in Iraq. He
has been trying to balance the needs of the Iraqi people affected
by the harsh sanctions imposed on Iraq by the Security Council eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Halliday was one of the strongest U.N. advocates of increasing
the amount of aid to Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
His lobbying efforts have helped the approval of the Security
Council to increase the amount of oil Iraq can sell over six
months to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars, up from 2 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with reporters in Baghdad in February, Halliday said
that he opposed the U.N. sanctions because of their "devastating
impact on the small people."

<HEADLINE> House Approves Decision on Normal Trade with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House of Representatives
approved by a big margin Wednesday President Bill Clinton's
decision to maintain normal trade with China.
</P>
<P>
Voting took place after long hours of heated debate and
Clinton's decision was endorsed by a vote of 264 to 166.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton notified Congress on June 3 that he had
decided to extend China's Most-Favored Nation (MFN) trading status
for another year. Critics tabled a resolution later to counter his
decision but failed to get it through the House.
</P>
<P>
Congress has taken up China's MFN annually since 1980 for
debate but never succeeded in revoting the status for China. This
Wednesday voting showed that some congressmen have changed their
mind to back President Clinton, with the fact that last year's
voting result was 259 to 175.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton gained the stronger support in spite of the
allegations that China tried to buy influence in American
elections and obtained sensative U.S. satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the House voted on his decision, President
Clinton signed into law a bill on reforms in the Internal Revenue
Service which quietly changed the term of MFN to NTR --Normal
Trade Relations.
</P>
<P>
Officials and businesses have repeatedly stressed that MFN is
nothing but normal trade relations. The U.S. has given the
trading status to all the world countries except six. However,
critics still oppose the continuation of normal trade with China.
</P>
<P>
Among supporters of Clinton's decision to extend for another
year China's access to the same low tariffs that almost all other
U.S. trade partners enjoy is ranking Democratic Representative
Lee Humilton, a strong advocate of normal trade relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
As the United States is cooperating with China on many
important issues, the suspension of normal trade ties with China
equals to a declaration of warfare against that most populous country,
Humilton said before voting.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the vote was not on trade with China but on
America's China policy of engagement, which he claimed has brought
about tremendous changes in China.
</P>
<P>
Philip Crane, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Subcommittee, expressed the belief that the continuation of normal
trade relations confirms to the American interest especially at a
critical time of financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Representative Tim Roemer said that the House debate should
focus on how to build a constructive relationship with China, a
country he believe would emerge as a world big power in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Critics insisted that the administration's policy of engagement
has failed to influence changes in China and now it is the right
time to send out a strong message to the Chinese leadership.
</P>
<P>
Richard Gephard asserted that the administration's China policy
has made no progress in China and a new one is needed to advance
the American interest.
</P>
<P>
However, the proponents believed the opposite, pointing to,
among many other things, the ever-improving living standards of
the Chinese people and local elections in rural areas throughout
China.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton has vowed to push for a permanent solution to
China's trading status. He might be boosted by the House voting
but there might be still a long uphill fight ahead.

<HEADLINE> Jon Postel Awarded ITU Silver Medal for Key Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) Wednesday awarded Dr Jon Postel the
ITU silver medal for his central role in the success story of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The medal was awarded on behalf of ITU Secretary-General Dr
Pekka Tarjanne in recognition of Postel's outstanding contribution
to the development of the Global Information Infrastructure,
through his management of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA).
</P>
<P>
In the world of Internet governance, ITU said, few
organizations play as critical a role as the IANA. Unique numbers
and unique names of the Internet Domain Name System (DNS) must be
assigned and managed in an orderly fashion to enable the
functioning of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
That has been the IANA's task from the very beginning of the
Internet. The IANA has been managing the root of the DNS to
promote stability and robustness and has ensured that every
Internet computer had a unique IP number. To this end, the IANA
has been allocating blocks of numerical addresses to regional IP
registries throughout the world which in turn issue them to
Internet service providers and users.
</P>
<P>
The IANA also assigns and maintains a registry of the values
used for several technical parameters including protocol numbers,
port numbers, and others which must also be unique for the
Internet to work.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the on-going number assignments have continued to
work effectively despite the phenomenal growth of the Internet
which now boasts of 24.7 million hosts, is a credit to the
architects of the system and to the IANA which administers it.
</P>
<P>
Postel, currently a researcher at the University of Southern
California's (USC) Information Sciences Institute (ISI), is a
legendary figure in the world of the Internet.

NEW YORK, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A powerful heat wave is spreading
to the northeastern part of the United States Wednesday with
temperatures expecting to hit their peaks for years, local radio
broadcast reported.
</P>
<P>
Hit by the heat wave, which has ravaged the southeastern states
of the country for more than a week, New York City saw temperature
hover in the high 90s Farhrenheit (mid 30s Celsius). Sidewalk cafe
tables and park benches were uncommonly empty as residents were
rushing to seek the indoor comfort of air-conditioned restaurants
and offices.
</P>
<P>
Air conditioner sales were strong and power demand were high in
the states of New York and New Jersey, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists predicted that the heat wave, brought on by a
high-pressure systems pushing north form Bermuda, would break
late on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The weekend should bring low humidity and comfortable
temperatures in the low 80s, they said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Israel's Call for Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday rejected an Israeli call for help to break up the
deadlocked talks with the Palestinians, saying the two
parties must make decisions themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We are getting to a point where we need to know whether the
parties themselves are committed to trying to resolve their
differences and move forward," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a call by Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai who urged the United States to send troubleshooter
Dennis Ross to the region and to call a three-way summit to bridge
the gaps between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot make the decisions that they have to make for
themselves," he said. "We cannot build confidence... they have to
do that themselves. We can help them bridge their differences, but
they have to be willing to build those bridges," he said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Ross' return to the Middle East, McCurry said:
"I think that Dennis Ross is available to the parties for
consultation, but the purpose of visits to the region is to
advance the process. And we are at a point now where the parties
have to make progress themselves."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a State Department official said he was not aware
that Ross had any plans to take an immediate trip to the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
And he said there would be no "big American initiative at this
stage" to rescue the talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said if the talks, starting from Sunday, really break
down, the United States might try a different approach,
possibly including publication of the U.S. proposal for the next
Israeli withdrawal from about 13 percent of the West Bank, which
was accepted by the Palestinians but rejected by Israel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Chief Sees No Sign of Recovery in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the
U.S. Federal Reserve, Wednesday described the events in Asia as a
vicious cycle, saying there is no sign yet of a recovery.
</P>
<P>
While making again testimony in the U.S. House of
Representatives Banking Committee, Greenspan noted it was hard to
predict when Asia's troubled economies would start to improve.
</P>
<P>
"You get an implosion of confidence in which pessimism feeds on
pessimism," he said. "Everyone withdraws from activities related
to an economy, trust... falls and the situation feeds on itself in
a downward spiral."
</P>
<P>
The Fed chief said that economists had failed to predict the
Asian crisis, and he was not ready to predict when it would end.
</P>
<P>
"It will depend to a very substantial extent on a restoration
of confidence and will depend on the types of economic policies
that these countries are involved with," he added.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also raised his caution about the high-flying stock
market even as he offers reassurance that the U.S. economy is
strong enough to withstand spillover from Asia's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
His comments were the latest in a series of cautions,
stretching back to his December 1996 musings about "irrational
exuberance."
</P>
<P>
Both today and Tuesday, Greenspan told Congress in his midyear
economic report that the most likely outcome of the spillover from
Asia is a welcome slowdown that will prolong the current economic
expansion, already in its eighth year.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan pledged Tuesday that the central bank would "resist
vigorously" any uptick in inflation.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe the combined effects of soaring trade
deficit, the GM strike and a need by businesses to reduce a huge
stockpile of unsold goods actually will produce a contraction in
the gross domestic product, something that has not occurred since
the end of the 1991 recession.
</P>
<P>
That would represent a remarkable turnaround from a GDP surging
at an annual rate of 5.4 percent in the first quarter of this year
to one falling at a rate of possibly 1 percent in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan acknowledged that such an occurrence was entirely
possible but he insisted it should not be read as the start of a
new recession but rather a temporary blip as the economy moves
from superheated growth to a rate that is more sustainable,
relieving inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
"Given the current tightness in labor markets, the potential
for accelerating inflation is probably greater than the risk of
protracted, excessive weakness in the economy," Greenspan stated.

<HEADLINE> UN Reduces Humanitarian Aid in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has to
reduce its humanitarian aid in Afghanistan except for life-saving
projects due to the blocks from the military faction of Taliban,
Sergio Vieira De Mello, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for
humanitarian affairs, said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Mello said while the United Nations
would stay in the capital of Kabul, it would have to cut all its
activities in view of obstacles imposed by Taliban rulers.
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid workers from 38 non-governmental organizations left
the capital of Kabul this week after the Taliban ordered the
expulsion of them.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot give you a precise date because we have not reached a
decision. But I can assure you it is much earlier than Christmas,"
Mello said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not planning to pull people out of Kabul unless
conditions are impossible for them to work there," he said.
</P>
<P>
"we are suspending and not laundering any additional programs
of a rehabilitation nature and cutting down assistance for food
supplies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mello said the departure of the aid organizations would affect
75 percent of the relief projects in Kabul where a quarter of the
population were dependent on foreign assistance.

President Clinton notified Congress on June 3 that he had

Congress has taken up China's MFN annually since 1980 for

Wednesday voting showed that some congressmen have changed their
mind to back President Clinton, with the fact that last year's
voting result was 259 to 175.

President Clinton gained the stronger support in spite of the
allegations that China tried to buy influence in American
elections and obtained sensative U.S. satellite technology.
