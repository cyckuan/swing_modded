<HEADLINE> $1B Reported in Academic Earmarks  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress directed more than $1 billion to specific colleges and
universities in the federal budget this year, a record for a
noncompetitive process critics assail as pork barrel spending, The
Chronicle of Higher Education says in a report being issued Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The total is more than 30 percent greater than last year's
record $797 million, the journal said, and it's a sizable portion
of the $40 billion in this year's overall federal appropriations
for higher education, which includes student aid.
</P>
<P>
   Such funding, without being subjected to review by the agencies
directed to give out the money, is known as ''earmarks'' in the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Critics call it ''pork'' -- gifts that members of Congress give
to their districts.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders say schools have to find money wherever they can,
and that no member of Congress or school wants to risk looking
silly by throwing money at a bad project.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an awful lot of people busy pointing fingers, rather
than trying to lend a hand,'' said Vincent Scalia, dean of the
College of Health and Human Sciences at the University of Northern
Colorado. ''Politicians are not that dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia's college got a $1.81 million earmark to enlarge a cancer
rehabilitation institute. ''I would say it's politics at its best,
not its worst side.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of earmarking sees only politics.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the funded projects have merit, said Ken White, director
of the Massachusetts office of Common Cause, the government
watchdog group. ''But the federal government is too often seen as a
place for everybody to line up with their hands out to ask for
something. This is the kind of thing that turns people off to
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The earmarking system ''does not allow for anyone to analyze the
projects and determine if they serve a good educational purpose --
or if the money could be better used at another school,'' said Rep.
John F. Tierney, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle, a Washington-based weekly, analyzed spending in
the federal budget for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. Its
report appears in the July 28 edition.
</P>
<P>
   Much of federal spending for higher education goes through a
review process, and federal agencies often hold competitions to
choose recipients of money for research, facilities and other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, earmarking may be the only option, administrators
say.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth College received $15 million for research on
terrorism, especially assaults on computer systems. When the school
in Hanover, N.H., wanted to create an institute for this work, no
big competitive grant programs existed, Provost Susan Prager told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The school turned to Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., a senior member of
the Senate Appropriations Committee. ''Dartmouth is known
nationally for cybersecurity, and Senator Gregg is fortunate to be
in a position to help not only Dartmouth, but a number of
worthwhile projects in New Hampshire,'' said Jim Morhard, a
committee aide.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle found the most earmarked grants -- money not shared
with other schools, businesses or agencies -- went to California at
$64 million. It was followed by Texas, $47.5 million; and
Mississippi, $40 million. Only Delaware schools received no
earmarked funds.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single recipient was Loma Linda University in
California, with $36 million for a variety of medical research and
to retrofit a building against earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Seventh-day Adventist school of 3,500 students is in the
district represented by Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., whose
photograph is displayed in a research building.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis chairs the House defense appropriations subcommittee, and
several of the Loma Linda grants came from the Defense Department,
the Chronicle noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take exception to the term 'pork barrel,''' said Loma Linda
spokesman W. Augustus Cheatham. He said Lewis ''has taken note of
the success and accountability that is clear in our track record
with Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The small state of West Virginia is No. 5 on the list, with
$38.8 million, the Chronicle said.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia's Sen. Robert C. Byrd is the ranking Democrat and
a former chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Rep.
Alan Mollohan, D-W.Va., sits on the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mollohan disagrees with critics of the earmark system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody knows their constituents or their academic institutions
or their programs better than the members of the House and Senate
who represent those organizations,'' Mollohan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every member of Congress worth their salt is working hard to
build up their congressional districts,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 18 in N.C. Accused of Hezbollah Aid  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- In a quiet street of tidy, middle-class
homes, the house of Mohamad Youssef Hammoud was notable to
neighbors only for the steady stream of people passing through.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities say at least some of them were members of a
cigarette-smuggling ring that was raising money for the Islamic
militant group Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, 17 suspects were arrested in raids of houses and
businesses in and around Charlotte, FBI officials said. One person
was arrested in Michigan. All were indicted on federal charges
including immigration violations, weapons offenses, money
laundering and cigarette trafficking, U.S. Attorney Mark Calloway
said. Twelve remained in custody Saturday; the others were released
on bond.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings for the suspects held in Charlotte will begin
Wednesday, while the Michigan man was scheduled to be in court on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hammoud, one of those arrested in the raids, was identified as
the group's ringleader by sources working with a state-federal task
force that investigated the group, according to an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   A source told agents Hammoud was well-connected to Hezbollah
members in Lebanon and is believed to have received
Hezbollah-sponsored military training.
</P>
<P>
   The source ''believes that if Hezbollah issued an authorization
to execute a terrorist act in the United States, Mohamad Hammoud
would not hesitate in carrying it out,'' the affidavit read.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah issued a statement Saturday in Beirut that denied any
involvement with the people charged in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Hammoud or any of his co-defendants had
an attorney who could comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Bassam Youssef Hamood, 33, of Dearborn, Mich., was being held
Saturday for federal marshals at a jail in Detroit, a federal
official speaking on condition on anonymity in Michigan said.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered the door Friday evening at Hammoud's gray-blue
house, where dents in the front door and damaged aluminum louvers
in a window remained as evidence of the morning raid.
</P>
<P>
   Those who lived nearby said they knew little of its occupants,
but did notice periodic gatherings and what appeared to be a
constantly changing set of occupants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other than all the meetings, where there'd be 15, 20 cars
parked in front of the house, and the fact that there was a
revolving door, they didn't bother anybody,'' said Paul Booher, who
lives two houses down.
</P>
<P>
   Booher said the only time he spoke to anyone at the house was
when he knocked on the door and asked if they'd like to join the
local homeowners' association. The man who answered said he'd have
to talk to the landlord.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wouldn't let anyone get to know them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began in 1996 when Iredell County authorities
noticed people with out-of-state license plates making large cash
purchases from JR Tobacco, a discount tobacco outlet in
Statesville.
</P>
<P>
   The ring allegedly bought cigarettes in North Carolina, which
has relatively low cigarette taxes of five cents a pack, and
unloaded them in Michigan, where prices are higher because of
75-cent-a-pack taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The profits were allegedly used to smuggle money to Hezbollah in
Lebanon since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials would not comment on how much total money they
believe was sent. An FBI informant said one of those arrested, Ali
Hussein Darwiche, had transported more than $1 million from the
U.S. to Lebanon, and another $360,000 in cashiers checks was traced
to Lebanon, according to an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the suspects are believed to have provided material
support or resources, including night vision devices, global
positioning systems, digital photo equipment and computers,
Calloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah draws its support from the 1.2 million-member Shiite
Muslim community, Lebanon's largest sect, and enjoys the financial
backing of Iran and the crucial political endorsement of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Hezbollah was believed to be the umbrella group
for militants who kidnapped Westerners and destroyed two U.S.
Embassy compounds, the U.S. Marine headquarters at Beirut and a
French military base. A total of about 290 Americans and about 60
French soldiers were killed. Hezbollah is on the U.S. list of
terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Hezbollah guerrillas have been treated like
heroes in much of the Arab world. Their years of resistance to
Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and infliction of casualties
on Israeli forces there weakened Israel's resolve. Israel ended its
18-year occupation of the area in May.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who follow terrorism and Middle East politics said
groups such as Hezbollah use different legal and illegal means to
raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Eldridge, a political science professor at Duke
University who teaches a course on international terrorism, said
this is the first time he had heard of a terrorist group
trafficking in cigarettes to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to be able to tap into large amounts of cash. And so,
what comes to mind immediately today where there are large amounts
of cash: drugs or, increasingly, cigarettes,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Shakes Tokyo Islands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A moderately strong earthquake shook a string of
volcanic islands off Tokyo on Sunday, the Meteorological Agency
said. Police reported no damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5, was centered
beneath the seabed near the islands of Niijima and Kozushima and
struck just after noon local time, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no danger of undersea waves triggered by volcanic
activity or earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was most strongly felt on the island of Shikinejima,
about 93 miles south of Tokyo. The island is near Niijima and
Kozushima. There were no reports of damage on any of the islands.
</P>
<P>
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause damage to homes if it occurs in
a residential area.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's quake was among thousands that have hit the small
islands of the Izu islands chain in recent weeks. On July 1, a
magnitude 6.4 earthquake killed a man on Kozushima.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

<HEADLINE> Kerlikowske To Head Seattle Police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A 28-year law-enforcement veteran now working for
the U.S. Justice Department is Mayor Paul Schell's choice for chief
of Seattle's 1,261-member police department.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Kerlikowske will be introduced at a Monday news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very confident he is the best choice for the city,''
Schell said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported Kerlikowske's selection
in Saturday editions. Schell confirmed the report in a KOMO-TV
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kerlikowske will succeed Norm Stamper, who resigned after city
leaders were criticized for the handling of last fall's World Trade
Organization disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of three finalists, along with Richard Williams, the
police chief in Madison, Wis.; and William McManus, an assistant
chief in the Washington, D.C., police department.
</P>
<P>
   Kerlikowske, 50, has been a deputy director at the Justice
Department for the past two years, overseeing Community Oriented
Policing Services grants. This week, he said he was ready to get
back to local police work, ''to see programs and policies actually
affect people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the federal government, Kerlikowske spent 4&AMP;frac12;
years as police commissioner in Buffalo, N.Y., introducing
technology, consolidating 14 precincts into five districts, and
sending officers into neighborhoods to solve problems rather than
simply arrest people.
</P>
<P>
   He was criticized for frequent travel, but his contacts in
Washington, D.C., and interest in innovative crime policies helped
bring the city $7 million in federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the city in 1998, violent crime was down 38
percent.

<HEADLINE> Police Probe Colo. Infant Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities were investigating the
death of a 2-day-old boy whose parents belong to a religious group
that does not believe in medical intervention for illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in less than two years that a child has
died in the care of parents who are members of General Assembly
Church of the First Born. Six other children in the church have
died after medical treatment was withheld.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest case, Billy Ray Reed died July 9 from
complications caused by congenital heart disease, Mesa County
Coroner Rob Kurtzman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Post reported Saturday that the child died while his
parents, Billy and Barbara Reed, and elders of the church prayed
over him. They did not seek medical help.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone Saturday, Billy Reed said neither he nor his
wife would comment on their son's death or their religious beliefs.
There is no telephone listing for the church.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtzman said he will investigate further before deciding
whether to rule the baby's death a homicide. The Mesa County
Sheriff's Office is also investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, two other members of the church, Joshua and
Mindy Glory, pleaded guilty to child abuse in the February 1999
death of their 18-day-old son, Warren Trevette Glory. The infant
died of pneumonia while church elders prayed over him and anointed
him with oil.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Crash Victims' Bodies Found  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DiPIETRO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) -- Rescue crews completed the grim and
dangerous task Saturday of retrieving the bodies of seven people
killed when a tour helicopter crashed on a steep mountain hillside.
</P>
<P>
   A ten-man crew rappelled down from the helicopter to a ridge and
then set new lines to rappel to the site at the 2,700-foot level.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no place a helicopter can land, so the men are
rappelling down,'' said Lt. John Morioka, a spokesman for the Maui
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The crash Friday of the Blue Hawaiian Helicopters twin-engine
AS355 occurred in a remote area of Iao Valley on Maui. Photos of
the scene show the tail section intact but the rest of the
helicopter disintegrated into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The crash site has a deep slope of about 30 degrees, and is a
wet and slick area, making it difficult for crews to gain access.
Among the recovery team are a master rappeller and crews who take
part in eradicating marijuana from remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was identified through dental records as Larry Kirsh,
55, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The other victims' names were to be released after they are
positively identified through their dental records, which are to
arrive Monday, said Richard Sword, a Maui psychologist handling
disaster stress control for the families of victims. Families of
the six passengers have been notified and some are already on the
island, Morioka said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram identified two of the
victims as 14-year-olds Whitney Wood of Burleson, Texas, and
Natalie Prince of Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Honolulu television station KITV, citing unidentified sources,
reported that the other four passengers were a New Jersey family --
William John Jordan, his wife, Jan Hortivick, and their two
children, Max Jordan, 17, and Linsey Jordan, 16.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board is
on Maui to look into the crash, which occurred during a 35-minute
sightseeing tour of the West Maui mountains. The investigator,
George Petterson, said he expects to issue a preliminary report in
about five days.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was a Vietnam veteran with more than 11,000 hours of
flight time and had been with the company more than a year, said
Patti Chevalier, co-owner of the company with her husband, Dave, a
former Vietnam scout pilot.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first accident involving a Blue Hawaiian tour
helicopter since the company began operations in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hawaii's third notable aircraft crash in 11 months. On
Sept. 25, a tour plane crashed on the slopes of Mauna Loa on the
Big Island, killing all 10 people on board. On May 10, a private
jet slammed into a hillside while approaching an airport on
Molokai, killing all six people on board.

<HEADLINE> Chinese River Dries up in Drought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A persisting drought has dried up one of China's
major rivers for a month, threatening the economy of the northeast,
the state-run China Youth Daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Songhua River ran dry June 19 in Zhaoyuan county, a marshy
stretch of farmland 70 miles west of Harbin, capital of
Heilongjiang province, the newspaper said. It added that people can
now cross the river by foot.
</P>
<P>
   The report blamed drought. Since the start of what is usually
the summer rainy season in May, Heilongjiang has seen high
temperatures and rainfall that has been a paltry 70 percent less
than usual, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Across northern China, drought this year already has destroyed
35 million acres of crops and left at least 16.2 million people
short of water.
</P>
<P>
   The Songhua feeds one of China's richest grain-growing regions
and a strip of heavily industrialized cities. Two years ago, amid
China's worst flooding in a half-century, the Songhua inundated
surrounding countryside.
</P>
<P>
   A water-use planning expert for the province, Wang Xinde, warned
that the river's drying up will have disastrous consequences for
the lives and livelihoods of 40 million people in the Songhua
basin.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on George W. Bush's short list.
Cheney is the leading candidate, a highly placed Republican
official said as the Texas governor neared his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, his wife Sally, and Cheney -- who also heads Bush's
search team -- met secretly with Bush for a get-to-know-you session
in a Chicago hotel suite Tuesday, setting aside his oft-stated
opposition to serving as vice president. Republican officials had
assumed Danforth's reluctance disqualified him from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's name surfaced as Arizona Sen. John McCain's chances
appeared to fade. Two Republican sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the House Republicans who wrote the Bush campaign
to urge McCain's nomination had been told in advance that it was
too late for such an effort. The word was relayed from Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will make his decision this weekend and announce it
this week, well in advance of the July 31 opening of the Republican
convention in Philadelphia. Officials said Saturday that Bush had
not made a final decision, although he appeared to be leaning
toward Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cheney and Danforth would give the GOP ticket stature and
the Washington experience that Bush lacks. Solid conservatives,
either candidate would help Bush shore up his base. Danforth has
the advantage of living in a key battleground state, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Those mentioned as possible candidates include Govs. Frank
Keating of Oklahoma, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and George Pataki of
New York; Rep. John Kasich of Ohio; and Sens. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska and Bill Frist and Fred Thompson of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Danforth meeting, first reported by ABC News, was notable
because Bush is known to have had few such sessions with
candidates. Danforth's wife has expressed reservations about the
job, leading the former lawmaker to say in the past that he didn't
want to be vice president. Party officials say Mrs. Danforth is now
more open to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Chicago meeting began, Cheney left the room to
allow Bush to meet alone with the Danforths. Bush was said to be
impressed with the couple, though he has not known them long.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known how many candidates Bush was considering,
though one official familiar with Bush's thinking said it appeared
that the Texan had more than two options remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, 63, who retired from the Senate in 1995 after three
terms in office, was appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno in
September to oversee investigation of the federal government's
actions during the siege on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco,
Texas, in 1993. He issued a report Friday that cleared Reno and all
government agents of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was releasing his report when it was only 95
percent done, he said he thought it was important to clear Reno and
others now. But he also suggested personal political
considerations, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''In May an unexpected political possibility came up, and if
there was any chance of that coming to pass, it would mean that I
would have to step down as special counsel,'' he told reporters,
but he refused to say whether completing his work meant he was now
open to becoming Bush's running mate. ''I'm not going to say
anything more about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Danforth was the chief advocate of Supreme Court
nominee Clarence Thomas during his confirmation hearings. After
leaving the Senate, he returned home to practice law in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, a former state auditor and attorney general, is a
graduate of Princeton University and Yale's law and divinity
schools. An heir to the Ralston-Purina fortune, he is an ordained
Episcopal priest.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a former Wyoming lawmaker and White House chief of
staff, emerged as the leading candidate Friday after changing his
registration from Texas to Wyoming to avoid a Constitutional hurdle
if Bush were to pick him.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's emergence quieted speculation that McCain wanted a spot
on the ticket. The timing left Republicans wondering whether Bush
was using Cheney to divert attention from his vanquished rival.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's candidacy diverts attention from McCain even further.
</P>
<P>
   Aides for McCain and Bush had long since suspected the Arizona
senator had little chance of getting the job, though McCain told a
mutual friend last week that he would be willing to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has a history of heart trouble, and as a former member of
President Bush's Cabinet, might undermine the younger Bush's
efforts to stand apart from his father and be viewed as a
fresh-faced Washington outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that Cheney is in play this late in the process shows
that Bush is looking for somebody with national stature,'' said
Republican consultant Scott Reed. ''The question he is wrestling
with is: 'Do I go national, or do I look for a regional or state
candidate?'''
</P>
<P>
   The former defense chief, who has residences in Texas and
Wyoming, spent Saturday in his suburban Washington home with his
wife, prominent Republican Lynne Cheney, their daughter and her
family.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, Cheney walked the family to their car. He refused
to talk about the running mate search or his prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no more news here tonight,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife added, ''There's a lid on. Go home.''

<HEADLINE> G-8 Leaders Focus On Third World  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Okinawa (AP) -- Leaders of the world's major industrialized
nations, hoping to stem a growing backlash against globalization,
pledged Sunday at their annual economic summit to do more to
provide schooling, health care and food to the poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique issued at the conclusion of their three-day
summit, the leaders cited ''unprecedented economic progress'' by
many world nations and agreed that more must be done to spread that
prosperity to poorer nations. ''The 21st century must be a century
of prosperity for all,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   They said their countries must work harder to relieve the debt
burden of developing nations. ''We must for our part promote more
responsible lending and borrowing practices to ensure that (poor
countries) will not again be burdened by unsupportable debt,'' the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose country agreed to
restructure $4 billion of Russia's debt, suggested that wealthy
nations hold back demands for poorer countries to pay off their
loans. ''It would be better to put the money in health and
education systems in these countries,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Okinawa meeting was the first ''development summit'' for the
Group of Eight -- leaders of the seven richest industrialized
nations and Russia, and the last G-8 meeting for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced that the United States will send $300 million
in surplus farm crops to provide school lunches in the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we can increase by millions and millions (the number
of children in school) just by telling these children and their
parents we will give them one hot meal,'' Clinton said before the
final session of world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The president cut short his schedule in Okinawa to hurry home to
another summit -- the Mideast peace talks that were continuing in
his absence at Camp David, Md. Before boarding Air Force One,
Clinton went over to quickly shake hands with a crowd of
well-wishers waiting in a heavy rain to watch his departure from
Kadena Air Base.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, this year's G-8 summit
host, said wealthy nations had an obligation to break the ''vicious
cycle'' of poverty and disease faced by poor nations. But Mori
declined to say whether Japan would provide funding for building
information technology infrastructure in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Information technology) is an area that needs to progress in
the private sector. The government really should be complementary''
in its role, Mori said.
</P>
<P>
   In their communique, they put forth a laundry list of objectives
to make sure that the economic benefits from an increasingly
interconnected world are shared more widely.
</P>
<P>
   The eight countries set a goal of universal primary education
for all the world's children by 2015, and gender equality in
schools by 2005. Currently, 100 million children in developing
nations are not in school.
</P>
<P>
   They also vowed to reduce by the year 2010 the number of
HIV-infected young people by 25 percent, tuberculosis deaths by 50
percent, and the burden of diseases associated with malaria by 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
issued a statement expressing disappointment that the leaders did
not address debt relief more aggressively, noting that so far,
relief had been extended to only nine of 41 extremely poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where there is agreement in principle that debt relief is
essential, and where delays have a profoundly negative impact on
the lives of poor people, clearly more must be done,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But Roman Prodi, president of the European Commission, said
Annan's statement was unfair. ''He expressed his disappointment
before we even discussed the problem in Okinawa,'' Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
   The summit did not resolve differences between North America and
Europe over the risks of genetically modified foods, French
President Jacques Chirac said Sunday. He noted that the United
States and Canada generally think such food is not dangerous, while
European and Japanese leaders are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   The differences were apparent in the joint communique issued at
the end of the three-day summit, which gave nods to both points of
view in vague language.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he spoke for the leaders
of Japan, Germany, France, Canada, Italy and Russia in praising
Clinton's efforts for global stability over the past eight years.
Clinton leaves office in six months and will not attend another G-8
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Blair also answered critics from outside the summit, who have
complained that the G-8 summit failed to do enough for poor
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many who work hard in the developing world, progress is
often agonizingly slow,'' Blair said. ''But we have made some
significant steps,'' in helping poorer nations at this session.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides insisted that the discussions had been
productive in countering the attacks from thousands of
demonstrators who marched in the streets of Seattle last December
and in Washington in April to protest that globalization helps the
wealthy nations and international corporations at the expense of
the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government brought in 20,000 police officers to
provide security during the summit on the island nation in the
Pacific, and there were no disruptions by protesters. On Thursday,
tens of thousands of peaceful demonstrators protested against the
massive U.S. military presence on the island, but the streets were
quiet after Clinton arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the initiatives put forth by the leaders featured grand
aims with little financial backing.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders agreed to create a digital opportunity task force,
or ''dot force,'' to expand Internet access and make it more
affordable in developing nations. They also said governments should
avoid regulating information technology too tightly, and they
pledged protections for intellectual property rights in cyberspace.
A report on this effort is to be presented at next year's G-8
summit in Genoa, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee 2000, a religious-based coalition that campaigns for
debt forgiveness, said the summit's emphasis on closing the
''digital divide'' was a puzzling goal in a world where poor
countries can't supply electricity or running water to millions and
starvation is an ever-present threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't eat computers, said Jubilee 2000 coordinator Kewesi
Owusu. ''People are dying.''

Kenya Suffers Massive Power Cut
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Power went off across Kenya on Saturday and the nation
of 29 million people will be largely without electricity for the next two days
because of technical problems, the electric company said. Electricity went off
about 6:30 p.m. throughout the capital, Nairobi, and in most other parts of the
country. In a statement on national radio, the Kenya Power and Lighting Company
said a ''major fault'' had occurred in transmission of power from neighboring
Uganda. It said the problem would take two days to fix. That means this East
African nation will be largely without power, except for those who have private
generators.

holding five people hostage in a home Saturday in a standoff with sheriff's
deputies, authorities said. Jamie Dean Petron, 41, shot a Broward County
sheriff's deputy in the leg in a grocery store parking lot before fleeing to the
nearby home, authorities said. He apparently did not know the occupants. The
hostages being held were a woman in her 40s, a 16-year-old girl, an 11-month-old
boy and a girl either 9 or 10 months old, said Orange County sheriff's spokesman
Jim Solomons.

2,700-foot level. The crash Friday of the Blue Hawaiian Helicopters twin-engine
AS355 occurred in a remote area of Iao Valley on Maui. Photos of the scene show

Earthquake Shakes Japan Islands
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A moderately strong earthquake shook a string of volcanic
islands off Tokyo on Sunday, the Meteorological Agency said. Police reported no
damage or injuries. The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5, was centered
beneath the seabed near the islands of Niijima and Kozushima and struck just
after noon local time, the agency said. There was no danger of undersea waves
triggered by volcanic activity or earthquakes. The quake was most strongly felt
on the island of Shikinejima, about 93 miles south of Tokyo. The island is near
Niijima and Kozushima. There were no reports of damage on any of the islands.

New Moon Found Orbiting Jupiter
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Astronomers at the University of Arizona and their
Massachusetts colleagues say they have found a 17th moon orbiting Jupiter. If
confirmed, the 3-mile-diameter moon would be the smallest known satellite of a
major planet and the first Jovian moon discovered in 21 years. For now, the
object is designated S/1999 J1. If follow-up observations confirm it is a moon,
S/1999 J1 will get a name. At 3 miles in diameter, it would be the smallest
moon. Among Jupiter's 16 confirmed satellites, half are smaller than 32 miles in
diameter. Mars has the smallest confirmed moon, Deimos, which is about 7.5 miles
in diameter.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A strong earthquake with a magnitude
of 5.5 shook Indonesia's Sumatra island Sunday, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Armyn Paimin, an official with the Meteorological and Geophysics
Agency, was quoted by the official Antara news agency as saying
that there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Paimin said the temblor hit at 3:55 a.m. local time, 20 miles
beneath the Indian Ocean, and 270 miles northwest of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   He said the quake was worst felt in the town of Bengkulu, where
a 7.9 magnitude temblor on June 4 killed about 100 people and left
thousands homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's quake was the latest in a series of seismic upheavals
that have rocked the world's largest archipelagic nation in the
past month.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the
Pacific ''Ring of Fire'' -- a line of volcanically active areas
stretching from the western coast of the Americas across to Japan,
Southeast Asia and the South Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Fire Spreads to Indian Land  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo. (AP) -- A wildfire spread to
6,000 acres Saturday after making a 3-mile run overnight and
burning into the nearby Ute Mountain Ute reservation.
</P>
<P>
   A second wildfire broke out about 40 miles to the northwest
Saturday afternoon, forcing some evacuations and diverting planes
and firefighters from the Mesa Verde fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're running short on resources,'' said Deb Koening,
spokeswoman at an interagency fire dispatch center in Durango.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfires also burned in Southern California, including a
5,000-acre blaze in a remote canyon in Death Valley National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Verde remained closed indefinitely. More than 500
firefighters were on the scene, but only about 250 were deployed on
the fire lines because of the difficulty of getting into the
steep-sided canyons.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 tourists were evacuated Thursday after the fire
started, apparently from a lightning strike.
</P>
<P>
   It was 5 percent contained Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they get this big, you don't put them out,'' said fire
management officer Tim Oliverious, U.S. Park Service. ''It will
take a major change in the weather, topography or fuels, and right
now the forces are lined up in favor of the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the park's well-known ancient Indian ruins, cliff
dwellings or other attractions were damaged, and buried
archaeological sites in the area of the fire were expected to
survive, Oliverious said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was burning on the rugged eastern boundary of the park,
about 260 miles southwest of Denver. It moved south into remote Ute
reservation land, said Justin Dombrowski, a spokesman for the fire
management team.
</P>
<P>
   No serious injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The new fire had burned 150 acres by Saturday evening and forced
the evacuation of 10 homes northwest of Mesa Verde, near the
Hovenweep National Monument, said Lt. Kalvin Boggs of the Montezuma
County Sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, the Death Valley fire started in desert
grass and brush in Happy Canyon, north of the small desert
community of Trona, said Tom Sensintaffar, manager of a Federal
Interagency Communications Center. Flames then spread into higher
elevations and into the park.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 firefighters were initially on the scene, but ''we're
now mobilizing a couple of hundred more,'' Sensintaffar. The area's
steep terrain and limited road access mean the fire must be fought
primarily from the air, he said.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported, and the park remained open,
spokeswoman Nancy Wizner said. The cause of the blaze was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller fires burned west of Santa Clarita, east of Temecula,
and in Cleveland National Forest in San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were battling three other large fires in
northwestern Colorado, at least two of them caused by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   The largest was burning on 1,500 acres about seven miles east of
Rangely and threatened two trailers and two cabins. It was 10
percent contained Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 56,000 fires have burned 2.8 million acres nationwide
this season, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in
Idaho, the worst acreage total since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Albright, N. Korean Minister To Meet  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun will meet this week
in Bangkok, Thailand, North Korean media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials will meet Wednesday to discuss ''issues related to
bilateral relations,'' the Korean Central News Agency said in a
one-sentence dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting would mark the highest-level contact between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made as North Korea, desperate for outside
economic aid to rebuild its dilapidated economy, actively seeks
contacts with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which had been expected, will take place prior to
the ASEAN Regional Forum, part of an annual round of ministerial
meetings held by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the meeting comes amid North Korea's
suspected missile ambitions, which are a key factor in the U.S.
drive to develop a missile defense system to protect the United
States from nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea shocked Asia by test-firing a long-range missile
that flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean nearly two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang claims it launched a scientific satellite and accuses
Washington and Tokyo of fabricating missile threats to justify a
missile defense program.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the United States and North Korea ended in a
stalemate early this month, with Washington refusing to pay
Pyongyang to curb exports of missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea restated that it wants $1 billion a year in exchange
for a halt to missile technology exports. It also refused to stop
developing such weapons for self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   But North Korea reportedly indicated it may abandon its missile
program in exchange for help in putting peaceful satellites into
orbit during a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and
North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang last week.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also urged Washington to give up on its proposed
construction of a limited missile defense system, claiming North
Korea's missile program was solely for peaceful uses.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, North Korea reiterated its accusation that the United
States was trying to gain military supremacy through the missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The shield is ''aimed at containing other big powers advocating
a multipolar world and implementing its strategy to build a
unipolar world and establish world supremacy,'' said Rodong Sinmun,
official newspaper for the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, in a
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The commentary was carried by the Korean Central News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Long-icy relations between communist North Korea and pro-Western
South Korea have begun to thaw since leaders of the two Koreas held
a historic summit last month.
</P>
<P>
   During his stay in Bangkok, Paek is scheduled to meet his South
Korean counterpart, Lee Joung-binn, to discuss ''cooperation in the
international arena,'' Seoul's Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Paek also will meet his Japanese counterpart, Yohei Kono, in the
highest-level talks between the two nations, on resuming
negotiations to try to normalize diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea also will receive membership status in the ASEAN
Regional Forum, which discusses regional security issues.

July 26. Since its enactment by former President George Bush, the
ADA literally has knocked down barriers and opened doors to the
disabled, in sports as well as other areas of public life.
</P>
<P>
   The differences show up in uncounted ways. One common example:
Sloped sidewalks let wheelchairs cross intersections where curbs
had been canyon-like barriers. And buildings such as gyms have
ramps to let those wheelchairs roll up to doors that had been
effectively walled off by stairs.
</P>
<P>
   But the law has done more than that, said Driscoll, a repeat
Boston Marathon winner and Paralympic medalist. ''ADA was a primary
piece of legislation that educated this nation,'' she said. ''Just
because people have disabilities doesn't mean they are weak.''
</P>
<P>
   The law itself does not mandate that athletics and exercise
should be open to the disabled with the same specificity in which
Title IX brought gender equity to women, said John D. Kemp, a
lawyer and activist for the disabled, who is senior vice president
for development at the HalfthePlanet.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The ADA does, however, require reasonable access for the
disabled. Regulations then spelled out definitions that cover,
among other things, health clubs and sports organizations --
including recreational league play, Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements go beyond fostering separate leagues such as
those for wheelchair baseball, Kemp said. Organizations that offer
activities to the nondisabled have to make accommodations to let
the disabled take part, he said. ADA's power became a big factor
''when we realized a lot of children and adults were being excluded
from more mainstream sports activities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A disabled athlete must be allowed in unless there is a valid
reason to exclude the person, Kemp said. For instance, a disabled
athlete can be excluded when participation would pose a risk to
other players, but ''we expect to be included as much as
possible,'' said Kemp, who was born without arms and legs and
relies on prostheses.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, common sense generally rules, and disabled athletes
don't try to force themselves into activities they can't handle,
Kemp said. ''We are the best determiners of our ability to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point could be Marla Runyon, a Paralympic champion who
on July 9 became the first blind athlete to qualify for a U.S.
Olympic team. She finished third, with a time of 4 minutes, 6.44
seconds, in a 1,500-meter race in Sacramento, Calif -- and this
despite a recent tendon injury.
</P>
<P>
   The abilities of disabled athletes also changes the public's
perception of disability, said Driscoll, a columnist for the
AccessLife.com Web site. ''I was a human interest story in the
feature section,'' she said. ''Now I am a sports story.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, disabled athletes still face societal barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Progress is being made at the health club level, but more can be
done, said Helen Durkin, spokeswoman for IHRSA, the International
Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association.
</P>
<P>
   Like the nondisabled, the disabled don't get enough exercise,
Durkin said. And the disabled ''clearly are not in clubs in great
numbers at all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some facilities are showing ''a real sincere interest,'' said
Kirk Bauer, executive director of Disabled Sports USA, a disabled
athlete advocacy group. Bally Total Fitness clubs include a
disabled athlete in their ads, and let Paralympics athletes train
free, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But clubs often let the disabled athlete in the door while
failing to provide satisfactory equipment for training, Bauer said.
For instance, he said, clubs often don't have upper body ergometers
-- devices similar to exercise bikes, but which work on arm strength
instead of leg strength. This cuts off an aerobic workout for
exercisers who can't run or ride a bike, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clubs, recreation centers and resorts are likely to come under
more regulatory pressure to provide access, Bauer said. The U.S.
Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, an
independent federal agency that develops accessibility requirements
for the disabled, is promulgating regulations on sports and
exercise facilities.
</P>
<P>
   While the rules are aimed at helping the handicapped, they also
help the nondisabled, Bauer said. A skier despite losing a leg in
Vietnam, he pointed to the standardization of ski lifts as an
example.
</P>
<P>
   To make ski lifts accessible to disabled skiers and their
special equipment, the lifts were set to standard heights where
skiers boarded and got off, Bauer said. The payoff for the
nondisabled is that a skier can count on how high the lift will be,
and not get bumped by surprise, he said.

<HEADLINE> Success Seen in Weight-Loss Program  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- An unusually disciplined, long-term weight
loss program helped participants following it lose nearly one-fifth
their original weight and keep it off five years, researchers
found.
</P>
<P>
   The Trevose Behavior Modification Program, serving about 1,200
people in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida, is the first weight
loss program in the country proven to work long term, according to
researchers at Rutgers University and University of Pennsylvania.
Their study appears in July's International Journal of Obesity.
</P>
<P>
   While most people eventually quit or were booted out of the free
program for not following the strict rules, the study found those
staying in two years on average lost 19.3 percent of their original
weight. At five years, they were still 17.3 percent lighter than
their original weight.
</P>
<P>
   ''A program where five years later 10 percent of the people are
within 95 percent of their (weight loss) goal is pretty amazing,''
said Rena Wing, a psychology professor and director of the Weight
Control and Diabetes Research Center at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   Wing, who was not involved in the research but is a member of
the National Task Force on Prevention and Treatment of Obesity,
cautioned that it is difficult to evaluate the program because
''failures'' are kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like a good option for some patients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, members lost 2.4 times as much weight in two
years as patients in a study of the diet pill Orlistat. Even the
Trevose dropouts contacted kept off 5 percent of their original
weight for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike plans using diet pills or fad diets, the program
encourages gradual weight loss through good nutrition, constant
calorie counting, exercise, weekly weighings and support groups.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs use such behavior modification techniques, but
are less strict. Participants can be dismissed if they miss
meetings or don't meet the goals they set based on the healthy
weight range for their height, or if they don't permanently
maintain at least 90 percent of that loss.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer-run program, based in the Philadelphia suburb of
Trevose, was founded in 1970 by Dr. Albert Stunkard, director of
the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine's obesity
research clinic, and David Zelitch, who lost nearly 100 pounds and
kept it off until his death in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the program operates in 62 locations in New Jersey,
eastern Pennsylvania and Pompano Beach, Fla., with a total of 108
groups of about 10 meeting weekly in ''donated'' space at schools,
churches and synagogues, hospitals and similar locations. Past
success stories serve as new group leaders or role models. Most
groups have a waiting list, but a few new ones are starting soon,
said program director Mary Jackson of Philadelphia, who lost more
than 80 pounds on the program and has kept it off for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very slow weight loss,'' Jackson said. ''Our experience
is the people who lose weight quickly are the ones who gain it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The study examined data on 329 people who applied to the
program's main location in 1992 and 1993. Many either changed their
minds or were rejected because they didn't meet certain criteria,
such as needing to lose 20 pounds to 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 202 who started the program, 105 completed the first
year, 59 were still in after three years and 39 completed five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Peak weight loss came at 30 months, about five times longer than
most diet plans last, said Janet Latner, a Rutgers graduate student
in psychology who was the lead researcher. She found three factors
predicted success.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more months you were in treatment, the more you lose; the
more you lost the first month, the more you lose; and the heavier
you were to start, the more you lose,'' Latner said.
</P>
<P>
   Her adviser, behavioral psychology professor Terry Wilson, who
directs Rutgers' Eating Disorders Clinic, said while more study is
needed, the program is a promising model that could be replicated.
He noted that it emphasizes improving health, not appearance,
something greatly needed because the U.S. obesity epidemic is
causing more diabetes, heart disease and other life-threatening
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and Latner said obesity researchers increasingly are
concluding ''continuing care is the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants agree.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're not dieting. You're eating this way the rest of your
life. That's why Trevose works,'' said Helene Lees, 60, of Cherry
Hill. The 5-foot-3 dietitian has maintained a 25-pound loss for
nine years, become a group leader and retrained for her current
profession. She budgets her daily calorie allowance to have
desserts or chocolate occasionally. ''I feel fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Lees, bank teller Gail Whitworth, 59, of Northeast
Philadelphia had gone through commercial weight loss programs a
dozen times without success.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've kept my weight off (about 30 pounds) for seven years,''
she said. ''I eat very healthy now, but I still snack.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is ''thrilled to death. He knows what I've struggled
through and he can't believe it,'' Whitworth said. ''I can't speak
highly enough about the program.''

   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Some 97 million American adults, or 55
percent, are considered overweight or obese.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Institutes of Health, this epidemic of
obesity, which is also a growing problem among children, costs
nearly $100 billion annually. That includes costs for weight loss
treatment and treatment of many serious health problems caused by
obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Overweight people are at increased risk of illness from:
</P>
<P>
   --high blood pressure and other heart disease
</P>
<P>
   --adult-onset diabetes
</P>
<P>
   --stroke
</P>
<P>
   --gallbladder disease
</P>
<P>
   --osteoarthritis
</P>
<P>
   --certain cancers
</P>
<P>
   --lipid disorders
</P>
<P>
   --respiratory problems
</P>
<P>
   --sleep apnea, a disorder that primarily strikes overweight men,
causing them to repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping. Besides
causing fatigue, it decreases the amount of oxygen and increases
the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood and brain.
</P>
<P>
   NIH says all those risks apply to people with excessive
abdominal fat -- meaning a waist circumference of more than 40
inches in men and more than 35 inches in women -- and people with a
body mass index of 25 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Someone with a body mass index of 30 or more, the level
considered obese, is about 30 pounds overweight -- roughly 221
pounds in a 6-foot person or 186 pounds in a 5-foot-6 person.

<HEADLINE> Bergen County hospital: Massages reduce pain for chronically ill  </HEADLINE>
By NINA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Staff and patients at a Bergen County
hospital agree: A program there offering massages to the
chronically ill has reduced their anxiety and dependence on
painkillers and helped them sleep better.
</P>
<P>
   A long-term care unit at Bergen Regional Medical Center is
working with a Westwood massage school as part of a pilot program
offering the rubdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not as preoccupied with their health complaints,''
April Judge, the nurse in charge of the unit, said of her patients.
''You see more smiles on their faces. They just seem happier.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 60-bed unit is filled with people who have multiple
sclerosis, are recovering from a stroke or are suffering from some
other debilitating illness. Many are wheelchair-bound or bedridden.
Some of the MS patients have been there almost two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like a new person,'' said Helen Christiano, 65, of
Lodi. The retired credit manager is learning to walk again after a
stroke. She has been hospitalized for 18 months while her husband
waits at home for her to recover. ''This relaxes me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Healing Hands Institute for Massage Therapy, which offers a
certification in hospital-based massage therapy, sends students to
the hospital once a week as part of their training. They give
massages free of charge to about 20 patients who take pain
medication daily.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials say the partnership with the school is the
first of its kind in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Medical massage is an important addition to the treatment (of
long-term care patients), especially as it relates to pain
management in the geriatric population,'' said Fred S. Sganga,
president and CEO of Bergen Regional Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Sganga hopes to make the massages a permanent fixture in the
hospital's entire long-term care division, which has 691 beds in a
nursing home setting.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, restful rubdowns that are not part of a physical
therapy program are ''not well received'' by most insurers, Sganga
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicians hope that will change soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should be incorporating complementary medicine into
conventional medicine. That's the wave of the future,'' said Dr.
Louis Teichholz, medical director for complementary medicine at
Hackensack University Medical Center. The center runs two spas for
public and patient use.
</P>
<P>
   Spa services are not covered by insurance, he said, and unlike
the Bergen program, patients must pay.
</P>
<P>
   Teichholz, who is also chief of cardiology at Hackensack, said
massage therapy relaxes muscles and reduces stress, which is
important because stress weakens the immune system and slows
healing.
</P>
<P>
   Massages also reduce swelling, increase blood flow and
flexibility, and restore tone to flaccid muscles, proponents say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to show that this works well enough so insurance
companies eventually pay for it,'' Teichholz said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is one of 29 states that require message therapists
to be licensed. Therapists must complete, on average, 500 hours of
training before receiving certification, according to the American
Message Therapy Association.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Army Col. Assassinated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Gunmen assassinated an off-duty
Colombian army colonel as he watched a children's beauty contest
with his wife and 10-year-old daughter, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two hit men walked into the event Saturday night in Rivera, a
small town in southern Huila state, shot Col. Oscar Trujillo two
times in the head, and then fled on a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   Huila, where Trujillo was gunned down, has been the scene of
fierce attacks in recent days by Colombia's largest leftist
insurgency, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   The officer was on vacation, hundreds of miles from where he is
stationed. Trujillo commands an army battalion in the violent
northern banana-growing region known as Uraba, an area teeming with
leftist rebels and rival rightist paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they had no hard leads yet into who killed
Trujillo. But the regional army commander, Gen. Carlos Ospina of
the army's Fourth Division, said he suspected the FARC urban
commandoes active in Huila. The group has assassinated high-ranking
military officers in the past.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Hostage Hopes Rise  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Flying his plane over the
Philippine island of Jolo, Malaysian pilot Fong Shaufah focused his
gaze on a chain of forested mountains, wondering where Muslim
guerrillas are holding his son and dozens of other hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, who works for a Malaysian air charter company, was hired
to fly Malaysian officials to the Philippines to monitor
negotiations for the release of his son, Ken, and other hostages
held by separatist Abu Sayyaf rebels, some for as long as four
months.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he flew with high hopes to Jolo to pick up four
Malaysian hostages freed by the rebels. Unfortunately, his son
wasn't among them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a flurry of releases this past week has rekindled hopes
among the captives' relatives that the hostage standoff is nearing
an end.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us, the worst time was the first week,'' Fong said. ''We
didn't know where they were and we didn't know whether they were
dead or alive. Now, there is much better hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken was among 21 people taken hostage April 23 at Malaysia's
Sipadan diving resort and brought to the Philippines by boat. Abu
Sayyaf guerrillas later kidnapped 13 Filipino Christian evangelists
and three French TV journalists. A separate armed group on Jolo is
believed to be holding a German reporter for Der Spiegel magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Following the latest releases, the groups were believed to be
holding six French people, three Germans, two Finns, two South
Africans, three Malaysians and 15 Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the rebels released their first European hostage,
Renate Wallert of Germany. On Thursday, they released the son of a
Philippine government soldier who was killed in a clash with the
guerrillas, and on Friday they freed two Filipino teachers and the
four Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
   Government negotiators called the releases a breakthrough that
would lead to the rapid freedom of the other hostages.
</P>
<P>
   But the optimism has been tempered by growing disputes among the
rebel leaders over their demands and the division of ransom
payments. Tensions also erupted Thursday within the government
negotiating team: Chief negotiator Robert Aventajado accused Lee
Peng Wee, a former presidential adviser with business interests in
Malaysia, of violating instructions and endangering the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the hostage crisis began, the Philippines' government has
been at a loss on how to resolve the standoff, particularly because
of the large number of foreigners being held.
</P>
<P>
   Government negotiators initially tried to intimidate the rebels
by having soldiers encircle their hinterland camp on Jolo. That led
to clashes and warnings from foreign governments against employing
force.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to use the military, the government then focused on
negotiations. But bargaining with the Abu Sayyaf commanders has
proved difficult because of the rebels' loose chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Abu Sayyaf have five different leaders, so it takes a
while to get their concurrence,'' Aventajado said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While some rebel commanders have emphasized political demands,
including a separate Islamic nation and improved treatment of
Filipinos living in neighboring Malaysia, another faction is mainly
interested in money and is demanding $1 million for each European
hostage, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines has a no-ransom policy, and President Joseph
Estrada has urged the rebels to accept offers of development
projects from countries like Libya, Malaysia and Germany. However,
emissaries working for the government negotiators reported that
ransoms were covertly paid to secure the release of the Malaysians
and the German woman.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf commanders Ghalib Andang and Mujib Susukan, who have
direct custody of the hostages, are demanding $1 million for each
hostage as well as an orange plantation for farmers on Jolo and
other efforts to create jobs, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappings will surely keep investors and tourists away
from Jolo for a long time. But local politicians say the crisis has
focused attention on the island's wrenching poverty, and they hope
it will prod the government to spend on development projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''The islands, the blue waters, they are fantastic,'' Fong said.
''But unless the problems are solved, nobody will come to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong said he hadn't abandoned hope for the release of his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still hopeful,'' he said. ''I'm still waiting.''

<HEADLINE> Chavez Challenger Also Plotted Coup  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Like the president he's trying to
unseat in next Sunday's election, Francisco Arias Cardenas took up
arms against a previous government and paid for it with a jail
term. And like the president, he says he wants to govern for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike populist President Hugo Chavez, Arias talks more
about good management than revolution, courts private investors and
gets along with the Catholic Church. He speaks fondly of the United
States and criticizes Chavez's alliance with Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Arias's moderation has earned him the support of the middle and
upper classes. But polls say it isn't getting him far with the poor
majority in this South American nation of 23 million people, so a
victory is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Chavez took office only 17 months ago, new elections
have been called for president, congressmen, governors, mayors and
local councilmen as part of a new constitution pushed through by
Chavez last year.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was originally set for May, but was postponed because
of technical glitches in the computer system used to tally votes.
Arias' supporters had hoped he would use the extra time to close
the gap in the polls, but recent surveys have Chavez still leading
by 15 percentage points or more.
</P>
<P>
   When Arias launched his candidacy in March, many Venezuelans
thought he might win because of his shared history as a former coup
plotter who rose up against a government widely considered corrupt
-- and because of his perceived independence from political elites
most Venezuelans blame for squandering the country's oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But Arias, depicted by Chavez as a ''traitor'' bought by a
''rancid oligarchy,'' has been unable to shed an image as the
candidate of the rich -- a perception the candidate says is
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is Arias Cardenas is not from the elite,'' he told
The Associated Press. ''He is from a slum, from a humble provincial
town, the son of a taxi driver.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter campaign that has pitted rich against poor and
divided Venezuela like seldom before, Arias' sobriety seems no
match for Chavez's folksy charisma. At one campaign swing in a
Caracas slum, Chavez's supporters pelted Arias with bricks,
vegetables and trash. At another, they displayed a life-size effigy
of Arias with a sign on its chest reading: ''traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias and the other three former military officers who helped
Chavez lead his failed 1992 coup attempt have all broken with the
president, saying he has betrayed the original goals of their
rebellion and grabbed too much power.
</P>
<P>
   According to Arias's friends, the differences between him and
Chavez began to surface shortly after the two were jailed following
their coup. Arias, who spent his teen years studying to become a
priest, was never comfortable with Chavez's leftist agenda, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a two-time governor of the oil-rich state of Zulia, Arias
welcomed private capital in state enterprises like the sea port,
airport and a bridge spanning Lake Maracaibo. He says Chavez's
revolutionary discourse is scaring off investors and increasing
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ''This class confrontation, this friction between poor and rich,
is only going to bring more hunger and more misery,'' he said in
the interview.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's running for president to rescue Venezuela from what
he calls Chavez's catastrophic rule that saw Venezuela's economy
shrink by 7 percent last year despite a boom in world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Gladys, offered another explanation. She told the AP
her husband was angered by Chavez's attacks on another coup leader,
former secret police chief Jesus Urdaneta. She said he was also
upset that members of the president's Fifth Republic Movement began
accusing Arias of corruption when he was governor of Zulia.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of why he's running, wealthier Venezuelans see Arias
as their best chance of stopping what they consider Chavez's
assault on democracy. Most of his support appears to be based on an
intense dislike of Chavez rather than any great fondness for Arias.
</P>
<P>
   At one Arias campaign rally, biochemist Carmen Hernandez said
she was voting for Arias in hopes of booting Chavez out.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we do not get rid of this man, we are going to have a
second Cuba here,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Cenk Koray, a Turkish television host and
journalist, died Sunday of a heart attack in his Istanbul home,
news reports said. He was 56.
</P>
<P>
   Koray amused Turkish TV audiences during much of the 1970s and
1980s with his wit and humor as host of entertainment and game
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Adana, southern Turkey, in 1944, Koray trained as a
lawyer but chose journalism as a career instead. His lucky break
came when he was asked to stand in for another popular TV presenter
who was on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, Koray had been writing a column for the
daily newspaper Aksam and was the spokesman for his favorite soccer
team, Istanbul's Besiktas, until last season.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Races Between 2 Summits  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Okinawa (AP) -- One was a lovefest of farewell toasts and
pre-cooked communiques. The other is a slugfest of grinding
negotiations and uncertain results.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton raced between two summits 7,600 miles apart.
One was on Okinawa with smiling presidents and prime ministers of
the world's industrial powers. The other is at Camp David with
grim-faced leaders of the Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa toasted Clinton as ''a great leader of the democratic
world.'' Camp David tested his mettle as a peacemaker, the legacy
he so dearly desires.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my last photo, so be serious -- do this right,''
Clinton said jokingly as he posed for his final group photograph
with the leaders of Russia, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada
and Japan. Maybe you'll be back, someone suggested. ''Not under our
Constitution,'' replied Clinton, who leaves office in six months.
''This is it.''
</P>
<P>
   All the leaders spoke warmly about Clinton, expressing ''immense
affection'' as well as ''our real admiration for his strength and
his leadership over these past few years,'' British Prime Minister
Tony Blair said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all going to miss him very greatly, indeed,'' Blair
added.
</P>
<P>
   The lighthearted mood in Okinawa stood in contrast to the tense
talks at Camp David in Maryland. There, Clinton spent nine days
trying to find grounds for compromise between Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on issues
inflaming a half century of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really hard. It's the hardest thing I've ever seen,'' the
president said during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rearranged his Okinawa schedule to fly back to
Washington a few hours early to refocus on Camp David, where the
talks have been on low throttle during his absence. He was to go
directly from Air Force One to a helicopter to fly to the
mountaintop presidential retreat without stopping at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters here he could not talk about Camp David
because of the news blackout rule. ''But I can say that they have
not wasted the time,'' he said Sunday in Japan. ''They've really
worked. And I'm very grateful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether we get an agreement or not, they have tried,'' Clinton
said. He said that ''whatever happens, I think they have continued
to make headway.''
</P>
<P>
   A summit statement applauded Clinton's peace efforts and pledged
financial help from wealthy industrial nations to help underwrite
the multibillion dollar cost of any Mideast agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left behind in Okinawa a blizzard of pre-negotiated
summit agreements expressing high-minded resolve to help poor
nations escape crushing debt, combat infectious diseases, improve
education and join the high-technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The communiques echoed Clinton's mantra of ''putting a human
face on the global economy,'' a theme he has emphasized as the
United States tries to recoup from its embarrassing failure to
launch a new round of world trade talks in Seattle last year.
</P>
<P>
   All the words in Okinawa were designed to battle a growing
populist backlash against globalization, led by labor unions and
environmental organizations and human rights groups who believe
that while the rich countries are doing fine in an increasingly
interconnected global economy, the world's poor are being left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   But Jubilee 2000, which has enlisted the support of a wide range
of religious leaders from Pope John Paul II to Billy Graham for its
cause of wiping out the debt of the poorest nations, made it clear
it felt the Okinawa summit's grand promises fell short of the hard
cash that is needed to make debt relief a reality. So far, only
nine of 40 countries have qualified for any relief.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration and other world leaders insisted
that Okinawa at least had made a start.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest discord was over Clinton's program to develop a
missile defense shield to protect the United States from possible
attack from nations such as North Korea and Iraq. The president and
Russia's Vladimir Putin remained sharply at odds over the project,
which Moscow says could destabilize nuclear deterrence and spark a
new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   France and Germany joined in to underscore their opposition to
the U.S. program.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, White House officials were upbeat about the
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very good summit,'' Clinton told reporters before his
15-hour journey back to America for what he obviously hoped would
be a Mideast summit with the same outcome.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Prize-Winning Film  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Since he won the Grand Prize at the prestigious
Cannes Film Festival in May, Chinese director Jiang Wen says, his
life has been like an Alfred Hitchcock thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Censors have refused to allow his movie about wartime China to
be screened in his homeland and, what's worse, they won't tell him
why. They also want to confiscate the movie's negatives, and Jiang
fears that he'll eventually be banned from directing and acting in
China.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a little absurd and it's a little terrifying,'' Jiang
said with an exasperated voice during a telephone interview from
his hometown, Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The main obstacle, he said, appears to be political.
</P>
<P>
   In an unpublished document circulating among Beijing's film
community, censors have branded Jiang's film, ''Devils on the
Doorstep,'' unpatriotic. The film portrays Chinese villagers who
capture a wounded Japanese soldier near the end of World War II.
They treat him well until deciding to trade him for food.
</P>
<P>
   ''Devils on the Doorstep'' is not the only work of art having
problems here: Worried about political challenges at a time of
fast-paced change, Communist Party media czars are trying to clamp
down on the arts. They have banned liberal intellectuals from
publishing and proscribed several books considered too political or
risque.
</P>
<P>
   Already the fallout over ''Devils'' has also claimed another
film casualty. Censors scotched this month's planned release of
critically acclaimed director Ang Lee's martial arts epic
''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' because its distributor, the
Hong Kong-registered Asian Union Film and Entertainment Company,
helped Jiang spirit ''Devils'' to Cannes without Beijing's
approval, industry insiders said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang appeared at Cannes along with his film as it won the
prestigious prize. One government censor acknowledged that
''Devils'' was being held up because Jiang violated regulations
that require official approval before a movie can be shown at
international film festivals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't had a chance yet to make a final ruling on the
film's content because we're still considering the legal issue,''
said Zhou Jiandong, an official at the State Administration of
Radio, Film and Television's conservative censorship committee for
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou said the committee would not rule out blocking Jiang from
making more movies in China. What happens to the director partly
depends on ''his attitude'' and whether he cooperates, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang says he never kept his 2-hour, 40-minute film a secret
from the government and even had a mandatory government-run
partner, the China Film Co-production Company.
</P>
<P>
   The director, who is also an actor and the star of his film,
dismisses the government's stated concerns. He says its real
motivations are contained in the unpublished critique.
</P>
<P>
   That document criticizes the film for having the Japanese
characters curse the Chinese as ''chink pigs'' too often. The film
also plays the Japanese national anthem too frequently, glorifying
the strength of Japan's military, and contains a vulgar shot of a
naked woman, the document says.
</P>
<P>
   The movie exaggerates the ''slavish side of the Chinese''
villagers, giving the impression that the Chinese neither hated nor
resisted the Japanese enemy, the report says: ''The only person who
dares to swear and resist the Japanese troops is a crazy man
disliked by the other villagers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little like the Cultural Revolution,'' Jiang said,
referring to the vicious political attacks common during the 1960s.
''I was really surprised. I don't understand why they're doing
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The director said his film is about human relationships, not
about politics. He complained that censors are not evaluating the
film as whole, but are basing their judgments on brief scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's interesting is that right-wing nationalists in Japan
also hate this movie,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Gets Accolades After G-8 Debut  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Okinawa (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin made a
strong showing at his first appearance at the exclusive club of the
world's richest nations.
</P>
<P>
   So strong, in fact, that the group may change its format to
include Russia in all its meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, elected in March and inaugurated just 2&AMP;frac12; months ago, won
broad praise from fellow leaders at this year's summit of the Group
of Eight leading industrialized nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder praised the Russian
president's ''confident, but not overdrawn, appearance,'' and
suggested the group do away with its two-tier format in which
Russia is excluded from full participation in meetings on purely
financial matters.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac lauded Putin as a champion of
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had the impression that he has a great determination to
implement reforms as rapidly as possible,'' Chirac said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to Okinawa, Putin made a brief stop in North Korea,
where he apparently got a promise from leader Kim Jong Il to
abandon Pyongyang's missile program in exchange for other nations'
help in launching North Korean satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The move, widely interpreted as an attempt by Moscow to undercut
Washington's main argument for a proposed national missile defense
system, helped Putin grab the limelight at the start of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also made a pre-summit visit to China, where he and
Chinese President Jiang Zemin jointly condemned the U.S. missile
defense plans.
</P>
<P>
   Putin spoke at length about North Korea at the G-8 leaders'
first dinner, then offered additional details during the bilateral
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed reservations about North Korea's
promise on the missile issue, saying it remains vague. Other
leaders said they were very impressed by Putin's Korean
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said his visit to Pyongyang was necessary to help end
North Korea's international isolation and take a close look at the
alleged missile threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are concerns about the missile program, we must first
learn what the program is,'' he said. ''Before making decisions
that have a global impact, one must have a reliable information.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin denied that his trip to North Korea was intended to
embarrass the Clinton administration by deepening its rift with
such allies as France and Germany, who strongly oppose the proposed
defense shield.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't trying to cheat anyone, or drive anyone into the
corner,'' Putin said. ''We are defending our position, drawing new
arguments, and I had an impression that my arguments received a
favorable impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin was less successful on easing Russia's debt burden.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow had hoped to use the summit to negotiate a write-off of
$42 billion in Soviet-era loans it owes to Western governments.
Germany and others warned from the start that was out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at length about Russia's interest in the broad global
problems that dominated the summit, such as the development of
information technologies and genetic science.
</P>
<P>
   Putin easily delved into the complex issues, proposing at some
point that the G-8 leaders exchange e-mail addresses. Some
officials, however, questioned whether security risks would prevent
Internet correspondence among world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's sharp, matter-of-fact manner vividly contrasted with the
style of his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, who was plagued by health
problems and relished in bear hugs and extravagant statements.
</P>
<P>
   The vision of Putin hobnobbing with the world's most powerful
men would likely help further boost Putin's image at home.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians felt pride when they saw their 47-year-old
president, who has a black belt in judo, also receiving the
ultimate karate honor -- a ninth-degree black belt from the master
of one of the major styles of the martial art in Okinawa.

<HEADLINE> Authorities see new wave of counterfeit cash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A lot of people in Connecticut have been
making money on computers. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities estimate about $400,000 in computer-generated
counterfeit cash hit the state last year and a string of recent
cases has caught their attention.
</P>
<P>
   High-quality, low-cost color printers have bred a new type of
computer-savvy counterfeiter. They use off-the-shelf computers,
image scanners and printers to generate thousands in fake bills
every year. About half of the counterfeit bills found in
Connecticut are now computer-generated, said Mark Enright of the
U.S. Secret Service in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Enright's office, founded during the Civil War to thwart
counterfeiters, is responsible for investigating the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-assisted counterfeiting isn't new. But the problem has
been steadily worsening over the last decade, Enright said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Fourth of July, a pair of Hartford men were arrested at
Lake Compounce amusement park in Bristol carrying hundreds of
dollars in fake $10 bills. Police believe they changed over $400 at
the park before being caught.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a Meriden man pleaded guilty to manufacturing
more than $3,000 in phony dough on his home computer. He faces up
to 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. In April, a Southington
man was charged with forgery for passing fake money at a service
station.
</P>
<P>
   Cases have also been reported in New Britain, Middletown and in
Plainville, where police say there were six incidents in the last
three months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clerks and business managers have to be very careful handling
cash,'' said Plainville police Lt. Brian Mullins.
</P>
<P>
   Phony bills found in the area were all copies of the old-style
currency in denominations of ten, five, and even one dollar. New
bill designs contain several hard-to-replicate features.
</P>
<P>
   The fakes can look real, but they never feel quite right. There
is nothing available on the open market to replicate the paper used
in genuine greenbacks, Enright said
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually, the paper is a dead giveaway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Criminals usually try to pass the money at busy stores where
clerks don't have time to carefully look at every bill. They pass a
counterfeit and then take the change in real bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a place like Lake Compounce where every two feet is a
concession stand or a game ... it's easy to pass it,'' Enright
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service makes about 25 arrests a year in Connecticut,
Enright said. The agency is currently investigating several
counterfeiting rings in Hartford, New Haven, and Fairfield
Counties, he said.

<HEADLINE> In the 1990s, 64 companies shut down after receiving state aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - More than 60 companies which received aid
from the Connecticut Development Authority during the 1990s have
since closed, an investigation by The Sunday Republican shows.
</P>
<P>
   According to records obtained by the paper, the Connecticut
Development Authority gave loans and loan guarantees to 881
companies to expand or create new jobs between July 1, 1991, and
June 30, 1999. Of those, 64 had gone out of business or left the
state by June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, those 64 companies received $36 million in CDA loans
and bank loan guarantees, and took 1,275 jobs with them.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies receiving loans designed to boost employment did
not fail, but cut more than 5,000 jobs during that same time frame.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, records show the CDA lent $28 million to at least 20
companies that went on to fail, including $14 million to the
Hartford Whalers hockey team, which ended up moving its 109 jobs to
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   CDA Executive Director Tony Roberto said policies have since
been put in place to close loopholes that allowed companies to
escape penalties despite failing to meet employment requirements
for their loans.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto said the CDA, a public-private agency, gave money more
liberally in the early 1990s to try to stem the rising tide of
layoffs and red ink Connecticut businesses were facing at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the job losses, the 881 companies receiving aid now have
1,451 more jobs than they had in 1991. Roberto said 8,341 new jobs
have been created at companies that haven't lost any employees.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that the CDA turned a profit the last two
years, and the Legislature continues to renew the agency's mandate
to take risks on behalf of business, whether through guarantees or
direct loans.

<HEADLINE> Stretch of Interstate 95 is one of most deadly in state  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   When Interstate 95 was built in the 1950s, the state
considered
it a pathway to prosperity for the shoreline cities through which
it wound.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, I-95 is considered treacherous, having claimed 130 lives
from 1993 to 1998 and six already this year.
</P>
<P>
   How did the road get so bad? State leaders will focus on the
issue, and ways to resolve it, during a statewide transportation
summit Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   I-95 opened Jan. 2, 1958 with 40,000 cars a day traveling the
road. Engineers predicted traffic would increase to 60,000 cars a
day by 1974 and the road would have to be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   The predictions rang true, but it wasn't until the Mianus River
Bridge in Greenwich collapsed in 1983 - killing three people - that
major repairs began. Even now, despite efforts by the state
Department of Transportation to relieve congestion, nearly all
construction efforts have gone into repairs and safety
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 160,000 cars a day pass through Bridgeport on I-95,
the DOT says.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has changed from bad to worse because there's just so much
on so little pavement,'' veteran radio traffic reporter Morgan
Kaolian told the Connecticut Post. ''The truckers have pretty much
taken over.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the latest year for which statistics are available,
there were 667 tractor-trailer accidents in the 111.6 miles between
the New York state line and Stonington - the majority of them on
the stretch from Greenwich to New Haven. In both 1998 and 1997, 22
people were killed in collisions on I-95 and 17 died in 1996,
according to the DOT.
</P>
<P>
   Kaolian believes that even doubling the six lanes of I-95 would
not alleviate the traffic crunch, particularly from local drivers
who hop on I-95 for a couple of exits. Bringing back the
controversial tolls and closing some exit ramps would reduce
traffic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Gov. John G. Rowland, say the number of trucks
which travel the highway and crowd rest stations and ramps when
they park for breaks has to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's scary,'' said Rowland, who admitted the situation is not
an easy one to solve. ''You can't wake up tomorrow and say 'Trucks,
don't come.'''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Martinez, chief of planning for the DOT, said truck
accidents along I-95 haven't substantially increased in recent
years. Trucks make up about 11 percent of the traffic and an equal
percentage of the accidents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers blame aggressive and inattentive motorists and
seemingly never-ending road construction.
</P>
<P>
   ''This part of the country is not truck driver-friendly,'' said
Donnie Phelps, of Clarksville, Tenn. ''I have to watch out for the
other guy more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   At the September summit, scheduled to be held in Hartford,
lawmakers plan to review technology and travel alternatives
available to improve all the state's roads. But I-95 will be a
focus.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said video cameras that allow state police to monitor
traffic and accidents on I-95 from Greenwich to New Haven have been
a positive advance. State Speaker of the House Moira Lyons,
D-Stamford, though, said weigh stations meant to ensure trucks meet
size and safety regulations are underused.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Jacqueline Cocco, a Bridgeport Democrat who co-chairs
the Legislature's Transportation Committee, said boosting the use
of public transportation could be the key.

carved headstone was prepared for him. His epitaph reads: ''The
tall, the wise, the reverend head, shall lie as low as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people think about him anymore. The cemetery where Kinne
lies has been abandoned, his grave decorated with nothing but pine
cones and low-bush blueberries in the woods behind a state
transportation depot.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his neighbors in the afterlife fared worse: headstones
tilt every which way, and many lie on the ground or under it,
covered by soil and greenery and decades of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Such small cemeteries dot the woodlands and subdivisions of
Connecticut like milestones to a map of state history, where
lopsided, forgotten tombstones become buried treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The sorry state of such cemeteries is being reversed in many
eastern Connecticut towns, driven by civic pride and the
Internet-fueled interest in genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the feeling is, the dead don't vote and they don't pay
taxes, so nobody cares about them,'' said Rusty Godino, a volunteer
on Ledyard's Cemetery Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ledyard has tried to reverse the trend with an adopt-a-cemetery
program. Groups, scout packs and families agree to care for a
cemetery by mowing grass and raking leaves. They keep watch for
vandals and report any serious problem, like broken tombstones or
crumbling walls.
</P>
<P>
   Other towns are trying to replicate Ledyard's program.
</P>
<P>
   In Voluntown, municipal workers are enlisted to clean out the
brush and make the cemeteries look respectable. Such work was
recently done where Kinne lies and efforts are underway to restore
the old burial ground.
</P>
<P>
   Some families have taken on cemetery restoration as a learning
project.
</P>
<P>
   Iva Arpin, of Griswold, and her family have raised stones,
gently cleaned them and catalogued the information they displayed.
One cemetery they fixed up was a party place for teen-agers; the
area was strewn with bottles and litter.
</P>
<P>
   The experience fueled an interest in American history in her
children and taught them respect, Arpin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a family researcher,'' Arpin said. ''I decided I wanted to
do something to make people aware of their history.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is really sure how many cemeteries are in Connecticut. A
Works Progress Administration project in the 1930s under Charles R.
Hale found 2,269 cemeteries, including long-abandoned plots under
reservoirs and state highways.
</P>
<P>
   But some cemeteries and graves catalogued by Hale have
disappeared and others have been found that the project did not
uncover, said Ruth Shapleigh-Brown, executive director of the
Connecticut Gravestone Network.
</P>
<P>
   The Hale Collection of tombstone inscriptions is on file at the
Connecticut State Library for the use of people interested in
genealogy, or the study of family descent.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogy interest has grown as baby boomers age and thanks to
the Internet, which provides information on free and easy-to-use
sites, Shapleigh-Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of the members of the Gravestone Network
joined the effort to preserve and restore cemeteries because of
their genealogy interest.
</P>
<P>
   Caring for the cemeteries is mostly a volunteer job. Many old
cemeteries still have associations that were formed decades ago to
see to the upkeep of the dead, but as cemeteries got full and the
money ran out the associations dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows towns to take over the upkeep of abandoned
burial grounds, but the state does not require towns to spend any
money on the plots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything lacks time, staffing, money,'' Shapleigh-Brown
said. ''I'd say most towns just abandon their old cemetery sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten graves can create problems for developers. As soon as
a backhoe uncovers a skeleton or grave, work must stop while the
police are consulted, said state archaeologist Nick Bellantoni.
</P>
<P>
   One such finding generated a stir in Griswold about 10 years
ago, when a forgotten burial site was found during a mining
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The finding became known as the ''Griswold vampire legend,''
although Bellantoni said the facts have nothing to do with the
vampires of movie fame.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was fear of tuberculosis that led people in the early
19th century to dig up the bones of their ancestors and rearrange
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some families believed the disease was transmitted from
deceased family members. They thought the dead were undead, and
could leave the housing of their grave and be mischievous - spread
the disease to living family members,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that thighbones of a skeleton had been removed
and crossed over the chest, and a head that had been removed was
placed on the chest. Other evidence showed the heart was removed.
</P>
<P>
   The finding provided a ''unique insight'' into the stress and
fear of disease in the 1820s and 1830s, Bellantoni said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped the grass-roots efforts to find, catalog,
research and preserve cemeteries will lead to a protection policy
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless that kind of research is done, nobody's going to know
what's there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Troopers say state's left-lane law will be enforced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GIBSONIA, Pa. (AP) - Warnings issued to left-lane drivers on the
Pennsylvania Turnpike are running out, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   From January to March this year, 220 motorists were cited for
hogging the left lane on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, police said.
The citations stem from a new state law adopted in December that
prohibits motorists from driving in the left lane of limited-access
highways except when passing other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're issued a lot of warnings and now we're citing drivers,''
said state police Cpl. Ahmed Shareef of Gibsonia north of
Pittsburgh in Butler County. ''The law seems pretty cut and dry,
although a lot of people say they never heard about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that if a motorist driving in the left lane blocks the
regular flow of traffic and fails to merge right after a trooper
has trailed him or her for three miles, the motorist can expect a
ticket. The fine is $25, but can rise to $100 with court costs and
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the law is vague, and roadways lack signs warning
drivers that too much time in the left lane is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone told me this is what they were cited for, I'd say,
'You must be mistaken,''' said Pittsburgh attorney Melissa Owen.
''It definitely has some problems with the way it reads now.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen and Shawn Stephenson, a suburban Pittsburgh attorney
specializing in motor vehicle law, said the law doesn't say how
long a motorist can be in the left lane after passing another
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The law also doesn't account for cars that move left to make
room for other cars merging onto a roadway or for driving in the
center lane of six-lane highways.
</P>
<P>
   The law says vehicles must be in the right lane except when
passing other vehicles or if they are directed into the left lane
by road signs, troopers or other traffic control devices. Drivers
are allowed to drive in the left lane up to two miles in
anticipation of turning left off a roadway.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Haver, a spokesman for AAA West Penn/West Virginia/South
Central Ohio, said his organization plans to lobby for changes in
the new law, mostly because of the lack of signs alerting drivers
to it. Other states with similar laws, such as New Jersey, have
erected such signs.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Myslewicz, a spokesman for the state Department of
Transportation, said PennDOT has no plans to put up any signs
regarding the left-lane law.

<HEADLINE> Hanover and Morristown bicker over who should deal with campsite  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HANOVER, N.J. (AP) - Two Morris County towns are exchanging
fighting words over who should deal with occupants of a campsite
along the west bank of the Whippany River.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five years, Mike Macabee and several homeless
friends have lived quietly in an encampment in Hanover. However,
the property is owned by Morristown, which has a sewage treatment
plant there.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hanover officials accused Morristown of violating the
township's land-use laws by allowing the men to remain at the
wooded site.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our opinion, the Morristown sewer plant is not a legitimate
place for housing the homeless,'' Hanover Administrator Joseph
Giorgio told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Sunday's editions.
''They should be provided the services they deserve. Morristown has
to take some action to address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Morristown officials replied that police in the neighboring town
are free to arrest the trespassers and deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Macabee and his friends are caught in the middle of
the feud and say they don't understand why the towns will not leave
them alone.
</P>
<P>
   Macabee and the two other regulars keep the grounds neat.
They've set up three tents for sleeping and use a fourth tent for
storage. They even have a shower with heated water through a solar
bag they bought at a shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would you rather have us bumming on the streets, or being
self-sufficient here?'' Macabee asked.
</P>
<P>
   Macabee does not have a regular job, but he picks up work
periodically to pay for his share of what the men need: food,
clothes, toiletries, camping equipment and beer.
</P>
<P>
   With the situation escalating, Macabee and the others say they
will have to find another place to set up camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to do what they're going to do, and I guess that
means we will have to go,'' Macabee said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover officials said they have been trying unsuccessfully to
get Morristown to deal with the situation since officials
discovered the campsite while walking the east side of Whippany
River months ago.
</P>
<P>
   They first tried to get social service agencies to help find
places for the men, but the men at the campsite refused to accept
the help.
</P>
<P>
   So Hanover officials said they approached Morristown about
addressing the situation, but got tough after Morristown took no
action.
</P>
<P>
   Morristown Administrator Eric Maurer said the superintendent of
the sewer plant didn't see anyone living there when he walked the
property after receiving a phone call from Hanover officials.
</P>
<P>
   Maurer said he didn't hear any other complaints until last week
when he received a letter from Hanover accusing Morristown of
violating its land-use law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't ignore them, by any stretch of the imagination,''
Maurer said. ''If there are trespassers there, we'll have to call
police, and that would be their police.''
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio opposes intervention from law enforcement, and Hanover
police said they have not had any problems with the men living at
the campsite.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people didn't commit any crimes,'' Giorgio said. ''We
should not reduce a social problem to a police matter unless there
is a need.''

<HEADLINE> DeLay Decries Cuba Embargo Vote  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House's third-ranking Republican said
Sunday that he is ashamed of his colleagues for voting to ease the
U.S. trade embargo against Cuba and its ''ruthless, murdering
dictator,'' Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas believes Castro would use the
food and medicines to increase repression in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Two House amendments, both sponsored by Republicans, that were
approved last week would ease sanctions in place for almost four
decades against the communist-ruled island.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments would restore virtually unlimited travel to Cuba
as well as allowing export of food and medicine to Cuba. They were
included in legislation to finance the Treasury Department in the
next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's really unfortunate, and frankly, it's the first
time I have really been ashamed of the House of Representatives,''
DeLay said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of helping the Cuban president, he said, Congress should
have been ''turning down the screws on this dictator that kills
people, has killed American citizens over international waters, has
put people in jail for being dissident.''
</P>
<P>
   The House vote was 301-116 to allow sales of food and medicine
to Cuba. Voting ''yes'' were 119 Republicans, 180 Democrats and two
independents. Opposed were 93 Republicans and 23 Democrats. The
provision's sponsor was Rep. Jerry Moran, R-Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The travel vote was 232-186, with support from 60 Republicans,
171 Democrats and one independents. Voting ''no'' were 153
Republicans, 32 Democrats and one independent.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said Democrats provided the important support, even though
Republicans Moran and Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina sponsored
the two amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overwhelmingly, the majority of the Republicans voted against
this,'' DeLay said. ''All those that believe in appeasement and
have sympathy toward Fidel Castro come from the Democrat side.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a ruthless, murdering dictator in Cuba, and all the
food will go through him,'' DeLay said. ''He'll use that food and
medicine as a tool to continue to oppress his people.''
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ''This Week,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta
welcomed the legislation as long as its benefits go to the Cuban
people and not Castro's government. Generally, the Clinton
administration has not supported tourist travel to Cuba for fear
the influx of money would boost Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to try to work with Congress to see if we can
implement that policy of creating ... more people-to-people
contacts, which the travel amendment goes to, and to provide food
and medicine to the people of Cuba,'' Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned, ''We want to do it in a way that doesn't support
the Castro government. So I think we can work something out.''

<HEADLINE> Time running out on pet bills in current Congress  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Sure, it's only July. But with presidential
and congressional campaigning about to take center stage, time is
running short to get bills through the 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Since this term began in 1999, New Jersey's 13 representatives
have cumulatively filed more than 380 pieces of legislation on such
varied topics as the flammability of children's sleepwear, import
duties on chocolate and the future of Atlantic striped bass.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, according to the Library of Congress Internet
site, Rep. Rob Andrews, D-Haddon Heights, led New Jersey lawmakers
with 100 bills or amendments proposed, while Rep. Frank LoBiondo,
R-Vineland, had offered just eight.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed bills are a guide to a legislator's priorities in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 proposed by Rep. Donald Payne, D-Newark, nine deal
with the topic of Africa, a continent that Payne has visited
numerous times. The House approved Payne's bill to congratulate the
people of Senegal for holding multiparty elections. But he was
unsuccessful in his effort to provide $15 million to the National
Democratic Alliance of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Rep. Marge Roukema, R-Ridgewood, has devoted many of
her 21 bills to the subject of finance, an appropriate interest for
the chairwoman of the House Banking subcommittee on financial
institutions. Most of the bills still await a first hearing,
although the House did pass her resolution encouraging the
international Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Most legislative proposals go nowhere. In the two-year life of
the last Congress, members of the House introduced nearly 6,000
bills (which, if passed, become laws if signed by the president)
and resolutions (which do not carry the weight of law). Just over
1,000 were approved.
</P>
<P>
   Some bills seem to be introduced merely to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Does Rep. Jim Saxton, R-Mount Holly, really expect the House to
name an ocean-dumping site the ''Albert Gore Jr. Mud Dump Site?''
That bill, which has had no hearings since Saxton introduced it in
January, is an attempt to blame the vice president for controversy
over a deal he helped broker to end dumping six miles off Sandy
Hook.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rush Holt of Pennington, a freshman Democrat, no doubt had
few illusions that the Republican-controlled House would pass his
bill to require licensing and registration of all handguns.
Introduced last November, the bill has not attracted a single
co-sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   And bills calling for amendments to the U.S. Constitution are
rarely adopted by Congress, but Andrews has proposed one to give
the president a line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a glance - by no means comprehensive - at other
bills of New Jersey lawmakers and their status in the 106th
Congress:
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-Paterson, has assembled support from 276
colleagues - more than half - for his bill to spend $5 billion over
five years in grants to local fire departments. A House committee
recently considered another Pascrell bill to require the government
to do a better job of informing veterans about available benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Rothman, D-Fair Lawn, won approval in May from the
House Judiciary Committee for a proposal to spend $60 million
annually for three years to help schools install metal detectors
and other security measures.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton signed into law a compromise version of
legislation sponsored by LoBiondo to stop deceptive practices of
some sweepstakes companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Smith, R-Robbinsville, has gathered 199 co-sponsors
for a bill to boost surveillance and research of autism, 52
co-sponsors for a similar measure targeting Lyme disease and five
co-sponsors for a bill to increase research funding for Alzheimer's
disease while ensuring that Medicare fully covers treatment for
those with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews has proposed a grant program to encourage schools to
establish or expand prekindergarten programs.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton won House approval for his proposal to create a
commission to mark the 100th birthday of the National Wildlife
Refuge System.
</P>
<P>
   A House committee approved legislation by Rep. Frank Pallone,
D-Long Branch, to name a post office in Long Branch, N.J., after
police Sgt. Pat King, who was killed in action in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-Harding, proposed restructuring the
New Deal-era Tennessee Valley Authority and selling most of its
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, introduced a bill last week
to require pipeline companies to offer more training to workers and
to test their pipelines for corrosion and mechanical defects.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Menendez, D-Union City, won House approval for a
measure requiring the Department of Transportation to study the
causes of crashes in New Jersey involving passenger vans.

<HEADLINE> Lazio and the littlest campaigners on the 2000 Senate trail  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHEATFIELD, N.Y. (AP) - It's a gorgeous July morning in western
New York, perfect for cutting hay or milking cows. Instead, two
dozen farmers are outside a barn listening as U.S. Senate candidate
Rick Lazio speaks.
</P>
<P>
   Misspeaks, actually.
</P>
<P>
   As he's done at many stops, Lazio introduces his wife, Patricia,
and their two daughters, then scans the crowd for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're having the ball of their lives,'' Lazio says of Molly,
8, and Kelsey, 6. ''They got to milk a little calf, and of course
their week is made now with that experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Milk a calf? Not on any farm around here, the farmers murmur
among themselves, gathered on a field in this aptly named farm town
near Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really do feel like I'm home when I'm here,'' Lazio tells
them, unaware of the calf-gaffe. ''And I want you to know how
grateful I am for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling at home may be the easiest part of political life for
the 42-year-old, four-term congressman. During much of the first
two months of his campaign, Lazio's entire family has traveled with
him from Brightwaters to Buffalo and back.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy that keeps the youthful candidate from missing
the comforts of home while boosting him politically. ''Vote for my
dad, he's great,'' the little Lazios bellow over a PA aboard a
campaign bus rolling through Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   The image of the congressman and his family also offers a stark
contrast to the Clintons, whose marriage woes are well chronicled.
The Clinton campaign took a stab at countering the image in late
June when Chelsea Clinton showed up at her mother's side at a City
Hall press conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Hillary Clinton made it clear then that, unlike the Lazios,
her college-age daughter would not be a fixture on the campaign
trail. ''She's going to be coming and going as she chooses,'' she
said. ''You'll be seeing her sometimes, which will be a delight for
me, and that's all I can tell you.'' She hasn't been seen since.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, the Lazios.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Lazio, who met her husband while studying to be a nurse,
even appears in the campaign's latest television commercial,
boosting her husband's stands on health care issues.
</P>
<P>
   And, while many newspapers were running stories about Clinton's
own recent bus tour, the reports were played alongside pictures of
a doting Daddy Lazio painting his daughter's fingernails or helping
them FEED MILK to a newborn calf.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a hometown guy, he's a real person,'' says Mary Donahue,
a court clerk attending a recent Lazio rally in Schenectady. ''Like
he said, he pumps gas, he goes to the grocery store like everybody
else.... He's winning me over.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Moeller, budget director for the town of Wheatfield,
says he was impressed by Lazio ''because he seems to be more down
to earth and more for the average, common person than I thought he
might be.''
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been busy,'' Patricia Lazio concedes during a Buffalo
Bisons double-header. It's near the end of a weeklong bus tour that
included three Fourth of July parades and visits to factories,
hospitals and village squares.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little bit reluctant about bringing the girls, but
they've been having such a great time,'' she says. ''And it's so
nice that we've gotten to spend some time together.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey, who enjoys Irish step-dancing, and Molly, who takes
ballet lessons, have become favorites of photographers who can't
get enough of the sisters - hanging out of the ''Mainstream
Express'' bus distributing Lazio hats, T-shirts and bumper
stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio girls have grown up in a political atmosphere, joining
their dad during congressional campaigns on Long Island. But the
Senate race has taken them farther afield in one of the most
closely watched elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience for them,'' their mother
says as the pair run to watch the antics of the Bisons' mascot.
''Just the things they've seen that they could never otherwise see
doing something like this. And the exposure and the experience has
been really fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio has trouble remembering the last movie he's seen,
noting that he's been a little preoccupied with the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was going to say ''Saving Private Ryan,'' he says, but then
the correct answer comes to him - as a look of horror envelopes his
face.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was that last unbelievably bad movie that I had to
take the kids to'' - the recent ''Pokemon'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, it was painful,'' he says. ''The first 10 minutes ...
there was no human sound. For 10 minutes! I'd like to run into the
creator of 'Pokemon' in a dark alley, I tell you that much. I'd be
the savior of a lot of parents.''

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Meeting To Open  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW PENNINGTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- North Korea's attendance at a regional
security forum here this week -- a major step toward breaking
decades of isolation -- will likely grab headlines, but the
meeting's hosts will also be grappling with their own issues of
cooperation and openness.
</P>
<P>
   At the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' annual round of
ministerial meetings, beginning Monday, the 10 ASEAN nations will
consider measures which could for the first time open up the
problems of each member-state to the scrutiny of the others. The
prospect is not appreciated by ASEAN's more closed societies, who
look upon it as interference in domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand, the outgoing chair of ASEAN, has called for a
revamping of the group ever since it failed to effectively respond
to Asia's 1997 economic crisis and the social upheaval that
followed. At Thailand's bidding, ASEAN ministers will consider the
idea of establishing a ministerial ''troika'' -- a three-country
diplomatic squad to address regional crises such as forest fires
that spread haze over frontiers and last year's violence in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, transnational crime, including trafficking in
drugs, arms and human beings, will be discussed at the ASEAN
Regional Forum for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures begin to breach a founding principle of ASEAN, set
up with five members 33 years ago as a Cold War bulwark against
communism: that a country's internal affairs, particularly its
politics, are its own affair.
</P>
<P>
   ASEAN now comprises liberal democracies like Thailand and the
Philippines as well as one-party regimes such as Laos, Vietnam and
Myanmar, also known as Burma. The other members are Brunei,
Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come for us to enhance our interaction to make
ASEAN relevant for the new globalized world,'' Thai Foreign
Minister Surin Pitsuwan said at a press conference last week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet efforts to broaden cooperation beyond traditional areas like
trade and investment -- for example, into cross-border concerns like
drugs and terrorism -- could run into opposition. Myanmar, for
example, is unlikely to welcome a discussion about drugs: The
military-run nation is the world's second-largest producer of
heroin and a big supplier of methamphetamine tablets to Thailand,
though it says it is doing all it can to combat the drug menace.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Thai proposal to institute a troika system
modeled on the European Union's three-nation ad hoc group for
urgent issues could be shot down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally, I think that the troika is a good idea but don't
think it will go through easily,'' said Eric Teo, honorary
secretary of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs
Council, an independent think-tank. ''Unlike the EU, ASEAN may not
be quite ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ASEAN Regional Forum, Asia's biggest security conference, is
already attended by countries such as the United States, Japan,
South Korea and China, and this year, North Korea will participate
for the first time. The move comes just weeks after communist North
Korea and pro-Western South Korea held a historic summit, beginning
a thaw in their long-icy relations.

<HEADLINE> 'What Lies Beneath' Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michelle Pfeiffer, Harrison Ford and an
underwater ghost scared off mutants and animated pocket monsters at
the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer and Ford's supernatural thriller ''What Lies Beneath''
debuted as the weekend's top movie with $30.1 million, according to
studio estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''X-men,'' the mutant superhero adventure that was last
weekend's winner, slipped to second place with $23.7 million,
pushing its total to $99.5 million in just 10 days. The movie's
three-day gross took a big drop of 56 percent from its $54.5
million opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pokemon the Movie 2000,'' the second cartoon installment based
on the pocket-monster craze, opened at No. 3 with $21.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The teen romance ''Loser,'' starring Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari
of ''American Pie,'' premiered at No. 7 with $6.1 million. Another
youth movie, the critically trashed thriller ''The In Crowd,''
debuted weakly at No. 12 with $1.5 million over the weekend,
raising its take since opening Wednesday to $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's new movies all received mixed reviews, but
audiences did not appear to mind. Overall, the top 12 movies
grossed $130 million, up 14 percent from the same weekend a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far this season, studio revenues have run 2 to 3 percent
ahead of last summer, when movies grossed a record $3 billion, said
Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks
box office figures. Revenues had been lower just a few weeks ago,
before huge opening weekends for ''Scary Movie'' and ''X-men.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Definitely, summer's back in a big way,'' Dergarabedian said.
''It means audiences want to go the movies. You just have to give
them something they want to see, and studios are delivering right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Robert Zemeckis, ''What Lies Beneath'' centers on a
wife haunted by watery visions of a missing woman with mysterious
ties to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ''This particular movie at this particular time filled a gap,''
said Jim Tharp, head of distribution for DreamWorks, which released
''What Lies Beneath.'' ''There wasn't much out there for adults,
and especially for adult females.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences for ''What Lies Beneath'' were 61 percent women and 64
percent over 25, Tharp said.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Pokemon'' sequel took in $9.5 million less than its
predecessor grossed over its opening weekend last November.
</P>
<P>
   '''Pokemon' certainly is not as strong in the marketplace as it
was when we opened the first one,'' said Dan Fellman, head of
distribution for Warner Bros., which released both movies. ''But
it's still a strong indication there are a lot of 'Pokemon' fans
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''What Lies Beneath,'' $30.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''X-men,'' $23.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Pokemon the Movie 2000,'' $21.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Scary Movie,'' $14.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''The Perfect Storm,'' $9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Disney's The Kid,'' $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   7 (tie). ''Loser,'' $6.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   7 (tie). ''The Patriot,'' $6.1 million.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Returning to Camp David  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Hurrying back from an abbreviated trip to
Asia, President Clinton was rejoining troubled Middle East talks at
Camp David on Sunday even as American mediators spoke of the
possibility of failure. ''We might reach a deal; we might not,'' a
summit spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   On a 13th day of talks -- the same period required to strike a
deal at the landmark 1978 Camp David summit -- neither Israel nor
the Palestinians signaled any change in position on the prime point
of dispute: Jerusalem. Both sides claim the ancient city as their
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball is in the Israeli court,'' said Hassan Abdel Rahman,
Washington envoy of the Palestine Liberation Organization and a
frequent spokesman during the talks. ''Will they do what is needed
to reach an agreement? Or will they stick to their unacceptable
positions?''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli spokesman Gadi Baltiansky suggested the Palestinians
would need to make concessions to move matters forward. With
Clinton's return, he said, ''We will try to see if there are
grounds for continuing this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking later on Israel television, Baltiansky said: ''It would
be easier to prophesy what will happen in 24 years than what will
happen here in the next 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who sat in for Clinton
after he left early Thursday for an economic summit in Japan, took
both Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak on separate excursions over the weekend. It marked the
first time the two leaders had left the secluded retreat since the
talks began.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Clinton's first
task upon returning would be to meet with his own negotiating team.
He said no schedule had been set for the evening, but he would not
be surprised if Clinton met both leaders late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about prospects for the summit going forward, he said
Clinton's initial assessment would be extremely important. After
U.S. officials prematurely declared Wednesday that the summit had
ended without an agreement, ''one hesitates to make any kind of
prediction,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   No deadline has been set for completing the talks, but Boucher
said the U.S. mediation effort could not continue indefinitely.
''We are not here for an unlimited period of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the summit, American spokesmen have freely
acknowledged the atmosphere has been very tense at times. Boucher
said that remained the case as the two sides grappled with the
toughest issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It continues to be very hard, and we continue to try to move
forward,'' Boucher said. ''We might reach a deal; we might not.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said before leaving Japan that whatever the outcome, the
two sides had made a genuine effort to resolve their long-standing
disputes over Jerusalem, the boundaries of a Palestinian state and
the fate of several million Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can say they have not wasted their time. They have really
worked,'' the president said. ''Whether we get an agreement or not,
I can't tell. But they have really worked.''
</P>
<P>
   If any agreement is reached, both leaders must prepare for a
fierce backlash at home.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, almost toppled by hard-liners before he left for the
summit, came under renewed criticism Sunday from Jewish settlers.
Settler leader Zeev Hever said most settlers would refuse to budge
from homes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip no matter what might be
decided at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not scared off. We are going to stay on the ground,''
Hever told Israel's army radio.
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian side, the radical Islamic group Hamas drew
1,500 people Saturday to a rally in the Gaza Strip demanding that
Arafat abandon the summit and resume the fight to destroy Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher refused to comment on developments in the region but
said the leaders are aware that any agreement they might reach
''will be tested in public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, an Israeli official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, denied reports that the case of Jonathan Jay Pollard, an
American convicted and jailed for spying for Israel, was among
issues on the table at Camp David. Israel has long pressed for
Pollard's release.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher refused comment on whether Pollard's case was raised. He
said he cannot answer questions dealing with ''what might or might
not be discussed up there.''

<HEADLINE> Cheap Thrills: Stephen King tests honesty of online readers  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Is Stephen King trying to kill his publishers?
Or just scare the daylights out of them?
</P>
<P>
   In an ambitious and quirky experiment beginning Monday, the king
of horror is offering up the first two installments of a previously
unpublished serial novel by posting them on his Web site and asking
readers to pony up a buck for each copy they download. If the honor
system works, the episodes will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's eliminating his publisher from the process - and
the story line of ''The Plant'' is about a creeping ''vampire''
plant that takes over a publishing company - King says the only
people he's interested in scaring are his readers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love my editors, and I like my publisher,'' King says in a
message on his Web site. ''I love the smell of glue.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, which worked closely with King on his previous
electronic publishing effort, a novella for hand-held devices that
sold more than half a million copies in March, says it doesn't mind
being left out on the distribution of ''The Plant.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We see it in the vein of an experiment rather than a permanent
move,'' says Simon &AMP; Schuster president Carolyn Reidy. ''We're
confident that publishers add enough value to the process that
authors are still going to want to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other publishing industry insiders also see King's experiment as
just that - a testing of the waters by a hugely popular author
rather than a blueprint for what's to come for all writers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may work for Stephen King, but it won't work for 99
percent of the people out there,'' says Larry Kirshbaum, president
of Time Warner Trade Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   But if King proves his point, and he gets payment for 75 percent
of the downloads - the minimum he wants for the series to continue
- it would go a long way toward challenging the conventional wisdom
that people are unwilling to pay for anything they see or hear on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether the honesty system will work.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike King's ''Riding the Bullet'' novella, which was released
in an encrypted format, downloads of ''The Plant'' will be in the
open PDF format, which can be copied and printed at will.
</P>
<P>
   King is counting on people making a credit card payment online
or sending in a check or money order. Amazon.com will process the
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''This ain't Napster,'' he says. ''Take what you want ... and
pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   While many publishing executives are wishing King well, most are
skeptical about the public's willingness to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Mort Janklow, a literary agent who represents hundreds of
authors, sees a huge future in the electronic distribution of books
once good business models are in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are highways with no cars on them. I own all the cars,''
Janklow says. ''After they finish with all the distribution
patterns they will need product.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a fellow sitting up in Maine having fun, but it's not a
way to run a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers, agents and publishers recognize that making a product
available in a new way and getting a lot of people to buy it are
two very different things.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think technology changes basic power relationships
between an author and the marketplace. You still need a lot of
money and power to promote a book,'' says Jonathan Tasini,
president of the National Writers' Union. ''The same people who
already make a good living at the top of the bestseller list may
have another way to sell, but I don't believe there will be a
dramatic change for other authors.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that a popular author can do away with his
publisher, however briefly, has given people who edit, make and
sell books for a living something to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It writes in the largest possible letters that publishers must
prove their value in finding an author his or her audience and
doing in better than the author can do it by his or herself,'' says
Simon &AMP; Schuster's Reidy.

<HEADLINE> Organic farming efforts growing in state and nationally  </HEADLINE>
By SHARON LINSTEDT
The Buffalo News
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - For the first 15 years of their farming
lives, Gail and Mike Thorpe of East Aurora relied on a conventional
arsenal of pesticides and fertilizers to grow their fields of
fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last three years, the couple has scrapped chemicals
in favor of things like tricho gamma wasps, green lace wings, bars
of soap, live bacteria, and lots of weeding. The Thorpes have gone
organic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been like learning to farm all over again,'' said Gail
Thorpe. ''But it has been worth it. We feel really good about
what's coming out of our fields.''
</P>
<P>
   This past week that feeling was backed by an official
designation of their accomplishments. The Thorpes passed a final
inspection by the Northeastern Organic Farming Association/New York
Chapter, and have the right to claim 896 acres of their farm as
''certified organic.''
</P>
<P>
   These local farmers are part of a growing national trend of
organic farming, joining more than 6,000 other growers of
everything from fruits and vegetables to animal feeds and
food-grade soy beans.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the organic head count is up 20 percent in two
years. In New York, more than 230 growers have earned official
organic status, with another 50 or so expected to pass muster this
growing season.
</P>
<P>
   Although less than 2 percent of all food produced in the U.S. is
certified organic, annual sales now total more than $6 billion said
Sarah Johnston, executive director of the New York branch of the
organic farming association.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our farmers are still the little guys, but we're seeing a
steady growth trend as consumer demand grows and producer awareness
increases,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, organic farming eschews artificial fertilizers
and pesticides, instead harnessing the power of natural substances,
such as compost, bacteria and pest-targeted insects and protective
netting, to build healthy soil and keep invading forces at bay.
</P>
<P>
   While any farmer can opt to use these methods, those who want to
label the fruits of their labors as ''certified organic,'' are
required to go through a three-year process that includes extensive
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   While the ranks of organic farmers are steadily increasing, it's
still considered an oddity. Steve Porter, in his 11th year of
organic growing, is the state's largest organic vegetable producer.
He said he continues to be scrutinized by non-organic neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still considered the weird ones,'' Porter said of the
Elba farm he runs with his father, Jack, and brother, Bill. ''A lot
of them scratch their heads, but a few are getting interested in
how this works.''
</P>
<P>
   While other farmers were writing checks for annual applications
of herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers, the Porters have faced
higher upfront costs on soil preparation, including equipment,
organic substances and labor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The costs probably work out to be comparable, but they're
paying and applying chemicals several times a year, every year,
while our biggest costs are up front,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the Porters have seen their organic
business bloom from a one-acre vegetable patch to more than 500
acres of produce.
</P>
<P>
   The goods find their way to the table via Wegmans and Tops
supermarkets, health food stores, food cooperatives, natural foods
wholesalers, and the farm's own Community Supported Agriculture
program.
</P>
<P>
   Through the CSA program, participants pay up front for a
season's worth of produce, and receive weekly installments of
fruits and vegetables from early summer through early winter. More
than 160 families in the Buffalo and Rochester areas are currently
paying about $200 each for the steady supply of organically-grown
goods.
</P>
<P>
   The Porters also produce organic grains sold to organic dairy
farmers as feed, and raise food-grade organic soy beans to ship
around the world for tofu production.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to discuss profits, Porter said he hasn't had to
''run to the bank to borrow money.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't go into farming to get rich,'' he said. ''We're
holding our own financially, expanding our acreage and finding new
markets, so I guess we're a success.''

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Urged To Be International  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II on Sunday urged creation
of a special international status for the holy sites of Jerusalem,
saying in an appeal aimed at Camp David's negotiators that only
world oversight can safeguard all the ancient city's religions.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, saying he was praying for peace to come out of the
U.S.-sponsored talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, urged
the power brokers ''not to overlook the importance of the spiritual
dimension of the city of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Holy See continues to maintain that only a special
statute, internationally guaranteed, can effectively preserve the
most sacred areas of the Holy City,'' John Paul said, speaking from
the window of his summer villa outside Rome.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, leader of the world's one billion Catholics, seized
the potentially decisive opportunity of the Camp David talks to
press the long-held Vatican position that Jerusalem's holy sites
should be internationally governed.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a half square mile of the walled city holds some of
the holiest sites of Islam, Judaism and Christianity: the Western
Wall, remnant of ancient Israel's Second Temple; Islam's Dome of
the Rock, from which Mohammed sprang into heaven on a winged horse;
and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where Christ was crucified,
entombed and resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   International oversight would ''assure freedom of religion and
of worship for all the faithful who, in the region and the entire
world, look to Jerusalem as a crossroads of peace and of
coexistence,'' the pontiff said, lingering at his window in his
weekly Sunday address to pilgrims to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Foreign Ministry immediately dismissed the appeal.
''It's not on the table,'' said Aviv Shiron, spokesman for Foreign
Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality has shown that since Israel has controlled the
holy sites, freedom of access and worship has never been greater,''
Shiron said in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian spokesman welcomed the pope's words, interpreting
them as siding with the Palestinians in the challenge to Israel's
insistence on sole stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a sign from the pope, who is the highest Christian
authority in this world, that he is denying the claim of Israeli
sovereignty over Jerusalem,'' insisted Hassan Abdel Rahman, PLO
envoy to Washington and a frequent spokesman for the Palestinians
during the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians both claim Jerusalem as their
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Vatican have been at odds over the city since
1967, when Israel captured and subsequently annexed east Jerusalem
-- which includes the Old City and its holy sites -- in the Mideast
war. The Vatican called the annexation an illegal occupation.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Vatican signed a strongly worded accord with
the Palestinians covering the status of churches and the freedom of
worship in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
   The preamble declared that an ''equitable solution'' for
Jerusalem, based on international resolutions, was ''fundamental
for a just and lasting peace.'' It called for international
safeguards of freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has been vague -- publicly, at least -- about just how
extensive an international role it envisions and just how it would
be administered.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican clearly is referring to sites of primary historic
and religious significance, all of which are in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The pope gave no new details Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was following the Camp David negotiations in his
prayers. ''I hope that they are always driven by a sincere desire
for respect and for justice for all and for reaching a just and
lasting peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-old pontiff fulfilled a goal of his papacy in March
when he visited Jerusalem, going to the Western Wall and placing
between its stones a plea for forgiveness for Christian
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Under John Paul, the Vatican has not hesitated to protest when
it feels access to holy sites at risk -- as in security crackdowns
of the 1990s, when at times the Vatican complained pilgrims were
being denied full access.
</P>
<P>
   Israel routinely seals off the West Bank and Gaza strip during
Jewish holidays. Security closures have sometimes stretched out for
months, blocking Palestinians from prayer at the Old City's holy
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The rival claims to the Old City were so intense that the 1947
U.N. partition plan that gave rise to modern Israel dodged deciding
them, setting out instead to make Jerusalem an international
district.
</P>
<P>
   But Arab armies attacked, making the partition plan moot. Jews
had no access to the Arab-held Western Wall from then until Israel
captured east Jerusalem from Jordan two decades later.

   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Claudia Schiffer got a visit from a man
carrying a large bouquet of flowers, but he wasn't at the

<HEADLINE> Zemeckis Compares Thrillers, Comedy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Director Robert Zemeckis, best known for his
comedies, says making his first thriller had a lot in common with
directing for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Zemeckis' supernatural mystery ''What Lies Beneath'' opened
Friday. The film stars Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford as a
couple whose idyllic life is disrupted by the vengeful ghost of a
young woman.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly a laughing matter, but the director of ''Forrest
Gump,'' the ''Back to the Future'' movies and ''Who Framed Roger
Rabbit?'' said setting up a scare was the same as setting up a
joke.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's a little too fast, it won't be scary. If it's a little
too slow, it won't be scary,'' Zemeckis, 48, said in Sunday's
Orange County Register.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for a good joke, the director says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zemeckis said he felt compelled to include comic relief
to offset the jolts in his new thriller.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't seem to help myself,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Kathie Lee Gifford says her co-host's wife would
be the ideal replacement for her when she leaves ''Live with Regis
and Kathie Lee'' this week.
</P>
<P>
   Regis Philbin's wife, Joy, ''not only shares chemistry with
Regis, but she has history with him,'' Gifford told Time magazine
in the issue on newsstands Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's such a fine line between how much to kiss his rear end
and how much to kick it,'' she said. ''When I kick his rear end,
people know I love him.''
</P>
<P>
   After appearing on Broadway in ''Putting It Together'' and
recording an album called ''Born for You,'' Gifford wants ''to
spend more time being that fulfilled creatively.'' She figures she
might end up on the big screen or back on the small one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm talking to networks about sitcoms and dramas,'' she said.
''I'm talking to movie producers.''

<HEADLINE> Downey Lawyers Urge His Release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Robert Downey Jr.'s lawyers say the actor
should have been released from prison a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Robert Walters said the Malibu judge who sentenced
Downey on drug charges made legal and mathematical errors, the Los
Angeles Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Walters said Superior Court Judge Lawrence Mira did not specify
whether Downey's misdemeanor sentences would run at the same time
or in a series and didn't take into account the time Downey had
already served in a drug rehab program.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mira's sentence, Downey would be eligible for release Nov.
2. His lawyers say he was eligible in February.
</P>
<P>
   Downey, 34, was jailed last year after admitting during a
probation hearing that he was missing scheduled drug tests. Mira
sentenced him to three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Downey earned an Oscar nomination for his work in the title role
in ''Chaplin,'' the 1992 screen biography of the famed comedian.
Other film credits include ''Less Than Zero,'' ''Natural Born
Killers,'' ''Two Girls and a Guy'' and ''U.S. Marshals.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor has had a series of drug-related legal troubles dating
back to the mid 1990s.

   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Carlie Coley may look like Ernest
Hemingway, but he admits he doesn't share the famous writer's
literary talents.
</P>
<P>
   Coley of Alma, Ga., won the coveted Ernest ''Papa'' Hemingway
Look-Alike Contest during the annual Hemingway Days Festival at Key
West on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old says he's written thousands of plumbing and

anything that anybody would want to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Coley, a semi-retired plumbing and electrical supply owner,
competed in the contest for four years prior to his victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to groom myself to look as much like him as I could
and put on a little more weight, though I don't know whether that
helped or hurt.''
</P>

   Hemingway lived in Key West from 1929 to 1939, where he wrote
''For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' ''To Have and Have Not'' and ''Green

<HEADLINE> Ivory Coast Votes on Constitution  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- In a vote highlighting ethnic
divisions while testing the ruling junta's resolve to return the
nation to civilian rule, residents of Ivory Coast turned out Sunday
to decide whether to approve a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum, which will play a major role in deciding who
could be the next president, comes at a critical juncture for Ivory
Coast. Once among Africa's most stable nations, the country faces
increasing military unrest, a battered economy and fears that
things could get worse.
</P>
<P>
   The government declared a state of emergency ahead of the
referendum, but the commercial capital, Abidjan, was unusually
quiet Sunday and there were no signs of violence.
</P>
<P>
   While turnout estimates were not available, long lines, some
with well over 200 people, snaked through some Abidjan
neighborhoods. Organizational problems plagued many areas, with
late openings at some polling stations, insufficient voting
materials and election officials who failed to turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the country's 4.8 million registered voters were kept
waiting for their voting cards, and there were also scattered
accusations of voting fraud. Police arrested four supporters of the
country's main opposition leader, Alassane Dramane Ouattara, for
allegedly buying ''no'' votes, said Menan Basil Adou, a senior
municipal official in Abidjan's crowded Adjame neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The junta acknowledged the problems in a statement broadcast on
state-run radio and said voting would continue Monday from 8 a.m.
until 12 p.m. at the stations where voters were unable to cast
their ballots Sunday. Elsewhere, voting continued past the 6 p.m.
deadline to give all those who turned up the chance to cast their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   For many voters in Abidjan, the referendum appeared to be a vote
on Ivory Coast's willingness to remain a haven for immigrants, many
of them from poverty-wracked states to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are victims of that hospitality now,'' said Dominique
Agnero, 41, a civil servant. ''The foreigners should get in an
airplane and call us by phone. We don't want to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast has some 19 million residents, about 40 percent of
them immigrants who came here when the country was the region's
economic powerhouse. But in recent years, as prices for the
country's main exports, cocoa and coffee, have plummeted, the
economy has stumbled and its hospitality has turned to a simmering
xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
   Many see the referendum as a junta plan to exclude Ouattara from
the Sept. 17 presidential elections, because a last-minute
amendment to the draft constitution stipulates that both parents of
presidential candidates must be ''of Ivorian origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara, a former top official with the International Monetary
Fund, has nevertheless encouraged his followers to vote ''yes,''
insisting both his parents were Ivorian.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some Ouattara supporters feared their leader would be
excluded and said they would vote against the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a citizen, I must make my own choice,'' said Idrissa Kone,
a 28-year-old unemployed man as he left a polling station in Abobo,
an Abidjan neighborhood that is a stronghold of Ouattara
supporters. ''This constitution will divide Ivorians more than it
will reconcile them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara was at the center of controversy over similar
eligibility conditions under former President Henri Konan Bedie,
who was ousted in a Christmas Eve coup that brought junta leader
Gen. Robert Guei to power.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie claimed Ouattara was not eligible for the presidency
because he said Ouattara's parents were from neighboring Burkina
Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie's ethnically divisive policies were a major reason Guei
gave for his takeover. Now many Ivorians see Guei's constitutional
modifications as fueling the divisions again.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently fearing a backlash, the government announced the
state of emergency last week, with Guei accusing opponents of
''maneuvering in the shadows'' to organize a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Guei, a former army chief, is widely believed to be planning to
run in the Sept. 17 elections, though he has not revealed his
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the December coup was initially popular among Ivorians,
who had grown tired of the Bedie regime's corruption and ethnic
favoritism, many have since become disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   The junta increased security at key facilities ahead of the
vote, including the national radio and television stations, the
international airport and Guei's residence.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of armed soldiers patrolled Abidjan's more crowded
neighborhoods late Saturday night but were less in evidence on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have risen in Ivory Coast since a two-day mutiny in
early July, when rioting soldiers demanded perks they said were
promised them for supporting the December coup.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Fears GOP Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton fears that the piecemeal
approach to cutting taxes by the Republican-controlled Congress
will undermine the budget surplus rather than reduce the national
debt, top Clinton aides said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The third-ranking Republican in the House, Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, contended that Clinton is playing politics with the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lew, the White House's budget chief, said on ''Fox News
Sunday'' that Clinton wants to cut taxes. ''I think the president's
made clear that there is the ability to do tax cuts this year,''
Lew said. ''The question is, 'How should we cut taxes, and in what
context?'''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Republicans sent Clinton a tax-cut package that
would have cost $792 billion. Clinton vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats contend congressional leaders decided this year to
pass basically the same package, but in pieces, item by item.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Clinton said the overall effect of the planned tax
breaks, plus higher interest because of slower payment of the debt,
would eat up the entire $2.2 trillion non-Social Security and
Medicare budget surplus projected for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Lew, White House chief of staff John Podesta and Sen. Richard
Durbin, D-Ill., repeated the same theme on Sunday's television news
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation already has passed Congress that would reduce taxes
on married couples and repeal the federal estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has promised to veto both as unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
   How much they would cost depends on who is making the estimate.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Clinton contends easing the income tax marriage
penalty would cost $250 billion over 10 years; Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., the Senate majority whip, on CNN's ''Late Edition'' put
the figure at $90 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it costs, Clinton offered last month to make the bill
law if Congress would enact a universal prescription drug program
for Medicare patients, which he said also would cost $250 billion
over 10 years. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office
estimated last week it actually would cost $400 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said that he would sign the marriage penalty if we gave him
a prescription drug benefit. But everybody knows that his
prescription drug benefit would never pass the House and the
Senate, and therefore it couldn't be done,'' DeLay said Sunday on
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''So he's the one playing politics here. We're trying to do
something substantive.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay did not shut the door on compromise. Asked what GOP
leaders would do should Clinton do as he says he will and veto the
legislation, DeLay said:
</P>
<P>
   ''What's open to us is to go back and try to override his veto.
Then after that, we've got one more procedural move, called
reconciliation, in September, where we can package up some
tax-fairness issues in another package to send him.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta indicated the Clinton administration might be receptive.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is for tax cuts,'' he on ABC's ''This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's for targeted middle-class tax cuts, and, hopefully, by
the end of this Congress, maybe we could come together and put the
partisanship aside and see if we can work something out.''

<HEADLINE> Motorists to be offered personalized traffic updates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Motorists in the New York metropolitan area
may soon be offered personalized traffic reports by fax, e-mail,
phone and pager.
</P>
<P>
   Called ''Trips123,'' the $14 million project, coordinated by the
state governments and the private sector, is expected to be
available by January.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will involve three private companies, 16 transit
agencies and the transportation departments of New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   For an undetermined fee, commuters will have access to
information from 29 counties in New York, Connecticut and northern
New Jersey, The Star-Ledger of Newark reported in Sunday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   Government agencies said they hope the plan will cut down on
traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies such as Parsons Brinckerhoff want to make a
profit by offering consumers personalized information.
</P>
<P>
   ''People no longer want to just get their traffic information
from the radio; they want to go and get the information and do
their own travel plans,'' said Paul Carris, an engineer at the
consulting firm in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, subscribers fill out applications detailing
the routes they regularly take. That information is filed on a
computer that will alert the customer of any traffic problems along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''So if you know you're going from Morristown to Stamford each
day, and there's any problems on the roadways or transit routes,
the system will notify you by either phone, fax, e-mail, cell
phone, or it will page you en route,'' Carris said. ''However,
whenever you want to get the information, it will get to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic and construction information will be available for free
on a Web site. There will also be a Web program to help travelers
coordinate trips involving various forms of transit.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic information will be available by phone, but not on a
toll-free line.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the traffic information will come from the system of
sensors, satellites and electronic warning signs wired into the
area's network of highways, bridges and tunnels.

<HEADLINE> Coverdell Successor Unknown  </HEADLINE>
By DICK PETTYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Speculation reigned Sunday as Georgia political
leaders waited for Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes to name a successor
to Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever Barnes picks would have an edge in the Nov. 7
nonpartisan special election to fill the remaining four years in
Coverdell's term.
</P>
<P>
   That draws attention both inside and outside Georgia because a
Democratic victory would tip the balance of power closer toward
even in the U.S. Senate, where Republicans now hold a 54-45
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic Gov. Zell Miller was said to be Barnes' most
likely pick following Coverdell's death last week at the age of 61.
</P>
<P>
   However, Miller, who has been teaching at Georgia universities,
was believed to be weighing whether he wanted to re-enter public
life at age 68.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather not talk about it right now,'' Miller said Sunday
from his home in the northeast Georgia mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Miller left the governorship in 1999 after eight years in which
his popularity soared, largely because of a lottery-funded program
that provides college scholarships to students with ''B'' averages.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever Barnes names, GOP leaders were looking to their party's
members of Georgia's congressional delegation to ensure that a
Republican wins in November.
</P>
<P>
   One name mentioned prominently was Rep. Johnny Isakson, although
other GOP congressmen also were said to be interested.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson, elected last year to the seat formerly held by House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, said Sunday that the eight Republican
congressmen had talked about uniting behind a candidate in November
and planned to meet again this week.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate would have to earn 50 percent of the vote in
November's nonpartisan election or the two candidates with the most
votes would go to a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot afford to get two, three or four Republicans in the
race against one well-funded Democrat,'' said Chuck Clay, the state
Republican Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican congressmen mentioned included Bob Barr, John
Linder and Jack Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   Emory University political science professor Merle Black said
each of those would be at a disadvantage, either because they were
not well-known outside their districts or were too conservative for
an election in which voters from both parties could participate.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Might Ban Relief Flights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Sudan's president has threatened to bar
foreign relief planes from delivering humanitarian aid to the
war-torn south, raising concern Sunday among U.N. food workers.
</P>
<P>
   President Omar el-Bashir accused Operation Lifeline Sudan, a
relief effort involving U.N. and voluntary agencies, of helping
rebels battling government troops in the south. He said his
government will not allow planes taking off from outside the
country to bring aid to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not allow OLS ... to be used for the provision of
assistance to the rebels,'' el-Bashir said late Saturday in a
ceremony aimed at rallying support for the government war effort in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Lifeline Sudan uses the northern Kenya town of Lokichokio as its
base.
</P>
<P>
   El-Bashir has suspended OLS operations several times in the
past, calling it a cover for the arms smuggling to the Sudan
People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Makena Walker, a spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program in
Khartoum, said Sunday her organization hasn't been officially
notified of el-Bashir's announcement and that flights were going as
normal.
</P>
<P>
   But if implemented, the president's decision would create ''a
worrisome'' situation in the south, she said. Flooding, fighting
and drought have left 1.7 million Sudanese in need of food
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The SPLA has led a rebellion for autonomy in the largely
Christian and animist south from the predominantly Muslim and
Arabized north since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Report: FBI looking at Paterson mayor's world travels  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) - The FBI has begun looking at the world
travels of Mayor Marty Barnes, in an effort to search for possible
links between contractors who paid for the trips and publicly
funded business they received, according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who has made international travel a hallmark of his
three years in office, has been to Switzerland, the Dominican
Republic, Russia's Caucasus Mountains and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has said some of the travels were an attempt to set up an
international trade zone in the economically depressed city and
help local businesses make contact with their counterparts abroad;
he said others were to review companies doing business with the
city.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sunday's editions of The Record of Hackensack, the
FBI investigation is focusing in particular on trips to Brazil and
Switzerland because they were funded by contractors who either
received millions of dollars in publicly funded business or were
seeking such business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is the company that Barnes recommends to the council the best
company, or is he recommending them because they have given him
gifts?'' Councilman Thomas C. Rooney Jr. told the newspaper. ''I
can't answer that question. That is the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has requested the mayor's appointment diaries, message
books, phone bills, travel records and records of gifts he
received, among other documents.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the FBI has also interviewed Barnes at his home
and seized records relating to three sewage system contractors who
do business with the city. All three contractors paid for portions
of Barnes' trips abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he took those trips - one to Brazil and one to
Switzerland - in order to review the systems before the city spent
millions of dollars on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The solution to the city's sewer problems will cost us in
excess of $34 million and the technology does not exist in the
United States,'' Barnes wrote in a March report to the city
council. ''It was prudent for us to review an existing system
before recommending a solution worth millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rooney and others say they're worried that the companies may
have had a better shot at the contracts after paying for the trips.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Cincinnati used city money on similar trips last
year to Austria and Switzerland last year to look at sewer systems.
One official, who asked not to be named, said his boss wouldn't
have allowed a contractor to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us, it would have been a conflict of interest to have one
of the companies pay for the trip,'' he told the newspaper. ''You
don't want to feel obligated to use the company that you visited.
You're there for an independent view of their product. You want to
stay as independent as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   After repeated requests, Barnes in March gave the council a
report on the trips that did not include details about who paid. He
said that information was nobody's business since public money was
not used to finance the trips.
</P>
<P>
   ''It involves public officials, public money,'' Rooney said.
''The public is entitled to know this. The secrecy of this is
terrible.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Clears Road in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- An offensive by U.N. peacekeepers
has pushed a breakaway military faction from a strategic road
leading into Sierra Leone's capital, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's U.N. mission, code-named Operation Thunderbolt, was
the latest move by the world body to flex the muscles of a
peacekeeping force that had been embarrassed by kidnappings and
military defeats since May.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the operation were scanty, but at least one
peacekeeper was wounded in clashes. U.N. spokeswoman Hirut Befecadu
said it ''successfully'' cleared a small renegade faction of
nominally pro-government fighters known as the West Side Boys away
from a road connecting Freetown and the international airport in
Lungi.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. military officer speaking on condition of anonymity said
the operation involved heavily armed U.N. ground troops and
helicopter gunships. An unknown number of renegades were killed,
the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Befecadu could not confirm the enemy casualties but said one
Guinean U.N. peacekeeper was critically injured by retreating
renegade fighters. U.N. troops from Nigeria and other nations are
patrolling the road to maintain security, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The operation was very intense to clear the road,'' Befecadu
said. ''Nobody is running around (there) anymore with guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last month, the West Side Boys were part of a fragile
pro-government alliance fighting Sierra Leone's feared rebel
Revolutionary United Front rebels. But the faction has fallen out
with the government after allegedly attacking other pro-government
fighters and carrying out a spree of carjackings, robberies and
rapes.
</P>
<P>
   The 13,000-strong U.N. force in Sierra Leone has recently begun
using force to restore its credibility in the wake of the
kidnapping of hundreds of its peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July, U.N. troops backed by British and Indian attack
helicopters launched a military rescue of more than 200
peacekeepers who had been surrounded by rebels since early May. One
Indian U.N. peacekeeper was killed and seven injured in that
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Also this weekend, a contingent of 230 combat-experienced troops
from Britain's Royal Irish Regiment arrived in Sierra Leone to
train about 1,000 new Sierra Leonean recruits, British army
spokesman Capt. Fergus Smith said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest arrivals replace a contingent that just completed
training another group of 986 Sierra Leonean troops. Britain has
also donated arms and military equipment to help Sierra Leone's
elected government.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone military officials said the new recruits would soon
be deployed to frontline positions to fight the RUF rebels, who
reignited the country's eight-year civil war in May.
</P>
<P>
   Since the civil war began in 1991, the rebels have
systematically killed and maimed tens of thousands of people in a
bid to gain control of the government and the country's lucrative
diamond-mining region.

<HEADLINE> Israel Settlers Will Refuse To Leave  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA BLIJDENSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PSAGOT, West Bank (AP) -- Peace deal or no peace deal, Jewish
settlers in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip said Sunday that they
will refuse to leave their homes no matter what is decided at the
Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak, conferring at the summit with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, has said that up to one-quarter,
or 50,000, of the 200,000 settlers may be left outside the umbrella
of Israeli sovereignty as part of an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would give the Palestinians the state they seek, but
Jewish settlers consider the land their biblical birthright.
</P>
<P>
   Settler leader Zeev Hever said most of the settlers will stay
put even if an agreement stipulates that they have to evacuate
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no power in the world that can uproot tens of
thousands of Jews,'' Hever said at a meeting in this well-to-do
bedroom community that juts into the crowded,
Palestinian-controlled town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, the settlers said they were confident
the army would never obey government orders to abandon them or
evacuate them. The army has repeatedly said it would carry out the
mandate of any peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, about a dozen members of Betar, a hard-line youth
group, brought a herd of sheep to the prime minister's residence
Sunday. ''We will not go like sheep to the slaughter,'' chanted the
group as they held onto the sheep with leashes.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers said they are preparing for the worst, including
the possibility of violent confrontations with local Palestinians.
They have asked the government for more bulletproof vests, and some
settlements have stocked up on battle gear including night-vision
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Palestinians will resort to violence, we have
self-defense units, we are not untrained,'' said Yisrael Medad.
''We know the Palestinians want war, we have to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlers got some succor from Barak's foreign minister,
David Levy, when he visited their protest tent. Levy, who has a
history of bolting Cabinets during government crises, refused to
tell reporters whether or not he was contemplating resigning.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was never talk about uprooting settlements'' before
Barak left, Levy said. ''There is no such thing like a peace at any
price, that's what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Further defections would seriously weaken Barak, who is already
governing with a minority coalition. Three parties defected as soon
as he announced his intention to attend the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the summit succeeds or fails, Israeli security officials
are preparing for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Environment Minister Dalia Itzik said that at Sunday's Cabinet
meeting, the head of the Shin Bet, Israel's internal security
service, said hard-line extremists had threatened the lives of both
Barak and Arafat. The intelligence chief added that to date there
had been no attempts to carry out those threats, Itzik said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak spokesmen said the issue of Jerusalem -- a seemingly
intractable problem that nearly derailed the summit last week -- was
central to coming to an agreement. Barak has pledged to keep the
holy city united, although the Palestinians say they will only sign
an agreement that gives them full sovereignty of the city's eastern
sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jerusalem is the heart of the Jewish people, and it could well
be the heart of this agreement,'' Barak spokesman Gadi Baltiansky
told Israel television. He said the summit's success could hinge on
coming to an agreement on the bitterly disputed city.
</P>
<P>
   Another spokesman, Yoni Koren, told Israel radio that the 24
hours after President Clinton returned to the summit on Sunday were
going to be ''critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak associates have said Israel might accept a U.S. bridging
proposal that would extend limited Palestinian sovereignty to parts
of east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, an architect of the breakthrough
peace accords that led to the marathon summit outside Washington,
led a tour Sunday through traditionally Arab east Jerusalem,
captured by Israel during the 1967 Mideast war. During the tour,
Beilin said it was time for Israel to unburden itself of some of
the Palestinian neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is most important is to see the lack of importance and
meaning of these villages for Israel,'' he said. ''They fall
outside the core of our Jerusalem and we have to differentiate
between our Jerusalem and the Jerusalem that is not ours and never
was.''

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Welcomes G-8 Trade Round  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The head of the World Trade Organization on Sunday
welcomed the call by leaders of the Group of Eight industrial
countries for a new round of global trade talks, but said support
from developing countries would be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a splendid thing if we could launch a round this
year,'' said WTO Director-General Mike Moore in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The support expressed by G-8 leaders at the summit in Nago,
Okinawa, is an important first step, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the WTO makes all of its important decisions by consensus
and while agreement on a package of negotiations from the Group of
Eight is welcome, there can be no launch of talks without support
from the world's developing countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said a new round of global trade talks would offer the
best way to ensure balanced negotiations capable of encompassing
the interests and concerns of all the WTO's more than 130 members --
and not just its richest members.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only through a round can you get the trade-offs that benefit
the smallest and most vulnerable societies,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings last year in Seattle to prepare for a new round of
global trade talks collapsed amid acrimony between developing and
developed nations after violent demonstrations against the ill
effects of globalization erupted in the streets.

<HEADLINE> UN: Disease Plan Will Cost $25B  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A campaign against killer diseases announced
Sunday by leaders of the Group of Eight industrial countries will
cost at least $25 billion over the next five years, a U.N. health
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization welcomed the commitment by leaders
of the G-8 meeting in Nago, Okinawa, to work to slash the number of
deaths worldwide from three of the planet's most deadly killers:
AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
</P>
<P>
   These three diseases account for nearly 5 million deaths a year,
the agency said in a statement Sunday. That's half of all
fatalities worldwide from infectious diseases -- the leading cause
of death in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''These deaths occur primarily among the poorest people because
they do not have access to the drugs and commodities necessary for
prevention and cure,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency warned that fighting the diseases will be
expensive and will require world governments to coordinate their
efforts with the United Nations and private companies and
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line: additional investment of $5 billion a year
for at least the next five years,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   In the final communique of their summit, the leaders of the G-8
vowed over the next 10 years to cut by a quarter the number of
young people worldwide infected with HIV and to halve the number of
deaths from tuberculosis. It also promised to combat diseases
associated with malaria.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization said fighting HIV would be the
costliest part of the effort, consuming 60 percent of funds. Most
of that should be spent on HIV prevention, including mother to
child transmission, and care for people already infected with the
AIDS virus, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the money should be split evenly for the campaigns
against malaria and TB, it added.

<HEADLINE> German Archbishop Dyba Dies at 70  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Archbishop Johannes Dyba, considered one of
Germany's most conservative clergymen for his outspoken views
against abortion and domestic partnerships, has died. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   He died in his sleep Saturday night of heart failure, officials
in his office said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Dyba, who was archbishop of the Fulda diocese in central Germany
and the Roman Catholic bishop for the military, polarized Germans
and even caused controversy within the church with his often
pointed comments on questions of morality.
</P>
<P>
   His most harsh criticism was focused against abortion, which he
called a ''children's Holocaust.'' In recent weeks, he also aimed
his barbs at talk within the government of giving legal rights to
gay couples, calling such moves ''a further fatal step in the
degeneration.''
</P>
<P>
   Those remarks drew strong criticism from many politicians as
well as lawsuits against him filed by homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Born Sept. 15, 1929 in Berlin, Dyba as a child wanted to be a
boxer, pilot or missionary. He studied law, including at Duke
University in North Carolina, before deciding to enter the
priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   He was ordained in 1959 in Cologne and after a short time
serving in churches went to study in Rome. He served the Vatican in
diplomatic posts in Buenos Aires, Argentina; The Hague,
Netherlands; Kinshasa, Congo, and Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1983, he was named the head of the Fulda diocese,
and in 1990 also became the Catholic military bishop, visiting
German troops on missions in Yugoslavia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the last Monday he had said he would give up his
position as military bishop as soon as a successor was named.

<HEADLINE> State upgrades bioterrorism lab for more complicated studies  </HEADLINE>
By HANAH CHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state has begun renovations at a
bioterrorism lab here that will allow scientists to conduct more
complicated analyses of biotoxins and agents of other deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Work began in January to replace a ''level-2'' lab at the
Department of Health and Senior Services' agricultural laboratories
building at John Fitch Plaza with a ''level-3'' facility, state
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   James Blumenstock, senior assistant commissioner of the state
Department of Health and Senior Services, said the upgrade is part
of a nationwide effort to give state laboratories the ability to
conduct more extensive tests of toxic agents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're densely populated, we have a great deal of international
travel and commerce that goes through New Jersey, and we have a
great deal of high-tech and research facilities in New Jersey,''
Blumenstock said. ''When you look at all of that, we in the state
have vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ''We in the state need to be better prepared for emerging
pathogens. Bioterrorism is one of the potential sources,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once renovations are completed in November, Blumenstock said
scientists will be able to conduct tests on bioterrorism toxins
such as anthrax, plague and smallpox. Also, diseases such as the
West Nile virus will be studied there.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists had been conducting tests on the West Nile virus in
the level-2 lab, but Blumenstock said they needed a better lab.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had been sending specimens of West Nile to the
Center for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta
for more extensive tests, he said. Once the new lab is done, those
tests can be done in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Renovations include an a better waste removal and air filtration
system, a decontamination unit and more security.
</P>
<P>
   There are four levels of laboratory safety, and Blumenstock said
only a few facilities in the country have level-4 laboratories,
which conduct research on such highly contagious diseases as the
ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
   The lab also is using part of a $1 million grant from the CDC to
hire more scientists and buy equipment, Blumenstock said.
</P>
<P>
   The state is funding the lab's renovations. But Blumenstock said
final cost estimates were not available.

<HEADLINE> Mexico PRI Won't Have New Govt Role  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The party that ruled Mexico for 71 years says
it will not participate in the government of the opposition
president-elect who booted it out of power, the Reforma newspaper
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, whose party doesn't have a majority in congress,
has pledged to include all major political parties since his
stunning July 2 election victory ousting the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   But PRI president Dulce Maria Sauri said it would be
''unimaginable'' that members of her party would hold posts in
Fox's administration. ''We can't collaborate with those who have
attacked and insulted us,'' she told the Mexico City-based Reforma.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a tough-talking cowboy, led one of the biggest name-calling
presidential campaigns ever seen in Mexico. He called the PRI
candidate, Francisco Labastida, everything from a ''sissy'' to ''La
Vestida,'' a pun on his name implying Labastida is a cross-dresser.
</P>
<P>
   The business-oriented National Action Party candidate also
campaigned largely on toppling the long-ruling party and ending
corruption, promising a broad-based government and a free-market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''How could one of us be the interior secretary when their
political ideas are completely different from ours?'' Sauri said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear, however, if individual PRI members would pass
up such an opportunity. Fox's personal secretary is Alfonso Durazo,
a member of the PRI and the former secretary of Luis Donaldo
Colosio, the PRI's presidential candidate who was assassinated
during the 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election, Fox has emphasized building alliances to
diffuse Mexico's volatile and rapidly changing political terrain.
</P>
<P>
   But PRI becomes the second party to reject his offer to
participate in his government. The largest center-left party, the
Democratic Revolution Party, also turned it down -- though last week
it said its legislators are considering working with Fox's party in
Congress on certain issues. The PRD finished third in the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Fox announced a multiparty transition team to usher
in the change. He is expected to announce his actual Cabinet and
top advisers in late August or September. Fox, a former Coca-Cola
executive, has hired head hunters who normally work for businesses
to look for candidates, although the people on the transition team
are obvious favorites for those posts.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Get Sierra Club Endorsement  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore touted the backing of a
big environmental group Sunday, seeking to ''reach out to the new
opportunities''' to protect air and water.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Sierra Club dismissed suggestions that Gore's
commitment to the environment has waned since he authored ''Earth
in the Balance'' and said endorsing Gore was easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did an exhaustive survey of our chapters and our members,'
said Debbie Sease, a spokesman for the Sierra Club. 'Our members
have full confidence in the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   The 600,000 member environmental group formally issues its
endorsement of Gore on Monday when its leader Robert Cox campaigns
with Gore in the key batttleground states of Michigan and Ohio, but
Gore was going out of his way to underscore the issue in campaign
events Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to be delivered accepting the endorsement, Gore
claimed the environmental high ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been criticized for my unyielding commitment to safeguard
the environment,'' said Gore's speech, which he planned to deliver
to environmental activists with Sierra Club leaders at his side.
''I've been criticized for my call to end the silent rising tide of
global warming that could threaten our health, our economy and our
whole way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the group said chapters representing two-thirds of
their membership backed the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Democratic National Committee fund-raising events in
new Jersey and New York, Gore went out of his way to underscore
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an era in which we are called upon to take more
responsibility for protecting the environment of the earth in all
the places we live,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dismissed suggestions that environmental protections must
come at the cost of bolstering the economy, suggesting that the
nation should take the lead in developing new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really have a responsibility to reach out for the new
opportunities that are right there,'' Gore said, noting that the
world is ''waiting for the U.S. to take the lead to create new
technologies ... that can increase standards of living and expand
wealth while at the same time reducing pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is an important one in several key states, including
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls have suggested that Green Party nominee Ralph Nader
drains support from Gore. And some environmentalists have said they
are suspicious of Gore's commitment to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, from Gore's perspective, is that drain is most
significant in key battleground states like Michigan and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Sease said the image of leaders of the environmental movement
campaigning with Gore should reduce those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think for the Sierra Club to stand up and say 'it's
important for al Gore to be elected president' sends a very
important message,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides were also boasting of the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously this is a very significant endorsement from one of,
if not the, preeminent environmental organization in the country,''
said spokesman Chris Lehane. ''It reflects Al Gore's lifelong
commitment to the environment. It's a passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was getting far less attention than Republican rival George
W. Bush, who set a weekend deadline for deciding on a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's only public appearances Sunday were brief speeches at the
fund-raising events, and he also was spending time visiting his
grandchild in New York before heading to Michigan for events
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign planned a photo-friendly event on the banks of a
river in Grand Rapids to formally unveil the environmental group's
backing.

<HEADLINE> Police say convicted felon assaulted children, stored weapons in home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORNWALL, N.Y. (AP) - A three-time convicted felon was charged
with handcuffing his 15-year-old son to a pole and beating him with
a leather belt and a pool stick.
</P>
<P>
   The father, John Vachaviolas, was arrested Saturday after the
boy escaped through a second-story window, ran to a convenience
store and called for help, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Philip Sinagra said Vachaviolas, 40, is a three-time
convicted felon. After his arrest, police found two assault rifles,
18 assorted shotguns and a handgun in the house. As a prior
convicted felon, Vachaviolas is prohibited from possessing
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Sinagra said two other children were also assaulted and locked
in their bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 1, police say they have been to the Vachaviolas home
eight times for situations between the father and his four
children.
</P>
<P>
   The father is the only parent in the house, Sinagra said.
</P>
<P>
   The children were treated at a hospital and released. They were
in the custody of Child Protective Services and will be placed in
temporary foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Vachaviolas was arraigned and sent to Orange County Jail without
bail. His home phone number was non-published and a message left
for him at the jail was not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> City expands spraying after two more dead birds are found  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -The discovery of two more dead birds infected
with West Nile virus prompted the city on Sunday to expand its
battle against disease-carrying mosquitoes into new areas of Queens
and Brooklyn, while going ahead with further efforts in Staten
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said there still have been no reports of
humans afflicted with the sometimes deadly ailment. Seven elderly
people died and more than 60 were made ill by an outbreak of the
imported virus a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far it's not as bad as last year,'' Giuliani said. ''First
of all, it hasn't infected a mosquito as far as we know, we haven't
found a mosquito, and even that's one step before you get to what
happened last year, which was a significant number of human beings
contracting the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and City Health Commissioner Dr. Neal Cohen said the
new assault on the disease would include spraying of a short-lived
insecticide by trucks and ''larvacide'' pellets or granules dropped
into selected pools, catch basins and other standing-water sites
where mosquitoes can breed.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should not be alarmed, should not be concerned. These
are all things that we assumed we would have to do,'' Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing unusual is happening. The plan that we had from the
very beginning - if we were to find birds, or even if we were to
find mosquitoes - infected with the virus, we would then spray. So
far we've proceeded to do that, and hopefully it will keep this
under control.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials said spraying by trucks would begin on Tuesday
night in two two-square mile sections of Queens, including Richmond
Hill and Woodhaven, plus Cypress Hills and other parts of Brooklyn.
The seven-hour spraying will end at 5 a.m. and the insecticide,
Anvil, will deterioriate after a few hours in sunlight, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Those areas were targeted after the two dead birds tested
positiive by the state health department. One was a crow, found in
Richmond Hill July 3. The other, found in Woodhaven July 13, was a
merlin, a small falcon common in Newfoundland and eastern Canada
but rare in this area.
</P>
<P>
   The tests raised to seven the number of dead birds recently
found to be infected, among more than 220 examined for the disease,
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Previously planned spraying will proceed on Monday night in
another section Queens and all of Staten Island not previously
treated, Giuliani said. He said the National Parks Service has
approved the program in the Gateway National Recreation Area.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters may be used to deliver the larvacide to water
sources in Staten Island that are not otherwise easily reached. The
target sites have not yet been selected, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ''bacterial larvacide'' is designed to kill the
mosquitoes where they breed but is non-toxic to fish and other
life. ''It can be very safely applied in ponds, lakes, streams and
other wetlands and environmentally sensitive areas without
concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The areas to be sprayed on Tuesday include all or part of the
Queens neighborhoods of Rego park, Forest Hills, Middle Village,
Glendale, Lindenwood, Kew Gardens, Ozone Park, South Ozone Park,
Woodhaven and Richmomd Hill, and Brooklyn sections of East New
York, Highland Park, Cypress Hills and City Line.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said it made sense to concentrate efforts on areas where
dead birds are found because once infected, ''they become sedentary
and very vulnerable'' to being bitten by other mosquitoes that then
become carriers, spreading the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Westchester County plans to begin spraying after a number of
dead birds were found recently. Connecticut also will start
spraying in communities where a number of dead mosquitoes carrying
the virus were found recently. The state has been testing dead
birds, but so far has not found the virus in them.

<HEADLINE> Lazio's spokesman: 'I will believe Clinton's denial'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The chief campaign strategist for Rep. Rick
Lazio said Sunday that he believes Hillary Rodham Clinton's
assertion that she did not use an anti-Semitic obscenity, but he
added that she has a ''credibility problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, who works for the Republican Senate candidate, was
asked on CNN's ''Late Edition'' if he believes she used the
offensive term.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy answered: ''I have no way to know. I will believe her
denial, but I will say, and I think most New Yorkers will say,
there's an unease about trustworthiness of Mrs. Clinton, because
there's such a history of spin taken to the ultimate with the
Clintons, that she has a credibility problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Lazio expressed doubts about her denial, saying: ''I
don't know who to believe. I don't think New Yorkers know who to
believe. And therein lies a good deal of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was accused of using the term ''Jew b------'' in an
argument with Paul Fray in 1974, after Bill Clinton lost a
congressional campaign in Arkansas. Fray had worked on the campaign
and later lost his license to practice law because he accepted a
bribe to change a guilty verdict in a court docket.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation surfaced in a new book, ''State of a Union,'' by
Jerry Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady vehemently denied the allegation in an emotional
press conference last week at her Chappaqua home and released a
letter Fray had sent to her in 1997 begging forgiveness for lies he
told about her.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Lazio had tried to ''promote'' the accusation by
publicly doubting Clinton's denial, Murphy said: ''Of course not.
What happened was, it's a New York Senate campaign, which means
it's highly entertaining and there's a new, explosive, crazy issue
every week. And Mrs. Clinton's had a very bad week because of these
allegations. What Rick said after days of questioning, and I think
what he said before, the problem is who knows who to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was also asked if he believes the first lady is
anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I don't,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Wins British Open  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) -- Five hundred years of legend and
lore hardly prepared golf's hallowed home for Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   On the same linksland that Old Tom Morris nurtured and Jack
Nicklaus conquered, along came a 24-year-old with a keen eye for
history.
</P>
<P>
   Woods not only became the youngest player to win the career
Grand Slam, he completed it faster than any of the four greats who
did it before him.
</P>
<P>
   The final piece came Sunday, when Woods held the silver claret
jug under the cool, gray skies of St. Andrews after another
record-breaking performance to win the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the ultimate,'' Woods said. ''This is the home of golf.
This is where you always want to win. To have a chance to complete
the slam at St. Andrews is pretty special. I was able to bring it
home.''
</P>
<P>
   He brought it home in style, strolling over the stone Swilken
Bridge on the 18th fairway and right into history.
</P>
<P>
   Challenged briefly by David Duval, Woods pulled away for an
eight-stroke victory. It wasn't quite as overwhelming as his
15-stroke victory in the U.S. Open last month, but it was the
largest in 87 years of golf's oldest championship.
</P>
<P>
   Woods doesn't only win, he wins by record margins.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Tom Watson, the only man to win a British Open at five
courses but never at St. Andrews, summed it up best.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is something supernatural,'' Watson said. ''He has raised
the bar to a level that only he can jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of daring fans tried to leap over the burn on the 18th
fairway to watch Woods finish off his latest masterpiece. He didn't
disappoint them, making a par on the final hole for a 69 that set
another benchmark for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   He finished at 19-under 269, the lowest score in relation to par
ever at a major championship and the best score ever at St.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he as good as he can get, Woods said: ''No, no, no no.
Definitely not.''
</P>
<P>
   He became the first player to win all four majors since Jack
Nicklaus' victory in the 1966 British Open at age 26.
</P>
<P>
   Having won three of the last four majors, Woods seems to be
racing toward the record that matters the most -- the 18 majors
Nicklaus won in a career that remains the standard.
</P>
<P>
   For now.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is the chosen one. He's the best player who has played the
game right now,'' said Mark Calcavecchia, who stuck around St.
Andrews to watch history in the making. ''If Jack was in his prime
today, I don't think he could keep up with Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing eras is never easy, but Woods' performance in the
majors stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   Woods won the British Open by eight strokes over Ernie Els and
Thomas Bjorn, the largest margin of victory in the British Open
since 1913, when J.H. Taylor won by eight strokes over Ted Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Woods became only the third British Open champion to win with
four rounds in the 60s, and he beat by one stroke the record Nick
Faldo set at St. Andrews in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy is simply in a different league,'' Faldo said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods also became the first player since Watson in 1982 to win
the U.S. and British Opens in the same year, and the first since
Nicklaus in 1972 to own three major championships at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Woods now goes to the PGA Championship with a chance to join Ben
Hogan as the only players to win three majors in one year.
</P>
<P>
   And what about after that?
</P>
<P>
   ''He's always had his own goals,'' father Earl Woods said. ''I'd
say the next one is winning all four of them in one year -- soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Els also set a record -- the first player to finish second in
three straight majors. He now has been runner-up to Woods six
times, more than any other player.
</P>
<P>
   Els shot a 69, while Bjorn closed with a 71 to finish at 277.
</P>
<P>
   But the real challenge came from Duval, No. 2 in the world
ranking behind Woods. It was the first time they were paired
together in the final group of a final round -- in a major
championship, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Duval went out in 32 and was only three strokes back until
Woods, perhaps sensing history slipping away, poured it on with
birdies on three of the next four holes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Duval crumbled. He was playing for second until
hitting into the notorious Road Hole bunker on No. 17 and taking
four shots to get out. He finished with a 75.
</P>
<P>
   ''As good as everything turned on the front nine was as bad as
everything turned on the back,'' Duval said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He simply didn't make mistakes, and he capitalized on the
holes you expect to capitalize on. It was a spectacular
performance, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   The other players to win the Grand Slam were Gene Sarazen in
1935, Hogan in 1953, Gary Player in 1965 and Nicklaus in '66 at
Muirfield. Nicklaus went on to win the Grand Slam two more times.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been the elite players to ever play the game,'' Woods
said. ''And to be in the same breath as those guys, it makes it
very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Woods the youngest player to win all four majors, he
did it in only his 93rd sanctioned tournament, compared with 125
for Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Woods won $759,150 from the record purse at the British Open. It
was his sixth victory this year, 21st on the PGA Tour and 25
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   With the claret jug on a wooden table next to the first tee,
shining in the bright sunlight over Scotland, Woods set out for
what figured to be another breeze along the coast of the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the U.S. Open, a challenge awaited.
</P>
<P>
   Duval made the Old Course look like PGA West in the California
desert, where he shot the only final-round 59 in history. After a
nice lag putt from 70 feet on the first, Duval hit it stiff to 2
and 5 feet on the next two holes for birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, in his trademark Chianti-colored sweater and black
slacks, looked uncomfortable from the start, shifting his legs over
his first two birdie putts and missing both from inside 10 feet.
When he finally made one on No. 4 from 18 feet, he showed more
emotion than he had all week by raising the putter with his left
hand and punching the air with his right.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a turning point, it came on the 10th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Duval got a huge break when his drive hit on the top of a pot
bunker and carried along the baked turf to about pin high, where a
simple chip left him 12 feet for birdie. The putt was on line for
the cup but stopped inches short.
</P>
<P>
   He grimaced, scolded himself under his breath and sulked off the
green, standing to the side as Woods buried a 10-foot birdie to
build the lead back to four strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a sore back, Duval showed plenty of fight.
</P>
<P>
   He also knew when it was time to concede. A sloppy bogey by
Duval and a routine birdie by Woods on the 12th hole restored the
lead to six strokes, and Woods cruised to victory.
</P>
<P>
   That could make for a long flight home. Duval and Woods were
scheduled to be on the same charter plane to Florida -- along with
the claret jug.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case two years ago when Woods finished one stroke
out of a playoff at Royal Birkdale, won by his good friend Mark
O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   ''I brought the claret jug back on the plane with Tiger,''
O'Meara said. ''He held it and knew that he wanted it someday.''
</P>
<P>
   He has it now, holding on with such a firm grip that anyone is
going to have a hard time wresting it away. Or any other major, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I played the regular tour events. Tiger plays his own
events,'' Els said. ''I'm probably living in an era where we're
going to see the next great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he paused, realizing what had unfolded over the past four
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're already seeing that.''

<HEADLINE> Five Deported From Australia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Five people with links to terrorist
organizations have been deported from Australia in the last year to
reduce risks of attacks on the Sydney 2000 Olympics, according to a
published report.
</P>
<P>
   Three had suspected or proven links with Middle Eastern
terrorist groups, one to a central European organization and one to
an Asian terrorist group, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth man, already under surveillance by a foreign
intelligence agency for terrorist links, had been caught trying to
board a cargo ship bound for Australia, the Telegraph said.
</P>
<P>
   The reports quoted an unnamed security source as saying it was
usually ''extremely rare'' to find people with terrorist links in
Australia and the time frame made it obvious they were linked to
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Olympic security authorities were planning to meet
with several national Olympic committees later this week to outline
security planning for the Sept. 15-Oct. 1 games.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's federal Attorney-General Daryl Williams, who is
responsible for national security, has said Australian agencies and
police were well equipped to handle security during the Olympics.

   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- Police have
detained 20 illegal Chinese immigrants who were dropped off by boat
in the U.S. Virgin Islands, but around 20 others on the boat eluded
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A citizen rounded up 20 Chinese nationals and one Haitian man
and put them in his truck to take them to the police station, but
the Haitian jumped out of the truck and escaped, said police Sgt.
Annette Raimer.

   Police said as many as 40 people were on the boat that let off
the illegal immigrants on St. Thomas' north coast Saturday, and
police were searching for the passengers who fled.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 346 Chinese have been detained for illegally
entering the United States through the Caribbean territory, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have said that many of the migrants pay
thousands of dollars to smuggling rings that move them through
other Caribbean islands on their way to the Virgin Islands to
arrive on U.S. soil.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Militants Under Siege  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Algerian troops backed by artillery and
helicopter gunships besieged the mountain hide-outs of Islamic
militants, amid militant attacks that have killed 31 people in four
days, newspapers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight militants have died over the past week in the
army's offensive in the mountainous Jijel region, 160 miles east of
the capital of Algiers, the El Watan daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The report said army artillery pounded paths leading to the
hide-outs in the Collo Mountains, from which the militants have
carried out attacks on civilians and soldiers as part of a campaign
of terror to establish a fundamentalist regime in this North
African nation.
</P>
<P>
   In one such attack in the Jijel region on Thursday, militants
killed four civilians by cutting their throats, the Liberte
newspaper said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Another attack claimed the lives of five civilians, whose cars
were stopped at a roadblock erected by militants about 280 miles
west of Algiers, the paper said. Three had their throats slit, and
the two others were shot, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper also reported that three soldiers died and seven more
were wounded in an ambush on Friday by militants near Azzaba, 220
miles east of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   Another newspaper, Le Matin, on Sunday reported four more
civilians deaths, as well as the killings of two members of a local
defense group. Combined with 13 other deaths -- including a newlywed
couple and three children -- reported by newspapers on Saturday,
militants have reportedly killed 31 civilians and soldiers since
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 1,300 people have died in the past six months, and
100,000 have been killed since 1992, when the militants began the
campaign of terror after the government canceled elections that a
now-banned Islamic fundamentalist party was set to win.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Crunch Salary Numbers  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- If Washington Redskins running back Stephen
Davis catches just one touchdown pass this season, he will earn a
bonus of about $1.5 million -- and it won't count against the salary
cap.
</P>
<P>
   How come? That particular achievement, using the NFL's legalese,
is ''not likely to be earned.''
</P>
<P>
   How can that be? Because it just so happens that Davis, even
though he led the NFC and set a franchise record with 1,405 yards
rushing, didn't catch a single touchdown pass last year. He did
have two TD receptions in 1998, but all that matters when figuring
''not likely'' incentives is whether a player improves in a
particular stat from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   That's one way to get around the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Such financial wheelings and dealings were flying fast and
furious Saturday when the Redskins signed their last two holdouts,
Davis and No. 2 overall draft pick LaVar Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm eager to understand all these things on my own,''
Arrington said.
</P>
<P>
   Have a seat, LaVar. It could take a while.
</P>
<P>
   The record will show that Davis signed a one-year, $3.532
million contract with a $1 million signing bonus, and that
Arrington's deal covers six years for a shade under $36 million
with a $10.75 million signing bonus and a voidable seventh year.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the numbers that count, in one way or other, against
the salary cap. Reality is far different. For instance, if
Arrington is on the field for just 35 percent of the defensive
plays this season -- a sure thing unless he gets hurt -- a series of
''escalators'' kick in that would earn him at least another $4
million -- cap-free.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington held out for six days because he wanted more money
than No. 1 overall pick Courtney Brown got from Cleveland. Such a
deal would have upset the natural order of the NFL universe, and
the Redskins weren't about to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, agents Kevin and Carl Poston -- brothers whom
Arrington called his ''two-headed dragon'' -- said the six-year deal
matches Brown's dollar-for-dollar for the first three years and is
slightly less than Brown's for the last three.
</P>
<P>
   But here comes the spin. Kevin Poston said that if Arrington
meets every possible incentive in the contract, he would earn more
than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''His overall package is more than Courtney's,'' Poston said.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington's holdout was standard fare these days. Davis'
negotiations, however, were especially bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had never complained about being a backup. He even
volunteered to play out of position at fullback for a season after
a teammate was injured, and he literally took one for the team when
he got sucker-punched by receiver Michael Westbrook and didn't
raise a fuss about it.
</P>
<P>
   After his great year in 1999, Davis felt it was his turn to get
one of those huge contracts signed by so many of his peers. When
the Redskins made a first offer that would have paid him only $1.5
million in salary and bonus the first year, Davis was so insulted
he walked out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stephen Davis hasn't been the same since,'' his agent, Steve
Weinberg, said.
</P>
<P>
   Countering what he considered to be a joke offer with his own
joke, Weinberg suggested a $100 million contract with a $14 million
signing bonus. Acrimony was high. The Redskins designated Davis
their franchise player to keep him from becoming a free agent, and
the two sides went months without talking.
</P>
<P>
   It took a girl about to turn 16 to get things going. On
Thursday, when the full camp started, Weinberg's daughter,
Michelle, said: ''Dad, this is absurd.'' She typed a fax and, with
some minor editing from Dad, it was sent to the Redskins. Contact
was re-established.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, Davis had agreed to a one-year contract
that at least gets him in camp while Weinberg and the Redskins work
on a long-term deal. Weinberg thinks it's a landmark deal that
franchise players will demand in future years: It has a no-trade
clause, a likely-but-''not-likely'' incentive, and -- in case they
can't work out a long-term deal -- it states that the Redskins can't
put the franchise tag on Davis again next year if he meets some
routine standards, such as 800 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously silent on the Redskins' big day were the Redskins
themselves. Director of player personnel Vinny Cerrato refused to
comment and didn't even present either of his signees at their
press conferences, leaving the agents to win the spin doctor game.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Cerrato's just worn out from all that cap maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Arrington took part in his first practice Sunday and was
worked hard by linebackers coach Foge Fazio. ''He did fair,'' Fazio
said. ''He's out of shape, and he needs a lot of work.'' ...
Arrington and the other first- and second-stringers then moved to
the sideline while the third and fourth units took part in an
intrasquad scrimmage. Among the standouts: QB Todd Husak (22-yard
TD pass to Derrius Thompson) and RB Chad Dukes (10-yard TD run).
... The Redskins signed RB Gerard Arnold and waived WR Ethan Howell
and LB Andre Reed.

<HEADLINE> J.R. Redmond Signs With Patriots  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Third-round pick J.R. Redmond has signed a
four-year contract with the New England Patriots, more than a week
after the running back was scheduled to report to training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was worth a reported $1.681 million. His signing bonus,
which was reduced during the holdout, was $300,000, team spokesman
Stacey James said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, out of Arizona State, received the highest average
salary of any third-round choice. But his signing bonus was about
$200,000 less than the amount slotted for that spot.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond isn't ready to practice after undergoing surgery last
month to repair an inflamed tendon in his groin. He will compete
with second-year pro Kevin Faulk and Raymont Harris, formerly of
the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers, for the vacant running
back job. Terry Allen, last year's starter, wasn't re-signed after
the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also signed free agent linebacker Rob Holmberg, a
six-year NFL veteran who played last season with the Minnesota
Vikings.

<HEADLINE> Columbus man claims he's sailor in famous V-J Day photo  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 15, 1945, sailor Ernie Dubay was working as a guard at
St. Albans Naval Hospital in Queens, N.Y., when he heard on the
radio that Japan had surrendered and the war was over.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as his shift ended, he hopped on the subway to Times
Square, where he knew there'd be a party going on. He came up from
the subway, saw a nurse in white, bent her over and kissed her.
</P>
<P>
   A photographer happened to be there and snapped the pair
kissing. That photographer happened to be Alfred Eisenstaedt, who
worked for Life magazine, Dubay said. And that picture happened to
become the symbol of the joy and relief the nation felt on V-J Day
and one of the most famous photos ever taken.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenstaedt didn't identify his subjects. In the 55 years since
it was taken, about two dozen men have claimed they're the sailor.
But Dubay, a retired school principal who lives in Columbus, N.J.,
insists he's the one.
</P>
<P>
   Why did he wait 55 years?
</P>
<P>
   Because he was more interested in peace at home than his place
in photographic history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never told my wife because we were going steady at the time,
and I should have been home kissing her instead of being in Times
Square kissing that girl,'' he said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   His wife wouldn't have understood, he said, and he couldn't get
up the nerve to tell her. The longer he waited, the harder it got.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know how you look down from a high diving board and it
looks like it's 10 feet, and you look again and it looks like 15?''
Dubay said. ''That's how it was.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 52 years they were married, Dubay never told his wife his
secret. She died in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He waited until now to go public because he ran for office in
Columbus last year and he didn't want his neighbors to think his
claim was a campaign stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Dubay doesn't want fame or fortune, he just wants to set the
record straight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't need the notoriety, but I saw these fellows claimed
they were the one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Years after the photo was taken, Life magazine identified the
nurse as Edith Shain, of Santa Monica, Calif. She has said the
sailor was Carl Muscarello, a retired New York detective who worked
on a submarine tender during the war.
</P>
<P>
   But Dubay says that isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm the man in the picture,'' the 75-year-old said. ''I've got
all the features, believe me, and I know it's me.''
</P>
<P>
   He can still see the moment in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can picture her walking down, me grabbing her, me kissing
her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't a passionate kiss. It was just a celebration kiss,''
he said. ''That's all it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The photo only shows the side of the sailor's face and his right
hand as he holds the nurse around her waist. But Dubay is hoping an
expert in photo enhancement could show the similarities to him
today.
</P>
<P>
   ''Noses don't change, chins don't change, ears don't change,
hands don't change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Romer, who teaches the history and conservation of
photography at the George Eastman House, a museum of photography in
Rochester, N.Y., said it would be possible to analyze the sailor's
features, but it would not provide a definitive answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are certain characteristics of everybody that are
distinct to them, but those characteristics can not only change
over time but they aren't always accurately rendered in a photo,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One can look at this man's ears, hands and chin and you may be
able to make a complete analysis against the information in the
picture,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, that won't necessarily prove that it's Dubay.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may make the case clearer that it might not be him, it will
never absolutely determine that it is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Romer said the mystery might just be better left unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a story about human nature and human drama, that there
is more than one claimant to that. Was there more than one sailor
kissing a girl in Times Square that day? Sure. There was more than
one sailor, more than one nurse, more than one kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Dubay agreed to that much.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody was kissing everybody,'' he said. ''You know how
sailors are.''

<HEADLINE> Athletics 5, Angels 0  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Rookie Mark Mulder followed up his worst
outing of the year by pitching 7 2-3 scoreless innings, and Randy
Velarde hit a two-run homer as the Oakland Athletics defeated the
Anaheim Angels 5-0 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder (6-6) had lost each of his last four starts, including
allowing 10 runs in four innings on Tuesday at Colorado. He hadn't
won a game since June 25 against Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed six hits and struck out five before being pulled with
two on and two outs in the eighth. Mike Magnante got Garrett
Anderson to ground out to end the threat. Jason Isringhausen
finished the six-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder allowed just two hits through his first four innings, a
double to Mo Vaughn in the first and a double to Anderson in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder's next two innings were shaky. With two outs in the
fifth, Edgard Clemente singled then went to third on Darin Erstad's
blooper to shallow left. But Mulder struck out Kevin Stocker to end
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and third and one out in the sixth, Mulder
got Troy Glaus to hit into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had homered in 13 straight games before Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde put the A's up 2-0 in the first inning with his eighth
home run of the season, scoring Terrence Long, who singled.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada hit an RBI single off Ken Hill (5-6) in the third
inning, and Jason Giambi added a sacrifice to right in the fourth
to put the A's up 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi added a solo home run, his 24th homer, off reliever Al
Levine with two outs in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hill allowed four runs and 10 hits in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The A's and Angels remain tangled in a close race for second
place in the AL West, behind division leader Texas. The A's have
struggled of late, losing 14 of their last 22 games, but remain a
game ahead of Anaheim. Oakland plays seven of its next 10 games at
home.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Vaughn has been hit by a pitch in three of the last four
games. He was hit by Mulder to lead off the sixth. ... With his
single in the fifth, Erstad has 161 hits through 99 games, keeping
him on pace to beat George Sisler's all-time season mark of 257
hits set in 1920. ... The A's put together three consecutive games
without an error for the first time this season.

<HEADLINE> Hall-Of-Fame Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Carlton Fisk isn't done collecting
honors.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox will retire their former catcher's No. 27 before
their Sept. 4 game against the Seattle Mariners, general manager
Dan Duquette said Sunday before the Hall of Fame induction
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk played parts of 11 seasons with Boston before playing his
last 13 years with the Chicago White Sox. Chicago has already
retired the No. 72 he wore there.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Red Sox have said they will only retire a
number for a player who is in the Hall, spent more than 10 years
with the team and finished his career with Boston. Fisk consults
with the Red Sox front office, and Duquette said that's good
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk's number will be mounted onto Fenway's right-field roof
facade along with Ted Williams' No. 9, Carl Yastrzemski's No. 8,
Bobby Doerr's No. 4, Joe Cronin's No. 1 and the No. 42 all teams
have retired in honor of Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox rules require a player to finish his career with the
team, but the team overlooked that technicality in Fisk's case.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   THE GOOD OLD DAYS: It looks like Barry Larkin is staying with
the Cincinnati Reds for now. But Sparky Anderson said this weekend
that if free agency was as prevalent in the 1970s as it is today,
they wouldn't have been able to keep the Big Red Machine together.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, it couldn't stay together,'' Anderson said. ''There's four
or five guys there who would have to be divvied up a fifth (of the
team) apiece. And I think they'd be arguing because they'd own the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Anderson said he's partially responsible for breaking
up the team, giving his OK to the trade that sent Perez to Montreal
after the 1976 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tony Perez should have never left Cincinnati,'' Anderson said.
''When he left, I started to realize, 'Something's missing.'
</P>
<P>
   ''They could have sent me to the Bahamas and kept Perez and they
could have won it again.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   WAIT 'TIL NEXT YEAR: Among those eligible for the first time
next year are: Steve Bedrosian, Ron Darling, Kirk Gibson, John
Kruk, Candy Maldonado, Don Mattingly, Kirby Puckett, Dave Righetti,
Dave Stewart, Andy Van Slyke, Lou Whitaker and Dave Winfield.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LONGEVITY: Inductees are supposed to take 15 minutes for their
acceptance speech. Carlton Fisk took more like 45.
</P>
<P>
   The catching great thanked everyone from his high school
baseball coach and army reserve officers to the clubhouse manager
in Chicago, growing emotional at times.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk made the Hall by lasting longer than any catcher in
history, playing in a record 2,229 games. His defining moment was a
game-winning homer in the Game 6 of the World Series -- in the 12th
inning.
</P>
<P>
   And, when he was playing, he was known for long, slow trips to
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS: Longtime Cleveland baseball writer Hal Lebovitz
was awarded the J.G. Taylor Spink Award for excellence in baseball
reporting. ... A record 45 previously inducted Hall of Famers
returned for the ceremony. Catfish Hunter, Pee Wee Reese and Bob
Lemon have died since last year's induction. ... The ceremony
opened with a recitation of ''Casey at the Bat,'' by Worcester,
Mass., native Ernest Thayer. ... Dennis DeYoung, the lead singer
from the group Styx and a White Sox fan, sang the national anthem.
... Bob Sheppard presented the Hall with the microphone he has used
for parts of the last 50 years as the New York Yankees announcer.

Clinton Returns to Camp David

   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Hurrying back from an abbreviated trip to Asia,
President Clinton was rejoining troubled Middle East talks at Camp David today
even as American mediators spoke of the possibility of failure. ''We might reach
a deal; we might not,'' a summit spokesman said. On a 13th day of talks -- the
same period required to strike a deal at the landmark 1978 Camp David summit --
neither Israel nor the Palestinians signaled any change in position on the prime
point of dispute: Jerusalem. Both sides claim the ancient city as their capital.

Israel Settlers Will Refuse To Leave

   PSAGOT, West Bank (AP) -- Peace deal or no peace deal, Jewish settlers in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip said Sunday that they will refuse to leave their
homes no matter what is decided at the Camp David summit. Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, conferring at the summit with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, has said
that up to one-quarter, or 50,000, of the 200,000 settlers may be left outside
the umbrella of Israeli sovereignty as part of an agreement. Such a deal would
give the Palestinians the state they seek, but Jewish settlers consider the land

Murphy, who works for the Republican Senate candidate, was asked on CNN if he
believes she used the offensive term. Murphy answered: ''I have no way to know.
I will believe her denial, but I will say, and I think most New Yorkers will

<HEADLINE> Serb Opposition Worries Over West  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia's opposition fears recent
warnings that the West will not recognize results of upcoming
Yugoslav elections could dash their chances of challenging Slobodan
Milosevic, representatives said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Serbia's few dozen opposition parties have contemplated
running against the Yugoslav president and have been counting on
support from Western nations in their attempts.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a foreign affairs adviser to German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, said that some heads of state attending the G-8
conference in Japan remarked that recent amendments to the Yugoslav
constitution were manipulative attempts to prolong Milosevic's
rule. As a result, Western leaders will disregard the vote, said
the adviser, Michael Steiner.
</P>
<P>
   The changes included two additional mandates for Milosevic and a
downgrading of the position of Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner
in the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's pro-Western leadership -- which is at odds with
Milosevic's central government in Belgrade -- has already said it
will ignore the general elections that are due by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's largest opposition party, Serbian Renewal Movement, led
by Vuk Draskovic, has also vowed to boycott the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Yet several of the other opposition parties, which have recently
set their differences aside, were still considering whether or not
to challenge the Milosevic's ruling Socialists at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner's warning is a ''new development'' calling for a
''reconsideration of a decision about the elections,'' said
Dragoljub Micunovic, who heads of the opposition Democratic Center
party.
</P>
<P>
   ''This further complicates the situation for Serbia's united
opposition,'' said Vladan Batic of Christian Democrats, adding that
the opposition is now wondering whether the world will ignore the
elections on principle even if the opposition wins.

<P>
   Yugoslavia's parliament, dominated by Milosevic loyalists, is to
convene Monday to adopt a few electoral laws in tune with the
amendments. There are indications the assembly might also set a
date for the elections -- possibly as early as September.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of Serbia's main opposition groups are to meet Tuesday
to further streamline a joint strategy against Milosevic and decide
whether to boycott or take part in the elections. They have pledged
to stay together either way.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition boycott would guarantee an easy victory for
Milosevic's Socialists and their allies, the ultranationalist
Radicals and a neo-communist party led by Milosevic's wife.

<HEADLINE> Lee's Wife, CIA Reportedly Tied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Wen Ho Lee's wife worked for the CIA, a
revelation that could undermine the government's case against the
scientist accused of breaching security at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, the San Jose Mercury News reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unnamed congressional, intelligence and other sources,
the newspaper said Sylvia Lee supplied information about Chinese
scientists to a CIA officer when she was a secretary at Los Alamos
National Laboratory in the 1980s. She worked as liaison between the
lab and visiting delegations, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the newspaper said, Wen Ho Lee, who worked at the lab for
nearly 20 years, and his wife met with a CIA official before they
went to China in 1986, a trip federal prosecutors have called
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow told The Associated Press he had not
seen the article.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't discuss specifics of it because it is a matter
currently before the courts,'' Harlow said, ''but I can assure you
she didn't work for the CIA.''
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee's lawyer Mark Holscher has portrayed Lee and his wife
as loyal Americans who did undercover work for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   A call to Holscher's office was not immediately returned Sunday.
Wen Ho Lee attorney John Cline declined to comment, and another Wen
Ho Lee attorney, Brian Sun, declined comment until he could talk to
his clients. The U.S. Attorney's office also could not be reached
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is jailed in New Mexico awaiting a November trial on charges
that he mishandled classified data. Although he has been
investigated for spying, he has not been charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   For a conviction, prosecutors must convince a jury that Lee took
data with the intent to harm the United States or aid another
country.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Lee has not been charged.

<HEADLINE> Tel Aviv Proposes Light Rail System  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel announced plans Sunday for a light rail
system for Tel Aviv that would link the increasingly congested
city's northern and southern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The subway's first line would link the town of Petach Tikva,
north of Tel Aviv, with Bat Yam in the south, the Finance Ministry
and the Tel Aviv municipality said in announcing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the first line would be above ground, but 2&AMP;frac12; miles would
run under central Tel Aviv, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials did not announce costs or a timetable for the
planned light rail system.
</P>
<P>
   Tel Aviv and its suburbs constitute a metropolis that encompass
over a million people along Israel's Mediterranean coast. In recent
years, traffic jams have increased.
</P>
<P>
   Tel Aviv has contemplated launching a subway at least since the
1991 Gulf War, when Iraq aimed Scud missiles at the city. City
authorities noted that, in other cities, subways had proven the
most effective bomb shelters during bombing attacks.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs FDA Check of Cholestin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration should be allowed
to regulate a dietary supplement made from a substance that is
chemically identical to the active ingredient in a drug that lowers
cholesterol, an appeals court has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday that a
federal court in Utah erred when it said the FDA could not regulate
the dietary supplement Cholestin.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA had banned imports of red yeast powder containing
mevinolin, which is used to make Cholestin. Because mevinolin is
identical to a synthetic drug -- sold as Mevacor and prescribed to
lower cholesterol -- the agency regarded the powder as an unapproved
drug.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Court Judge Dale Kimball last year ruled that
FDA's ban was illegal under a 1994 federal law because Cholestin
clearly fit the definition of ''dietary supplement'' and could not
be regulated by the agency as a drug.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball said the law allows FDA to regulate finished products --
but not their ingredients -- as drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court disagreed, saying the intent of the law was
ambiguous and that to interpret it as applying only to finished
drug products ''would be to restrict its scope so as to render it a
meaningless limitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision sends the case back to district court for decisions
on unresolved arguments.

<HEADLINE> Grant Cottage a link to nation's past  </HEADLINE>
By RIK STEVENS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILTON, N.Y. (AP) - At 8:08 Sunday morning, the men of the Sons
of Union Veterans Camp 154 paused outside their tents and gazed
northwest toward the top of Mt. McGregor.
</P>
<P>
   It was 115 years ago to the minute that President Ulysses S.
Grant died in a cottage atop the mountain, finally succumbing to
the throat cancer he raced to finish his best-selling memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Few people know the cottage is here in Saratoga County, 30 miles
north of Albany and two miles west of Northway Exit 16. Where it
once sat in the shadow of the grand Balmoral Hotel, it now has Mt.
McGregor Correctional Facility as a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, all is as it was in the days following Grant's death.
Personal effects, medicine bottles, even the original floral
arrangements from his funeral provide a look into the 18th
president's last weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Grant was literally fighting his last great battle here,''
said Kathleen Cummings, a member of the Friends of Grant Cottage, a
group that cares for the two-story mountain retreat and provides
educational tours during the summer. ''He was desperate to get his
memoirs done.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting fleeced by corrupt financier Ferdinand Ward in
1884, Grant was broke. At the urging of Mark Twain, the ailing
Grant determined to write his memoirs to help restore his family's
name and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was his last battle and he won it,'' said Richard
Trombley, who portrays Grant at re-enactments. Strikingly familiar,
Trombley bore the president's characteristic graying whiskers, silk
top hat, Prince Albert coat, house slippers and ivory muffler, worn
to warm his ravaged throat. ''In death, he was able to do for his
family what he was unable to do in life: Provide for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Trombley was surrounded by other re-enactors Sunday, including
the president's wife, Julia, his children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Grant's death in 1885, veterans of the Grand
Army of the Republic, the men who served him as he led Union troops
to victory in the Civil War, ascended the Adirondack foothill,
encamped and posted an honor guard at the remains of their leader.
</P>
<P>
   Now, exactly 115 years later, descendants of those men stood in
dappled sunlight and lifted anew the mantle borne by their
grandfathers' fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stopped and stood for a moment and I looked at my watch and
it was the exact minute,'' said Daniel T. Cole, a member of the
Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War Camp 154.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's maternal great-great-grandfather, George Thomas Hatch,
fought with Grant under his first command. His paternal
great-great-grandfather, Joel Cole, was under Grant when Robert E.
Lee surrendered April 9, 1865 at Appomattox Court House.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rave's great-great-grandfather, Charles Kniffin, fought in
places like Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg and Gettysburg,
where he would lose his leg.
</P>
<P>
   It is for their ancestors - and all those who fought in that
great, terrible war - that men like Cole and Rave and groups like
the Friends of Grant Cottage exist, they say. Children get a few
pages in a history book but most fail to take advantage of living
histories that remain in places like Grant Cottage.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the cottage, a stone sits. Across the top of its
verdigris plaque is a message: ''Lest We Forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here to keep green the memories,'' said Rave. ''We're
honoring our ancestors who stood here.''

<HEADLINE> Sick baby seal found on Jones Beach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WANTAGH, N.Y. (AP) - A baby seal found at Jones Beach State Park
was being treated Sunday for dehydration and malnourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Workers from the Theodore Roosevelt Nature Center found the sick
hooded seal pup at West End Field 2 on Saturday while monitoring
local nests of birds known as plovers, the Riverhead Foundation for
Marine Research and Preservation said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Durham, a stranding expert from the Riverhead
Foundation, examined the 3-foot, 45-pound male pup and found he was
dehydrated and malnourished. The animal, named Plover by his
rescuers, will be given fluids and monitored closely for several
days, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Plover was believed to be two to three months old. Hooded seals
are generally found on ice drifts off the east coast of Canada and
along the coast of Greenland, but they have been known to swim
south along the U.S. eastern seaboard.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Wins Senior Instinet Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- Gil Morgan shot a 6-under-par 66 Sunday
to cap off a tournament record 17-under 199 that gave him a
four-stroke victory over Bob Murphy and Bruce Fleisher in the
Senior PGA Instinet Open.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan broke Chi Chi Rodriguez's 1987 mark of 14-under 202 and
his margin of victory was the second largest in the 16-year history
of the event, played for the first time at 2-year-old Jasna Polana.
It also was the first time in three years the tournament didn't go
to a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher shot a 66 Sunday and Murphy shot a 70 to tie for second
at 13 under. Defending champion Tom Jenkins, who led after the
first round and was tied for the lead entering the final round, was
another stroke back at a 71.
</P>
<P>
   In winning the $210,000 first prize Morgan earned his second
title this year and his 17th on the Senior PGA Tour. He won the
Emerald Coast Classic in March.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, Jenkins and Murphy began the day at 11 under and were
even at 12 under after five holes. Morgan birdied No. 6 to take the
lead for good, and added birdies at 7 and 8 to open a three-stroke
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy birdied No. 9 to get within two strokes and it remained
that way until Morgan birdied 15 to go three ahead of Murphy and
Fleisher.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, a licensed doctor of optometry, finished with his eighth
birdie of the day on the par-5 18th, giving him 10 birdies on the
par-5s in the tournament. Morgan entered the day leading the tour
with birdies on 46.7 percent of the par-5s he played, and birdied
all four in the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer completed his 1,000th official PGA Tour/Senior PGA
Tour event with a 73, finishing 4 over for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   John Mahaffey tied the course record with a 65 Sunday and
finished at 210.

<HEADLINE> Dragila Beats Own Pole Vault Record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Stacy Dragila smashed her world pole
vault record Sunday, clearing 15 feet, 2&AMP;frac14; inches, at the U.S.
Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila had set the previous record of 15-1&AMP;frac34; at Phoenix in May.
</P>
<P>
   The former rodeo performer and heptathlete won the inaugural
world indoor championship in 1997 and the inaugural world outdoor
title last year. She is the favorite for the inaugural pole vault
gold medal at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   After soaring over the record height, Dragila had the bar raised
to 15-5, but she missed three times. Her best attempt was her
second, when the bar hung up momentarily after she cleared it, but
it fell when Dragila apparently nicked it on the way down.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Montreal swept its first three-game series on the
road in nearly five years as Fernando Seguignol and Geoff Blum
homered to give the Expos a 7-6 win Sunday over the Florida
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos last swept a road series of three or more games Aug.
8-10, 1995, at Houston. They did sweep a two-game set in New York
against the Mets in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Seguignol went 3-for-4, and Blum capped an impressive series by
going 2-for-5 as the Expos pulled to within one game (47-48) of the
.500 mark. Blum drove in nine runs in the three games.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Vazquez (8-5) allowed four runs -- two earned -- and eight
hits in six innings for just his second win in his last nine
starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos scored three runs with two outs in the fifth against
Jesus Sanchez (6-8) to take a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Lenny Webster walked and Vazquez reached on a
throwing error by third baseman Mike Lowell that put runners on
second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Bradley knocked in both runners with a single to center
for a 5-3 lead. Wilton Guerrero then doubled to left, scoring
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez allowed seven runs -- four earned -- and 14 hits, two of
them homers.
</P>
<P>
   Blum's solo homer in the sixth gave the Expos a 7-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins scored two in the seventh to pull within 7-6. Mark
Smith hit an RBI double and pinch-hitter Alex Gonzalez had an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez advanced to second on a passed ball, and reliever Scott
Strickland walked Dave Berg before ending the inning by striking
out Mike Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Strickland pitched two perfect innings for his second
save.
</P>
<P>
   Seguignol's solo home run, his third homer of the season, gave
Montreal a 3-2 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins tied the game on Sanchez's RBI single in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The three-game sweep was the first allowed at home by Florida
since May 19-21 against the Dodgers. The Marlins have lost seven of
their last nine and have dropped two games below .500.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Seguignol had an error for the second straight game when he
allowed a single by Luis Castillo to go between his legs in left.
On Saturday, Seguignol misplayed a fly ball in right. ... Marlins
RF Mark Kotsay left the game in the fourth inning with lower back
spasms. ... LF Cliff Floyd had fluid drained from his knee Sunday
and missed the game. The Marlins are off Monday, and Floyd is
expected to play Tuesday against the Braves. ... Florida's Luis
Castillo has a 15-game hitting streak.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 3, Mariners 2  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Rafael Palmeiro's RBI single in the eighth inning
and Rick Helling's solid pitching gave the Texas Rangers a 3-2
victory over the Seattle Mariners on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who gave up 25 runs in the first two games of their
first series at Safeco Field, ended a four-game losing streak
against Seattle this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Mike Lamb singled off Arthur Rhodes (3-4). With
two outs, Rhodes walked Rusty Greer before Palmeiro, who ended an
0-for-18 slump with a double in the seventh, singled to right.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (11-7) won his fourth straight decision after losing six
consecutive starts. He gave up eight hits, walked two and struck
out one.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 25th save in 30
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field's retractable roof was open under sunny skies after
it failed to close during a storm Saturday, causing a 54-minute
rain delay. That was Seattle's first rain delay since a Seattle
Pilots' game Sept. 12, 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners tied it at 2 in the seventh after David Bell opened
with a double and was sacrificed to third by Dan Wilson. Mark
McLemore, who played nine seasons for the Rangers, singled home
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle got its first run in the fifth when McLemore singled,
stole second and came home on Carlos Guillen's single.
</P>
<P>
   Texas took a 2-0 lead in the fourth after Ivan Rodriguez walked
and took third on a single by Dave Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez scored and Martinez reached third on Wilson's passed
ball, and Lamb had an RBI grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Freddy Garcia started for Seattle and, in six innings, gave up
two runs, one earned, on six hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers loaded the bases in the sixth and the seventh
without scoring. Garcia struck out Luis Alicea to end the sixth and
reliever Brett Tomko got pinch-hitter Frank Catalonotto to pop out
and Gabe Kapler to ground out to end the seventh.
Notes: Mariners manager Lou Piniella said he expects All-Star SS
Alex Rodriguez to be back Tuesday night against Oakland. Piniella
said Rodriguez could be used as a pinch-hitter Monday night against
the Athletics. ''He needs one more day of catching groundballs,
especially to his left,'' Piniella said. ''But hitting-wise he's
ready to go.'' Rodriguez has been on the DL since July 14 because
of a sprained right knee. ... Joe Oliver's grand slam Saturday was
the first against the Rangers in Seattle since Dann Howitt's slam
off Nolan Ryan in the Kingdome Sept. 22, 1993. That was the final
hit against Ryan in his Hall of Fame career.

Clinton Returns to Camp David
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Hurrying back from an abbreviated trip to Asia,
President Clinton rejoined troubled Middle East talks at Camp David today,
saying ''I'm keeping my fingers crossed'' for a peace deal. Clinton arrived by

strike a deal at the landmark 1978 Camp David summit -- neither Israel nor the
Palestinians signaled any change in position on the prime point of dispute:
Jerusalem. Both sides claim the ancient city as their capital.

   MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo. (AP) -- More than a hundred years after
cowboys first discovered the native American dwellings in the cliffs of Mesa
Verde National Park, a wildfire raging through the area is uncovering more sites
and giving archaeologists a better understanding of the people who used to live
here. At least a dozen previously unknown sites have been found as the latest
wildfire stripped away concealing vegetation. The blaze had charred 8,000 acres
as of today and was only 15 percent contained.

prepared to announce his pick. Cheney, former Sen. John Danforth of Missouri and
perhaps others are on Bush's short list, according to highly placed GOP
officials. In seclusion at his Texas ranch, Bush tentatively planned to
introduce his running mate Tuesday. Even his closest advisers said they did not

Court Backs FDA Check of Cholestin
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration should be allowed to regulate
a dietary supplement made from a substance that is chemically identical to the
active ingredient in a drug that lowers cholesterol, an appeals court has ruled.
The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday that a federal court in Utah
erred when it said the FDA could not regulate the dietary supplement Cholestin.
The FDA had banned imports of red yeast powder containing mevinolin, which is
used to make Cholestin. Because mevinolin is identical to a synthetic drug --
sold as Mevacor and prescribed to lower cholesterol -- the agency regarded the
powder as an unapproved drug.

Johnson and Greene met in the final. The first round of this heavyweight battle
of the world's top two sprinters went to Johnson. He swept across the finish
line in 20.14 seconds, finishing second behind former NCAA champion John Capel,
with Greene third at 20.30. The top three advanced to the final.

<HEADLINE> Captain Steve Wins Swaps Stakes  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Trainer Bob Baffert was facing a bad
ending to a trying week until Captain Steve salvaged things with a
2&AMP;frac12;-length victory over Tiznow in the $500,000 Swaps Stakes on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's week hadn't exactly gone well before he saddled
Captain Steve at Hollywood Park. First, he was hit with a lawsuit
for allegedly over-racing 1998 Kentucky Derby winner Real Quiet,
then one of his horses tested positive for morphine.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday got off to a disappointing start when his horses running
in Delaware and Texas both lost, including Silverbulletday in the
Delaware Handicap. Captain Steve improved Baffert's outlook with a
strong kick in the stretch to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God he's back,'' Baffert said. ''I needed this race
really, really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert faces a hearing with stewards at Del Mar later this week
over Nautical Look's positive test. The lawsuit, filed by Highland
Stud of Paris, Ky., over the handling of Real Quiet, also accuses
Baffert of defrauding the farm out of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''That other stuff, we don't worry about that. We just worry
about the horses,'' he said of his troubles. ''That guy is trying
to fight Mike (Pegram) in the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Pegram sold Real Quiet to Highland
Stud before the colt won the Derby, but Pegram was allowed to
continue racing Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve, who proved a bust in the Kentucky Derby (eighth)
and Preakness (fourth), became the third horse to win the Hollywood
Futurity and the Swaps.
</P>
<P>
   The colt won the Futurity on the same track last December, but
he bruised his feet early this year and Baffert said he hadn't been
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now he's put his weight back and he's enjoying it. He's a
different horse,'' he said. ''I was going to be so disappointed if
he didn't win. It was time to fish or cut bait.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Swaps win for Baffert, Pegram and jockey Corey
Nakatani. Captain Steve's human namesake was on hand, too. Capt.
Steve Thompson of the Louisville, Ky., Police Department, who
proved a huge hit during Derby Week, traveled west for the race.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve covered 1[ miles in 1:48 under co-high weight of
120 pounds. He paid $3.80, $2.40 and $2.10 as the wagering
favorite. The victory, worth $300,000, increased Captain Steve's
career earnings to more than $1.4 million, with six wins in 15
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Tiznow returned $2.80 and $2.20, while Spacelink was another
length back in third and paid $2.40 to show.
</P>
<P>
   Riding Captain Steve for the first time, Nakatani settled the
colt off the rail behind leader Millencolin, then went between
horses into the second turn and took a brief lead before unleashing
a strong stretch kick.
</P>
<P>
   ''Turning for home, I couldn't have been any happier. I had a
lot of horse under me and I was just sitting here biding my time,''
Nakatani said. ''When I set him down, he just kicked away from the
other horse (Tiznow). I think he's going to be able to get better
off of this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve was coming off a win in the Iowa Derby on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew the trip to Iowa was really going to help. He needed a
confidence builder. I needed to get a win under his belt,'' said
Baffert, who is considering the Haskell, Travers, Jim Dandy, West
Virginia Derby or Remington Derby for Captain Steve's next race.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Espinoza, who already clinched his first Hollywood Park
riding title with one day left in the meeting, struggled with
Tiznow on the backside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to strangle down on him harder that I would have wanted.
Then I had plenty of room on the inside, but when I decided to go,
he stayed in the same place,'' he said. ''I could see the leader
had too much left. I only rode hard for second after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Grey Memo was fourth, Millencolin fifth and Spicy Stuff, also
trained by Baffert, was last in the six-horse field.

<P>
	   ONEIDA, N.Y. (AP) - A state police investigator was charged
Friday with driving while intoxicated, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator Lyndy Helt was charged after a crash a few minutes
after midnight in Oneida, Maj. James Parmley said. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's embarrassing, obviously, to the state police,'' Parmley
said. ''She's facing disciplinary action. She has a clean record,
and she was in her own car at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Helt, who is on vacation, will be placed on administrative duty
and relieved of her caseload when she returns, Parmley said. AN
internal investigation will be conducted. State Police
Superintendent James McMahon ultimately will decide her punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the crash were unavailable.

<HEADLINE> Jockey Dies After Track Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Ginger Welch, one of the leading jockeys at
Les Bois Park, died after she was thrown in a race by her horse,
which then fell on her. She was 37.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the start of an 870-yard quarterhorse race
Saturday night, Welch's 4-year-old gelding, Porthos, either took a
bad step or clipped heels with another horse and fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was right beside me, then her horse fell,'' said another
jockey, Cammie Papineau. ''There was nothing she could have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch was treated by medics at the track then taken to Saint
Alphonsus Regional Medical Center, where she died. Her death was
the first in the track's 30-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Born Ginger Tremain on Jan. 15, 1963, in Henderson, Nev., Welch
started riding at Pennsylvania and New Jersey tracks. It was there
that she learned under Julie Krone, the sport's winningest woman
jockey.
</P>
<P>
   Welch returned to the West and established herself at tracks in
Idaho and Washington. She rode a longshot to win Idaho's first
$100,000 race, the Centennial Cup, in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Welch won the National Ladies Jockey Challenge at the
Downs at Albuquerque (N.M.) as well as three Idaho Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   Welch is survived by her husband, Dave Welch, their daughter and
a son from an earlier marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don Roloff, the track veterinarian, said Porthos sustained a
pulled muscle and scraped shoulder.

<HEADLINE> Gore touts environmental endorsement  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Vice President Al Gore touted the backing of a
big environmental group Sunday, seeking to ''reach out to the new
opportunities''' to protect air and water.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Sierra Club dismissed suggestions that Gore's
commitment to the environment has waned since he authored ''Earth
in the Balance'' and said endorsing Gore was easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did an exhaustive survey of our chapters and our members,'
said Debbie Sease, a spokesman for the Sierra Club. 'Our members
have full confidence in the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   The 600,000 member environmental group formally issues its
endorsement of Gore on Monday when its leader Robert Cox campaigns
with Gore in the key batttleground states of Michigan and Ohio, but
Gore was going out of his way to underscore the issue in campaign
events Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to be delivered accepting the endorsement, Gore
claimed the environmental high ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been criticized for my unyielding commitment to safeguard
the environment,'' said Gore's speech, which he planned to deliver
to environmental activists with Sierra Club leaders at his side.
''I've been criticized for my call to end the silent rising tide of
global warming that could threaten our health, our economy and our
whole way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the group said chapters representing two-thirds of
their membership backed the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Democratic National Committee fund-raising events in
new Jersey and New York, Gore went out of his way to underscore
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an era in which we are called upon to take more
responsibility for protecting the environment of the earth in all
the places we live,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dismissed suggestions that environmental protections must
come at the cost of bolstering the economy, suggesting that the
nation should take the lead in developing new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really have a responsibility to reach out for the new
opportunities that are right there,'' Gore said, noting that the
world is ''waiting for the U.S. to take the lead to create new
technologies ... that can increase standards of living and expand
wealth while at the same time reducing pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is an important one in several key states, including
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls have suggested that Green Party nominee Ralph Nader
drains support from Gore. And some environmentalists have said they
are suspicious of Gore's commitment to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, from Gore's perspective, is that drain is most
significant in key battleground states like Michigan and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Sease said the image of leaders of the environmental movement
campaigning with Gore should reduce those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think for the Sierra Club to stand up and say 'it's
important for al Gore to be elected president' sends a very
important message,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides were also boasting of the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously this is a very significant endorsement from one of,
if not the, preeminent environmental organization in the country,''
said spokesman Chris Lehane. ''It reflects Al Gore's lifelong
commitment to the environment. It's a passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was getting far less attention than Republican rival George
W. Bush, who set a weekend deadline for deciding on a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's only public appearances Sunday were brief speeches at the
fund-raising events, and he also was spending time visiting his
grandchild in New York before heading to Michigan for events
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign planned a photo-friendly event on the banks of a
river in Grand Rapids to formally unveil the environmental group's
backing.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Village To Welcome Families  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Indian traditionalists in southern Mexico
have agreed to welcome back 14 Protestant families expelled from a
village for not sharing their religious beliefs, the government
news agency Notimex reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant families were driven out of Plan de Ayala, near
the Guatemalan border, on Wednesday by Indians who practice a
Catholicism mixed with Indian traditions. Another 15 Catholic
families also were expelled, but it was not clear if any agreement
would be made to allow them to return.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides signed an agreement Sunday stating that they would
go to outside authorities the next time differences arise, Notimex
reported.
</P>
<P>
   State police started patrolling the village Saturday and planned
to continue doing so as long as their presence was needed, Notimex
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The expulsion is part of a continuing struggle that has seen
tens of thousands of people, most of them Evangelical converts,
driven from their homes in Chiapas in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   Local Mayan Indian cultures place a strong value on consensus
and village leaders claim the converts undermine local cultures
that have been under attack by the outside world for hundreds of
years.

<HEADLINE> 40 Guatemalans Trapped In Trailer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Gaspar Juarez Mendoza was one of 40
Guatemalans hidden among sacks of corn in the back of a truck that
was supposed to secret them across Mexico to the U.S. border -- and
a better life.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his journey ended in tragedy when the trailer carrying
him and his companions was abandoned Saturday in the blistering
midday sun along a highway in southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   By the time one of the occupants managed to pry open the doors
10 hours later, all 40 were suffering from severe dehydration, and
many had already passed out.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Tobasco state found the Guatemalans sprawled out along
the highway, Red Cross officials said. Juarez Mendoza, whose age
was not immediately known, was one of seven who had to be
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   He died later Saturday at a hospital in Villahermosa, 410 miles
southeast of Mexico City, the government news agency Notimex
reported Saturday night. The six others remain in serious
condition, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We couldn't breathe,'' one of the Guatemalans, Juventino
Arango, told The Associated Press. ''We were buried among the sacks
of corn. I had to break them open and empty them so I could get out
and ask for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Those hospitalized were suffering from severe kidney damage due
to dehydration, and also complications from asphyxiation, said Dr.
Heriberto Tosca.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors said they had left two weeks ago, making their way to
San Cristobal de las Casas in the Mexican state of Chiapas, which
borders Guatemala. In Chiapas, they hired a smuggler and paid him
$1,500 to take them to the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tragic end to their journey, those who came out
relatively unscathed said they planned to keep trying to enter the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course we'll try again,'' said one of the Guatemalans.
''Even if the heat kills us or we drown, we will keep on trying
because in our country there is no way to live.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, 22 bodies washed ashore after a boat carrying
Guatemalans trying to reach the United States sank off Mexico's
Pacific coast. The lone survivor told the government news agency
that he and the others had boarded the boat before dawn near the
Mexico-Guatemala border and were caught by a storm.

<HEADLINE> Palestinan Americans, Jews Scuffle  </HEADLINE>
By NASSER SHIYOUKHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- Some 70 Palestinian Americans scuffled
and exchanged insults with Jewish settlers, many of them also
American, when they toured the divided West Bank of Hebron Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting broke out when the tour group of Palestinian
Americans tried to cross into the city's Jewish enclave.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are criminals, you are Nazis,'' the settlers, among the
hardest-line in the West Bank, shouted in English. ''Get off of our
land.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Americans yelled back, ''We are here. It's our
land.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushing and shoving broke out between the two groups. Local
Palestinians joined in, trying to protect the Palestinian
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Hebron has been the repeated scene of Jewish-Arab clashes. The
400 settlers there say the city was willed to the Jews by the
biblical patriarch, Abraham. The city has a population of 120,000
Palestinians living there, about 30,000 in the portion still
controlled by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came on the trip to show our children our country. We want
to show them Palestine on the ground,'' said Musa Natil, of
Houston, the organizer of the Palestinian American group. ''We came
to Hebron to see the suffering of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, wearing T-shirts emblazoned with American and
Palestinian flags, shook hands with shopkeepers in Hebron's market,
within the Israeli-controlled enclave, and the target of settler
attacks in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are heroes, we are behind you,'' the Americans told the
Hebron Palestinians.

   ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) -- Pine Dance beat Hymn by 1&AMP;frac12;
lengths Sunday to win the $200,000 American Derby at Arlington
International Racecourse.
</P>
<P>
   The European-based Pine Dance, ridden by Eddie Ahern, took the
lead for good in the field of four at the top of the stretch and
finished 1 3-16 miles on the turf in 1:55.46.
</P>
<P>
   The Grade II race was the second leg of Arlington's Mid-America
triple. King Cugat took the first leg, the Arlington Classic on
July 1. The final leg is the Secretariat Stakes on Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Dermont Weld, Pine Dance's trainer, said he hopes to run the
horse in the Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the next logical spot for him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The winner paid $17.20 and $5.40. There was no show wagering.
Hymn, who held off Del Mar Show and Boyum for second, returned
$4.40 to place.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Contestant Stirs Talk  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- William Collins, who stirred up
controversy as a ''Big Brother'' contestant, proved as feisty
Sunday outside the confines of the CBS reality-TV show.
</P>
<P>
   In Collins' first news conference since he was voted off the
show Thursday, the Philadelphia youth counselor said he was
prepared for any threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe in my God and I believe in my gun,'' Collins told
the Television Critics Association, noting that he had a permit to
carry a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Collins riled his fellow contestants by playing pranks on them
and engaging in heated discussions on race. He created headlines
outside of the house because of his connection with the New Black
Panther Party for Self-Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the floppy orange hat he sported on ''Big Brother'' and
carrying a Bible, Collins dodged questions about his political
beliefs but spoke at length about his religious devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've seen me with my gun, but you haven't seen me with my
God,'' said Collins, apparently referring to a photo showing him
armed at a 1998 rally held in Texas to protest the dragging death
of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he believed his verbal confrontations with his
fellow housemates, which include whites, a black woman and an
Asian-American man, were valuable.
</P>
<P>
   He helped them reassess their ideas about blacks and to consider
the idea that minorities should be a respected part of the American
melting pot, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   He complained that ''Big Brother'' failed to show him as a
complete person, excluding shots of his devoted prayers while
making hay out of his conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Series executive producer Paul Romer defended the series'
editing, saying that 24 hours of footage had to be boiled down to
the most compelling 22 minutes for each episode.
</P>
<P>
   During a ''Big Brother'' interview Thursday, Collins said he had
been a member of the New Black Panther Party. The group is headed
by Khalid Abdul Muhammad, who was ousted by the Nation of Islam for

Burnett also made an appearance Sunday before the TV critics group.

   ''Everybody already knows who the winner is ... Mr. Burnett and
CBS,'' joked Gretchen Cordy. The series has been a summer hit for
the network and a sequel set in Australia is planned for January.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,200 applications for ''Survivor II'' have been
received in a quarter of the time it took for the first show to
reach that number, Burnett said.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Braces for 2001 Walkouts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood studios have hastened production on
movies and TV shows in anticipation of walkouts by actors and
screenwriters next year over what many believe will be lengthy
contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts with the Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors
Guild are set to expire in May and July of 2001, respectively, and
moves by the industry underscore fears about the resolution of
long-debated issues.
</P>
<P>
   Key issues include pay for work appearing on cable television
and in overseas markets; and how to compensate for work distributed
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Writers also are demanding studios abandon the practice of
giving directors credit by saying: ''a film by,'' which writers
feel diminish their contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation of a potential 2001 walkout, studios are
beginning to stockpile material by storing scripts and increasing
the number of movies being made.
</P>
<P>
   Networks also have pressured producers to speed up production
and are preparing to fill time slots with game shows, sports and
reality-based shows.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment lawyers and agents began advising clients to do as
much work as possible in the next months. Unions also told members
to increase saving money.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now is not the time to be buying the biggest house or the
nicest car you can possibly afford,'' WGA warned in its July
newsletter. ''If you have a TV staff writing job, begin putting
money away now. If you make a feature deal, bank every penny you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   In past years, such warnings would have been seen as what
normally occurs during difficult labor negotiations. But with a
current actors strike ongoing against advertisers over residuals
paid on commercials, fears are that talks will become lengthy and
take a much more adversarial tone than in past years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The storm feels like it's moving closer, not away from you,''
said Nina Jacobson, president of Walt Disney Co.'s movie group.
</P>
<P>
   WGA and SAG went on strike against studios in 1988. The WGA
strike lasted 22 weeks and the SAG strike three weeks, costing the
industry an estimated $500 million.

<HEADLINE> Report: Lee Wife Worked for CIA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Wen Ho Lee's wife worked for the CIA, a
revelation that could undermine the government's case against the
scientist accused of breaching security at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, the San Jose Mercury News reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unnamed congressional, intelligence and other sources,
the newspaper said Sylvia Lee supplied information about Chinese
scientists to a CIA officer when she was a secretary at Los Alamos
National Laboratory in the 1980s. She worked as liaison between the
lab and visiting delegations, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the newspaper said, Wen Ho Lee, who worked at the lab for
nearly 20 years, and his wife met with a CIA official before they
went to China in 1986, a trip federal prosecutors have called
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow told The Associated Press he had not
seen the article.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't discuss specifics of it because it is a matter
currently before the courts,'' Harlow said, ''but I can assure you
she didn't work for the CIA.''
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee's lawyer Mark Holscher has portrayed Lee and his wife
as loyal Americans who did undercover work for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the offices of Holscher and other Wen Ho Lee attorneys,
John Cline and Brian Sun, were not immediately returned Sunday. The
U.S. Attorney's office also could not be reached on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is jailed in New Mexico awaiting a November trial on charges
that he mishandled classified data. Although he has been
investigated for spying, he has not been charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   For a conviction, prosecutors must convince a jury that Lee took
data with the intent to harm the United States or aid another
country.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Lee has not been charged.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Contestant Stirs Talk  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- William Collins, who stirred up
controversy as a ''Big Brother'' contestant, proved as feisty
Sunday outside the confines of the CBS reality-TV show.
</P>
<P>
   In Collins' first news conference since he was voted off the
show Thursday, the Philadelphia youth counselor said he was
prepared for any threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe in my God and I believe in my gun,'' Collins told
the Television Critics Association, noting that he had a permit to
carry a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Collins riled his fellow contestants by playing pranks on them
and engaging in heated discussions on race. He created headlines
outside of the house because of his connection with the New Black
Panther Party for Self-Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the floppy orange hat he sported on ''Big Brother'' and
carrying a Bible, Collins dodged questions about his political
beliefs but spoke at length about his religious devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've seen me with my gun, but you haven't seen me with my
God,'' said Collins, apparently referring to a photo showing him
armed at a 1998 rally held in Texas to protest the dragging death
of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he believed his verbal confrontations with his
fellow housemates, which include whites, a black woman and an
Asian-American man, were valuable.
</P>
<P>
   He helped them reassess their ideas about blacks and to consider
the idea that minorities should be a respected part of the American
melting pot, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   He complained that ''Big Brother'' failed to show him as a
complete person, excluding shots of his devoted prayers while
making hay out of his conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Series executive producer Paul Romer defended the series'
editing, saying that 24 hours of footage had to be boiled down to
the most compelling 22 minutes for each episode.
</P>
<P>
   During a ''Big Brother'' interview Thursday, Collins said he had
been a member of the New Black Panther Party. The group is headed
by Khalid Abdul Muhammad, who was ousted by the Nation of Islam for
calling Jews ''bloodsuckers.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins refused to discuss his own political stance or his
relationship with Muhammad, saying ''I don't want the press to play
Don King between me and brother minister (Muhammad).''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ''Survivor'' castoffs and series producer Mark
Burnett also made an appearance Sunday before the TV critics group.
Both Collins and the ''Survivor'' group were shielded by security
guards while offstage.
</P>

   Asked about the bodyguards for Collins, network spokesman Chris

<HEADLINE> Mets Move On After Failed Deal  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Nothing personal.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets, trying to catch the Atlanta Braves in the NL
East, insisted Sunday that they won't be deterred by Barry Larkin's
rejection of a proposed trade that would have given them the
All-Star shortstop for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was never here,'' manager Bobby Valentine said shortly
before the Mets played the Braves at Turner Field. ''Nothing has
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury-plagued Mets, trailing Atlanta by five games before
Sunday's game, worked out a trade with Cincinnati for Larkin. But
the Reds captain, who becomes a free agent at the end of the
season, rejected the deal when New York balked at a three-year
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team here is going through many things,'' said All-Star
second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo, one of three New York infielders
who are injured. ''It would have been great to have a guy like
Larkin. But everything works out for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The player most affected by Larkin's decision was Melvin Mora,
who took over as the Mets shortstop when Rey Ordonez was lost for
the year with a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I can help at other positions,'' said Mora, who also
has started at second, third and the outfield this season. ''I'm a
big part of this team. It won't bother me if they bring in another
shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora said the only drawback to going through two days of
back-and-forth negotiations was the uneasiness in the clubhouse
over the Mets' end of the deal. General manager Steve Phillips
never disclosed the players New York agreed to give up, but it was
thought to be a package of minor league prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were saying, 'Oh, who's going to be traded? Who are the
guys who are going to leave?''' Mora said. ''We didn't know. Maybe
it was me who was going to Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Lenny Harris, who played with Larkin in
Cincinnati, said he hasn't had a chance to talk with his close
friend about his reasons for turning down the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll probably say, 'Hey, I was looking for security for my
wife and kids. I wanted to be a Met, but not a temporary Met,'''
Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo, who sat out the weekend series against the Braves with
a sore hip, doesn't expect the Mets to suffer a letdown after being
spurned by Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing for sure,'' Alfonzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the team figures to improve when Alfonzo and third
baseman Robin Ventura -- on the DL with a bruised rotator cuff --
return to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been a pretty good team so far,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the Mets were working on other deals, with
pitching considered a top priority as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''This door has closed, but sometimes that has a way of opening
up another door,'' he said. ''We're talking to some teams about
some pretty significant players.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he did everything he could to convince Larkin to
at least spend the rest of this season with the Mets. The GM
offered a 10-day window after the World Series in which he could
discuss a contract extension with Larkin or pay him a bonus for
agreeing to the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also wanted to take the extraordinary step of flying a
group of players, coaches, officials and Valentine to Cincinnati to
meet with Larkin. But the Reds player rejected that idea, saying he
''didn't need that sort of attention or recognition,'' Phillips
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pushed all the buttons we could push,'' the GM said. ''We
were not allowed to get close enough to exert any peer pressure.''

<HEADLINE> Don't say 'Yuck,' Hudson River swimming studied  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTLETON-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) - On hot summer days, teen-agers
here will amble past a No Trespassing sign, walk over the railroad
tracks and jump in the cloudy waters of the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The young swimmers swear the water is warm, refreshing and
reasonably clean. Just don't try telling that to Heidi Herholz, a
resident of this Albany-area river village who scoffs at the idea
of diving in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to catch a disease,'' she said, ''or come out
glowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the attitudes New York state faces as it considers
creating more public swimming spots along the Hudson River.
Although the river is getting cleaner, old opinions linger. Also,
the state is faced with finding swimming spots on a shoreline where
public access is limited by railroad tracks and private homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration has paid a consulting firm $88,000 to
study the feasibility of creating more public swimming spots,
focusing on the 140 miles between Manhattan and Troy. Environmental
groups and residents have been polled on potential spots. And two
public meetings are being held in the river valley this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the time is right,'' said state Environmental
Commissioner John Cahill. ''The water quality in the Hudson River
has improved dramatically over the past decade.''
</P>
<P>
   He ought to know. Cahill annually takes part in a three-mile
swim across the river north of New York City for charity. And his
agency, the state Department of Environmental Conservation, has
classified the river as swimmable from northern Columbia County to
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hudson is haunted by its past. Back in the '60's, the
river was infamous for running with raw sewage and factory wastes.
Marine life was choked out of some areas for lack of oxygen. There
was a joke back then about a drunk who fell off a boat into the
Hudson and had to be dusted off.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Clean Water Act of 1972 and later state
environmental programs are credited with reducing toxic discharges
and turning the tide.
</P>
<P>
   The river is still not the pure waterway Henry Hudson sailed up
in 1609. Upper river silt still contains traces of polychlorinated
biphenyls - or PCBs - and state health officials advise limiting
consumption of fish from the river.
</P>
<P>
   But the swimming is good, said Hudson River Sloop Clearwater
executive director Andy Mele, who has swum the Hudson over a
hundred times.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never heard of a single soul getting ill or getting a
festering cut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mele said he gets calls every summer asking if the water is
safe. He tells callers yes, but offers a caveat: Avoid swimming for
a few days after heavy rains to avoid sewage runoff from old
treatment plants. And he adds: ''I really wouldn't go out of my way
to swim in New York Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   The knottier question along the Hudson River is not whether if
you can swim, but where you can swim.
</P>
<P>
   Boaters can just dive from the sides of crafts. The kids in
Castleton make do with an old earthen pier. But public swimming
spots are rare. Croton Point in Westchester County and Kingston
Point in Ulster County are among the few.
</P>
<P>
   A big problem is that rail lines run near the Hudson's eastern
shore from New York City to the Albany area. There are stretches of
track on the river's western shore too. Beyond that, prime
riverside real estate is in private hands. Cahill said river access
plans in past decades didn't consider swimming because the water
was too dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Rockland County-based consultants Lawler, Matusky &AMP; Skelly
Engineers will conduct the two-year study to identify possible
sites for beach development. The firm will also address tactics for
water quality improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The study is part of the Hudson River Estuary Action Plan
released by Gov. George Pataki in 1996. Pataki, who grew up in
Peekskill near the river, has already overseen the creation of new
waterfront trails and new boat launches.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the popularity of boating on the river, Cahill said:
''Hopefully, in five to 10 years you'll say there's a lot of
swimming on the river as well.''

<HEADLINE> Police: Man shoots 2, leads cop on chase, then kills self  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKDALE, N.Y. (AP) - A man who may have been angry because he
believed his daughter was assaulted shot her alleged attacker and
another person Sunday, then led police on a highway chase that
ended with his suicide, Suffolk County police said.
</P>
<P>
   William Mosca, 43, of Sound Beach, forced his way into an
Oakdale home demanding to see one of its occupants, police said. He
fired 15 shots with a semiautomatic handgun, and hit two of the
four people inside, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were Daniel Dellapina, 16, and Gregory Malfer, 25,
who both lived in the house. Malfer allegedly attacked Mosca's
daughter, Mackenzie Mosca, several months ago, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives were investigating the possibility that Mosca was
seeking revenge for the alleged assault, police said. It was not
immediately known whether a complaint had been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Mosca fled the shooting scene by motorcycle, and was soon being
followed by four police cars, which chased him west on the Northern
State Parkway, police said. He allegedly turned around in an effort
to elude police, and pointed his gun at them without firing.
</P>
<P>
   Mosca lost control of his motorcycle around 11:20 a.m. while
trying to pull onto the highway's shoulder east of Route 231 in Dix
Hills, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers ordered him to drop the gun he was pointing at them,
but instead he shot himself in the head, they said. He was
pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Malfer and Dellapina were airlifted to the University Medical
Center at Stony Brook. Police did not know their condition.

<HEADLINE> Women's Open Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   GURNEE, Ill. (AP) -- Nancy Lopez's search for a U.S.
Women's Open
championship is far from over.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Women's Open is the only major to elude the 43-year-old LPGA
Hall of Famer. She's finished second four times, including 1997
when she became the only person to shoot four rounds in the 60s at
the Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   She barely made it to the weekend this year after missing her
last two Women's Open cuts, and finished tied for 46th at 14-over
302. But she didn't think her game was far off after shooting a
1-over 73 in Sunday's final round.
</P>
<P>
   ''This week I felt real good about my game, I was hitting the
ball very well,'' Lopez said. ''I putted just terribly the first
three days, and finally today I made putts -- a lot of them were for
pars, but at least I made them. If I just have an average of 30
putts every day I should be right in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez received a special exemption from the U.S. Golf
Association, sparing her from having to qualify for her 24th
Women's Open. But she said she would go through qualifying if she
had to next year.
</P>
<P>
   Anything not to miss a Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hoping I can win something before I have to qualify, if I
have to,'' Lopez said. ''I just have to keep working because I know
that I've got some wins in my bag still. I feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's best finish this year in eight LPGA tournaments was a
tie for ninth in The LPGA Office Depot, her first event of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   KING OF PAIN: Timing was the most painful part of Betsy King's
back injury.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time U.S. Women's Open champion was playing in the last
group Saturday and was just one stroke off the lead when she
strained a muscle in her lower back. Hurting on every swing and
barely able to continue, King shot a 10-over 82 and fell out of
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of scary,'' King said. ''One second I'm a shot out
and then one swing later It was more of a shock than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   King fared better Sunday, shooting a 79 to finish tied for 46th
at 14 over.
</P>
<P>
   She decided to play even though she knew there was no way she
could be competitive with her injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're playing against the world's best golfers, my swing
was like a 10-handicapper,'' King said. ''That's basically what I
was the last two days. It was tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, she played the last five holes in two under.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess it's like any 10-handicapper, eventually you hit a few
good shots,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   King received treatment for her back after Saturday's round, and
was given medicine by her dad, a retired doctor, that left her
feeling ''woozy'' during her round Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Though she joked that part of the incentive for playing was a
paycheck, her main motivation was the tournament itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be a shot out of the lead (Saturday) and then make nothing
of the week, I just couldn't stand that,'' King said. ''If it had
been a regular event I probably wouldn't have played, but because
it was the Open I just wanted to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   NATIONS COLLIDE: There was a welcome site for Karrie Webb when
she reached the 15th hole.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to a gallery that was squarely on the side of
American Meg Mallon for most of the day, suddenly Webb came upon a
family holding a large Australian flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to clam myself down. I got some tears in my eyes because
I felt like I was playing the Solheim Cup out there and I was on
the European team,'' Webb said. ''It was a great sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallon joked that she was trying to take advantage of the
gallery's tendency to root for Americans, saying that's why she
wore a white shirt with thin blue and red stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was wearing my stripes today. I was trying anything,''
Mallon said. ''It was a neat feeling. People were really cheering
me on.''
</P>
<P>
   SORENSTAM SETBACK: Two-time U.S. Women's Open champion Annika
Sorenstam was considered a favorite coming into this week, winning
her last two LPGA tournaments and four of her last six.
</P>
<P>
   She was never in the hunt after opening rounds of 73 and 75.
</P>
<P>
   ''A major is so much more than just playing well coming into the
tournament. I think I showed that,'' Sorenstam said. ''I played
really well coming into here and I'm not even on even on the
leaderboard. So it just shows what a major means.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam did pick up another top-10 finish, though, shooting a
final-round 70 to finish tied for ninth at 3-over 291.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked my caddie (Terry McNamara), I said, 'How do you play
this course?,''' Sorenstam said. ''He said, 'You're playing it the
right way. We just need some good breaks and to make some of the
crucial putts.' And that's the difference. I have not played bad
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   With her win, Webb tied Sorenstam for most victories on the LPGA
Tour this year with five.
</P>
<P>
   ALL IN THE FAMILY: The Wongluekiet twins have a knack for
major championships.
</P>
<P>
   Naree Wongluekiet, a 14-year-old who just finished eighth grade,
won low amateur honors at the U.S. Women's Open, finishing tied for
40th at 12-over 300. Her twin sister, Aree, was low amateur earlier
this year at the Nabisco Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels really nice to know my sister did it at Nabisco and
now me here,'' Naree said. ''My first goal was to make the cut and
after that my goal was to be low amateur.''
</P>
<P>
   Naree has an exemption for one more LPGA event this year, and
says she will take a lot from her Open experience with her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I learned a lot this week,'' she said. ''I learned that you
have to trust yourself and that when I get out here, I'm going to
have a caddie, so I have to trust the caddie.''
</P>
<P>
   DRAWING A CROWD: Sunday's final round of the U.S. Women's Open
drew a gallery of 25,409, the largest of the week. Including the
practice rounds and pro-am, the tournament drew 101,568.

<HEADLINE> Cop: Boat Survivor Admits Stabbing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, La. (AP) -- There was only one life jacket on board a
sinking shrimp boat, and authorities say the two men on board
fought over it.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor of last week's sinking in severe weather is now
charged with second-degree murder after he allegedly stabbed and
beat the boat's captain as they struggled for the lifejacket.
</P>
<P>
   When Alvin Latham was rescued, he told authorities that he and
the captain of the Bandit, Raymond Leiker, had prayed together
before the boat went down in the Gulf of Mexico during the night of
July 16-17.
</P>
<P>
   And when Leiker's foot got tangled in a net, Latham said, he
tried to save the man. When he couldn't, Latham said, he swam for
help. He was rescued by another fishing boat Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Leiker, 34, of Port Sulphur, was found Friday. An autopsy found
he had suffered stab wounds and blunt-force injuries to his head
and arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we found the body, there was no indication that anything
illegal had gone on out there,'' said Maj. John Marie.
</P>
<P>
   Police confronted Latham with the evidence Saturday and he
admitted inflicting the wounds, Marie said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Latham told them he stabbed Leiker as the two fought
for the sole life jacket, and a wave knocked Leiker and the jacket
overboard.
</P>
<P>
   When Leiker tried to climb back onto the boat, Latham said, he
hit him with a pipe. Leiker let go of the boat and the lifejacket
disappeared in the waves, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Latham, 46, of Venice, was to be arraigned Monday.

<HEADLINE> Rome's Colosseum Now a Concert Hall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Rome's 19-century-old Colosseum debuted as a concert
hall Sunday, its newly renovated stage serving as the starlit venue
for the premiere of a Sicilian composer's work dedicated to Mother
Theresa.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Francesco Rutelli was among a black-tie crowd of more than
300 at the first and only scheduled performance of Franco Mannino's
Missa Solemnis.
</P>
<P>
   The concert was the first on the ancient arena's reconstructed
stage. African instruments, including elephant tusks, blended
Sunday night with the classic elements of Rome's Teatro dell'Opera
orchestra and instruments from Asia, Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Missa aims to bring together the diverse cultures in one
long embrace,'' said Mannino, who conducted the opening movement
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Completed in A.D. 80, the Colosseum once seated 45,000
spectators, who watched gladiators doing battle -- and, according to
tradition, lions consuming Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Falling into disuse in the fifth century with the decline of the
Roman Empire, it has remained one of Rome's best-known landmarks.
The Colosseum reopened for public entertainment earlier this month
with a performance of the classical Greek tragedy Oedipus Rex.

<P>
   COHASSET, Mass. (AP) -- John Coert Campbell, a former member of
the State Department's policy planning council and expert author on
Middle Eastern and Eastern European affairs, died July 16. He was
88.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was a consultant and adviser to the State Department
from 1963 to 1980 and a member of its policy planning council in
1967 during the Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   He also served on an advisory panel for the State Department's
Bureau of Near East and South Asian Affairs during the 1960s. He
was a State Department specialist in Eastern Europe from 1942 to
1946 and officer in charge of Balkan affairs and a member of the
policy planning staff from 1949 to 1955.
</P>
<P>
   As a staff member of the New York-based Council on Foreign
Relations for 27 years, he provided analyses of world affairs.
Johannes Dyba:
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Archbishop Johannes Dyba, considered one of
Germany's most conservative clergymen for his outspoken views
against abortion and domestic partnerships, died Saturday of heart
failure. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Dyba, who was archbishop of the Fulda diocese in central Germany
and the Roman Catholic bishop for the military, polarized Germans
and caused controversy within the church with his often pointed
comments on questions of morality.
</P>
<P>
   He was ordained in 1959 in Cologne and after a short time
serving in churches went to study in Rome. He served the Vatican in
diplomatic posts in Buenos Aires, Argentina; The Hague,
Netherlands; Kinshasa, Congo, and Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1983, he was named the head of the Fulda diocese,
and in 1990 also became the Catholic military bishop, visiting
German troops on missions in Yugoslavia and elsewhere.
Cenk Koray:
</P>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Cenk Koray, a Turkish television host and
journalist, died Sunday of a heart attack, news reports said. He
was 56.
</P>
<P>
   Koray amused Turkish TV audiences during much of the 1970s and
1980s with his wit and humor as host of entertainment and game
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Koray trained as a lawyer but chose journalism as a career
instead. His lucky break came when he was asked to stand in for
another popular TV presenter who was on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, Koray had been writing a column for the
daily newspaper Aksam and was the spokesman for his favorite soccer
team, Istanbul's Besiktas, until last season.

<HEADLINE> Johnson, Greene Both Pull Up Lame  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- In the most anticipated showdown in
track and field in three years, Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene
both pulled up lame in the final of the 200 meters at the U.S.
Olympic trials Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The hugely hyped meeting was held twice because both were in the
same semifinal heat, then came back less than two hours later in
the final.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the race, Johnson was nursing a tender right
quadriceps, but it was his left quadriceps that forced him to quit
about 80 meters into the race.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident that when Johnson came out of the blocks, he
wasn't healthy. He started much slower than usual, began slowing
even more at 50 meters, then struggled another 20 to 30 meters
before crumpling to the track.
</P>
<P>
   He was removed from the track on a cart.
</P>
<P>
   Greene began limping with about 100 meters left, grabbed for the
back of his left leg, started to slow further and stopped shortly
after.
</P>
<P>
   He then walked toward the finish line, and had his left
hamstring wrapped in ice.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries to Johnson and Greene means neither will run the
200 at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, however, has qualified for the 400 and will run the
1,600 relay, if he recovers.
</P>
<P>
   Greene will be in the 100 and 400 relay, also if he is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The race, the final event at the trials, proved anticlimactic
after a huge buildup, which included as much trash-talking as has
ever been seen in a track and field event.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the final was 1999 NCAA champion John Capel of
Florida in 19.85 seconds, with Floyd Heard second in 19.88 and Coby
Miller third in 19.96.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know what had happened until I looked up at the
screen and saw Michael lying on the ground,'' Capel said. ''I hope
he's all right for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a terrible way to lose.''

Shanele Stires' two 3-pointers. Katie Smith's only field goal, a
3-pointer with 9:45 left, gave the Lynx a 55-43 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Portland did not get closer than four points the rest of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Brumfield shot 5-for-5 from the field and 4-for-4 from the foul
line. Smith, Minnesota's leading scorer, was 1-for-11 from the
field.

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Water Leaks in Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A small amount of radioactive water was found to
have leaked at a nuclear power plant in northeastern Japan after
officials shut down one of its reactors because of an oil leak, the
plant's operator said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There was no danger, however, of any radiation escaping outside
the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant in Okuma, said Yoshimi
Hitosugi, spokesman of Tokyo Electric Power Co.
</P>
<P>
   Okuma, a town located on the Pacific Coast in Fukushima
prefecture (state), is 150 miles northeast of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Hitosugi said plant officials found about 39 gallons of
radioactive water that had leaked near the No. 2 reactor at around
10:20 p.m. Sunday, about an hour after the No. 2 reactor was
manually shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had noticed an alarm indicating the lowering of oil
levels inside the tank in the turbine facility, Hitosugi said. The
oil leak was stopped after officials closed the valve supplying oil
to control the turbine, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Plant officials were still investigating the cause of the
leakage of oil and radioactive water, Hitosugi said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the No. 6 reactor at the Fukushima nuclear plant was
shut down after a leak of waste gas was detected in a tank where
steam used to power the turbines was turned back into water.
</P>
<P>
   No leak of radioactive material was reported at the No. 6
reactor, which was shut down as a cautionary measure after a 6.1
magnitude earthquake struck in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of
eastern Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The plant has six reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has an extensive nuclear power program, as the
resource-poor nation depends on nuclear energy for a third of its
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Public faith was shaken, however, by the nation's worst nuclear
accident on Sept. 30 last year at a fuel-processing plant in
Tokaimura, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo, that took the lives of two
workers and seriously injured a third.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people are believed to have been exposed to less
harmful radiation in the accident, which set off an uncontrolled
atomic reaction.

<HEADLINE> Clark Family Sweeps into Olympics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Team Clark will be heading to the
Sydney Games. Barely.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest member of the talented 800-meter family, Hazel
Clark, took first place and her sister-in-law and sister followed
Sunday at the U.S. Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Clark finished first in 1 minute, 58.97 seconds and
sister-in-law Jearl Miles-Clark was timed in 1:59.12.
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic finish came from Hazel's older sister,
Joetta. Coming from the back of the pack in the final lap, Joetta
caught and just edged Meredith Rainey-Valmon for third.
</P>
<P>
   A desperate lunge and a lean at the finish bought Joetta a trip
to Sydney. She finished in 1:59.49, while Rainey-Valmon had a time
of 1:59.50.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't get started the way I wanted, but I stayed
confident,'' Joetta said. ''But I saw my chances going and I had
worked too hard not to get there. I ran that last 100 like my life
depended on it. I kept digging.''
</P>
<P>
   After the race, Jearl collapsed and was helped off the track.
The family, which includes brother J.J. Clark and father Joe Clark,
gathered together to celebrate just off the track following the
dramatic race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kept saying it's not that hot, we live in Florida,'' Jearl
said. ''I didn't stay hydrated and toward the end of the race my
legs were shot, depleted. I feel a lot better now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the bell lap, Hazel still held a slight lead over
Rainey-Valmon and Miles-Clark as the group began putting distance
on the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Down the stretch, Hazel Clark held off Miles-Clark, who finished
fast for second.
</P>
<P>
   It was left to the elder Clark to complete the day. She did,
running from the extreme rear through 500 meters and just passing
Rainey-Valmon in a photo finish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of felt I outleaned her,'' Joetta said. ''I wasn't sure
if I had got her. Then I saw it on the scoreboard and knew we did
it. Now I look forward to making history with my family.''
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Clark, brother of Hazel and Joetta, and Jearl's husband,
coaches all three runners.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Clark, the family patriarch, was also a spectator. He was
the principal of Eastside High School in Paterson, N.J., a strict
disciplinarian who had his life portrayed in a 1989 movie, ''Lean
On Me,'' starring Morgan Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   It's been quite a career for Joetta, 37, who has spent the past
21 years ranked among the top 10 800 runners. This was her sixth
and final Olympic trials. She will retire after her fourth Olympic
appearance, the same number as Jearl.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been hard if I didn't make it,'' Joetta said.
''It was something the family really wanted to do. I would have let
them down, but I did my best. This is my last race in this country,
it was a great final race.''
</P>
<P>
   Jearl, 33, established an American record last year with a
1:56.40 and was an Olympic gold medalist in the 1,600 relay in
1996. She qualified second in this year's trials in the 400.
</P>
<P>
   Hazel, 22, is the baby of the group, a four-time NCAA champion
(three indoor titles) who competed at her first trials and will
make her Olympic debut.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted this real bad, I said a prayer for all of us before
the race,'' Hazel said. ''But I felt they would come through. I'm
young, I was really scared.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   It's never easy to replace a legend, as the Miami
Dolphins are
discovering in their search for a starting quarterback.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The team finished its 52-play controlled scrimmage Sunday at
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., much like it started the day -- unsure who
will take over for Dan Marino, the future Hall of Famer who retired
in March.
</P>
<P>
   The two quarterbacks vying for the No. 1 job, Damon Huard and
Jay Fiedler, split time Sunday with similar results. Each threw a
touchdown pass and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   Huard was 7-for-10 for 50 yards, including a 34-yard scoring
toss to Robert Baker on a post pattern. Fiedler moved the team more
effectively early on, going 5-for-8 for 63 yards, including a
29-yard touchdown strike to Lamar Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The quarterbacks threw two interceptions and we can't survive
doing that,'' coach Dave Wannstedt said.
</P>
<P>
   Huard gave himself a C-minus grade. Working against Miami's
first-string defense, he threw an interception on his first attempt
</P>
<P>
   Neither quarterback gained an edge in their competition, said
offensive coordinator Chan Gailey, the former Dallas Cowboys head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   They ''probably did some good and some bad things,'' Gailey
said. ''That's the best way to (assess) it without seeing game
film.''
Panthers:
</P>
<P>
   Reggie White, the NFL's career sacks leader, signed a contract
with Carolina on Sunday after arriving at the team's training camp
at Spartanburg, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   White, 38, who passed a physical in Charlotte on Friday, was to
work with strength and conditioning coach Jerry Simmons on Monday,
rather than participating in the regular team practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to having Reggie White on our football team,''
coach George Seifert said. ''He brings a special talent and special
mindset that we believe will help in our development as a team.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert has said he hopes White will be ready to play by the
third preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers offered White a five-year contract worth about $20
million -- although White said he may only play one year -- with
several performance incentives based on Carolina's defensive
improvement.
Seahawks:
</P>
<P>
   Sean Dawkins, released last month because of salary-cap
restraints, has agreed to rejoin Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have agreed to things,'' coach and general manager Mike
Holmgren said Sunday. ''I expect him in the next day or two. ...
I'm glad Sean decided to come on back. He makes this a better
football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the signing were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Dawkins caught 58 passes for 992 yards last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have only first-round draft choice Chris McIntosh,
an offensive lineman from Wisconsin, still unsigned.
Vikings:
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hovan, the Minnesota Vikings' first-round draft pick, was
the only player who didn't show up for the start of training camp
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hovan's agents spent the day meeting with team officials, but a
deal couldn't be reached in time, coach Dennis Green said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been in the NFL for a long period of time. Each
individual guy has to get what he considers a fair deal,'' Green
said. ''We're negotiating. We think we know what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovan, an All-America from Boston College who can play nose
tackle, defensive end and defensive tackle, will be expected to
contribute immediately to the Vikings' revamped defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 305-pound Hovan will help fill the void created by
the departures of Duane Clemons, Jerry Ball and Chris Doleman, who
combined for 19 sacks in 1999. Clemons signed with Kansas City, and
Ball and Doleman retired.
Redskins:
</P>
<P>
   Amid mouthfuls of ''scornbread'' and ''drop-the-ball baked
beans,'' the former home of the Redskins' training camp, Frostburg
State University, held its annual picnic for a team that wasn't
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins recently broke a 10-year contract with the
university by moving their preseason training camp after only five
years. The team became the first in NFL history to charge admission
to preseason practices at the new camp in Ashburn, Va.	   In Frostburg, Md.,
about 130 people showed up Saturday for this
year's Jack-Kent-Cooke-Out, named for the late Redskins owner,
which featured a tongue-in-cheek menu: ''scornbread and butter,''
''Fan-friendly Fruit Salad (No sour grapes),'' and ''Iced Tea (Not
bitter. Really, it's not.)''
</P>
<P>
   A state study last year estimated that the Redskins brought $2.9
million to the town.
Buccaneers:
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson was among the first players arriving when Tampa
Bay reported to training camp Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's pretty much the way I go about doing things,'' said the
two-time Pro Bowl wide receiver, who was obtained in an offseason
trade with the New York Jets. ''I'm just here to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers on Sunday agreed to terms on four-year contract
with guard Cosey Coleman, the team's second-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Coleman, Tampa Bay released long snapper Mitch
Palmer. The Bucs also signed tight end Patrick Hape to a $385,000,
one-year contract.
Bears:
</P>
<P>
   Second-round draft pick Mike Brown ended his holdout Sunday,
signing a four-year deal. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the 39th overall pick in April's NFL draft, left Nebraska
as the second-leading tackler in school history and had nine career
interceptions.
Saints:
</P>
<P>
   Guard Chris Naeole sprained a ligament in his left knee in a
hard fall late in the ''Black &AMP; Gold Scrimmage'' on Saturday, and
was helped off the field. Tests Sunday indicated the ligament was
not torn.
</P>
<P>
   There is no word on how long he will be out of practice. Naeole
injured the same knee during his rookie season.

<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Ben Crane became the 12th Monday qualifier
to win a Buy.com Tour event, closing with a 5-under-par 67 on
Sunday for a three-stroke victory in the Wichita Open.
</P>
<P>
   Crane, who earned $72,000, had a 25-under 263 total on the
Willowbend Golf Club course to break the tournament record of 265
set by Emlyn Aubrey in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The former University of Oregon player's 25-under total is the
second lowest in tour history, one shy of the mark set by Chris
Smith in the 1997 Omaha Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still a little numb. What an amazing week,'' said Crane,
who earned a full exemption for the rest of this year along with
the 2001 campaign if he does not advance to the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so thankful I can take Mondays off because they are so
tough. That's all I wanted, a place to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Grunewald and Vance Veazey closed with 65s to tie for
second at 266, and Richard Johnson (68) and Pat Perez (69) followed
at 267.

<HEADLINE> Marion Jones Goes On to Sydney  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The exhausting preliminaries are over.
It's on to Sydney and a quest for five Olympic gold medals for
Marion Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a relief,'' Jones said. ''As everybody knows, coming to
the U.S. trials and getting through in all three events, and
winning all three events, is tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the best word I can use to describe it is 'I'm glad
it's all over' and that's more than one word. But now I can go home
and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones added the 200-meter title Sunday to her triumphs in the
long jump and 100. Her goal is to win those three events in Sydney,
and add gold medals in the 400- and 1,600-meter relays.
</P>
<P>
   She won the 200 Sunday in a tight race with longtime rival and
defending world champion Inger Miller. Miller was gaining on Jones
with about 80 meters to go but couldn't close close any ground in
the last 40 meters. Jones' winning time of 21.94 seconds was the
fastest in the world this year. Miller was second in 22.09.
</P>
<P>
   Jones expects to get faster.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only my third 200 of the year,'' she said. ''To come out
here and run pretty good -- it's been a long week and I'm glad I
could come out of here with a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was a runaway winner in the 200 semifinals at 22.08.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think so much emotion went into the semis that it felt like
a finals to me,'' she said. ''When I was finished with the semis, I
was pooped. To have to regroup and refocus in an hour and half and
come back and run in the finals was a little difficult. Perhaps it
was the heat and whatever else, but I'm just glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who won the 200 at last year's world championships after
Jones went out with back spasms in the semifinals, feels she, too,
can do better.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good race,'' Miller said. ''I have a lot of work to
do between now and Sydney. That was not anywhere near perfect, but
it was a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   All the sprint drama and hype at the U.S. Olympic track and
field trials was on the men's side. Among the women, Jones was a
portrait of grace, constantly smiling, her good-natured unassuming
personality masking an all-consuming self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if her performance at the trials boosted her confidence,
she just smiled again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it can be bolstered any more than it is,'' Jones
said. ''The goal was to come here and primarily qualify in all
three events. Without a doubt, I've always said it's not going to
be easy in Sydney. I'd be the first to tell you it's going to be
quite difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the fact that I can come here and get through all three of
these and all sorts of different things is motivating for me. I'm
glad I've gotten through it.''

Johnson, Greene Both Pull Up Lame

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- In the most anticipated showdown in track and
field in three years, Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene both pulled up lame in
the final of the 200 meters at the U.S. Olympic trials today. The hugely hyped
meeting was held twice because both were in the same semifinal heat, then came
back less than two hours later in the final. Going into the race, Johnson was
nursing a tender right quadriceps, but it was his left quadriceps that forced
him to quit about 80 meters into the race. It was evident that when Johnson came
out of the blocks, he wasn't healthy.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Hits Islands Off Tokyo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook a string of volcanic
islands off Tokyo on Monday, the Meteorological Agency said. There
were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Meteorological Agency said the magnitude 5.5 earthquake hit
the Izu islands chain at 6:52 a.m. and was centered at a shallow
point beneath the seabed near the islands of Niijima and Kozushima.
</P>
<P>
   Takashi Makino, a municipal official on Niijima, home to around
600 people, said there were no immediate reports of damage or
injuries, but officials were checking roads and other sparsely
populated islands.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was most strongly felt on Niijima, about 105 miles,
south of Tokyo. Kozushima, with a population of around 2,300, is
located about 12 miles south of Niijima.
</P>
<P>
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause damage to homes if it occurs in
a residential area.
</P>
<P>
   The Meteorological Agency said there might be a ''slight''
change in sea levels from the quake, but no damage was expected.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a quake of magnitude 5.0 jolted Niijima and
neighboring small islands but no damage or injuries were reported.
On July 1, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake killed a man on Kozushima.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's quake was among thousands that have hit the small
islands in recent weeks. A total of 1,129 were registered on Sunday
alone, with about 20 percent of them strong enough to be felt. As
of 9 a.m. Monday, 491 tremors were registered, with 148 them strong
enough to be felt, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

<HEADLINE> NY Expands West Nile Virus Spraying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The discovery of two more dead birds infected
with the West Nile virus prompted New York City on Sunday to expand
its battle against disease-carrying mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the city still has had no reports of
humans afflicted with the sometimes-deadly ailment. Seven people
died and more than 60 were made ill by an outbreak of the virus a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said spraying efforts will be expanded into areas of
Queens and Brooklyn in attempt to kill mosquitoes that might be
carrying the virus. The city is going ahead with further efforts in
Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should not be alarmed, should not be concerned. These
are all things that we assumed we would have to do,'' Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   New York health officials have now found seven birds infected
with West Nile.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Fires Uncover Native Dwellings  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo. (AP) -- More than a hundred years
after cowboys first discovered the native American dwellings in the
cliffs of Mesa Verde National Park, a wildfire raging through the
area is uncovering more sites and giving archaeologists a better
understanding of the people who used to live here.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen previously unknown sites have been found as the
latest wildfire stripped away concealing vegetation. The blaze
doubled in size in 24 hours and had charred 17,000 acres by Sunday
evening. It was only 10 percent contained.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bit of a trade off,'' said Jane Anderson, a National
Park Service archaeologists and project manager of Save America's
Treasures, a $3 million, two-year federal and private effort to
study the cliff dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's exciting to see the new ruins and get that information,
but at the same time, fire can destroy these sites,'' she said.
''Sandstone explodes when it's heated.''
</P>
<P>
   No major structural damage had been reported Sunday, but the
fire had moved to within 3 miles of the ruins known as Cliff
Palace, the park's major attraction, and was burning in Morefield
Canyon where there are hundreds of known sites.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen archaeologists were accompanying firefighters to help
identify new sites and protect them if possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Mesa Verde fire also was threatening a park campground and
had spread into a remote area of the nearby Ute Mountain Ute
reservation. The national park was closed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   A second fire broke out about 25 miles to the northwest outside
the park and quickly spread to 600 acres, forcing the evacuation of
15 homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're running short on resources,'' said Deb Koening,
spokeswoman at an interagency fire dispatch center in Durango.
Firefighters were pulled from the Mesa Verde fire to fight the
second blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfires also burned in Southern California -- including a
5,000-acre fire in a remote canyon in Death Valley National Park --
and blackened 70,000 acres in eastern Oregon. The Oregon fire was
considered ''essentially out,'' officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Verde is the nation's largest archaeological preserve with
more than 4,000 identified sites, nearly 400 of which were
discovered after a 1996 fire.
</P>
<P>
   Park archaeologists have mapped those sites and are studying how
they relate to the cliff dwellings and other structures built when
the ancestors of Pueblo Indians popularly known as the Anasazi
lived in the area between 550 and 1300 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   ''As more sites are added, it becomes clearer as to what
happened,'' said Larry Nordby, an archaeologist at the park. ''It
allows us to get a snapshot at what the landscape looked like and
we hope to expand that over the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the 600 cliff dwellings in the park were built within a
100-year period after 1200 A.D., Nordby said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four American Indian tribes, living mainly in New Mexico
and Arizona, claim to be descendants of the people who abandoned
the area around 1300 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   For years, scientists believed the 150-room Cliff Palace had
been home to hundreds of people. But a closer look over the last
few years has revealed that it served as ''transitional housing''
for only about 25 families, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 25 rooms have hearths for cooking and heating while
the rest served as storage or ceremonial areas, Nordby said.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists aren't sure why, although one theory holds that
Cliff Palace was used for craft fairs where people from throughout
the area could trade and share ideas in basket weaving, pottery and
hunting, Nordby said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the reason we didn't know what this site was used for
is that it was excavated in the early 1900s,'' Nordby said. ''They
didn't look at things as systematically as we're doing. In
addition, there is always room for interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists also are not sure why the area was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mapping rooms and rethinking how those rooms may have been
used helps us best determine the daily routines of the ancestral
Puebloans and their community structure,'' Nordby said. ''It may
also help us further understand some of the mysteries of Mesa
Verde.''

<HEADLINE> Larkin Rejects Mets, Signs New Deal  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Barry Larkin is staying in Cincinnati -- for
the rest of this season and the next three as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after he rejected a trade to the Mets, the All-Star
shortstop agreed Sunday to a three-year, $27 million contract
extension that will keep him with his hometown Reds through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in a suit and tie at the Reds' offices five hours
after a 5-3 victory over Arizona, Larkin admitted he was stunned
when owner Carl Lindner decided to give him almost exactly what he
had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Reds general manager Jim Bowden, who arranged a trade with the
Mets, sought out Larkin after the game and told him that Lindner
wanted to talk about his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has all really come as a shock to me,'' Larkin said.
''Today I fielded questions about possibly being a Met. Now Mr.
Lindner and the organization have stepped up and signed me for
three more years as a Red.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets general manager Steve Phillips had the same reaction to the
Reds' stunning about-face.
</P>
<P>
   ''Astonishment,'' Phillips said, ''only because Jim Bowden told
me they were not going to sign him. ... I guess we helped Barry
Larkin get a contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Only five days earlier, the Reds told Larkin they wouldn't meet
his request for a three-year, $27.9 million extension. Since Larkin
could be a free agent, Bowden worked out a trade with the Mets for
three players.
</P>
<P>
   It required Larkin's approval. He wouldn't give it because the
Mets weren't offering a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to stay drew a 30-second standing ovation from
34,822 fans on Sunday. It also became a prelude to the club's
strangest day since Lindner took control of the team from Marge
Schott last September.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds wound up giving Larkin only $900,000 less than he
requested. A little less than one-third of the $27 million will be
deferred over 15 years, according to a source familiar with the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, who makes $5.3 million this season, will get $6 million
next year. When Bowden called him aside after the game, he thought
he'd been traded to a different team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought OK, if not New York, then where?'' Larkin said. ''I
thought I was going to be talking to Jim about going to another big
market club that needed a shortstop. This all happened very fast.
I'm very appreciative of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips wished the Reds would have called and told him about
the extension, which he learned about secondhand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's appropriate he finishes his career in
Cincinnati,'' Phillips said. ''It's good for him and his family. I
understand that part. But if he wanted out, we were interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., who blocked a trade to the Mets last December,
had offered to defer even more of his $116.5 million deal to help
keep Larkin in Cincinnati. Chief operating officer John Allen said
the club didn't take him up on the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds will have to raise ticket prices -- maybe this season --
to cover the contract, Allen said. The Reds will depend upon ticket
revenues until they move into a new stadium in 2003, the final year
of Larkin's new deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I announce that right now: There's going to be a ticket price
increase and possibly before the end of this season,'' Allen said.
''We're going to review that over the next few days and we may do
something that nobody else has ever done and raise ticket prices
during a season. We've got to generate the revenues to pay for
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who had lobbied for the Reds to keep Larkin, showed up
for the news conference and gave him a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really excited,'' Griffey said. ''This is one of the
reasons I came over here, to play with this guy. Since spring
training, it's been great. Now I get to do it for the next three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' surprising offer ended a day of ovations, acrimony and
disappointment for the 36-year-old Larkin, who has played all 15 of
his major league seasons with his hometown team and wanted to
finish his career in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative trade with the Mets led to bruised feelings
between Larkin and the front office. Larkin suggested the Mets were
misled.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin said that Bowden failed to tell the Mets in advance about
his conditions for approving the trade. Larkin wanted a multiyear
extension, but the Mets were only interested in him as a stopgap
for with shortstop Rey Ordonez sidelined by a broken arm this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin would have liked New York -- he named his oldest daughter
Brielle D'Shea, after the Mets' stadium -- but made it clear he
wouldn't go there for only a half-season.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the parties knew that -- at least, that's what we told
Jim,'' Larkin said. ''But he obviously didn't relay that to the
Mets. I guess they didn't realize what was going on with this
entire thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips confirmed that the Mets agreed to talk to Larkin on the
assumption he would accept a trade for this season only.
</P>
<P>
   ''I called Jim (on Friday) and said, 'Where is Barry on this?'''
Phillips said. ''Jim told me, 'Oh, don't worry, he'll accept the
deal.' Jim said he might be talking a little bit, but he was
convinced he would want to get out of the negativity in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems there was a misunderstanding. From my discussions
with Eric and Jim, they were not on the same page with what was
going to happen with his contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he didn't tell the Mets about Larkin's contract
conditions because he didn't learn about them until Thursday, after
New York agreed to the tentative deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's correct because we were not told until after the deal
was consummated,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets weren't interested in offering a long-term deal because
it would limit their options in the offseason. Ordonez has three
years left on a $19 million contract he signed in January, and
Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez might be a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be an appealing free-agent class out there and
we didn't want to make all the decisions today, not knowing what
the future is going to be like,'' Phillips said.

<HEADLINE> Plaques For New BB Hall Members  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Inscriptions on the plaques of the Hall of Fame
members
enshrined Sunday at Cooperstown, N.Y.:
George Lee Anderson:
''Sparky'':
Cincinnati NL, 1970-1978:
Detroit AL, 1979-1995:
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the game's most successful and colorful managers, his
2,194 wins rank third in history behind Connie Mack and John
McGraw. The crank that turned the Big Red Machine, his skillful
leadership helped those Cincinnati teams dominate in the 1970s.
Revered and treasured by his players for his humility, humanity,
eternal optimism and knowledge of the game. Baseball's only manager
to win a World Series in both leagues and lead two franchises in
victories. His teams won three World Series, seven division titles
and five pennants compiling a .619 post-season winning percentage.
Carlton Ernest Fisk:
''Pudge'':
Boston AL, 1969, 1971-80:
Chicago AL, 1981-93:
</P>
<P>
   A commanding figure behind the plate for a record 24 seasons. He
caught more games (2,229) and hit more home runs (351) than any
catcher before him. His gritty resolve and competitive fire earned
him the respect of teammates and opposing players alike. A staunch
training regimen extended his durability and enhanced his
productivity -- as evidenced by a record 72 home runs after age 40.
His dramatic home run to win game six of the 1975 World Series is
one of baseball's unforgettable moments. Was the 1972 American
League Rookie of the Year and an 11-time all star.
Norman Thomas Stearnes:
''Turkey'':
Negro Leagues 1923-1941:
</P>
<P>
   One of the Negro Leagues' most feared hitters. He hit better
than .300 in 14 of 19 seasons. Collected six home run titles and
led the league in triples four times. A graceful center fielder as
well. He played in four East-West All Star games. Played 11 seasons
for the Detroit Stars. Also excelling with the New York Lincoln
Giants, Kansas City Monarchs, Chicago American Giants and
Philadelphia Stars.
John Alexander McPhee:
''Bid'':
Cincinnati AA, 1882-1889:
Cincinnati NL, 1890-1899:
</P>
<P>
   One of the 19th century's premier second basemen, he was a
standout fielder despite playing barehanded for most of his 18-year
career. The last second baseman to play without a glove, he
regularly led the league in double plays, fielding average, assists
and putouts. Playing with a glove for the first time in 1896, his
fielding average was .982, a mark that stood for 29 years. A
skilled leadoff hitter, he complied 2,250 hits and topped the
100-run mark 10 times, including a career best 139 in 1886. Known
for his sober disposition and exemplary sportsmanship.
Atanasio Perez Rigal: ''Tony'':
Cincinnati NL, 1964-1976, 1984-1986:
Montreal NL, 1977-1979:
Boston AL, 1980-1982:
Philadelphia NL, 1983:
</P>
<P>
   A clutch performer throughout an illustrious 23-year career. He
tormented the opposition with his ability to consistently drive in
runs. His composure under pressure led to 379 home runs, 505
doubles and 1,652 RBI, including seven 100+ RBI seasons and 954 RBI
in the 1970s. A catalyst of Cincinnati's talented Big Red Machine
teams during the 1970s. His subtle leadership and timely hitting
helped pace those clubs to five division titles, four pennants and
two World Series championships.

<HEADLINE> Reds Dominate BB Hall Inductions  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- And this one belongs to the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Red Machine's presence in Cooperstown got a lot bigger
on Sunday when Tony Perez and Sparky Anderson were inducted into
the Baseball Hall of Fame alongside World Series nemesis Carlton
Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seem to be a lot of guys up here that I played against
in '75,'' said Fisk, who hit a game-winning homer in the 12th
inning of Game 6 only to see Perez homer in Game 7 to deliver the
Series to the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ''As happy as I was in the sixth game, I was happy for him
(Perez) in the seventh game,'' Fisk said after the ceremony. ''But
I don't think I was too happy back in 1975.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds announcer Marty Brennaman was enshrined in the
broadcaster's wing on Sunday, commemorating a 26-year career in
which he celebrated Cincinnati victories by proclaiming, ''And this
one belongs to the Reds.''
</P>
<P>
   And during the Reds' consecutive World Series titles in 1975-76,
he said it an awful lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got good players, stayed out of their way, let them win a
lot and then just hung around for 26 years,'' said Anderson, the
only manager to win it all in both leagues. ''I was smart enough to
know the people that were doing the work, and I could never thank
them (enough) for what they did for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez and Anderson join Cincinnati teammates Joe Morgan and
Johnny Bench in the Hall. All-time hit king Pete Rose is
ineligible, having been banned from baseball for gambling; that
explains why commissioner Bud Selig was greeted with boos and
chants of ''We want Pete!''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, Anderson and Brennaman all said they thought Rose
deserved to be in the Hall. But Anderson also defended Selig.
</P>
<P>
   ''Commissioners make mistakes -- they're human beings,'' the
66-year-old manager said. ''But nobody loves the game of baseball
more than this commissioner.''
</P>
<P>
   Also honored Sunday were ''Gloveless Wonder'' Bid McPhee, a 19th
century second baseman for Cincinnati who was the last player to
play without a glove, and Negro League star Norm ''Turkey''
Stearnes.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-time All-Star, Fisk caught more games -- 2,229 -- than
anyone in baseball history, and hit a record 351 of his 376 homers
as a catcher. He was elected in his second year of eligibility with
79.56 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''His gritty resolve and competitive fire earned him the respect
of teammates and opposing players alike,'' his plaque reads. ''His
dramatic home run to win Game 6 of the 1975 World Series is one of
baseball's unforgettable moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also won a championship in 1984 with the Detroit Tigers
and 2,194 games in all -- third most in history behind Connie Mack
and John McGraw. His .691 postseason winning percentage (34-21) is
the best ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crank that turned the Big Red Machine, his skillful
leadership helped those Cincinnati teams dominate in the 1970s,''
his plaque says. ''(He was) revered and treasured by his players
for his humility, humanity, eternal optimism and knowledge of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez drove in at least 90 runs in 11 consecutive seasons from
1967-77. He finished with 1,652 RBIs, which ranks 18th, hit 379
homers and batted .279 while also playing for Boston, Philadelphia
and Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ''He tormented the opposition with his ability to consistently
drive in runs,'' says his plaque. ''A catalyst of Cincinnati's
talented Big Red Machine teams during the 1970s, his subtle
leadership and timely hitting helped pace those clubs to five
division titles, four pennants and two World Series
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez fell short of election eight times before making it this
winter with 77.15 percent of the vote. Going in with Anderson made
the wait worthwhile, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they made me wait so long so that we could be inducted
together,'' said Perez, a native Cuban who gave part of his speech
in Spanish and even threw in a ''merci beaucoup'' as a nod to his
playing days in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I doubt that a king on his coronation feels better than me
today.''

<HEADLINE> Devers Sets American Hurdles Record  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gail Devers has some unfinished
Olympic business.
</P>
<P>
   She owns two gold medals, but neither are in the event that is
her best. She won the 100 meters in Barcelona and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Her victory in the 100-meter hurdles at the U.S. Olympic track
and field trials Sunday, in an American record 12.33 seconds, made
her the fourth-fastest ever in the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be honest, coming in, I knew the 100 hurdles was my last
chance to be on the team,'' Devers said. ''My goal was to break the
American record on American soil. Every time I've broken it, I've
been in Europe somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Her time was four-hundredths of a second faster than the
American record she set last year at the world championships in
Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fans here were great,'' she said of the capacity crowd of
24,000. ''They helped me get my head in the hurdles.''
</P>
<P>
   Devers overcame a rare thyroid disease for a fabulous career.
She's won the 100 hurdles three times at the world championships.
In 1992 in Barcelona, she was leading in the hurdle finals but fell
over the last hurdle and finished fifth. Devers was fourth in the
100 hurdles four years ago at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   She said she got off to a good start in Sunday's finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no clue about the middle,'' she said, ''and at the end
I hit a hurdle, but I wasn't going down. I'm very pleased with the
time -- 33 years old and running 12.33.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 5, Giants 0  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Darren Dreifort pitched seven shutout
innings, and Shawn Green homered twice Sunday night as the Los
Angeles Dodgers beat the San Francisco Giants 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   By winning for the sixth time in eight games, the Dodgers moved
within four games of first-place Arizona in the NL West. The
Diamondbacks lost at Cincinnati 5-3 earlier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, 15-5 this month despite losing two of three to Los
Angeles during the weekend, trail the Diamondbacks by 1&AMP;frac12; games.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (6-7), who entered the game with a 2-6 record and 6.68
ERA in his previous 11 starts, walked one and struck out nine to
equal a season high before being relieved by Terry Adams to start
the eighth. Jeff Shaw got the final out to complete the two-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, who threw 90 pitches, held the Giants hitless until
Barry Bonds lined a single to center with one out in the fourth.
The only other San Francisco hit off Dreifort was a double by Bobby
Estalella in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Blanked for just the second time this season, the Giants scored
four or more runs in 16 of their previous 19 games this month, and
have averaged over six runs per game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth homered on the first pitch thrown by Russ
Ortiz (5-9), and Green hit a two-run homer three batters later to
give the Dodgers a quick 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield doubled and scored on Adrian Beltre's two-out
single in the third to make it 4-0, and Green opened the eighth
against Scott Linebrink with his second homer and 16th of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz allowed eight hits and four runs in seven innings, while
walking three and striking out eight. It was his longest outing
since April 28.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Dodgers activated center fielder Devon White, sidelined
since partially tearing his left rotator cuff May 3. To make room,
right-hander Al Reyes was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque of the
Pacific Coast League. ... White wasn't in the starting lineup.
Instead, it was Hollandsworth, who has hit six of his eight homers
leading off a game. ... The Dodgers, whose 25-23 road record is the
best in the NL West, begin a 10-game road trip at Colorado on
Monday night, and play 16 of their next 22 games on the road. ...
Dreifort struck out four straight during one stretch -- Bonds to end
the first, and Jeff Kent, Ellis Burks and J.T. Snow in the second.
... Ortiz struck out the side in the fourth, fanning Dreifort,
Hollandsworth and Mark Grudzielanek. ... Burks went hitless in four
at-bats, ending his 12-game hitting streak. ... Five of the first
seven Los Angeles batters hit safely against Ortiz, but the
right-hander allowed just one hit after the third.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The coach of the women's U.S. Olympic
track and field team wants Regina Jacobs to run both the 1,500 and
5,000 meters in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my mind, I think it's a doable thing,'' Karen Dennis said
Sunday, the final day of the U.S. Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said all along that she would run only the 1,500 at the
Olympics, but the pressure for her to compete in the 5,000 has
increased after she set the American record on Friday at 14
minutes, 45.35 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year by
7&AMP;frac12; seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Regina, who also won the 1,500 at the trials, said after her
5,000 triumph that she still intended to run only the 1,500 because
''I have some unfinished business there.'' That business includes
taking a shot at Mary Slaney's 17-year-old American record and
winning an Olympic gold medal after getting silvers at the last two
world championships.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis doesn't think the decision is final.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw Regina this morning and I asked her if she'd consider
both,'' Dennis said, ''and she said she had to go to the
bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis interpreted that answer to mean that Jacobs hasn't made
up her mind and will talk it over with her coach Tom Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she and Tom are going to get together and determine
what her best chances are to win a medal and come up with a
decision,'' Dennis said, ''whether it's the 1,500, the 5,000 or
both.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said the schedule in Sydney would make it possible for
Jacobs to run both.
</P>
<P>
   ''She'd have a 5,000, and then two days' rest and then the 5,000
finals,'' Dennis said. ''Then the day after the 5,000 finals she'd
go into three successive days of trials, semis and finals in the
1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tough task, but Regina's tough. I don't know if she'll
opt to do it. I'd like to see her do it, but that's going to be a
decision she and her coach will make.''

   GODINA GOES: John Godina, who missed out on making the Olympic
team in his best event, the shot put, will make it after finishing
second in the discus Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of bittersweet to qualify in one event and not the
other,'' said Godina, the Olympic silver medalist in the shot put
four years ago. ''But if you don't get it in the first event,
getting the other is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Godina finished fourth in the shot put trials in one of the
toughest competitions in the event ever. The top three all threw
over 70 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took me about a day to get over it,'' he said. ''But I
would have felt bad longer if I'd performed badly. The three guys
who made the team all had personal bests. You can't dwell on that
forever.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   RELAY PLANS@: The top seven finishers in the 100 meters all
have agreed to be part of the pool for the 400-meter relay team,
U.S. men's coach John Chaplin said.
</P>
<P>
   Those seven include the four who ran on the first-place team at
last year's world championships -- Jon Drummond, Tim Montgomery,
Brian Lewis and Maurice Greene.
</P>
<P>
   The exact makeup of the pool won't be determined until early
next week, Chaplin said, and it may or may not include those seven
who have agreed to run the relay.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin, the former head coach at Washington State, knows that
his biggest job will be making sure the highly favored American men
win the 400 relay.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they drop the sticks or run out of the zone or lose the
race, I'll be hung in effigy and maybe literally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   MONIQUE'S OLYMPICS: U.S. women's Olympic coach Karen Dennis
says she is considering taking 17-year-old Monique Henderson to
Sydney as part of the 1,600-meter relay pool, even though she
finished last in the 400-meter finals at the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite possible that Monique would get in the pool and get
a chance to experience the Olympics in Sydney,'' Dennis said. ''She
would gain a lot of valuable experience really as a youngster to
participate in the Olympics. But it's not a certainty that Monique
will actually run a round.''

<HEADLINE> Braves 1, Mets 0  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Andy Ashby is fitting right in with the Atlanta
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, acquired in a trade during the All-Star break to bolster
Atlanta's rotation, picked up his second complete-game victory for
the Braves, allowing only four hits in a 1-0 victory over the New
York Mets on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were told before the game that All-Star shortstop Barry
Larkin rejected a proposed trade from Cincinnati. Then, while
watching his team try to make up ground on the Braves in the NL
East, New York general manager Steve Phillips learned that Larkin
signed a three-year contract extension with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby (6-7) made sure it was a miserable day all around for the
Mets, who dropped six games behind Atlanta after losing two of
three in the weekend series. New York is 2-18 at Turner Field since
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby won his fourth straight start, the last two since being
acquired by the Braves from the Philadelphia Phillies. He struck
out seven and walked two in his eighth career shutout, and first
since July 4, 1999, while pitching for San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby pitched a seven-hitter in his Atlanta debut, a 4-1 victory
at Baltimore. Then, he benefitted from a rainout at Florida on
Wednesday, having surrendered six runs in three innings before the
game was called.
</P>
<P>
   New York's best chance to score came in the fourth inning, when
the Mets loaded the bases with one out. But Todd Zeile hit into a
6-4-3 double play to end the threat, which might still have
produced a run if Lenny Harris had not been picked off at first
after leading off with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby threw high to first after fielding Jay Payton's dribbler
leading off the ninth, the error allowing Payton to reach second.
But Ashby escaped the jam by getting Mike Piazza on a grounder to
third, and Zeile and Benny Agbayani on grounders to short.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves scored the only run in the sixth. Brian Jordan led
off with a single to right and came all the way around when Wally
Joyner followed with a double into the right-field corner against
Bobby Jones (4-5).
</P>
<P>
   Jones allowed seven hits in 5 1-3 innings and benefitted from a
brilliant defensive play by right fielder Derek Bell.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, the Braves had two runners on with Mets killer
Chipper Jones at the plate. Last year's NL MVP, hitting .367 in his
career against New York, sent a towering drive that seemed headed
for the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bell made a perfectly timed leap above the fence,
snaring the ball for the third out.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The temperature at the start of the game was 69 degrees,
much cooler than the 90-plus readings for the first two games in
the series. A line of severe thunderstorms moved through Atlanta a
couple of hours before the game, cooling things down, and the game
was played with a gentle breeze blowing through the stands. ...
Braves reliever John Rocker, who made a memorable return to New
York last month after his inflammatory magazine article, did not
pitch in this series. ... Mets 2B Edgardo Alfonzo missed all three
games against the Braves with a sore hip.

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Lisa Leslie scored 20 points as the Los
Angeles Sparks defeated the Sacramento Monarchs 73-68 Sunday and
moved into first place in the WNBA's Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Feaster scored a career-high 18 points, in a reserve
role, for the Sparks (21-3), Tamecka Dixon had 14 points and seven
assists and DeLisha Milton had 13 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles won for the 17th time in 18 games and jumped a
half-game ahead of the Houston Comets, who lost 69-64 to the New
York Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has eight games left, Houston seven. If the teams
are tied at season's end, the Sparks win the conference title
because they took the season series against the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Griffith had 19 points for the Monarchs (15-10) and
Tangela Smith scored eight of her 10 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks trailed just once early in the game, but the Monarchs
chipped away at the lead late in the second half. Sacramento tied
it at 66 with 3:55 to play before 8,482 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   After a Milton free throw and a reverse lay-up by Dixon put the
Sparks up 69-66, Sacramento came back within one on Ruthie
Bolton-Holifield's basket with 2:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks padded their lead with a basket by Leslie with 1:09
left and two Dixon free throws with 6.3 seconds remaining and the
Monarchs didn't score again.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento point guard Ticha Penicherio, the league's assist
leader, missed the game because of a sore right foot.

<HEADLINE> Bills Sign Rookie DE Erik Flowers  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSFORD, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills signed rookie defensive
end Erik Flowers on Sunday, the last of the team's eight draft
picks to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not released.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels great,'' Flowers told Empire Sports Network after
arriving at Rochester International Airport on Sunday evening. ''I
was talking to (a Bills' teammate) yesterday and he was telling me
he was having a blast up here. I'm like, 'Man, I got to hurry up
and get out of here.' And plus the heat in Texas is ridiculous, so
I'm happy to get out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team management nor Eric Metz, Flowers' agent who flew
into town over the weekend to negotiate the deal personally, could
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers, the 26th pick in April's draft, arrived at the Bills'
new training camp at St. John Fisher College in time for the 7 p.m.
team meeting. After missing the first three days of practice, he
will take part in Monday morning's session.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers led Arizona State with 10 sacks last season while also
recording 68 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   The signing was critical for the Bills, trying to shore up the
sagging right side of the defensive line. Bruce Smith, the team's
career sack leader, signed as a free agent with Washington last
February. Marcellus Wiley, Smith's successor, will miss at least
two more weeks recovering from back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers became the Bills' first defensive end to be drafted in
the first round since the team took Smith first overall in 1985.
Flowers was also the first rookie holdout in general manager John
Butler's eight-year term.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of camp, Bills coach Wade Phillips raised concerns
that Flowers was missing critical development time with every
practice he missed.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica 2, United States 1  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- For the United States, it was an
unfair call that resulted in the team's fall to the bottom of its
four-team World Cup qualifying group. For the Costa Ricans, it
became their winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''This one is tough to swallow,'' U.S. captain Claudio Reyna
said Sunday after a questionable call resulted in a penalty kick
that gave Costa Rica a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive play came when Gregg Berhalter was called for using
his hands inside the penalty box, a ruling strongly argued against
by the Americans, especially by Reyna who had to be restrained
several times by teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended the U.S. team's eight-game World Cup qualifying
stretch without a loss, which dated to 1997. The streak was just
two games short of the team's all-time mark.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a case where the referee was under pressure to do
something and he made a bad call,'' Berhalter said. ''My hands were
by my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernan Medford beat goalkeeper Kasey Keller with the penalty
kick and the game ended shortly after that with U.S. players
shouting at Jamaican referee Peter Prendergast.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna went at Prendergast with such anger that the referee took
several steps backward. Reyna said Prendergast was in a bad
position to see whether Berhalter used his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a terrible decision at that time of the game, but there's
nothing we can do about it now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bruce Arena also criticized the call which came just
minutes after Prendergast ruled there was no foul when Frankie
Hejduk of the United States knocked down Medford in the box with
what appeared to be a sliding tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just have to win the next four games, that's all,'' Arena
said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is winless in six straight matches in Costa
Rica, which handed the Americans their only two losses during
qualifying for the 1998 World Cup. In its opening game for the 2002
World Cup semifinal round, the United States (0-1-1) tied Guatemala
(1-0-1) a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the United States, playing without defender Eddie
Pope and forward Brian McBride, who are injured, fell behind Costa
Rica (1-1) in the ninth minute on a goal by Rolando Fonseca. The
score came after Medford intercepted a U.S. corner kick and passed
to Fonseca.
</P>
<P>
   The United States came back in the second half, with Earnie
Stewart scoring in the 65th minute on a rebound of a shot by Ante
Razov.
</P>
<P>
   The win gave Costa Rica a much-needed three points. The team
qualified for the 1990 World Cup but has not returned since.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes we play good and lose, and they criticize us,''
Costa Rica's Paulo Wanchope said. ''Today we won, and they continue
criticizing us.''
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica was upset 2-1 at Barbados (1-1) a week ago, angering
many fans who shouted insults at the national team's players during
practices this week. The abuse became so bad that Wanchope's family
hired bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   But Costa Ricans fans were supportive Sunday, throwing so many
white streamers on the field, some of the areas around the goals
looked snow-covered. Players from both teams were affected by the
thick layer of paper, which nearly tripped both goaltenders.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd also threw objects, including a bottle that landed
well onto the field at Estadio Ricardo Saprissa, at the Americans
and shouted obscenities from the stands. The stadium is infamous
for rowdy fans who are just yards from the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala leads the regional group, with Costa Rica and Barbados
sharing second and the United States fourth. Each team plays each
other home and away. A team must finish first or second to advance
to the final qualifying round.
</P>
<P>
   The next game for the United States is against Barbados on Aug.
16 in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's other games in the North and Central American and
Caribbean region, Trinidad and Tobago upset visiting Mexico 1-0 on
Russell Latapy's goal in the 85th minute, and Canada played a
scoreless tie at Panama in Group C; and Jamaica beat visiting
Honduras 3-1 and El Salvador routed St. Vincent and the Grenadines
7-1 in Group D.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Murder Suspect Releases 2 Kids  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A murder suspect holding five hostages in a
suburban home released two of the four children Sunday as police
tried to end the two-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Both children, an 8-year-old boy and a girl under 1, were in
good health, although the boy was hungry and thirsty, Orange County
Sheriff Kevin Beary said.
</P>
<P>
   Beary said the suspect, Jamie Dean Petron, 41, had asked police
to see the children reunited with their parents on live television
after releasing them. Local news stations aired the footage shortly
after their release.
</P>
<P>
   Petron told police he would release the other hostages after the
tape of a statement he made was aired, Orange County Sheriff's
Capt. Steve Jones said, but he continued to hold them Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in her 40s, a 16-year-old girl and a 9-month-old girl
remained inside the home Sunday, police said. Earlier Sunday,
police had fired a shot at Petron in an attempt to end the standoff
but missed.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 5 p.m., negotiators released the taped statement
from Petron, at his request. Petron said he didn't mean to hurt
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not me, it's something that totally happened,'' he
said. ''All I can say is deep in my heart I am really apologetic.
Don't think I'm the devil, I'm not the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Petron also had a message for his son and baby granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love you guys. Maybe we'll see each some day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Petron took the family hostage Saturday after shooting an Orange
County sheriff's deputy in the leg as the deputy tried to arrest
him outside a nearby grocery store, police said. Petron is
suspected in the Friday shooting death of a Pompano Beach
convenience store clerk, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Petron apparently did not know the family before he burst into
their home in the Meadow Woods subdivision, south of Orlando. About
20 nearby homes were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   He had not threatened to harm anyone, Orange County sheriff's
spokesman Jim Solomons said. Petron had demanded food and ''other
things,'' but police did not release details.
</P>
<P>
   Petron, who continued negotiating with police after a SWAT
officer shot at him, has said someone in the house is injured,
though police could not confirm whether it was true, Orange County
sheriff's Sgt. Angelo Nieves said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure he wants the right thing done,'' Petron's attorney,
Spencer Bryant Siegel, said Sunday after talking to his client by
phone.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office was receiving assistance from Petron's son,
a Broward County sheriff's employee, who traveled to Orlando in an
attempt to convince his father to let the hostages go.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Petron shot at a 28-year-old man as he escaped the
home, grazing the man's head, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Petron is a suspect in the Friday slaying of Jorge Trillos, 22,
during a convenience store robbery in Pompano Beach. Trillos' boss,
Samir Hantash, 48, was seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies located Petron about noon Saturday at a grocery store,
but Petron rammed a sheriff's vehicle and shot Deputy Scott Winters
in the leg, authorities said. Winters, 26, was in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Petron was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 1986
for attempted first-degree murder, forgery and battery on a law
enforcement officer. He was released from prison on Dec. 10, 1995.

   RIBEIRAO PRETO, Brazil (AP) -- Argentina shot 50 percent from the
field, including going 10-for-16 from 3-point range, and beat the
United States 92-77 Sunday night in the gold medal game of World
Championship for Young Men qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team, which had already clinched a berth in FIBA's 2001
World Championship for Young Men, lost for the first time in five
games in the tournament. Argentina and the Dominican Republic,
which beat Brazil 77-73 in the third-place game, also advanced to
next year's world championships in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's Jason Williams scored 17 points for the United States,
which shot 36.2 percent (25-for-69) from the field and 30.0 percent
(6-for-20) from beyond the arc against Argentina, well off the
marks of 51.7 percent and 41.0 percent it managed over the first
four games.
</P>
<P>
   Williams finished as the tournament's assist leader with 29.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina (4-1) closed the first half with an 11-4 run to take a
41-39 lead. Williams hit a 3-pointer to bring the U.S. team within
50-45, but Argentina went on a 10-3 run to lead 60-48 with 10:56 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Zack Randolph and Jason Richardson, who will be teammates at
Michigan State next season, each scored 12 points, while Illinois'
Brian Cook added 11.

   Carlos Delfina scored 29 points for Argentina, while tournament
MVP Luis Scola added 15.

<HEADLINE> Rallies Oppose and Back Philly Cops  </HEADLINE>
By MARYCLAIRE DALE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Black clergy leaders rallied at a church
Sunday evening to criticize the police beating of a carjacking
suspect that was captured on videotape. Earlier in the day, several
hundred people gathered at City Hall in a show of support for
police.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is it,'' Rev. Robert Shine, vice president of the Black
Clergy of Philadelphia and vicinity, told about 600 people gathered
in Morris Brown A.M.E. church. ''We've taken all we can take. From
henceforth the movement has begun.''
</P>
<P>
   Shine also criticized white clergy members for not denouncing
abuses such as the violent arrest of Thomas Jones, which drew
national attention after a television station helicopter videotaped
officers kicking and punching him after a chase and shootout on
July 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason racism has continued so long is that certain
pulpits have been quiet too long,'' Shine said.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers blasted District Attorney Lynne Abraham for not
filing criminal charges against the officers. The Rev. Al Sharpton,
who addressed the church service, suggested a march on Abraham's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''If she saw you beat somebody, she would you arrest you right
away,'' Sharpton later said outside the church, where he tried to
appease a rowdy crowd of about 300 people unable to fit inside the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Cathie Abookire, Abraham's spokeswoman, said, ''There are
conditions under which a police officer can lawfully use force to
make a lawful arrest.'' The investigation will determine whether
the officers' conduct ''rose to the level of criminal charges,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they began chasing Jones after spotting him driving
a car that had been taken in a carjacking. Police said the car
crashed, they exchanged gunfire with Jones, and he then stole the
police car and fled before he was cornered and subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been charged with attempted murder, assault, resisting
arrest and other offenses, and with a series of purse-snatchings
and other crimes in the week leading up to the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, talk-show host Dom Giordano held an afternoon rally at
City Hall in support of the police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people in the media and the community are on the way to
canonizing Tom Jones as a saint instead of the dangerous career
criminal that he really is. His criminal actions on July 12 could
have had fatal consequences,'' Giordano said.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The big buildup turned into a big
bust.
</P>
<P>
   In the most anticipated showdown in track and field in three
years, Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene both pulled up lame in
the final of the 200 meters at the U.S. Olympic trials on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was painful when it happened,'' Johnson said of the injury
to his left hamstring. ''It was one of the most painful I've ever

   Greene strained the same hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt a strain ...,'' Greene said. ''I stopped before I tore
something.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it had anything to do with the heat or with the
rivalry. I was just trying to do something my body wasn't ready to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole world wanted a great show today. Unfortunately,
Michael and I weren't able to give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   They met twice Sunday because both were in the same semifinal
heat. They came back less than two hours later in the final but
neither finished the race.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries to Johnson and Greene means neither will run the
200 at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, however, has qualified for the 400 and will run the
1,600 relay, if he recovers.
</P>
<P>
   Greene will be in the 100 and 400 relay, also if he is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The shocking developments involving Johnson and Greene, the
world's two best sprinters, overshadowed some dazzling and
unprecedented performances.
</P>
<P>
   There was Stacy Dragila breaking her world record in the pole
vault, soaring 15 feet, 2&AMP;frac14; inches. There was Gail Devers smashing
her American record in the 100-meter hurdles in 12.33.
</P>
<P>
   There was Marion Jones winning the women's 200 at 21.94, the
fastest in the world this year, assuring her the opportunity to try
for a record five gold medals at the Sydney Olympics. And there was
the running Clark family -- Hazel, Jearl Miles and Joetta --
finishing 1-2-3 in the women's 800, all qualifying for the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the 200 final, Johnson was nursing a tender right
quadriceps, but it was his left hamstring that forced him to quit
about 80 meters into the race.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident that when Johnson came out of the blocks, he
wasn't healthy. He started much slower than usual, began slowing
even more at 50 meters, then struggled another 20 to 30 meters
before crumpling to the track.
</P>
<P>
   He was removed from the track on a cart.
</P>
<P>
   Greene began limping with about 100 meters left, grabbed for the
back of his left leg, started to slow further and stopped shortly
after.
</P>
<P>
   He then walked toward the finish line, and had his left
hamstring wrapped in ice.
</P>
<P>
   The race, the final event at the trials, proved anticlimactic
after much hype, which included as much trash-talking as has ever
been seen in a track and field event.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the final was 1999 NCAA champion John Capel of
Florida in 19.85 seconds, with Floyd Heard second in 19.88 and Coby
Miller third in 19.96.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know what had happened until I looked up at the
screen and saw Michael lying on the ground,'' Capel said. ''I hope
he's all right for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a terrible way to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene was surprised that he got injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was coming up on the curve. I was running pretty good and my
leg just grabbed,'' he said. ''I'm disappointed I couldn't put on a
show here for the fans. You have to listen to your body and I
couldn't finish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should be ready to go in about two to three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Greene spoke with Johnson after their huge
letdowns in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him to get well,'' Greene said. ''He said nothing. I
have no problem speaking with Michael. I can tell him something
like 'Get well.' If he speaks back, it will be on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did not speak back.
</P>
<P>
   Greene plans to see a doctor Monday to determine the seriousness
of his injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's torn, I can't say how long it will take to heal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had sympathy for Johnson and Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's frustrating for everybody,'' Jones said. ''As an
athlete I can sense their frustration because everybody knows I
went down in Seville last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones crumpled to the track in the semifinals of the 200 at the
World Championships in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that you have two of the fastest men in the world go
down in that event and not make the Olympic team (in the 200) is
hard,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate for everybody, but that's the way the U.S.
trials go.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's first round went to Johnson. He finished second to
Capel in the semifinals at 20.14, with Greene third at 20.30.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Greene had said, ''Michael Johnson is a great athlete.
If people call him Superman, well, I am Kryptonite.''
</P>
<P>
   Kryptonite wasn't good enough in the semifinals and came apart
in the final. Superman didn't live up to his name in the final,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maurice had a lot to gain,'' Johnson said. ''If he beats me,
he's the new king. Everyone had a lot to gain but me.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson thought that perhaps the near-100 degree heat caused his
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''The heat will, of course, do that. But I thought I was
hydrated,'' he said. ''It was disappointing. It was a goal of mine,
but you can't have everything. I'll still represent my country in
the 400.''
</P>
<P>
   This was their first confrontations since 1998 and their third
and fourth overall, with them splitting the first two.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson got hurt Saturday in his opening-round heat. After
winning with the first-round's fastest time, 19.89, he complained
of a cramp in his quadriceps coming off the curve, but said that it
mostly disappeared down the straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there was doubt whether he would run in the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Clyde Hart said it would depend on whether Johnson felt
any pain during warmups Sunday. Hart and Johnson did not want to
jeopardize the Olympic champion's chances of winning gold medals in
the 400 and 1,600 by running with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the warmups, the semifinal went well, although not as
well as expected because of the surprise performance of the
overlooked Capel.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson crossed the finish line, having beaten Greene, he
smirked at his feisty rival.
</P>
<P>
   He then went into the athletes' tent and packed his quadriceps
with ice.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to the race, Johnson had said he was tired of what he
called Greene's disrespectful and immature attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup attracted betting in a Nevada book and drew many
responses from an internet poll conducted to determine a favorite.
Johnson was the odds-on favorite in the betting and a huge choice
in the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries and Capel undid both the bettors and the pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Johnson's 150-meter match race against Canada's
Donovan Bailey, the 1996 100-meter Olympic gold medalist, has there
been so much hype for a track and field event.
</P>
<P>
   That race also turned into a bust, as Johnson pulled up after
about 70 meters with an injured right leg.
</P>
<P>
   After Dragila smashed her record of 15-1&AMP;frac34;, she tried to clear
15-5, but missed three times. On her second attempt, she barely
brushed the bar on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Austin, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the men's high
jump, will return to defend his title after winning the national
title for the sixth consecutive year. Austin cleared 7-7&AMP;frac14;.
</P>
<P>
   Devers broke her year-old record of 12.37 and became the
fourth-fastest performer ever.
</P>
<P>
   The world record is 12.21 by Yordanka Donkova of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   In the 800, 22-year-old Hazel Clark matched her career best of
1:58.97 in beating 33-year-old Jearl Miles (1:59.12) and
37-year-old Joetta Clark (1:59.49).
</P>
<P>
   Joetta beat Meredith Rainey-Valmon by 0.01 seconds for the final
spot on the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   In other finals, 1996 Olympic gold medalist Allen Johnson won
the men's 110 hurdles at 12.97, the fastest in the world this year;
Mark Everett took the men's 800 at 1:45.67; Robert Howard won the
triple jump at 55-9, and Adam Setliff took the discus at 209-10.

   WILTON, N.Y. (AP) - At 8:08 Sunday morning, the men of the Sons
of Union Veterans Camp 154 paused outside their tents and gazed
northwest toward the top of Mt. McGregor.
</P>
<P>
   It was 115 years ago to the minute that President Ulysses S.
Grant died in a cottage atop the mountain, finally succumbing to
the throat cancer he raced to finish his best-selling memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Few people know the cottage is here in Saratoga County, 30 miles
north of Albany and two miles west of Northway Exit 16. Where it
once sat in the shadow of the grand Balmoral Hotel, it now has Mt.
McGregor Correctional Facility as a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, all is as it was in the days following Grant's death.
Personal effects, medicine bottles, even the original floral
arrangements from his funeral provide a look into the 18th
president's last weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Grant was literally fighting his last great battle here,''
said Kathleen Cummings, a member of the Friends of Grant Cottage, a
group that cares for the two-story mountain retreat and provides
educational tours during the summer. ''He was desperate to get his
memoirs done.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting fleeced by corrupt financier Ferdinand Ward in
1884, Grant was broke. At the urging of Mark Twain, the ailing
Grant determined to write his memoirs to help restore his family's
name and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was his last battle and he won it,'' said Richard
Trombley, who portrays Grant at re-enactments. Strikingly familiar,
Trombley bore the president's characteristic graying whiskers, silk
top hat, Prince Albert coat, house slippers and ivory muffler, worn
to warm his ravaged throat. ''In death, he was able to do for his
family what he was unable to do in life: Provide for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Trombley was surrounded by other re-enactors Sunday, including
the president's wife, Julia, his children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Grant's death in 1885, veterans of the Grand
Army of the Republic, the men who served him as he led Union troops
to victory in the Civil War, ascended the Adirondack foothill,
encamped and posted an honor guard at the remains of their leader.
</P>
<P>
   Now, exactly 115 years later, descendants of those men stood in
dappled sunlight and lifted anew the mantle borne by their
grandfathers' fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stopped and stood for a moment and I looked at my watch and
it was the exact minute,'' said Daniel T. Cole, a member of the
Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War Camp 154.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's maternal great-great-grandfather, George Thomas Hatch,
fought with Grant under his first command. His paternal
great-great-grandfather, Joel Cole, was under Grant when Robert E.
Lee surrendered April 9, 1865 at Appomattox Court House.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rave's great-great-grandfather, Charles Kniffin, fought in
places like Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg and Gettysburg,
where he would lose his leg.
</P>
<P>
   It is for their ancestors - and all those who fought in that
great, terrible war - that men like Cole and Rave and groups like
the Friends of Grant Cottage exist, they say. Children get a few
pages in a history book but most fail to take advantage of living
histories that remain in places like Grant Cottage.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the cottage, a stone sits. Across the top of its
verdigris plaque is a message: ''Lest We Forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here to keep green the memories,'' said Rave. ''We're
honoring our ancestors who stood here.''
