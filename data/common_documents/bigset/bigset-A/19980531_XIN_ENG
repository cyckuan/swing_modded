<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants to Host Another World Cup by 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Soccer Federation
(USSF) hopes to host another World Cup in 2010 or 2014, said the
head of the USSF at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Alan Rothenberg said:"We would love to host another World Cup.
It's something we will absolutely look at. But I think it can't be
before 2010 and probably more likely in 2014. As soon as the
bidding opens up, I'm sure FIFA will put us at the head of the
line."
</P>
<P>
The 1994 World Cup, staged in the United States for the first
time, was regarded as a success from a public and commercial
standpoint. The 52-game tournament attracted 3.5 million
spectators at nine venues and reached good television ratings in
this country.
</P>
<P>
FIFA officials were satisfied with the results and indicated
they would like to see another U.S. bid in the future.
</P>
<P>
The 2002 World Cup is scheduled to be shared by Japan and South
Korea. Germany and England are bidding for the 2006 tournament,
and FIFA has showed its attitute to back up South Africa for the
2010 version. That likely would open 2014 for a North American or
South American country.
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg said there haven't been any formal discussions with
FIFA officials about the bidding attempt.
</P>
<P>
The United States will host the Women's World Cup next year.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Ministers to Meet on Indian-Pakistan Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain announced Saturday foreign
ministers from the Group of Eight (G-8) countries would meet in
London next month to discuss a joint approach towards the series
of nuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement issued
Saturday that the London meeting of G-8, which consists of the
United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Britain and
Russia, would be held on June 12.
</P>
<P>
Cook, whose country is the current G-8 president, stressed that
the G-8 ministers were expected to "coordinate our approach to
Pakistan and India in the light of the nuclear tests."
</P>
<P>
The ministers would consider "in particular how we can most
effectively bring both of them within the global non-proliferation
regime and encourage them to address the roots of the tension
between them," Cook said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, Cook unleashed verbal attacks upon Pakistan for
undertaking another round of nuclear tests saying this latest
action was "flagrant disregard" of international opinion.

GENEVA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Real Madrid have had their 200,000
U.S. dollars fine for crowd trouble at last month's European Cup
match with Borussia Dortmund halved, UEFA announced in Zurich on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But a 1,000,000 Swiss francs (674,000 U.S. dollars) penalty for
apparently letting in too many fans stays.
</P>
<P>
A two-match ban on the home stadium has been cut to one. Real
must play their first home European game next season over 300
kilometers away from Madrid.
</P>
<P>
UEFA imposed the punishments following crowd problems at the
European Cup semi-final first leg against Borussia in Real's
Santaigo Bernabeu stadium on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Hooligans damaged one of the goals, causing a 75-minute delay.

<HEADLINE> Half of Sans Papiers Immigrants Receive Legal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 50 percent of some 145,000
registered immigrants without residency papers, called sans
papiers here, have received legal residency in France since the
Socialist government began to re-examine their cases 11 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said that 85 percent of the applications
for legal residency from the 145,000 sans papiers have been
studied and given answers, with nearly 50 percent of them being
positive.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for applying for legal residency by hundreds of
thousands of sans papiers, most of them Africans and Arabs but
also Asians, is due on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Most of those whose applications were rejected are unmarried
young people, as the French government gives prior considerations
to those who have family members living in France.
</P>
<P>
The French government estimates that 150,000 more unregistered
sans papiers are living and working illegally in France.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement congratulated the
governments of different prefects on almost completing the job
without causing much trouble from the political rightwing rivals
of the leftwing government.
</P>
<P>
But the government is criticized by some for doing it in an
arbitrary rather than humanitarian way when issuing residency
rights.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Crackdown on Tax Dodgers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia's newly-appointed director of
the state tax service, Boris Fyodorov, has decided to tighten tax
collection in a bid to raise revenue owed to the state.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Kommersant Daily on Saturday, Fyodorov
said production and service industries, including the fields of
raw materials, oil and liquor, should bring in more tax revenue
than they do.
</P>
<P>
Measures would be imposed equally on anyone, Fyodorov said in
response to the question whether monopolies having debts to the
budget would be included in the penalty.
</P>
<P>
"If an enterprise does not pay taxes, it should be declared
bankrupt. Everyone should be treated on an equal footing." he said.
</P>
<P>
Tax collection was especially poor with regard to individuals,
Fyodorov said, adding only four million out of the 150 million
population filled out income tax declarations for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tax dodging, particularly by some conglomerates, had deprived
the state of revenue, compounding the country's economic woes and
problems caused by devaluation of the currency.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria under Fire Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, currently in Switzerland for
a World Cup training session, came under heavy fire back from home
after a series of disasterous performances in their preparations
for next month's event.
</P>
<P>
The "Super Eagles" chalked up an embarassing warming-up records
which have seen them tying Jamaica 2-2, losing to Germany 0-1,
humiliated 0-4 by the Swiss first division club Grasshoppers and
routed by Yugoslavia 0-3.
</P>
<P>
"Shame" and "Disaster" are the comments for the Olympic
champions from the already impatient Lagos media, who had
previously highly rated their World Cup-bound team.
</P>
<P>
The media also accused the national players of lacking
commitments, being loosely-minded and only seeking for personal
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has now only one warm-up match before the World Cup,
taking them face the Netherlands on June 5.

<HEADLINE> Pak Nuclear Testing, Expression of Self-Defense: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's decision to exercise
the nuclear option is "an expression of self-defense," Foreign
Secretary Shamshad Ahmed told a press conference Saturday
afternoon after the detonation of another nuclear device earlier
in the day.
</P>
<P>
"In restoring the strategic balance in the South Asian region,
Pakistan has given only a bare minimum response," the foreign
secretary said at the press conference which was attended by about
150 journalists.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan conducted five nuclear tests on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan completed the current series by another nuclear test
Saturday, said Shamshad.
</P>
<P>
"All the tests conducted were fully contained. There was no
release of radio-activity. The results were as expected," Shamshad
said, adding that "the devices tested correspond to weapons
configuration, compatible with delivery systems."
</P>
<P>
He said that "it is not our intention to enter into an arms
race. The history of the Cold War era shows that such disastrous
races are counter-productive and definitely not sustainable."
</P>
<P>
"The only race we propose to run is for economic development,"
said Shamshad, adding that more than one billion people of South
Asia do not want and certainly cannot afford to divert their
precious resources for a nuclear confrontation in the region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Pakistan has always exercised maximum restraint.
It will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
"Our capabilities demonstrated by our six nuclear tests are
only for self-defense and only to deter aggression," stressed the
foreign secretary.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said India initiated its nuclear program right after
its independence and detonated a device in, as early as, 1974.
</P>
<P>
"New Delhi then feverishly engaged in a massive nuclear and
missile program to satisfy its grandiose ambitions and
hegemonistic designs," the foreign secretary said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact of our existence as the neighbor of an expansionist
and a hegemonistic power taught us the inevitable lesson that we
must search for security," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the real causes of insecurity, conflicts and
tensions in the South Asian region need to be redressed. "It is,
therefore, imperative to find a peaceful and just solution of the
Jammu and Kashmir dispute," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the genuine contribution to peace and security
can be made by constructive engagement in the search for permanent
solutions.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has affirmed
Pakistan's determination to engage in "a constructive dialogue"
with other countries especially major powers to determine new ways
and means to promote the goal of nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation in the world.
</P>
<P>
Sharif has also reaffirmed the determination of his government
to resume Pak-India dialogue to address all outstanding issues
including the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir as well as peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to enter into discussions with India for
taking all steps that are necessary to ensure mutual restraint and
equitable measures for nuclear stabilization in the South Asian
region," Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said that "compelling security concerns
have to be discussed together with measures to promote the goals
of non-proliferation. Global non-proliferation regimes can best be
promoted by addressing the very factors that impel proliferation."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, as a responsible nation, assures the international
community and in particular India of its willingness "to enter
into immediate discussions to address all matters of peace and
security including urgent measures to prevent the dangers of
nuclear conflagration," he added.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Visiting former French President
Valery Giscard D'estaing said here on Sunday that the European
Union (EU) is to adopt a common policy on cooperation with Iran.

Beijing this evening do not prelude major ones in the Chinese
capital, according to an official with the State Seismological
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Beijing will be hit by destructive earthquakes
measuring more than five on the Ritcher Scale in the
near future," said Ding Jianhai, head of the Center for Earthquake
Analysis and Prediction.
</P>
<P>
At 7:37 and 7:42 this evening (local time) this evening,
Beijing was hit by two minor quakes measuring 3.1 on the Ritcher
Scale. The quakes' epicenters were located at around Fengtai
District, 15 kilometers away from the center of Beijing, or 39.53
degrees north latitude and 116.18 degrees east longitude. They
were strongly felt in Fengtai, Shijingshan, Haidian and some other
areas of the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
"As the quakes are the ones that occurred nearest to the city
center this year, so they have drawn close attention of local
residents," Ding said.
</P>
<P>
No damage of houses has been reported, according to Ding.

<HEADLINE> Wanda Draws Guo'an to Retain Lead in Chinese League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- League leader Dalian Wanda fought
Guo'an to a 1-1 away tie to keep its lead as Shanghai Shenhua also
tied 1-1 at home with unheralded Yanbian Aodong in the 12th round
of the Chinese soccer first division league.
</P>
<P>
Star striker Hao Haidong opened the scoring for Wanda in the
20th minute for the visitors to silence the sellout stadium before
Li Dongpo equalized with a surprise shot from outside the penalty
in the 39th minute.
</P>
<P>
Guo'an was outplayed by Wanda all the way through the
competition as Wanda controlled the midfield, forcing the host to
the defense. Guo'an only staged strong attacks during the opening
minutes in each half, highlighted by its speed advantage.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua remained three points adrift from Wanda in the
standings after it came a long way to overcome a 1-0 deficit with
a late goal in injury time, while Guangzhou Songri scored a
surprise 3-1 away win over star-studded Vanguard Huandao.
</P>
<P>
In the other games of the day, Shichuan Quanxing tied 1-1 with
Shenzhen Pingan. Zhuangyi scored his first goal in the league as
Qingdao Hainiu notched up a 1-0 win over the Chinese Army.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang Haishi held Shangdong Luneng to a 1-1 draw where the
imports came into the spotlight. Guangzhou Apollo was held
scoreless by Wuhan Hong Jinlong, facing the threat of being
demoted after it failed to exploit the host advantage.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Reiterates Call for Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Sunday reiterated his call for dialog among different
civilizations in the world, the Iranian official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We need to work to make the next century a time of dialog
among civilizations," Khatami said during a meeting with visiting
former French President Valery Giscard D'estaing.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to enter the 21st century with a new
outlook, saying that cultural and political personalities of the
world can be instrumental to help realize the dialog in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, a moderate advocate of reforms and social changes in
Iran, has repeated his call for dialog to promote understanding
among different cultures and civilizations on several occasions
since he took office last August.
</P>
<P>
D'estaing, who arrived here on Friday for a three-day visit,
said that France has viewed the election of Khatami among the
important events last year.
</P>
<P>
"We all want to see Iran find its rightful place in the world
community, and driven by this, we are keenly pursuing your
outlooks of world issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Khatami's initiative on dialog, the former French
president said that "one of the problems in this century is the
misconceptions existing among adherents of various schools of
thoughts with regard to each other."
</P>
<P>
"Nations and civilizations should respect each other, but
before that they should gain a thorough knowledge of each others'
cultures," he said, adding that the real face of Iran should be
introduced to the world and "I am delighted about being in Iran
and to be able to testify to the present realities in Iran."

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Industries Slow Down in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's industrial foundation
is headed toward collapse as manufacturing operation rates in some
industries plunged to as low as 40 percent, the Federation of
Korean Industries (KFI) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a report, the FKI said that the production of major
manufacturing industries have nosedived by 20 to 30 percent since
the nation signed an agreement with the International Monetary
Fund for a rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars last December,
after suffering a serious financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Operational reduction is particularly serious in auto,
machinery, electric and steel industries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The average operating rate of auto assembly plants, for
instance, has dropped from 65 percent last November to the current
42 percent, mainly because of sluggish domestic sales,
bankruptcies of spare parts suppliers and the tight liquidity
situation.
</P>
<P>
The operating rates of electric appliances, machinery and steel
industries tumbled to 60.3 percent, 69.8 percent, and 75.5 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Setbacks in factory operations are feared to weigh down the
industrial base, wiping out the potential for future economic
growth, said the federation.
</P>
<P>
The FKI proposed that the government cut interest rates, expand
trade financing, lower import duties and tax rates and advance its
budget spending to stave off a further worsening economy.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Surmounting Drugs Problem, Arduous Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is facing a serious and
complex situation in drug abuse. Despite consistent efforts, the
government has yet to surmount the crucial problem which has
rendered millions of people hooked on narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Until the late 1970s, many of the Pakistani people even did not
know what heroin was. However, since then, the drug abuse
situation in this South Asian nation has been increasingly serious
mainly because of the long-running war in neighboring Afghanistan
and poppy production in tribal areas.
</P>
<P>
Official data suggest that in the early 1980's only a very
small number of people, who already addicted to hashish, took
heroin just for entertainment. The drug abuse has now become a
problem of national importance.
</P>
<P>
Media reports suggest that more than half of the total drug
production worldwide is smuggled from Pakistan and Afghanistan to
Europe, Middle East and northern America, while the rest comes
from the well-known "Golden Triangle".
</P>
<P>
Official studies show that heroin is being processed from opium
by the local tribesmen living in Pakistan's Federal Administered
Tribal Areas (FATA).
</P>
<P>
"Opium extracted from poppy is processed and converted into
heroin powder at make-shift laboratories and then marketed ," said
an official attached to the Pakistan Narcotics Control Board
(PNCB).
</P>
<P>
Sources from PNCB's regional office in Peshawar, capital of
North West Frontier Province (NWFP), said that cultivation of
poppy got boosted in tribal areas as well in some districts of
NWFP throughout the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
There had been a record bumper poppy crop in the mid 1980s with
a cultivated area of 80,000 acres in Gadoon Amazai, Malakand,
Buner, Dir, Kaladhaka and Mohmond and Bajaur agencies in tribal
areas.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pakistani government, under the pressure both from
home and abroad, has actively intervened for the last several
years and enforced a ban on cultivation of poppy which has
resulted in a significant decrease.
</P>
<P>
And these measures are supplemented by checking smuggling of
heroin and rehabilitation of drug addicts all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign countries as well as the United Nations
Drugs Control Program have been providing financial assistance for
Pakistan's poppy growing areas in the settled districts of NWFP
and FATA to enable farmers to look for substitute means of
income.
</P>
<P>
And various international aid programs have helped the
Pakistani government create more job opportunities for the local
residents and provide funding to development schemes ranging from
agriculture sector to communication.
</P>
<P>
With the strict enforcement of the ban on poppy cultivation,
people of Gadoon Amazai and adjoining areas have abandoned
cultivation of poppy crop.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no poppy crop in Gadoon Amazai area since the
inception of the development projects," said Ghafoor Jadoon, local
representative elected to the Provincial Assembly of the NWFP.
</P>
<P>
The government has also beefed up its measures to check
smuggling of contraband drugs including heroin and hashish.
</P>
<P>
It has set up an Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) comprising
personnel from the Pakistani Army in addition to the police and
customs squads.
</P>
<P>
ANF has been assigned dual responsibility including combating
smuggling and detecting assets accumulated from drug money. It is
actively trying to detect the assets of smugglers in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In addition to these steps, dozens of smugglers have been
arrested and tons of drugs have been seized by the ANF regional
office in Peshawar this year.
</P>
<P>
The Peshawar office of ANF, headed by Brigadier Behramand Shah,
seized 2050 kilograms of hashish and 43 kilograms of heroin
carried on two vehicles late last month and arrested the
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the worst victims of the drugs business are
the Pakistani youths aged between 20 to 35. The existing treatment
and rehabilitation centers do not match the increasing number of
addicts in the country.
</P>
<P>
Only a few government hospitals with limited capacity offer
treatment facilities to the drug-ridden youths.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the number of drug addicts in Pakistan is
likely to grow and the drug abuse situation will remain serious
until poppy cultivation is banned and production of heroin and
hashish stopped in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Considering of Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan, who will fight
against the Indiana Pacers with all his talent and courage in Game
7 of the Eastern Conference finals late today at United Centre,
said his retirement is a certain thing.
</P>
<P>
"That is certainly a thought," said the 35-year-old. "But
before that, we're going to win Game 7. I haven't played in a Game
7 in six years. You've got to start focusing on that and let that
slide off your back. You've got to laugh and let it go."
</P>
<P>
If the Bulls lose the showdown, the battle might be the final
game for the NBA greatest hero.
</P>
<P>
It's perhaps the ultimate testament to the greatness of Jordan
and the Bulls that they almost never find themselves on the brink
of elimination, deadlocked with everything riding on one game.
</P>
<P>
To presume the Bulls will win Sunday game means ignoring that
Indiana has won three out of the last four games in this series.
It would ignore Jordan tripping over Derrick McKey's foot in the
dying seconds Friday night, or missing two jumpers in the final
minute.
</P>
<P>
But the Pacers should get nervous when they fight at United
Center, where they have lost three straight games in the series.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get to the next round," said Jordan. "We don't
have time to think about dynasties and everything else. I'm
looking forward to the challenge. If you had your choice, you'd
rather have it another way. In situations where our backs have
been against the wall, I think we've showed that we can conquer
the situation."
</P>
<P>
But the Bulls reserve guard Jud Buechler voiced out everyone's
inner fear. "I'm sure it has entered everyone's mind that this
could be Michael's last game, Scottie's last in a Bull's uniform."
</P>
<P>
The showdown is more important for Jordan than for anyone
else. It is a stage set only for him.

<HEADLINE> Moller Scores Late to Give Germany Bronze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Inga Moller scored eight minutes
from time to help Germany seal a 3-2 win over Argentina to take
the World Cup bronze medal on Sunday at Utrecht, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Argentina failed to convert a number of chances to wrap up the
match in the first half, and only to take only one at the end of
the half when center forward Vanina Oneto was in like a flash to
lift in a corner rebound.
</P>
<P>
Karin Kauschke equalized in the fourth minute of the second
half with a reverse sweep shot through a crowd of players before
Tanya Dickenscheid scored at the left post to keep Germany ahead.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, Oneto equalised with her second goal for
Argentina after Maria Rognoni's corner shot was deflected.
</P>
<P>
Argentina then had a good chance to go ahead only for Keller
to split their defence and allow Moller to round the Argentine
goalkeeper and score the winner from a narrow angle.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Celebrates International Children's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Three thousand pre-school children
from across the country gathered at the Tian'anmen Square in
central Beijing today to celebrate International Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
They performed exercises designed specially for pre-school
children to celebrate their own festival.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the performance, 4,000 pigeons which symbolize peace
and happiness were released to fly into the sky.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the gathering were senior officials from
the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), the China Committee on Caring for the Younger
Generation and All-China Sports Federation, including Sun Fuling,
Wan Guoquan, Lei Jieqiong and Wu Shaozu.
</P>
<P>
An official from the China Committee for Caring for the Younger
Generation said that the committee has developed the setting-up
exercises, which were performed today at the Tian'anmen Square, to
help keep Chinese children fit and improve their overall quality.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in Chinese cities, about 10 percent of
children under the age of six years are fatter than normal, and
that there are many children of the same age who are slimmer than
normal.
</P>
<P>
In 15 series, the exercises reportedly accord with the

<HEADLINE> Number Of Handicapped Poor Chinese Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The number of poverty-stricken
handicapped population in China has declined in the last two
decades, thanks to great efforts of the government to assist
the poor.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, the figure stood at 13.72 million, 22.87
percent of the country's total handicapped people and 27.4 percent
of all people below the poverty line. There were 17 million
disabled poor people in China at the end of 1976.
</P>
<P>
The figures were provided by the China Federation of
Handicapped People. A latest survey on the issue was conducted by
local federations of the disabled between last November and March
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the investigation, at the end of last year, China
had 10.59 million poor families with handicapped members. Of them,
7.78 million are able to have enough food and clothing by
joining in government-funded development projects or finding a job
on their own.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.8 million of these families, whose members are unable to
feed themselves, have to live on government relief programs.
</P>
<P>
Of the present 13.72 million poor handicapped people, 87.9
percent live in rural areas and 91.3 percent in underdeveloped
central and western regions.

<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Twelve academicians of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE)
accepted invitations to be science and technology tutors for the
Chinese capital's one million primary and middle school students.
</P>
<P>
The name-list of the academicians, including Wang Daheng and
Zhu Guangya, president of CAE, was published today at a ceremony
to mark the founding of Beijing Jinpeng Science and Technology
Group.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese scientists have noted that Chinese primary and
middle school students will find it hard to meet scientific and
technological competition of the next century as they are poor at
practical ability and lack knowledge of subjects other than
school-run courses.
</P>
<P>
The founding of the Beijing Jinpeng Science and Technology
Group, which includes ten sub-groups in astronomy, biological
engineering, electronics, aviation and space science, computer and
environmental protection and other areas, marks a major move of
the Chinese capital to raise the quality of students.

<HEADLINE> Good U.S.-China Relations in Interest of Both: Brzezinski </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A constructive strategic
partnership between the United States and China is of importance
not only to regional stability in Asia but also to global
stability as a whole, says former U.S. National Security Adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski.
</P>
<P>
Brzezinski, who is now a senior adviser at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's visit to the U.S. last fall generated a
significant improvement, both in the atmospherics and in the
substance of U.S.-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
"There is strong recognition on both sides that good relations
are in the interest of each of the two parties," Brzezinski said
in a recent written interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Frequent and regular American-Chinese dialogue on strategic
issues is necessary so that the two countries are able to consult
one another on matters of general as well as specific interest,"
said Brzezinski, who served as national security adviser to
President Carter.
</P>
<P>
"Both countries share an interest in resolving conflicting
issues, though disagreements and different perspectives on some of
them are inherent both in history and in the different
geopolitical settings in which the two countries respectively
operate, " he said. In addition to discussing these issues in a
constructive fashion, it is desirable to expand the scope of
concrete cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"One very specific step to advance that goal would be to
include China in the annual meeting of the G-7, which has recently
been expanded to G-8, " Brzezinski said, adding, "China is
certainly qualified, in every respect, to be a member of that
group, given its present composition."
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on how to enhance mutual
understanding, Brzezinski said, "Mutual understanding can be best
advanced by more frequent contacts not only between the
governments of the two countries but also between their societies
as a whole."
</P>
<P>
To be truly constructive, such contacts must be unhindered by
any form of official impediments and should be as wide-ranging as
possible, he said. In the age of global communications and growing
economic interdependence, any effort to impose a specific
doctrinal perspective is bound to be counterproductive to a good
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Talking about China's role in regional and world affairs,
Brzezinski said China is clearly a source of stability in the Far
East and that greatly enhances the important role that China plays
in the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
"The present financial and economic crisis in some Asian
countries further underlines the stabilizing role of China, and
American-Chinese relations should be designed to further
consolidate that stabilizing role," Brzezinski said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Criteria for research activities
was announced today by the Chinese Academy of Engineering, with
academicians asked not to use their titles for the commercial
purpose.
</P>
<P>
The criteria require academicians not to become involved in any
kind of commercial advertisements by receiving free gifts, and
"when necessary, a state should be made."
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the criteria, all the academicians should
cherish the purity of their titles and set an example for others
to fellow through their good behaviors.
</P>
<P>
The criteria also stress that citations and sources must be
mentioned clearly in papers of academicians if their studies are
based on previous studies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences, another top science and
technology research institute in China, set up a moral committee
for scientific research in 1996, in an effort to check unhealthy
academic tendencies.
</P>
<P>
In June of 1997, when Chen Minheng, an academician of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences working for the East China Science and
Technology University, was found plagiarism, two investigations
were conducted soon.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Chen was asked to stop using his title as an
academy during the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Chen was asked to made a self-criticism to examine
his mistakes.

<HEADLINE> One Third Of Urban Smokers Prefer Foreign Brands </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A latest survey shows that 30.8
percent of urban Chinese smokers prefer foreign-brand cigarettes
than local brands, and moreover, 21.1 percent of them smoke
foreign cigarettes only.

<HEADLINE> China Intensifies Ban on Smoking in Public Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A total of 79 provinces and cities
in China have formulated regulations banning smoking in public
places, a senior Chinese health official announced today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenkang, minister of Health, made the announcement in a
written speech marking the 11th "World No Tobacco Day", which
falls on today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that provinces and cities which have formulated
smoking-ban regulations include the provinces of Shanxi, Jilin,
Shandong, Jiangxi and Fujian, the municipalities of Beijing,
Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing, and 70 provincial capitals such
as Guangzhou and Wuhan, as well as medium- and small-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
China has about 320 million smokers. A survey shows that over
90 percent of smokers smoke in public places.
</P>
<P>
Since smoking in a public place causes serious secondary
smoking and has a bad impact on youngsters, China has taken the ban
on smoking in public places as a key part of the ban on smoking in
public places in its anti-smoking effort.
</P>
<P>
A regulation banning smoking in public transport means and
waiting areas was enacted in last May.
</P>
<P>
However, these "smoking-control" cities only account for
one-eighth of all the country's cities, according to an official
with the National Committee for Patriotic Health campaign (NCPHC),
who described it as a "long-term and arduous" task to promote work
in this regard in all cities.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ming with the NCPHC said that the rapid development of the
country's tobacco industry in recent years has resulted in a
substantial increase in the number of smokers.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that the ratio of adolescent and youth smokers
in the age group of 15-25 increased by six percentage points in
1996 over 1984, and the average age for smoking the first
cigarette moved to 19.7 from 22.4.
</P>
<P>
However, Lu pointed out, China's efforts to control smoking is
gaining increasing support from both smokers and non-smokers.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey, 84 percent of the smokers and 89 percent
of the non-smokers have become aware of the hazard caused by
smoking to health. Meanwhile, 74 percent of the correspondents
support government's effort to ban smoking in public places.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Committee for Patriotic Health Campaign
awarded today a group of "smoking-free" schools and a group of
educators who have done a good job in promoting smoking-control
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Activities to publicize the knowledge that smoking is hazardous
 to health and keeping youngsters away from cigarettes were also
conducted in busy commercial districts in the Chinese capital
today.

<HEADLINE> China Orders Clear Indication of Cigarette Tar Content </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The administrative body of China's
tobacco industry will soon order domestic manufacturers to
indicate cigarette tar contents with accurate figures.
</P>
<P>
The industry also planned to reduce the average content of tar
to less than 15 milligram per cigarette by the year 2000, compared
with some 18 mg at present.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Tobacco Monoply Bureau (STMB)
confirmed the news today, the World No-Tobacco Day when
anti-smoking campaigners raised their voices to warn people,
whether smoking or not, of harms related with smoking cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
"We've decided to implement the order as of July 1, 1998. The
figure of tar contents must be as accurate as to one place of
decimals," Yu Minfang told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
She said consumers were often confused by inaccurate
indications of tar contents on some cigarette cases, which only
read "high", "medium" or "low".
</P>
<P>
Tar in tobacco has long been blamed as a major material to
damage human health, such as leading to cancers.
</P>
<P>
The average tar content has been reduced below 12 mg per
cigarette in many industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
There are only a small number of low-tar cigarettes among some
2,000 brands of Chinese tobacco products. The "medium-tar"
cigarettes, containing about 18 gm of tar each, are popular in
China.
</P>
<P>
But in fact, China's tobacco manufacturers have increased
development and production of low-tar cigarettes under the
pressure from the anti-smoking campaign and increasing fierce
competition from foreign tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
The STMB's decision received a positive response from the China
Association on Tobacco or Health, the leader of the country's
anti-smoking campaign.
</P>
<P>
"China has 320 million smokers, and it's not realistic to ask
them to quit smoking overnight," said Prof. Zhang Yifang, vice
president of the association.
</P>
<P>
"To a certain extent, reducing tar contents may help reduce
health risks caused by smoking," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Over 80 African children happily
attended a painting competition on the lawn at the Embassy of the
Republic of Congo in Beijing this afternoon to celebrate the
forthcoming International Children's Day and the African Day
which fell on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Many of the kids drew the paradises they have in mind with
unfettered imagination. Most of the paradises are characteristic
of the Africa-styled houses on the African continent. "I love
drawing houses because my home is a sweet home," said one kid from
Libya. " I hope all homes in Africa are peaceful," a girl from the
Republic of Congo said in answering why she painted so many
beautiful houses.
</P>
<P>
The competition, the first of its kind, was organized by the
African Association of Beijing, which "is aimed at promoting
exchanges and friendship within African community in Beijing and
with people of other countries," said M.Adil Embarch, chairman of
the African Association of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"After experiences are gained from this competition, a second
one will be held next year in which children from outside Africa
will be invited," pledged Embarch, who is also first secretary of
the Moroccan embassy in China.

<HEADLINE> Blatter Promises Asia Extra Spots for 2002 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Five places at least will be
alloted to Asia at the 2002 World Cup finals, FIFA presidential
candidate Blatter said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA general secretary insisted that it has already been
agreed that Asia will get extra places in the first World Cup
finals in Asia though he was on the final stretch of an arduous
presidential campaign prior to the vote next week.
</P>
<P>
Japan and South Korea, who will co-host the 2002 World Cup
finals, will get automatic places. But Asia will also get at
least three other guaranteed places, as it did for the World Cup
in France and a playoff chance for another country.
</P>
<P>
Blatter added that it was possible Asia could get a fourth
guaranteed spot in 2002 "and possibly more" if Iran, Japan, Saudi
Arabia and South Korea displayed good performances at this year's
finals.
</P>
<P>
Blatter also implied that Europe was likely to have to give up
one of its spots in four years time. But it was also clear that
the battle is not yet over.
</P>
<P>
Blatter is just over a week away from the FIFA presidential
vote in Paris on June 8 when he will be up against UEFA leader
Lennart Johansson in the vote to succeed Joao Havelange.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss official was in Beijing on Saturday lobbying the
Chinese Football Association's vote. He was to return to Zurich on
Sunday before flying off again to West Africa for a final round of
campaigning.

WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Drug enforcement officials say that the seizure of 4,000
pounds of cocaine from a pleasure boat in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida, was another indication that after concentrating on other
routes in the 1980's and 1990's, Colombian drug traffickers are
returning with renewed intensity to the familiar routes between
the Bahamas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
-- Pakistan said it had exploded another nuclear test device,
spurning worldwide criticism and calls for restraint after its
tests two days ago. But the Government also said that Pakistan was
ready to "talk peace" with India and that "it is not our purpose
to enter into an arms race."
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Anthony A. Williams said yesterday that he will resign as
Washington, D.C.'s chief financial officer to run for mayor. The
surprise move shakes up the District's mayoral campaign by pitting
the bow-tied, professional manager, who has been a central figure
in the city's financial recovery, against three D.C. Council
members.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton took aim Saturday at a controversial
school prayer measure likely to be voted on in the House this
week, saying there was no reason to amend the Constitution to
protect religious freedom in the schools.

<HEADLINE> Mutiny Ends in Niger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Niger's Republican guardsmen have
ended a mutiny over back pay and set free a senior officer they
took hostage, a report from Niger's capital Niamey said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara's personal chief of staff
Colonel Hamadou Moussa Gros was quoted as telling state radio
late Saturday that the grumbling guardsmen had agreed with an
order from Mainassara to end the revolt.
</P>
<P>
Regular forces in armored cars remained visible around the
central camp in Niamey, capital of the western African state
where the mutiny erupted, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
"The orders given by the president of the republic have just
been carried out to the letter," Gros said, adding that
Mainassara had congratulated the guardsmen for recognizing that
discipline was paramount for anyone in uniform.
</P>
<P>
Regular forces in the French-speaking country had encircled
the camp and given the guardsmen an ultimatum to free their
hostage or face the use of force. there were no reports of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
A number of mutinies rocked barracks elsewhere in Niger in
February over unpaid wages. Niamey settled those protests with
partial payments.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Guard ensures the security of state
institutions in the former French colony which has an area of
1,267,000 square kilometers with a population of more than eight
million.
</P>
<P>
The government, weighed down by debt and struggling to make
ends meet, owes its 40,000 civil servants around six months'
salary.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Enters French Open Quarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- World top player Martina Hingis
became the first to reach the quarter-finals of the French Open on
Sunday when she beat Israel's Anna Smashnova 6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Swiss sealed her fourth round match in one
hour, moving closer to claiming the grand slam title that she has
yet to win.
</P>
<P>
Despite being ranked 102th in the world, Smashnova, 21, had
some great marks under her credit by reaching the fourth round
here three years ago and winning claycourt tournaments in Athens
and Cardiff this year.
</P>
<P>
But Hingis, who lost last year's final to Croatian Iva Majoli,
posed as a too much obstacle for the Israeli with winners at will
from the baseline.
</P>
<P>
"She's playing unbelievable, I just couldn't keep up," said
Smashnova. "She doesn't give you anything, she's just on another
level."
</P>
<P>
For Hingis, she has breezed through her first four matches in
straight sets, surrendering only 14 games.

<HEADLINE> 12 Police Hurt As Riot Erupts In N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) - Northern Ireland was hit by some of
its worst street violence in more than two years Saturday night as
a 400-strong crowd went on the rampage, according to news from
Portadown, Co Armagh, early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Twelve police officers and three civilians were hurt in a hail
of stones, bottles and petrol bombs in the flashpoint area of
Portadown.
</P>
<P>
The rioting began after nationalists objected to a parade by
the junior orange Order. Petrol and paint bombs, and stones and
bottles were thrown at police, and troops moved in to separate the
rivals.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Ulster Constabulary fired plastic bullets to beat
back the rioting mob coming from the mainly Nationalist housing
estate which was objecting to an attempt by some Loyalists to move
down the road.
</P>
<P>
Police said the junior Orange march involving children up to
the age of 15 had passed off peacefully and was breaking up when
the violence erupted.
</P>
<P>
An RUC spokesman said,"It is the most serious rioting we have
had for a very long time and it is difficult to establish what
sparked it off."
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the violence is a blow to
those who heralded last week's referendum in favor of a new
assembly for Northern Ireland as a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Pressure on the Sinn Fein and the Republican movement has been
stepped up recently when unionists renewed their demands for the
decommissioning of weapons.

WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Unbeaten Michael Grant succeeded
in defending his IBC heavyweight title on Saturday night by
parlaying a late style adjustment into a ninth-round victory over
Obed Sullivan.
</P>

Grant floored Sullivan midway through the round with a
combination of punches highlighted by three jabs, a left hook and
a straight right, and finished the title defense with a series of
unanswered punches that prompted referee Tony Orlando to stop the
scheduled 12-round bout at 2:16 of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Grant, 25, improved to 28-0 with 20 knockouts, and Sullivan,
30, fell to 29-3-1 with 20 knockouts.

TOKYO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Liu Xuan, Zhang Jingjin and Li
Xiaopeng awarded three gold medals for China at the Gymnastics
World Cup finals in Sabae on Sunday.
</P>

medal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm at the level that I can win the gold medal and I
gave 100 percent today. I didn't feel any pressure since our
athletes are at the top level in the world," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The other gold medals for China were through Zhang Jingjin and
Li Xiaopeng in the men's parallel bars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> British Minister Defends Sinn Fein Party Invitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam
on Sunday defended her decision to invite Sinn Fein leaders to a
Northern Ireland garden party at which Prince Charles will be
guest of honor.
</P>
<P>
Inviting them had been part of the peace process in Northern
Ireland because Sinn Fein had signed up to the peace agreement,
Mowlam told BBC TV.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness have not
said if they will attend the garden party, but Mowlam ensured
personally that if Adams and McGuinness do come to the party, they
would not come face-to-face with Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
"There is doubt whether they will. They are Republicans, they
are not supporters of the monarchy. But if they come, it will be I
that will escort the royal round and I will make very sure who he
meets," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I would not have put them at the garden party in a position
where they would meet Sinn Fein. I have met too many families of
victims -- and the Royal Family in that sense with the death of
Mountbatten are a family that has suffered -- and I wouldn't put
them in that position."
</P>
<P>
Lord Mountbatten, the great uncle of Prince Charles, was killed
with three others, including his 14-year-old grandson, when his
boat was blown up while he was holidaying in the Irish Republic in
1979.
</P>
<P>
The garden party at Hillsborough Castle is one of the major
social events of the year in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The decision to invite the meeting between Adams and Charles,
however, sparked outrage from opposition politicians in Britain
and from Protestant Unionists who said Mowlam was being
insensitive.

<HEADLINE> 11 Injured as Violence Mars Jewish Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were injured in
clashes between ultra-Orthodox Jews and Palestinians Sunday in
East Jerusalem as violence marred the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.
</P>
<P>
The clashes broke out as Orthodox Jews passed by the Muslim
Quarter of the Old City after ending their morning prayer at the
Western Wall to celebrate Shavuot, the Jewish festival commemorating
the obtaining of Torah (Five Law Books of Moses) on Mount Sinai
and marking the start of the harvest season.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted witnesses as saying that Palestinian
residents began the fight by throwing stones at the prayers
and the incident quickly developed into a massive scuffling and
stone throwing. Israeli policemen were also attacked when they
intervened to break up the melee.
</P>
<P>
Four Jews, four Palestinians and three Israeli policemen
were lightly injured and three Palestinian cars damaged in the
clashes, the radio said. Four Palestinian youths were detained
for questioning.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the morning, dozens of Israeli police were
deployed at the Western Wall to prevent confrontation between
Orthodox and Conservative Jews as happened last year on Shavuot,
one of three Jewish pilgrimage festivals beginning on Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Flights from British airports are
slowly returning to normal on Sunday after thousands of travelers
faced delays because of a strike by Spanish air traffic
controllers.
</P>
<P>
At Gatwick airport in London, there was an average delay of up
to three hours on flights to Spain or to destinations such as the
United States or Portugal with routes through Spanish airspace.
</P>
<P>
Worst-hit was thought to be Glasgow city airport in Scotland,
where 1,000 passengers were stranded waiting to board holiday
flights as the Spanish ended their strike, but then began a
work-to-rule.
</P>
<P>
Passengers were asked to check in as normal, but were warned
they could be delayed between two and nine hours.
</P>
<P>
At Manchester Airport, more than 2,000 people were forced to
spend weekend night camped down. One flight was held up by 14
hours.
</P>
<P>
The strike has also affected homeward-bound British holiday
makers, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Street Violence Hits Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) - Northern Ireland was hit on Saturday
night by some of its worst street violence in more than two years
as a 400-strong crowd went on the rampage, said reports from
Portadown, Co Armagh.
</P>
<P>
Twelve police officers and three civilians were hurt in a hail
of stones, bottles and petrol bombs in the flashpoint area of
Portadown.
</P>
<P>
The rioting began after nationalists objected to a parade by
the junior orange order. Petrol and paint bombs, and stones and
bottles were thrown at police, and troops moved in to separate the
rivals.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) fired plastic bullets to
beat back the rioting mob coming from the mainly Nationalist
housing estate which was objecting to an attempt by some Loyalists
to move down the road.
</P>
<P>
A RUC spokesman said "it is the most serious rioting we have
had for a very long time and it is difficult to establish what
sparked it off."
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the violence is a blow to
those who hailed last week's referendum in favor of a new assembly
for Northern Ireland as a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Pressure on the Sinn Fein and the Republican movement has been
stepped up recently when unionists renewed their demands for the
decommissioning of weapons.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Industry Grows in First Five Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial production grew
by 12.7 percent to about 4.58 billion U.S. dollars in the first
five months of this year from that of the same period last year,
official statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
But in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's industrial hub, industrial
production grew by just 5.9 percent, about half that for the first
five months of last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that it will be very difficult to meet this
year's industrial growth target of 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnam Economic Times" said inefficiency, outdated
equipment and a chronic lack of capital to upgrade technology are
the major reasons for the slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the industrial sector's capital comes from
loans and this is aggravating the difficulties, especially as the
prices for industrial goods was lower than anticipated, according
to the weekly magazine.

ISLAMABAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people were feared
dead Sunday after a strong earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter
scale jolted northeastern Afghanistan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Sunday from the Afghan capital of Kabul

<HEADLINE> Arafat Concludes Visit to UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat left here Sunday morning after reaching an agreement with
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) leaders on holding an expanded Arab
summit in view of the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay here, Arafat held talks with UAE
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan on the latest
developments in the Arab arena and the prospects of convening an
Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed sources here, the Palestinians
accept the convocation of a mini Arab summit as a preliminary step
for an expanded one, provided that all Arab parties concerned with
the peace process take part in the mini summit.
</P>
<P>
These parties are Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), Jordan, Egypt as well as certain countries in the
Arab Gulf and the Arab Maghreb Union.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Maghreb Union groups Algeria, Libya, Mauritania,
Morocco and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, an Arab diplomatic source in Riyadh has
ruled out the prospects of convening of a tripartite summit of
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria before an expanded Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
He said that convening a mini Arab summit without the
participation of the PNA would be tantamount to departing the
summit from its prime objective and real meaning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, well-informed Palestinian sources said that Arafat
will proceed Wednesday to Muscat to discuss with Omani Sultan
Qaboos Bin Said the convening of an Arab summit, and will also
visit Qatar for the same purpose.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Stance on Missiles Remains Firm: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides has reiterated that his government's decision to deploy
Russian anti-aircraft missiles remains firm unless the reasons
for which they were ordered are eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters Saturday night upon his return from his
visits to Dublin and Athens, Kasoulides said "if the reasons which
have forced us to feel the need to order the missiles persist to
exist, then we have no other choice but to bring in the missiles."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government ordered the Russian-made surface-to-air
S-300 missile system in January 1997, which is expected to be
deployed here later this year.
</P>
<P>
The deal has met strong opposition from Turkey, which has
threatened to destroy the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides argued that the people of Cyprus are facing security
dangers from the Turkish air force.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third in the aftermath of afailed pro-Athens c
oup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained around 40,000 troops in northern Cyprus,
which was declared unilaterally in 1983 by Turkish Cypriots as
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
"Had we been engaged in productive talks which would have
paved the way to peace or had we clinched an agreement on the
demilitarization of Cyprus, then we would reconsider our decision
to deploy the missiles," the foreign minister reiterated.
</P>
<P>
He said President Glafcos Clerides proposed, during last
summer's U.N.-led talks, to the Turkish Cypriot leader "to enter
a dialog with a view to reduce forces and armaments and prohibit
the import of new weapons as part of a plan for the
demilitarization of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Clerides put forward to the U.N. Secretary-General in December
1993 a proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus, providing for
the disbanding of the Greek Cypriot National Guard and the Turkish
Cypriot armed forces and the simultaneous withdrawal of the
Turkish forces in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his talks in Athens, Kasoulides said his
discussion with his Greek counterpart, Theodoros Pangalos focused
on a review of developments in Cyprus, especially after a visit
here of U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke early this month.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased with the understanding that exists between
the Cypriot and the Greek governments," Kasoulides added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Enters Second Round of Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon started Sunday morning the
second round of its first municipal and mayoral elections in 35
years.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese interior ministry stationed armored personnel carriers
mounted with machine guns at key intersections and deployed troops
outside the polling stations for fear of the violence and unrest
which the country had suffered during the 15-year-old sectarian
civil war.
</P>
<P>
The voting started at 7:00 a.m. local time (4:00 a.m. GMT) and
will close at 5:00 p.m. (1400 GMT) in the North Lebanon
governorate where politicians said there will be no competition as
sharp as in the first round of elections in Mount Lebanon, the
country's central province.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of elections, right-wing Christian groups,
which oppose the Syrian presence and its 40,000 troops in
Lebanon, swept to victory in some parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Lebanese Christians, nearly counting
for the country's half population, to take part in the elections
after the civil war. They boycotted parliamentary elections in
1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, won in its
stronghold in Beirut's southern suburbs, defeating an alliance
formed by its rival Shiite Muslim Amal Movement led by Parliament
Speaker Nabih Berri and candidates backed Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri.
</P>
<P>
As no security problem took place in the first round of
elections, in which turnout reached as much as 80 percent,
Lebanon's top leaders had expressed confidence in the following
polls in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats here said it is still early to forecast the
success of the whole elections as the fiercest race has not come
in the capital of Beirut where has nearly half of the country's
population.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,662 members for 646 municipals councils, and 2,041
mayors and chiefs in 1,282 towns and villages will be finally
elected in the polls, which started on May 24 and will continue on
the following two Sundays.

<P>
XINING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- China recently successfully launched
the second massive artificial rainfall on the upper reaches of the
Yellow River in an effort to save it from drying up.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the water flow dramatically reduced on the upper
reaches of the Yellow River in Qinghai province, posing a threat
to local economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Between the end of April and September of 1997, Qinghai,
located at the source of the Yellow River, invested one million
yuan (120,480 US dollars) in launching the first artificial
rainfall on the upper reaches, bringing 180 million to 280 million
cubic meters of water to the river.
</P>
<P>
The operation was done in an area about 4,000 meters above sea
level where marshland is abundant.
</P>
<P>
The second operation involved a total investment of eight
million yuan from both the central and regional governments. It is
learned artificial rain will be made on the river every year in
the coming three years.

SHANGHAI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that the
industrial climate in east China's Shanghai municipality, a
leading manufacturing base in the country, improved significantly
in the second quarter of this year.

<P>
More than half of the industrial firms said that the
macro-economic environment and their operation conditions are
good, according to the survey conducted by the Shanghai
Information Center, said.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed the improvement to more orders, larger
output and abundant supply of energy and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The survey also noted that sectors such as tobacco, textile and
garment enjoyed improvement in the operational climate, while the
food processing and printing businesses are still in a cloudy
climate.
</P>
<P>
This also indicated that the municipal industrial firms are
confident with the set economic growth target, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey admitted that many manufacturing firms still face
serious fund shortage problems.

<HEADLINE> Vicious Flu Virus Hits S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- An extremely vicious
influenza virus is sweeping through South Africa, increasing
intakes at hospitals and clinics, forcing some schools to close
and hitting industry with high percentage of absenteeism.
</P>
<P>
While it has been difficult to get figures of the affected,
experts confirm that large numbers are in sick beds.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of flu has led to a sharp drop in blood supplies
at the South African Blood Transfusion Service (SABTS) because
many donors have fallen ill, according to the City Press weekly
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, SABTS received only 6,000 units, only
half of the 12,000 units it would normally have received.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted SABTS spokesman Diane de Coning as saying
that flu has disabled many regular donors and the agency is
appealing to healthy people to donate blood.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts have warned that the flu, although not
dangerous in itself, could lead to life-threatening complications
such as pneumonia.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Explores Trade Prospects in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian businessmen
are exploring trade opportunities in their neighboring country,
the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
A Tanzanian trade delegation will travel to Congo (K) during
June 8-15 to explore trade prospects there, said Mbarouk
Mwandoro, director general of the Board of External Trade (BET).
</P>
<P>
The delegation will visit Lubumbashi, a major business center
in southwest Congo (K), where a mini-exhibition will be staged
for four days.
</P>
<P>
Visits to other towns, including Mbujimayi, Kalemie, and
Bukavu will also be arranged by the BET in collaboration with the
Katanga Chamber of Commerce, Mbarouk said, according to a local
press report. But the report did not say when Mbarouk made the
remarks.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanians will display goods and services and establish
further contact with their Congolese counterparts, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sunday Observer, the BET will arrange a
meeting for the business community in Dar es Salaam Monday to
discuss how to benefit most from the visit.
</P>
<P>
The BET chief said the tour to Congo (K) follows findings and
recommendations of a mission which visited Lubumbashi in early
February this year to explore trade prospects there.
</P>
<P>
He said the mission concluded that Tanzania has very good
trade prospects with Congo (K), particularly in the eastern and
southern parts of the central African country where Kiswahili,
Tanzania's national language, is widely spoken.
</P>
<P>
The BET chief said the trade prospect between Tanzania and
Congo (K) is bright with the improvement of transport and
communication links between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), Zambia
Railways and Congolese Railways signed an agreement in February
to accelerate the transportation of imported and exported goods
of Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tanzania Central Freight Bureau has signed a
cooperation agreement with the Congo (K)'s Office for Maritime
Freight Management to jointly handle Congolese exports and
imports passing through Dar es Salaam port.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Air Tanzania introduced twice-weekly
flights to Lubumbashi to speed up the movement of passengers and
cargo between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> SAARC to Increase Cooperation in Education, Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The fifth meeting of the SAARC
Technical Committee on Education, Culture and Sports envisaged
several programs to promote cooperation in this regard among
members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC).
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held on May 26 and 27 in Thimphu, capital of
Bhutan, worked out a calendar of activities for 1999 and also
identified some activities to be funded under the SAARC-Japan
Special Fund, the Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat said in a
press release Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reviewed the progress made in seven priority areas
including education, networking arrangements for sharing
information on mass literacy programs, preparation of an anthology
of short stories of the SAARC region and joint production of
books, audio and visual cassettes, the secretariat noted.
</P>
<P>
It said the meeting submitted a proposal for the implementation
of an SAARC chairs, fellowships and scholarships scheme.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC leaders directed at their second summit in November
1986 that action be taken for an early institution of SAARC
chairs, fellowships and scholarships to promote increasing
cross-fertilization of ideas through greater interaction among
students, scholars and academics in the SAARC countries.
</P>
<P>
The technical committee also decided that Pakistan will prepare
a concept paper to create a consortium of open universities in the
region.
</P>
<P>
So far, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh have such
universities in the region and Nepal is in the process of
establishing them.
</P>
<P>
During their ninth summit held in May 1997 in Male, the
Maldives, the SAARC leaders recognized the constraints in
resource, manpower and infrastructure to the promotion of
vocational and higher education in the region.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the possibility of the creation of a
consortium of open universities in the region should be explored,
noting that new and innovative methods like open learning and
distance education can play an effective role in meeting regional
needs in a cost-effective and flexible manner.
</P>
<P>
A tour program by ship for youth of the SAARC countries under
the title SAARC-Ship was also envisaged at the meeting of the
technical committee, the SAARC Secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC, formed in December 1985, has seven member countries
including Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka. Under it are 11 technical committees responsible
for formulating programs and preparing projects in their
respective fields.

<HEADLINE> United States Ties Scotland in Warm-up (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States showed they
were well tuned-up for the World Cup finals by fighting a goalless
match against Scotland in a warm-up here Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
After calling back all the starters, U.S. coach Steve Sampson
tried a new system that organized the 10 field players into three
defenders, six midfielders and one forward.
</P>
<P>
The formation worked well. Supported by a packed yelling crowd
of nearly 30,000, the Americans dominated the field from the first
whistle, pressing all-out and created several scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
But its seemed that they still need to polish their shooting
skills in front of the goalmouth.
</P>
<P>
Scotland also lost a good chance to score in the 58th minute
when Kevin Gallacher got a clear pass and found nobody in front of
him but the goalkeeper to beat, however, the striker's flat shot
was blocked right by Kasey Keller's left foot.
</P>
<P>
Six minutes later, Scotland's Darren Jackson was given a yellow
card for pushing. Referee Felipe Ramos of Mexico had to control
his temper after being booed again and again by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Word Cup group opponents are Germany, Yugoslavia and
Iran.

<HEADLINE> Russian Financial Crisis Eased, but Economy Unstable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Russian financial crisis started
to ease after the Russian Central Bank raised the credit interest
rates sharply twice, but the financial situation remains unstable.
</P>
<P>
As the Russian media reported on Saturday, the panic, that hit
the financial market days ago, started to die away with demand for
the U.S. dollar on the ebb and prices of long-term government
securities and corporate bonds on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The central bank bought 300 million dollars in the off-record
transactions on May 28, seen by experts as a sign of the ending of
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In mid-May, some foreign banks and companies drew loads of
capitals by dumping Russia's short-term government securities and
corporate bonds, which shocked the Russian stock market.
</P>
<P>
The following turmoil, controlled for a while after the central
bank raised the interest rates of credit and short-term
securities, deteriorateed in the past days: the return rate of the
short-term securities rose to 80 percent, the exchange rate
between the dollar and the ruble climed to 1:6.2, exceeding the
1:6.188 exchange corridor, and stock prices dropped an average of
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a desperate effort to calm the financial market and to
prevent the rubble from further depreciation, the Russian
government raised the interest rates of credit again on May 27,
from 60 percent to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Moscow has stepped up tax collection to fill the
state coffers.
</P>
<P>
These efforts won approval from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), which, in return, awards Moscow with a loan of 670 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Though the Kremlin claims that it has controlled the financial
situation, the media are not as optimistic.
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the Russian crisis seem related to the Asian
financial storms, the slipping world oil prices and the fleeing of
foreign capital, but the real reason, the media believe, lies deep
in its stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish Russian economy, though having stopped sliding,
remains burdened by foreign debts with zero growth, has largely
shattered investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
To readdress the situation, the Russian government once
promised to increase income through enhanced taxes rather than new
borrowings from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Moscow now has in hand 14 billion U.S. dollars of foreign
reserves, not enough to meet its import need for a long time. It
is widely believed that crisis might strike again at any time
unless the Russian economy starts to grow.

SHANGHAI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shanghai municipality
now has some 240 private firms which were funded by foreign
investors and another 2,500 such firms which are engaged in
export-oriented processing operations or foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that the private firms in the municipality have

firms engaged in high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has 74,000 private firms, of which, five percent
are engaged in technological undertakings. The rate doubled the

<HEADLINE> Nateq-Nouri Re-elected as Iran's Majlis Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Majlis
(Parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri was re-elected on
Sunday for another one-year term after the rival moderate faction
failed to announce a strong nominee to challenge him.
</P>
<P>
In the internal elections of the 270-seat Majlis, which was
broadcast live by Tehran radio, Nateq-Nouri secured 165 votes from
256 members of the parliament (MP) present and his rival candidate
Majid Ansari only gained 84 votes.
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh term for Nateq-Nouri as Majlis speaker since
he was elected in 1992 during the fourth Majlis elections. He was
re-elected by gaining 211 out of 243 votes last year in spite of
his disgraced failure in the May presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The pro-moderate daily Iran News reported on Sunday that the
MPs from the two rival factions held a session on Saturday and
reached an agreement over the re-election of Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
The two factions also agreed to elect Ansari, head of the
Hezbollah Assembly in the Majlis, as the second vice speaker to
replace the conservative Ali Movahedi Kermani, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
So far the result of the election of vice speakers has not been
announced.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the moderates failed to reach an
agreement on their candidate for the post of Majlis speaker due to
"the lack of harmony" within the faction. Some of the moderates
insisted to take over the speakership while others said that
Nateq-Nouri has changed his manners during the past year following
his defeat in the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Moderate MP Elyas Hazrati said last week that Nateq-Nouri's
performance in the past year was good, especially toward the
administration of President Mohammad Khatami. Nateq-Nouri
succeeded to direct the Majlis toward cooperation with the
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the Majlis internal elections, Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei received the MPs on Saturday, calling for
unity between the two rival factions.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Develop New Variety of White Clover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have succeeded
in cultivating a fine variety of white clover, making it possible
to improve grassland in south China, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
A brainchild of animal husbandry departments and the
Agricultural University of Sichuan Province, the new variety of
large-leaved white clover was tested to contain more than 25
percent of crude protein, and to yield 52,500 to 90,000 kilograms
of grass per hectare annually.
</P>
<P>
Research departments have spent 200,000 yuan on the project
since they first imported the grass seed in the 1970s, which, in
turn, have created nearly 8 billion yuan worth of economic
returns.
</P>
<P>
Tests also show that the clover can grow in subtropical zones
at an elevation of 200 to 3,500 meters, and a temperature of 37 to
-13 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
The new variety can also serve as an ornamental plant as well
as a nectar source, and is helpful for water and soil
conservation.
</P>
<P>
South China lacks of natural grassland of the bean family, and
has only 13 percent of quality grassland.

<HEADLINE> East China City Reports Rising Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Jinan, capital of Shandong Province
of east China, signed contracts with overseas investors involving
44 million U.S. dollars of overseas investment in the first four
months this year, 4.5 times the figure for the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that the actual paid-in sum of overseas
investment during the period stood at 108 million U.S. dollars, a
rise of 45.7 percent over last year's comparable figure.
</P>
<P>
Meng Jianxin, director of the Jinan Commission of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, attributed the boom in overseas
investment despite the East Asian financial crisis to the fact
that the city has changed the past practice of focusing efforts
only in attracting overseas investment to industrial processing
projects for broadening investment scope, and a list containing
municipal infrastructure, comprehensive agricultural development
and high- and new-technological projects for overseas investors
has been prepared.
</P>
<P>
Upgrading, building and transfer of operation rights of
municipal infrastructure have become popular destination of
overseas investment, the director continued to explain.
</P>
<P>
For instance, to improve water shortage in Jinan, the city will
expand three existing water plants, construct one new water plant,
replenish shortage of underground water resources by diverting the
flow of the Yellow River this year in cooperation with investors
from Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The projects require a total investment of 118 million
U.S. dollars. So far, 40 million U.S. dollars of overseas
investment have been paid in for first-phase construction.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Province had altogether approved establishment of
20,000 overseas-financed projects with contracts involving an
agreed use of 36.5 billion U.S. dollars of overseas investment by
1997. And the actual paid-in sum of overseas investment was at
20.2 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Large Soil Conservation Project Planned on Loess Plateau (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- China is to undertake its largest
environment protection project on the Loess Plateau to control
soil erosion and desertification.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is expected to be completed in three
decades, will become one of the most important bases for China's
energy and raw material production in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The short-term objective for the project is to check the
deteriorating ecological environment and to limit the area of soil
erosion and desertification on the plateau in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The next step is to make further improvement on the overall
ecological environment on the plateau by bringing more than 60
percent of soil erosion area under control.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River,
the Loess Plateau is one of the regions with worst soil erosion in
the world.
</P>
<P>
As it cuts through the plateau, the Yellow River will yearly
carry 1.6 billion tons of soil and sand to the lower valley region
of the river.
</P>
<P>
Environment experts said that the annual economic losses from
soil erosion on the plateau amounted to more than 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion is a big problem in China as a whole. Statistics
show that the total soil-erosion area in China accounts for 38.2
percent of its total land area, in addition to an annual expansion
of the erosion area of 2,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attached importance to soil erosion
control on the Loess Plateau. Since 1996, China increased funds to
water and soil conservation projects on the plateau by more than
105 million yuan a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
The water and soil protection project on the plateau also
caught the attention of international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, a water-soil conservation project funded by the World
Bank started on the plateau, which covered 23 counties in Shanxi,
Shaanxi and Gansu provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The project using a 126-million-U.S.-dollar World Bank loan
aimed to transform arable land on slopes into farmland with stable
crop yields and to raise grain output by planting trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
The project also involved building sand-breaks on nine rivers
to prevent sand from draining into the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank official who just visited the
project, the World Bank plans to arrang its second batch of loans
for the project.
</P>
<P>
Huang Ziqiang, deputy director of the Yellow River Water
Conservancy Committee, said that water and soil conservation on
the Loess Plateau has been successful.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present, China has completed water-soil
conservation works on an area covering 160,000 square kilometers
on the Loess Plateau, which accounts for 40 percent of the
soil-erosion area of the plateau.
</P>
<P>
The works, which have helped more than 10 million farmers get
sufficient food and drinking water, led to an annual increase of 4
billion kilograms of grain, to more than 8 million cubic meters of
 water in storage and to an annual reduction of 300 million tons
of sand from draining into the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
But some scientists noted that soil erosion is still serious
due to the loose structure of the soil and frequent storms on the
plateau.
</P>
<P>
You Lianyuan, a research fellow of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said that water and soil conservation works on the
plateau call for efforts of several generations and for more funds
before the ecological problems are thoroughly settled.

<P>
FUZHOU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- It may not attract one's attention
at the first sight, but the small electric mosquito swatter, a
patented product, has proved to be a hot seller on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Developed in 1994, the swatter has become a major foreign
exchange earner for the Jiuxing (nine star) Enterprise Group.
</P>
<P>
So far, the group, located in Fuzhou, Fujian province, has
exported the swatter to over 30 countries and regions in Asia,
Europe, and Africa, earning eight million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The invisible asset value of the mosquito swatter is assessed
by the Liancheng Asset Assessment Firm of the Patent Office of
China to be at 83 million yuan (10 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Jiuxing Group has developed 86 patented products, of which
three, including the mosquito swatter, were designated as the
state key new products. Because of its achievements, the company
was selected as one of the best ten patent-application
enterprises.

<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Three newly-born snow leopards,
Forsaken by their mother leopard more than a week ago, are now in
good health conditions as they are properly fed by a dog,
according to sources from Beijing Zoo.
</P>
<P>
Their weight has grown to 855, 890 and 670 grams respectively
from former 575, 515 and 450 grams when they were born on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the zoo said that the mother leopard had showed no
interest to feed its babies eight hours after little snow leopards
were born.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Beijing Zoo said that the reason that the mother
leopard did not want to feed its babies was possiblly because of
the noisy environment.
</P>
<P>
Animal keepers at Beijing Zoo found a dog mother for the three
snow leopards in the dog-raising center in suburban Beijing's
Changping county on May 19. The dog just gave births to tree

<HEADLINE> Good U.S.-China Relations in Interest of Both: Brzezinski </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A constructive strategic
partnership between the United States and China is of importance
not only to regional stability in Asia but also to global
stability as a whole, says former U.S. national security adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski.
</P>
<P>
Brzezinski, who is now a senior adviser at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's visit to the U.S. last fall generated a
significant improvement, both in the atmospherics and in the
substance of U.S.-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
"There is strong recognition on both sides that good relations
are in the interest of each of the two parties," Brzezinski said
in a recent written interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Frequent and regular American-Chinese dialogue on strategic
issues is necessary so that the two countries are able to consult
one another on matters of general as well as specific interest,"
said Brzezinski, who served as national security adviser to
President Carter.
</P>
<P>
"Both countries share an interest in resolving conflicting
issues, though disagreements and different perspectives on some of
them are inherent both in history and in the different
geopolitical settings in which the two countries respectively
operate, " he said. In addition to discussing these issues in a
constructive fashion, it is desirable to expand the scope of
concrete cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"One very specific step to advance that goal would be to
include China in the annual meeting of the G-7, which has recently
been expanded to G-8, " Brzezinski said, adding, "China is
certainly qualified, in every respect, to be a member of that
group, given its present composition."
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question how to enhance mutual understanding,
Brzezinski said, "Mutual understanding can be best advanced by
more frequent contacts not only between the governments of the two
countries but also between their societies as a whole."
</P>
<P>
To be truly constructive, such contacts must be unhindered by
any form of official impediments and should be as wide-ranging as
possible, he said. In the age of global communications and growing
economic interdependence, any effort to impose a specific
doctrinal perspective is bound to be counterproductive to a good
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Talking about China's role in regional and world affairs,
Brzezinski said China is clearly a source of stability in the Far
East and that greatly enhances the important role that China plays
in the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
"The present financial and economic crisis in some Asian
countries further underlines the stabilizing role of China, and
American-Chinese relations should be designed to further
consolidate that stabilizing role," Brzezinski said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Changchun, capital of northeast
China's Jilin Province, has introduced a wide range of measures to
spread the use of new building materials to replace the
traditional clay bricks in an effort to protect farmland.
</P>
<P>
A leading office for reform of building materials, which was
established recently, has been authorized to impose fines on those
organizations that refuse to use new wall-building materials, said
local sources.
</P>
<P>
Organizations are required to pay special fees for the
development of new wall-building materials.
</P>
<P>
While giving tax breaks to firms which use new wall-building
materials, the city bans constructing or extending production
lines of clay bricks. It urges factories with existing brick
production lines to produce new wall-building materials with
industrial wastes and cement.
</P>
<P>
Per capita farmland area of Changchun city is 0.2 hectares, but
the city's farmland has been decreasing at a speed of 66.67
hectares annually from the making of clay bricks. The city
produced more than one billion clay bricks in 1996, said local
sources.

<HEADLINE> Millions Suffer From Filariasis in North Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- About 20 million people in
Bangladesh's 12 northern districts have been suffering from
filariasis, a disease caused by mosquito bite, press reports said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The was revealed by Dr. Moazzem Hossain, associate professor of
microbiology at Sir Salimullah Medical College, in his
recently-conducted pilot study.
</P>
<P>
The disease-affected districts include Thakurgaon, Dinajpur,
Rangpur, Nilphamari, Panchagarh, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Jaipurhat,
Naogaon, Chapainawabganj, Rajshahi and Lalmonirhat.
</P>
<P>
This disease, which has widely spread in the tropical and
sub-tropical areas, also carried a social stigma with it, Moazzem
said, adding, "Patients come to see doctors only after the
swelling of any part of the body as people are less aware of the
disease."
</P>
<P>
The disease in early stages which last for three to five years
is manifested as allergic symptoms like occasional fever, cough,
asthma, skin diseases, redness, swelling and urticaria, he stated.
</P>
<P>
When it turns into chronic infection following lymphatic
blockage, there is permanent swelling of the legs and other parts
of the body causing sufferings, permanent disability and reduction
in the working capacity of the population, he said.
</P>
<P>
There has been so far no simple tool to diagnose filariasis at
its early stage in the country except microscopic examination of
blood for microfilaria collected at night which is very cumbersome
and difficult and gives false negative results, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
will absorb large amounts of investment from abroad this year to
accelerate its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Overseas companies are welcome to invest in such traditional
pillar industries as electronics, machine-building,
pharmaceuticals, textiles and chemicals in Henan, said Zhang
Yixiang, vice-governor of Henan, at a provincial conference.
</P>
<P>
They may also develop high-efficient agricultural and forest
projects, build communications and power supply projects, urban
engineering facilities and sewage disposal projects.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors open to overseas investors include new and
high-tech development, export-oriented industries, construction of
industrial parks and renovation of old urban residential areas.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, more than 5,790 foreign-funded firms
had been built in Henan, involving a total contractual value of 7
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Previously, over 80 percent of overseas investment came from
the Republic of Korea, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As from this year, Zhang said, the provincial government is to
adopt a multi-outlet policy and enhance contacts with north
America, West European countries and Japan.

CARACAS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will propose at the

a supranational court against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Chairman of the National Antidrug Commission Carlos
Tablante said Saturday that this court would have an itinerant
character with moving from one country to another and have special
courtrooms in accordance with the specific needs of each region or
country.
</P>

There are local jurisdictions which are not strong enough to
face a criminal manifestation that crosses territorial barriers,

A supranational entity could deal with drug trafficking crimes

CARACAS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan basket of crudes and
exportable byproducts averaged at 10.91 U.S. dollars per barrel
this week, slightly up from the 10.66 dollars average a week ago,
according to the Energy and Mines Ministry Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the average was still below the targeted price of 12
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Experts here hope prices will recover with the start of the
summer season, during which an upsurge in gasoline demand is
expected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the maintenance work in the North Sea oil rigs would
make producers there cut production by 650,000 to one million
barrels a day to keep up prices.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of the Southeast Asian economies will also help
boost oil prices, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Kanezo Muraoka Saturday condemned the latest series of nuclear
tests by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Describing them as "extremely dangerous actions which might
rock the nuclear weapon nonproliferation regime from its very
foundations," the top Japanese government spokesman said that
"Japan absolutely cannot accept (the tests)."
</P>
<P>
Muraoka called upon Pakistan to immediately halt nuclear
weapons testing and development and unconditionally participate in
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of Japan's two atom-bomb-hit cities also
issued statements, criticizing Pakistan's testing.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshima Governor Yuzan Fujita said Pakistan's nuclear tests
are a violent affront to the wishes of the people of Hiroshima and
around the globe for a nuclear-free world.
</P>
<P>
Nagasaki Governor Genjiro Kaneko said the tests threaten
efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan announced earlier Saturday that it had carried out two
further nuclear tests in the hills of Baluchistan in western
Pakistan, in reply to five nuclear tests conducted by India on May
11 and 13.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Benxi city, a heavy industrial base
in northeast China's Liaoning province, has become a tourism site
due to successful pollution control.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that visitors to the city reached 1.5 million
in 1997, who spent over 2.7 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The great change has been attributed to the efforts of the
local government made in improving the local environment in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Li Wenxi, deputy mayor of Benxi city, said that the city has
invested 540 million yuan in the improvement of the local
environment in the past decade. Pollution control projects include
reducing and comprehensively utilizing industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the amount of dust per sq km has dropped by
three-fourths compared with the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The city has built a 200-sq km forest belt around urban areas
and has achieved an increase rate of 7-8 percent in terms of urban
green areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy mayor, the city's forest coverage rate
had reached 70 percent by the end of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Give Wealthy Foreigners Residence Visa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 31 (Xinhua) -- You invest here, and we give you
the residence visa.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest policy of Thailand's Immigration Police,
which aims to lure more foreign money into the cash-strapped
country.
</P>
<P>
As Sunday's Bangkok Post reported, foreigners who invest at
least 10 million baht (250,000 U.S. dollars) for at least three
years will be granted temporary residence visas.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a senior immigration officer as saying the
cabinet has allowed the Immigration Police to grant one-year
residential visas to 5,000 qualified foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to bring in at least 50 billion baht (1.25
billion dollars) of foreign investment if the quota is met.
</P>
<P>
The minimum 10-million-baht investment can be done through
investment in limited companies or public companies: Buying
condominiums or special bonds issued by the Finance Ministry or
the Bank of Thailand, or bonds issued by state enterprises which
are guaranteed by the Finance Ministry, or placing a fixed deposit
with a domestic bank.
</P>
<P>
However, foreigners must follow some restrictions. They must
fix their investment for at least three years after receiving the
temporary residence visas.
</P>
<P>
They must buy the condominiums directly from developers. Both
the condominiums and the bonds must not be sold or transferred to
other parties, nor mortgaged within the three-year period. The
fixed deposits must not be involved in any other legal action, nor
used as guarantees.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration Police also have other plans to attract
foreigners' spending in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration Police will allow elderly foreigners or foreign
pensioners to transform their tourist and transit visas into
one-year residence visas to take any therapeutic courses or tour
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Chinese and their families from Indonesia will be
granted renewable one-year residence visas if they have fixed
deposits of at least 3 million baht (75,000 dollars) per case with
a domestic bank.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Decide on Aid to Indonesia Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- An official of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) said here Saturday that his organization will
make a decision on resuming a rescue package to Indonesia as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
IMF Asia Pacific director Hubert Neiss said at the end of a
four-day fact-finding visit to Indonesia that it was highly
unlikely that the next installment of the rescue package brokered
for Indonesia by the IMF would be further delayed.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian economy is deteriorating rapidly and needs
immediate attention, local leading newspapers quoted the IMF envoy
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Neiss said he has no reason to doubt forecasts that the
battered Indonesian economy could contract 10 percent or more in
1998.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the economic reform program and the latest
political developments in the country were very positive and were
being welcomed not only in Indonesia, but also in the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
The IMF would continue financing Indonesia's efforts to
overcome the worsening crisis by initiating an immediate recovery
process, he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF promised last October to provide Indonesia with 10
billion U.S. dollars of a 43 billion dollar fund which the agency
had brokered to bail out the country's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has so far disbursed 4 billion dollars of the 10
billion dollars promised.
</P>
<P>
The third tranche of 1 billion dollars was initially scheduled
to be handed over to Indonesia on June 4, but it was delayed
because of the political turmoil which led to the resignation of
former President Soeharto.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Exercise Against Terrorist Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Defense Department of the
United States on Saturday held an exercise at its Pentagon
headquarters against terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
About 500 Defense Department employees and law enforcement
officials joined the 10-hour exercise, in which unidentified
radicals split away from a group of Pentagon tourists, took the
defense secretary's staff hostage, then killed hundreds of people
by knocking over a milk jug full of sarin gas.
</P>
<P>
"The bombings in the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City were
wake-up calls," Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood said. "To ignore
them would be a dangerous assumption to make."
</P>
<P>
The bombings and the sarin gas at a Tokyo subway in 1995 have
pushed the Clinton administration to make the preparation for such
attacks a new priority.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has announced a plan to develop and
stockpile vaccines against the lethal anthrax bacteria and the
Defense Department has expanded its vaccination program to all
service men and women from the troops in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also designated 10 states -- Massachusetts, New
York, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Illinois, Texas, Missouri, Colorado,
California and Washington -- where National Guard units will be
specially trained to respond to weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that local governments around the country have
begun sending fire and police forces through anti-terror training.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon was considered the potential ground zero for
nuclear attacks from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Now the
Pentagon is visited by 150,000 tourists a year. It was considered
as a prime target for terror attacks.

NEW DELHI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Market optimism about a
pre-budget rally failed to materialize and equities suffered a
sharp setback on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) during the week.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index lost 210.71 points to 3686.39 as
against last weekend's close of 3897.1. The national index also
dropped by 81.11 points to end the week at 1644.14 from the
previous close of 1725.25. The BSE-200 and U.S. dollar indexes
were quoted down at 375.74 and 150.74 compared with last weekend's
closes of 391.2 and 160.5.
</P>
<P>
Depressed by Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha's reported hints
at a tough budget in the light of a mounting fiscal deficit,
falling revenue collections and the shadow of economic sanctions
in the wake of India's five nuclear tests in mid-May, sentiment
remained constantly under pressure. Contributing to the mood were
also other factors like the international rating agency Standard &AMP;
Poor's decision to revise the outlook on India's sovereign rating
from "stable" to "negative."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's decision to put off talks on loans worth 800
million U.S. dollars led to the rupee's continuous downslide, to
the historical low of 41.75/78 rupees per U.S. dollar on Friday.

<P>
SOFIA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A survey conducted by the Gallup
International recently showed that confidence in Bulgaria's ruling
United Democratic Forces (UDF) has dropped by around 20 percent
over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The UDF has lost 20 percent of its electorate in the 18-30 age
group and 15 percent of its supporters in the 41-50 age group.
</P>
<P>
May, which marked the government's first year in office, saw a
10 per cent drop in the approval rating.
</P>
<P>
Since he took office last year, Prime Minister Kostov lost 6
percent of his popularity rating.
</P>

of the BSP supporters are aged 60 and over.
</P>
<P>
President Peter Stoyanov still enjoys the top rating of 72
percent, followed by Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofiyanski of 59 percent.

<P>
JAKARTA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A dengue fever epidemic hitting
Indonesia during the past four months has killed more than 1,000
people, a public health official said.
</P>
<P>
The death toll was recorded in 11 provinces in Indonesia,
Thomas Suroso, director of animal-vector disease control at the
Health Ministry, said Saturday in Semarang, Central Java,
according to reports reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on dengue fever control, Suroso said the
first known dengue fever cases in Indonesia occurred in 1968 in
Jakarta and Surabaya. Since then the incidence of the disease has
tended to increase in number as well as in area.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 there were 31,789 known cases in 27 provinces and 705
people died, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that every year about 2.5 million people of the world
population living in tropical and subtropical countries run the
risk of contracting the disease.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 tropical and subtropical countries have
experienced dengue fever explosions with more than 500,000 cases a
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, an acute tropical disease transmitted by
mosquitoes, leaves its victims with fever, rash and severe pains

<P>
PRAGUE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Czech customs seized 82
kilograms of high-purity heroin at the border post of Lanzhor
leading to Slovakia on Saturday and arrested three suspects.
</P>
<P>
The drug seized amounts to three million koruny (about 2.28
million U.S. dollars), the second largest after an April
crackdown in which the Czech police captured 120 kilograms of
heroin.
</P>
<P>
Hidden in containers holding textiles, the heroin was being
transported from Turkey, a spokesperson of the Czech customs said.
</P>
<P>
Located at the heart of Europe, the Czech Republic has been
used recently by smugglers as a distribution center of heroin and
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
The Czech police has enhanced its forces in a bid to fight the
rising wave of narcotic smuggling.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- World Cup qualifier South Africa was
held to a 1-1 draw by lowly second division German side Stuttgart
Kickers on Saturday in Oberthal, southern Germany.
</P>
<P>
South African team captain midfielder Lucas Radebe scored the
27th minute when the team was awarded a freekick. But the lead
was cancelled when Tomislav Maric scored for Kickers in the 69th
minute.
</P>
<P>
The match was a disappointing performance by the South Africans
who were to compete in the World Cup finals for the first time
next month. They seemed to resort to playing a close-knit passing
game when it would have been more effective to go for goal.
</P>
<P>
Two players are to be chopped from the South African team on
Sunday before coach Philippe Troussier form his 22-man final World
Cup squad.
</P>
<P>
The team is scheduled to play the Iceland national team on June
6 in its last warm-up match before the World Cup finals.

<HEADLINE> China to Open up Its Agriculture Sector for Further Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- China will increased the pace of
opening up its agriculture sector in an effort to help a rural
population of nearly 900 million, a senior agricultural official
said in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Tang Zheng, director-general of the International Cooperation
Department with the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) said that more
efforts will be made to modernize labor-intensive agriculture by
introducing state-of-the-art technology and fine seeds.
</P>
<P>
"We are dedicated to cooperating with foreign countries that
perform well in the agriculture sector," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to stay abreast of the world's latest agricultural
technology, China will join up with Japan this year to set up a
research and information center on the development of biological
agriculture. The total investment is expected to be 20 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang, the MOA plans to conduct 10 projects this
year, in cooperation with Japan, France, Austria, the Netherlands,
Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the most successful agricultural cooperation
taking place in the country has involved projects assisted by
international organizations to help China alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
These organizations include the World Food Program (WFP), the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The WFP itself has committed to provide food-for-work aid to 60
projects in China, with a total investment of nearly 800 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
An IFAD-aided agricultural project across Hunan and Guizhou
provinces, with a loan of 30 million US dollars, will be initiated
this year.
</P>
<P>
"These supported projects in China have achieved a favorable
record and can be cited as models in terms of the implementation
and the impact on the beneficiaries," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"All these projects are required to follow the strategy of
sustainable development to achieve success in both grain harvests
and environmental improvement," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China is also helping other countries to
develop their agricultural programs.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang, China developed 600 hectares of land in
Guinea last year to plant paddy rice. With the efforts of 65
Chinese agricultural experts, the rice yield in the project area
reached 6,000 kilograms per hectare.
</P>
<P>
More cooperative agricultural projects will be launched in six
other African countries this year, Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Conduct No Further Nuclear Tests: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said Saturday that his country has completed its nuclear
program and there would be no further testing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Pakistan's second largest city
of Lahore, Sharif said Pakistan is ready to hold talks on all the
outstanding issues with India for ensuring peace and tranquillity
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that Pakistan conducted another nuclear test
Saturday in the wake of the detonation of five nuclear devices
Thursday, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Sharif stressed that Pakistan's nuclear tests had become
imperative following India's nuclear explosions earlier this month
which had seriously jeopardized the situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan had waited for the response of the
international community on the Indian tests but was deeply
disappointed by the muted reaction.
</P>
<P>
"This left us with no option but to conduct our own tests in
order to safeguard our national security and restore the balance
of power," he said, adding Pakistan could not afford to endanger
its national security.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian leadership exacerbated the situation further
by their aggressive statements and threats to use nuclear weapons
and attack Pak-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that his government initiated peace talks with
India, however, he was disappointed by India's response to the
initiatives aimed at improving the strained relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that instead of furthering the peace process in South
Asia, the Indian leadership poured cold water on all Pakistan's
attempts to forge a peaceful and friendlier relationship with
India.
</P>
<P>
Declaring that Pakistan could not compromise on her national
security, Sharif said the country was forced to have taken extreme
steps.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said his country has now been provided with "a golden
opportunity to change its destination by shaking off the legacy of
slavery and adopt a route to self-reliance and self-sufficiency."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan cannot depend on anyone for its security and neither
it should do so because of its bitter past experience, Sharif
said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has no aggressive designs against anyone, but at the
same time it must be strong enough to deter evil notions of
others," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Pakistan is ready to sign the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, he said the country would have to think about it
because of the changed circumstances and come with a new strategy.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also said that having attained the nuclear goal,
Pakistan would now pay attention to other issues for the
development and progress of the country. He expressed his optimism
that Pakistan would also succeed in attaining those goals as well.
</P>
<P>
To a question on India's willingness to sign a peace accord
with Pakistan provided Pakistan gave up its stand on Kashmir, he
said no meaningful talks can be held with India without the
solution of this issue which, he believed, is the root cause of
the conflict between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"India must understand that peace in South Asia lies in the
solution of the Kashmir problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the time now has come for the world community to
concentrate on solving the Kashmir issue if they want to see an
end to the nuclear proliferation and eliminate the menace once and
for all.

<P>
CHANGSHA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province is
beginning to help people with disabilities by requiring all
government departments, social bodies, institutions, and companies
to set aside 1.5 percent of their job opportunites for them.
</P>
<P>
Those who fail to give employment to the disabled people will
have to pay into a special foundation for the disabled, according
to the province's federation of the disabled.
</P>
<P>
The province has one million disabled people living below the
poverty line, and 881,500 of whom could make a living if they had
some help.
</P>
<P>
The federation says that banks will also be encouraged to
provide loans for disabled people to start profit-making projects.
</P>
<P>
China allocated 1.5 billion yuan for poverty relief this year,
a third of that going to disabled people.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Calls For Self-reliance Against Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Saturday urged the nation to launch a self-reliance program
to ward off anticipated economic sanctions to be imposed by
western countries on Pakistan for its series of nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the National Economic Council, Sharif
called upon the provinces and the federal government to launch a
self-reliance program and stop dependence on foreign aid and
loans.
</P>
<P>
The Council was holding the meeting to approve the 1998-1999
Annual Plan at a time when Pakistan conducted six nuclear tests in
48 hours in response to India's series of nuclear tests last week.
</P>
<P>
"We have chosen the path of independence and self-reliance. We
have shown the world that Pakistan is capable of defending its
independence. We were left with no choice but to conduct nuclear
test in larger national interests and to preserve our freedom,"
the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We should adopt the habits of austerity and economy and cut
down our expenditures at all levels," he said while urging the
patriotic people to come forward and rise above self interests and
work hard to achieve the goal of self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
"We are not afraid of sanctions," he said. "These are in fact
blessings in disguise. We can live within our means. This has
given us a direction to adopt the way of self-reliance and to do
away with dependence on foreign loans and aids."
</P>
<P>
He asked the Finance Ministry, Planning Commission and Central
Board of Revenue to submit suggestions to the Cabinet on
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
Both the provincial and federal governments should make
extensive efforts to boost export and production in agriculture
and industrial fields to increase national income, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1998-1999 Annual Plan, the National Economic Council
has already decided to impose a 50 percent cut on all expenditures
except development and the salary components of government
departments, autonomous bodies and corporations.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Proposes Talks With India, Pakistan on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac has
proposed to India and Pakistan that they talk with the world's
major powers in order to give up nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Friday with the U.S. daily Washington Post
which was also carried by the local media Saturday, Chirac
expressed his opposition to the U.S. decision to impose sanctions
on India and Pakistan for conducting the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"The eight or seven powers with the capability to do something
should meet among themselves first to discuss what we can do to
persuade India and Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and to join the negotiations in the Conference on
Disarmament on the cutoff" of the manufacture of fissionable
material, said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
"Then India and Pakistan could join the talks without fearing
they would be humiliated, as they fear now, and we could all work
together to save the Non-Proliferation Treaty which must be
saved," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Chirac said that he and other European leaders believe that
the economic sanctions against the two already poor countries
would only make them even more miserable.
</P>
<P>
"The main effect of such sanctions in these circumstances is
to make the weak suffer even more," he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that a future conference make clear to India and
Pakistan that they would get help with significant, peaceful
nuclear power programs if they gave up testing and the processing
of weapons-grade nuclear material, according to the Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that he favored providing security guarantees to
India and Pakistan "in one form or another."
</P>
<P>
French diplomats will discuss the proposal by Chirac with
Indian and Pakistani envoys in Paris next week, said the
Washington Post.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Condemns Pakistan's New Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton Saturday
condemned Pakistan for its two more nuclear tests, saying it can
only serve to increase tensions "in an already volatile region."
</P>
<P>
"The United States condemns today's second round of nuclear
tests by Pakistan," Clinton said in a written statement. "These
tests can only serve to increase tensions in an already volatile
region."
</P>
<P>
"With their recent tests, Pakistan and India are contributing
to a self-defeating cycle of escalation that does not add to the
security of either country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on India and Pakistan to resume their direct
dialogue, to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and reverse
their arms race without conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Both India and Pakistan need to renounce further nuclear and
missile testing immediately and take decisive steps to reverse
this dangerous arms race," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the State Department issued a statement condemning
Pakistan for carrying out two more nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
"We are very disappointed that Pakistan continues to ignore the
calls to exercise restraint that were made by the international
community after its first tests," the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
"This action by Pakistan will further set back our continuing
efforts to defuse tensions and halt the spiraling cycle of
provocative action," it added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan announced earlier Saturday that it carried out two
further nuclear tests in the hills of Baluchistan in western
Pakistan, bringing the total to seven in three days.
</P>
<P>
The State Department statement called on both India and
Pakistan to stop nuclear tests now and avoid any further
provocations that could raise tensions further.
</P>
<P>
"We again urge both Pakistan and India to cease and desist from
any further nuclear or missile tests or any other provocative
action or rhetoric," the statement said.

BUCHAREST, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rains which fell in
the past 24 hours have made rivers in northeastern Romania rise
at an alarming level, some of them having registered the biggest
swell in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Rompres news agency, the level of water has
considerably risen in the rivers of Siret, Prut and Jijia. Land
slides and floods have been reported in Botosani, Iasi and Vaslui
counties. Rivers spilled their banks and swamped about 10,000
arable hectares in these counties, dozens of houses have been
flooded and many residents have been urgently evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Specialists say the Prut, the boundary river with the Republic
of Moldova, rolls in 2,400 cubic meters per second, registering
the biggest swell in the past 30 years. It was reported that some
villages in the Republic of Moldova have also been flooded.
</P>
<P>
According to the meteorological forecasts, the flood will be
stopped in a few days. Nevertheless, special units of the counties
stand ready to fully control the situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei Saturday called for unity among political factions, the
Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Such a unity is needed to preserve the Islamic principles and
values, Khamenei told the members of Majlis (Parliament) on the
eve of its annual internal elections to decide the presiding board.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that different political factions have been
busy with preparing for the elections due on Sunday, but none of
them has announced candidate.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the conservative Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri would be re-elected for another one-year term since
the Majlis is controlled by the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The pro-moderate daily Iran News said on Saturday that the
moderates have not reached a consensus over the elections due to
"the lack of harmony within the faction."
</P>
<P>
Moderate factions joined efforts to help Mohammad Khatami, an
advocate of social reforms and freedom, win the presidential
election in May last year. Ever since then, Iran sees frequent
factional struggles.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said the realization of Islamic principles would help
strengthen the bond between the people and the government, which
would also help the country overcome problems.

According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, the
Foreign Ministry's public relations office issued a statement,
terming the remarks made by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati on Friday as a
"slip of the tongue."
</P>
<P>
Up to now no Israeli individual has been granted visa and nor
will they be granted visa in the future either, the statement
said, and the Foreign Ministry also has no plan to issue visa to
the U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
The visa for journalists, scientists and tourists have their
own procedures and necessary conditions for receiving these kinds
of visas are different, it added.
</P>
<P>
Jannati, secretary of the conservative Guardians Council, on
Friday strongly criticized the Foreign Ministry for inviting
"certain American and Israeli elements" to visit Iran.
</P>
<P>
The pro-conservative daily Jomhuri Islami on Thursday also
blamed the moderate government of President Mohammad Khatami for
inviting "suspicious American and Israeli elements" to visit the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a response, Sadeq Kharrazi, an advisor to the foreign
minister, stated that Iran should extend an open invitation to
all intellectuals who can convey the truth of the Iranian Islamic
system to the world.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see all European and American researchers
visit Iran," Kharrazi said in an interview with the moderate
newspaper Iran Daily published on Saturday, adding that the visit
of American researchers, journalists and members of the academic
community have positively affected American public opinion about
Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that in some cases some Americans came to Iran with a
very negative attitude, but were favorably impressed once they
returned home.

<HEADLINE> French Police Discover Killing Plan by Islamists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- French police said Saturday that they
discovered a plan by Islamic extremists to assassinate the rector
of the Mosque of Paris, Dalil Boubakeur, during a raid against
them this week in several places of France.
</P>
<P>
These extremists are suspected to belong to the Armed Islamic
Group (GIA), an Algerian terrorist group which has a support
network in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Some of the arrested Islamists admitted the existence of a plan
to assassinate Boubakeur, Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted
judicial sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Boubakeur said that he himself was not aware that he was
targeted by the GIA, when he accepted an AFP telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
French police arrested 55 people during a simultaneous raid
against the Islamists in several European countries Tuesday, a
security operation apparently aimed at improving security for the
Football World Cup finals to be opened in France in June.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen of them are still being detained in police custody and
could face trial.
</P>
<P>
Boubakeur was blamed by the extremists to be too close with the
Algerian government and for repeatedly condemning the massacres of
civilians by the GIA in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
He has been under police protection since he attended the
celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of Israel in
Paris and joined a religious ceremony in a Jewish synagogue one
month ago.
</P>
<P>
The assassination of a Muslim religious leader in Paris, Imam
Abdelbaki Sarhaoui, on July 11, 1995, signaled a wave of terrorist
attacks in France.
</P>
<P>
France held the GIA for the attacks.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Inspectors Continue Mission in Iraq Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Monitoring and inspections groups
of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of eliminating Iraq's
banned weapons, known as UNSCOM, continued their mission smoothly
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted an official source at the
National Monitoring Department, the Iraqi peer of UNSCOM, as
saying that 11 monitoring groups made surprise and scheduled
visits to 14 sites on Saturday with full cooperation from the
Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that a biological inspection team which arrived
here a week ago made surprise visits to three health sites in
Baghdad while another group of the same team, on board a
helicopter, made scheduled visits to two health sites in Wasit
Province.
</P>
<P>
Another biological team made surprise visits to
under-monitoring sites, while a chemical team which arrived in
Baghdad on Friday made scheduled visits to one of the
under-monitoring sites, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The inspection team in charge of surveying war heads
destruction sites, which arrived here 10 days ago and would
continue its mission for one month, continued their activity on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Iraq-U.N. weapons inspection
agreement on February 23, U.N. weapons inspection has been going
on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Iraq must get the health bill from UNSCOM before sanctions
imposed on it after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait can be
lifted.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Greece has launched a new nationwide
consumer hot line for complaints and for product information.
</P>
<P>
The telephone number is part of a new system for codifying and
dealing with complaints as soon as possible, and the system will
relay consumers' complaints directly back to the traders or
manufacturers to achieve a speedy and out-of-court settlement of
differences, the Greek daily newspaper Kathimerini reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In Greece, 1998 has been declared Year of Quality, but public
and private sectors continue to pay more attention to prices
rather than to quality, variety, cleanliness or service.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted recently by the Greek
Consumers' Federation (GOKE), a total of 30,155 complaints were
reported in the first five months of this year, mainly related to
the retail trade.
</P>
<P>
There were also complaints about banking services and credit
cards, public transport, water and electricity supply and car
repairs.

UNITED NATIONS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Saturday again called on India and Pakistan to exercise
restraint and reduce tensions between them.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Pakistan's latest nuclear test Saturday, Annan

The U.N. chief reiterated his offer to the prime ministers of
India and Pakistan to assist them in initiating a "constructive
dialogue," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's nuclear test Saturday came after the five previous
tests conducted Thursday which it said were aimed at deterring

<HEADLINE> UAE, Palestinian Leaders Discuss Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU-DHABI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sheikh
Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan Saturday held talks with visiting
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the latest developments of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Zayed said Israel should respect the signed
peace agreements before a just, comprehensive and permanent peace
in the Middle East can be realized.
</P>
<P>
He said the Arab nation is in a decisive stage, which requires
Arab rapprochement through an expanded summit to face up to the
Israeli intransigence and protect the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis have been
stalled over much-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from the West
Bank and the expansion of settlement.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting between the two leaders, UAE Minister of
State for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed al-Nahyan told
reporters that the UAE president underlined the importance of
holding an emergency expanded Arab summit to discuss the
challenges posed to the peace process and probe ways for restoring
the Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here earlier Saturday to seek support from the
UAE for an Arab summit to save the collapsing peace process.
</P>
<P>
He has sought for several months to convene a summit to adopt a
unified Arab stance towards the Israeli intransigence and hardline
policy.
</P>
<P>
He quickened his pace recently in urging the summit after the
U.S. failed to convince Israel to accept its proposal, which
demands a 13 percent withdrawal from the West Bank. Intensive
consultations are under way among Arab states for a mini or
expanded summit to close Arab ranks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Qatar have reportedly
agreed to attend the summit proposed to be held early June in
Egyptian capital Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Yemen Call for Avoidance of Nuclear Arms Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Yemen have called for
efforts to avoid nuclear arms race in the world following the
nuclear tests of India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi Friday called on all
countries in the Middle East to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) to avoid possible nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the Pakistani and Indian nuclear
explosions, Kharrazi said that the blame lied entirely on those
countries which refused to attend talks on nuclear disarmament,
the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as Pakistan carried out its first round of
nuclear tests Thursday in response to India's nuclear explosions
earlier this month. Pakistan set of two others later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Urging countries to refrain from arms race, Kharrazi said that
Iran, as a member of the NPT, would make efforts to create a
nuclear free zone in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
He also called on other regional countries to join hands with
Iran in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yemen voiced support for reining back the
international nuclear arms race, saying such a race would only
lead to more tensions and struggles worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The country's leading state-run daily "El-Thawrah" said in its
editorial Saturday that Yemen was concerned over the successive
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan recently.
</P>
<P>
Yemen called on India and Pakistan to avoid doing anything that
could exacerbate the tension and destabilize the world peace and
security, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> France Backs Lebanon's Stance on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French President Jacques
Chirac said on Saturday that France supports Lebanon's rejection
of Israel's proposal to withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Lebanese and French officials at a ceremony to
reopen the residence of French envoy to Lebanon, Chirac stressed
that Israel should abide by the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 425 to withdraw troops from south Lebanon
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to endorse the resolution. But it
said that it would not withdraw from south Lebanon before security
arrangements are negotiated with Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, insisting that the withdrawal
be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Israel is now occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip
in south Lebanon with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
areas from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Chirac expressed welcome to Israel's endorsement of the U.N.
resolution and described it as a "positive step."
</P>
<P>
He said that France is willing to cooperate with other
countries concerned to make contribution to a quiet border between
Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
France, which enjoys a traditional relationship with Lebanon,
is keen on playing an active role in the Middle East peace
process, especially mediating between Lebanon, Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived here on Friday for a two-day visit, the third
since he took office in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: U.S. to Publicize Proposal on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat said Saturday that the U.S. has promised to announce
its proposal on Israeli withdrawal from West Bank to bring more
pressure on Israelis.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made the promise in
a recent telephone call to Arafat, but without saying when the
proposal will be made public, he told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
The proposal demands an additional Israeli withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank. It was accepted by Palestinians, but
rejected by Israelis on security reasons. The proposal was not
made public as Washington does not want to press Israelis hard.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. appeared to have lost patience somewhat when its
efforts to reactivate the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have
failed due to Israelis' intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Albright also told Arafat that the U.S., the chief Mideast
peace mediator, will announce who is to blame for the failure of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled since March
last year due to the much-delayed Israeli withdrawal and the
expansion of settlement in occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said the Palestinian National Authority has the
right to announce the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state in May next year. But Netanyahu warned him not to do so.
</P>
<P>
Albright did not issue any warning against such a state, only
saying that its establishment should be preceded by a consensus of
parties concerned, Arafat told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here earlier Saturday to seek support from the
United Arab Emirates for an Arab summit to save the collapsing
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the importance of such an emergency expanded
summit, he told reporters that such a meeting must be held so that
Arab countries can adopt a unified stance at a proposed
international conference on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The international conference was co-proposed by Egypt and
France earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The emergency summit can also help Arab countries formulate a
single stance against the challenges arising from different areas,
said Arafat, adding contacts and efforts have been made to see
such a meeting sealed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the summit can be held as soon as
possible.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Saturday urged India and Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) without conditions.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement read by Kenyan Njuguna Moses
Mahugu, the 15-member council also called on Pakistan to issue a
public declaration announcing a moratorium on future tests and
experimentation on delivery systems.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its increased concern at the risk of a nuclear arms
race escalating in South Asia, the council strongly supported
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's statement on his profound dismay at
the latest development.
</P>
<P>
The council convened an urgent meeting Saturday afternoon to
discuss Pakistan's nuclear test Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The test came after Pakistan's five nuclear tests Thursday.
Islamabad said its actions were aimed at defensing its position in
the face of the Indian nuclear threat. On May 11 and 13, India
conducted a total of five nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Mahugu said the council "is actively considering" a draft
resolution on the matter with a view to its quick adoption.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the time of the next meeting and the substance of
the draft, he said the meeting could be "any time" and the draft
resolution may go beyond the Indian and Pakistani tests.
</P>
<P>
It would rather look at the whole question of stability and
security in South Asia, including non-proliferation and
disarmament, he said.

WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's ambassador to the
United Nations said Saturday that his country would watch what
India would do before taking its responding action.
</P>
<P>
"We will be watching exactly what is done by India, what is the
nature of their aggressive designs against Pakistan," Ambassador
Ahmad Kamal told CNN in an interview.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed his country's peace overtures to India and said
Pakistan currently did not intend to mount nuclear weapons on its
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
But "if the type of provocations that they have done in the
past, threats of nuclear blackmail, threats of action against
Pakistan in Kashmir, in fact even plans for a preemptive attack
against Pakistan, if any such actions are taken, then it would be
the duty of Pakistan to safeguard its national security by all
possible means," Kamal warned.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Pakistan carried out two more nuclear tests
in the hills of Baluchistan in western Pakistan, bringing the
total to seven in three days.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton condemned Pakistan for the further
testing, saying it can only serve to increase tensions "in an
already volatile region."
</P>
<P>
"With their recent tests, Pakistan and India are contributing
to a self-defeating cycle of escalation that does not add to the
security of either country," Clinton said in a written statement.
</P>

He called on India and Pakistan to resume their direct
dialogue, to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and reverse
their arms race without condition.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has ordered 18
Kenyan farmers to leave the country because of their illegal stay
and undertaking agricultural activities contrary to immigration
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyans have been given two weeks to quit Kimwati Village
in Monduli District in north Tanzania's Arusha Region, according
to a report reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The order was issued Friday by Monduli District Commissioner,
Abdallah Kihato, following complaints from Kimwati villagers on
deteriorating relations between them and the illegally staying
Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
Kihato said that the illegal farmers last year invaded the area
bordering Kenya following severe drought which had
affected the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Kimwati villagers had received the Kenyans with expectations
that they would return home after the drought subsided, he said,
adding that the Kenyans, however, had remained to stay in the
area and engaged in large-scale farming of beans and wheat farms
which have created some misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
"We expect good neighborliness in line with the stated
immigration laws," the district commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our friends from Kenya will understand the situation
and leave the area," Kihato added.
</P>
<P>
He has asked the Kenyans to hand over the farms to the
government immediately after harvesting their last products for
this season.

<HEADLINE> Instability Creates 100,000 More Refugees in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The instability of the political
and military situation has forced some 100,000 more people to
flee their homes in southern provinces of Huila, Namibe and
Cunene in Angola.
</P>
<P>
These new refugees, mainly children, women and old people,
have sheltered themselves around a few cities in Huila Province,
the Angolan News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an official of the Huila provincial
government as saying that the refugees are leading hard lifes as
the local governments has not enough money to provide them with
such emergency relief as foods, medicine and clothes.
</P>
<P>
The official added that epidemic diseases are likely to erupt
at any time in the areas crowded by refugees.
</P>
<P>
Since the year began, the number of refugees in the
war-ravaged southern African country has been increasing as the
remnants of the opposition National Union for Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) keeps making troubles.
</P>
<P>
The representative of the United Nations humanitarian relief
coordination agency to Angola, Francesco Strippoli, disclosed at
a recent press conference held in Luanda that the number of
refugees except those in south Angola has increased to 70,000,
making the total refugee number in the country up to over one
million.
</P>
<P>
Strippoli said that the demand for emergency aid is "evident
and urgent." Cases in which aid workers and vehicles are
attacked are on increase, making the provision of humanitarian
relief more difficult and halting most of the activities of the
non-governmental organizations in Angola, he added.
</P>
<P>
The unstable situation will delay the transition from
emergency relief to development aid, Strippoli said, adding that
the setback in humanitarian relief in Angola has disappointed the
international community.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that "the Angolan people hold no
responsibility" for this development, and emergency relief work
in the country will continue as long as it is needed.
</P>
<P>
Strippoli said that the U.N. agency will call on the
international community to provide more emergency aid if it is
necessary.

<HEADLINE> 18 Kenyan Farmers Ordered to Leave Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has ordered 18
Kenyan farmers to leave the country because of their illegal stay
and undertaking agricultural activities contrary to immigration
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyans have been given two weeks to quit Kimwati Village
in Monduli District in north Tanzania's Arusha Region, according
to a report reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The order was issued Friday by Monduli District Commissioner,
Abdallah Kihato, following complaints from Kimwati villagers on
deteriorating relations between them and the illegally staying
Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
Kihato said that the illegal farmers last year invaded the area
bordering Kenya following severe drought which had
affected the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Kimwati villagers had received the Kenyans with expectations
that they would return home after the drought subsided, he said,
adding that the Kenyans, however, had remained to stay in the
area and engaged in large-scale farming of beans and wheat farms
which have created some misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
"We expect good neighborliness in line with the stated
immigration laws," the district commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our friends from Kenya will understand the situation
and leave the area," Kihato added.
</P>
<P>
He has asked the Kenyans to hand over the farms to the
government immediately after harvesting their last products for
this season.
