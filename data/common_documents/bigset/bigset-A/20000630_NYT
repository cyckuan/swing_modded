PC EXPO SHOWCASES WEARABLE HARDWARE  &HT;     BY CAROLYN SAID

   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
New York _ The blue suits, the white shirts, the red ties _ they're
history.
<P>
   The new de rigueur uniform, according to IBM Corp., is a
wearable computer.
</P>
<P>
   Big Blue, generally not known for setting fashion trends,
attracted a stream of PC Expo showgoers to a corner of its huge
booth, where it showed a prototype of a wearable PC.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, IBM miniaturized one of its ThinkPad notebook
computers to the size of a VHS cassette so it would fit in a pocket
(a large one) or fanny pack. Instead of a keyboard, it came with a
curved mouse that nestled in the user's hand (there's also the
option of voice control); and instead of a screen, there was a
headset that floated a minidisplay in front of the user's eyes. An
earpiece provided sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the future,'' said Peter del Rio, one of the visitors
to the booth. Del Rio, who had skated over to the Javits Convention
Center from his Chelsea office, said he would like to equip
salespeople for his customized clothing company with wearable PCs.
The company, ic3D, will open a store in Times Square next year and
counters in Bloomingdale's this fall. ``It's the cyborg look; we'd
like our salespeople to be modeling the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, del Rio faulted IBM's prototype for being cumbersome.
``I'd like to design something cooler,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has been testing the waters with corporate clients for the
system, which would be for mobile workers who need to keep their
hands free _ customs agents, ship inspectors, telephone line repair
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could even retrofit a Web cam into a hard hat so they
could capture video of a problem area,'' said George Tatomyr, an
executive with IBM's Wearable Solutions division. He added that
with wireless connectivity, someone wearing the system could access
a database to help in troubleshooting problems up an 80-foot pole
or down a manhole.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial versions should be available early next year from IBM
partner Xybernaut, according to Tatomyr, priced from $4,000 to
$7,000. He said a consumer version is likely to be a couple of
years away.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is showing the system in a TV commercial that depicts a man
in a Venice, Italy, plaza surrounded by pigeons that think he's
talking to them instead of his wearable PC.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies at PC Expo had looked deep into the future and
saw _ a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   HeyAnita, from a Los Angeles company of the same name, is a
``voice portal'' _ the same designation as recent media darling
TellMe. Consumers call its toll-free number and can orally request
information such as stock quotes, weather, traffic, news and
horoscopes. It will launch nationwide in September. Versions for
Korea, Japan and China are also coming this year. The consumer
version will be partially supported by ads; overseas it will also
be subsidized by phone companies that hope customers will run up
their cell-phone bills calling it. The company hopes to license
HeyAnita to Internet sites like Yahoo and Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like radio on command,'' said Victor Sim, co-founder and
chief strategy officer of the company. The five founders named it
after a waitress in their favorite Los Angeles diner; she has since
moved on to seek fame in Hollywood and doesn't yet know that she's
soon to be renowned on the phone, Sim said.
</P>
<P>
   Another telephone solution is ShopTalk. As the name promises,
it's like an uber-800 number for shopping. More than 50 companies
like Jiffy Lube, Pizza Hut and Crate &AMP; Barrel offer their wares
through the service, which gives them a chance to make special
offers to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Why, when so much of the high-tech industry is focused on making
whiz-bang gadgetry, are companies betting on a century-old
technology?
</P>
<P>
   Simple, said Sim. ``Worldwide, PC penetration is only 10
percent. We want to go after the other 90 percent.''

STARTUP WANTS TO TAKE ON PRICELINE.COM  &HT;     BY CARRIE KIRBY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ A San Francisco startup code-named Purple Demon has
been quietly gearing up to challenge Priceline.com in the business
of selling off the airline seats that go unfilled every day.
<P>
   With six major airlines as founding investors, Purple Demon
plans to launch in the fall as Hotwire. The company has $75 million
in investments, with minority stakes held by American Airlines,
United Airlines, Continental Airlines, US Airways, Northwest
Airlines and America West.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Priceline.com fell $3.38 to $36.81 Thursday. Despite
the drop, a Priceline.com spokesman insisted that the planned
company is not a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a competitor to Priceline's name-your-price
model,'' said Priceline spokesman Brian Ek. ``This will have zero
effect on our business.'' Priceline.com's expectation of achieving
profitability by 2001 will not be affected, Ek said.
</P>
<P>
   With both services, the buyer agrees to buy tickets at a certain
price, with no choice regarding airline or route.
</P>
<P>
   But there are differences between the two companies' systems:
Customers of Priceline.com decide how much they are willing to pay,
then wait an hour to find out whether any of the site's airlines
will sell a seat at that price. Hotwire plans to provide a
predetermined discount price for the chosen day and destination.
</P>
<P>
   Hotwire's idea eliminates one problem that has kept some buyers
away from Priceline.com: With Hotwire, buyers don't agree to accept
the flight until they view the price and route; Priceline.com
customers must agree in advance to buy whatever the service comes
up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the Purple Demon project will be similar to
Priceline with less restrictions,'' said Aram Fuchs, chief
executive of Fertilemind.com, a group of New York City Internet
analysts. ``That doesn't seem to be an idea to base an entire
business on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Priceline can simply adjust. If they do that, the Purple Demon
wouldn't be so demonic,'' Fuchs added.
</P>
<P>
   However, having six large airlines as founding partners could
give Hotwire an edge in obtaining more and better seats to sell,
Fuchs said. Priceline also has investments from airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Orbitz, another company with airline investments that plans to
sell tickets online, is being investigated by the Justice
Department for possibly being anticompetitive, even though the site
hasn't launched. But Hotwire chief executive Karl Peterson said
although the airlines' combined investment is significant, he's
confident that his venture does not undermine competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike other industry consortiums, there is no governance from
our airline supplier partners. We are independently managed,''
Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hotwire's majority investor is Texas Pacific Group, a private
investment company with which Peterson was formerly a partner.

MARINERS JUMP BACK INTO FIRST PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ These are the facts and go figure: The Mariners won
again Thursday afternoon, using a combination of pitching and
power, defense and execution.
</P>
<P>
   They beat Anaheim, 7-2, at Safeco Field, taking their eighth
consecutive series, a franchise first.
</P>
<P>
   They jumped back into first place in the AL West, improving to
45-31, the second-best record in the American League, third-best in
the majors behind the White Sox and Braves. In contrast,
Cincinnati, home of the dearly departed but not sorely missed, is
37-40.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners begin a seven-game road trip in Texas Friday night
after breezing through an 8-2 homestand, running their Safeco
record to 28-12, best in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this ballpark,'' Mariners manager Lou Piniella said.
``It's really made a big difference in our pitching. Our young
pitching has really developed here.''
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud stroked two home runs while starter Gil Meche and
three relievers stifled the Angels in front of 44,387 fans. Stan
Javier and new catcher Robert Machado also homered for the
Mariners, adding insurance blows in the seventh and eighth innings.
</P>
<P>
   If it all sounds straightforward, that's because it is _ the
Mariners are business-like in their approach, ruthlessly and
methodically mowing down their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Although Piniella prefers to proceed with caution, the bandwagon
is picking up the pace and now includes the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're solid,'' said Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn. ``They
have a chance to be one of the best teams in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Darin Erstad added:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no holes, none, zero. They're going to have their
hands in it (the pennant race). There's no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This from a player who is batting .373 after banging out three
singles, nonetheless recognizing a potential powerhouse. They used
to mock the M's and now they marvel instead.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the developments Thursday, however infrequent in
the past, have turned routine. The foundation is fundamental
baseball, always stressed but rarely seen in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team won't get beat making mistakes,'' said Stan Javier,
a utility man who lit up the Angels with a home run in the seventh
inning. ``We have very smart players. Doing little things ... it's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   A lack of defense could have led to a different outcome. But the
Mariners have an abundance.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the tone, Mike Cameron raced in to catch a short fly
ball to right-center. Erstad tagged up at third and tried to score.
Cameron gathered himself and threw a strike to Machado, who tagged
the sliding Erstad, resulting in a double play to end the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud cleanly fielded three basic grounders before making the
play of the game, snagging a one-hop bolt off Vaughn's bat. The
first baseman turned it into a double play that ended the seventh,
avoiding the unpleasant alternative: extra bases for Vaughn and a
serious rally by the Angels, who trailed 4-2 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gold down there,'' Vaughn said. ``He saves a lot of
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Olerud: ``I didn't have time to try to get it on a big hop.
That's a reaction play. Mo's a dangerous hitter. To get out of an
inning like that ...''
</P>
<P>
   Was huge, just like Olerud's performance. The 31-year-old is an
appropriate example of what the Mariners are all about these days:
understated elegance. His swing is Fred Couples smooth, and
Thursday he generated the same kind of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can juice the ball when he has to,'' Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Olerud deposited Kent Bottenfield's waist-high
fastball into the right-field seats for a 2-1 lead. In the sixth,
he ripped a two-run shot off Mark Petkovsek, sending another
fastball over the Mariners' logo in right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some pitches to hit and hit 'em well,'' said Olerud, who
had a .316 batting average and nine RBIs during the homestand. ``I
want to keep that going.''
</P>
<P>
   The other elements of the victory also were predictable:
Supposedly slumping Edgar Martinez delivered a run-scoring single
in the first inning, and Jose Mesa continued his revival from
barely breathing to suddenly flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   The same reliever who gave up nine runs in one inning a month
ago in Tampa Bay struck out three Angels. One was the baffled
Bengie Molina, who fanned on a pitch that hit the dirt 2 feet in
front of home plate. Another was Erstad, flailing at the last pitch
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best I've ever seen him throw the baseball,''
Erstad said. ``It was pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   As are the M's, now hoping for the same kind of results on the
road.

POWER-GRID OPERATOR CUTS ELECTRICITY PRICE CAP  &HT;     BY KELLY YAMANOUCHI
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In a move to lower wholesale prices for electricity, the California
Independent System Operator said Thursday that it has slashed the
maximum price it will pay for power to $500 per megawatt hour from
$750.
<P>
   The Independent System Operator _ made up of utility officials,
power generators, and commercial and industrial power users _
operates much of the state's electricity grid. Its decision to cut
the wholesale cap comes two weeks after a heat wave caused
blackouts and pushed wholesale prices for electricity up to the
limit in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Most residential consumers in the Bay Area will see no immediate
difference in their monthly electricity bill as a result of
yesterday's decision. However, the lower maximum bid price could
mean lower bills in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Rates for electricity consumers in most of California were
frozen to artificially high rates as part of a deal for
deregulation in order to allow utility companies to pay off debts.
Now, a potentially smaller portion of a consumer's utility bill
will go toward paying actual electricity costs. That leaves a
larger portion to go toward paying the debt. The debt was scheduled
to be repaid by 2002, but with a lower price cap it may be paid off
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent System Operator acknowledged that the price cap
may make it difficult for the state to get all the power it needs
the next time electricity demand is extremely high. That's because
the low price cap may discourage companies from building new power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The new price cap, which was passed 16 to 4 with four
abstentions and will be effective July 1 through October 15, is a
compromise. Many consumers and businesses wanted a cap of $250 per
megawatt to keep prices low. An earlier motion to cut the cap to
$250 was proposed by Southern California Edison, an investor-owned
utility, and failed after a 12-to-12 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Some electricity generators, however, wanted all caps lifted,
arguing higher profits will be an incentive to build more
generating plants.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine Corp., a San Jose constructor of power plants, said the
decision won't affect its plans to provide power sources in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our backyard and we're going to keep building
plants,'' said Calpine Chairman Pete Cartwright. ``But it's no way
to encourage people to come in and build power plants in
California, and what we need is more power plants _ very, very
badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent System Operator board member Barbara Barkovich said
the board made the decision in spite of some pressing concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the votes show that there are real concerns about all
these issues,'' said Barkovich, who is also an energy analyst.
``It's a judgment call for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the price cap for electricity in the
state has been argued over and adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, prices for electricity soared as high as
$9,999 per megawatt hour. That translates into $9.99 per kilowatt
hour, compared with a more typical price of 3 to 5 cents. There
were not enough generators to produce electricity in the state, and
the lack of competition opened the door to price gouging.
</P>
<P>
   A price cap in a competitive market is generally seen as a
temporary means of addressing market design flaws or other
problems. During the summer of 1998, the Independent System
Operator imposed a cap of $250 per megawatt hour, which it later
lifted to $750.
</P>
<P>
   During the week of June 12, the cost for electricity for all
users in California was more than $850 million &LR;   &LR; _ three times the
most expensive week for electricity last year _ a red light went up
again. Utility officials and consumer groups said the astronomical
prices signal that the market is not functioning properly.

WORKING IN A COSTUME ISN'T ALL YABBA-DABBA-DOO  &HT;     BY DAVID LAZARUS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
I gazed into the mirror and a 7-foot-tall Yogi Bear stared back.
<P>
   ``Ready?'' asked Rod Edora, who runs the costume department at
Paramount's Great America theme park in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering that costumed characters must never, ever speak, I
awkwardly nodded Yogi's huge, heavy head, which was clamped firmly
to my own and fixed in place via a strap around my chest.
</P>
<P>
   I struggled to see out of the small holes hidden in Yogi's nose
and mouth. My breathing sounded like I was in a deep-sea diving
rig. Sweat was already cascading down my face.
</P>
<P>
   Cautiously, I shuffled in my furry Yogi boots toward the door,
dipping to get through doorways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you go outside,'' Edora said, ``you are onstage. You have
to stay in character, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded once more, bent to get through the doorway and stepped
into the sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   From this point on, I would be Yogi Bear.
</P>
<P>
   The performers inside the costumes are the unsung heroes of the
theme-park world. Wandering the grounds in oven-hot outfits
weighing as much as 30 pounds, they fill in the gaps between
scream-inducing attractions and often create the most memorable
experiences for younger visitors.
</P>
<P>
   What most people probably don't &LR;   &LR; know, though, is that almost
all the costumes at Great America are inhabited by kids themselves,
usually 16- or 17-year-olds enjoying what is arguably one of the
niftier summer jobs in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like one of the funnest jobs you can ever have,'' said
Monique Rutherford, 17, a student at the School of the Arts in San
Francisco who frequently appears as Cindy Bear, Yogi's girlfriend
in Jellystone Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bring your own personality to it,'' she said. ``Normally,
I'm, like, quiet. But when I'm Cindy, I'm like the bomb. You like
walk and shake your little Cindy butt.''
</P>
<P>
   This level of, like, commitment is shared by most other young
performers.
</P>
<P>
   Bedrock Bonding
</P>
<P>
   Greg Larsen, a 16-year-old student at James Logan High School in
Union City, adopted a serious expression as he inspected the
costume for Fred Flintstone's pal Barney Rubble in the backstage
wardrobe room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I connect with Barney,'' he said. ``You try and be the
costume. I'm no longer Greg. I'm Barney Rubble from the town of
Bedrock. I have a wife named Betty.''
</P>
<P>
   And Justin Chapman, 19, who has just finished a drama program at
Delta College in Stockton, sees his role as Scooby-Doo in one of
Great America's stage shows as a steppingstone toward a career as
an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make your actions so much bigger to get across to
the audience,'' he said. ``I think a lot more now about what I'm
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   To underline this point, Chapman talked about how he prepared
for his part as an 8-foot-tall crime-fighting dog. He said he did
considerable research on the Internet, as well as pore over
background briefings from the character's creator, animation
heavyweight Hanna-Barbera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet you didn't know that Shaggy's real name is Nashville
Rogers,'' Chapman said of Scooby's human sidekick. ``That's not in
the cartoon. That's just something Hanna-Barbera made up for the
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen chimed in that his own research revealed that Fred
Flintstone's ``Yabba-dabba-doo'' yell actually was inspired by an
ad for Brylcreem hair lotion (``A little dab'll do ya'').
</P>
<P>
   Great America officials say such extracurricular study is
encouraged among performers. It complements the training _ basic
movements, do's and don'ts _ provided by park staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you know about your character, the better you're
going to do,'' said Edora, the costume manager. ``We like to see a
lot of job-related research.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, he admitted, ``job-related research'' means
sitting around watching lots of cartoons _ something all the young
performers agreed was a pretty cool way to spend one's summer
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed that, at a starting salary of $6.50 an hour,
this isn't a job you do for the money. ``We could get paid less and
we'd still do it,'' said Christina Gaines, 15, who often appears as
Boo-Boo, Yogi Bear's partner in pic-a-nic basket theft.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; First Rule _ Be Animated
</P>
<P>
   Keith Clausen, Great America's entertainment operations manager,
said the park holds auditions for performers each fall. Usually, he
said, about 500 people will try out for just 35 or so openings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tight,'' Clausen said. ``It's very competitive. What
we want is that spontaneity, an ability to take risks, to take
command. We want an ability to be with a guest and make them feel
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clausen should know. In a former job at Universal Studios in Los
Angeles, he played the Mummy and the Wolfman, among other
characters, and has even been known to don the Scooby-Doo costume
in a pinch _ making him, at 50, probably the oldest person ever to
appear as a Great America character.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no words to describe the really cool feeling you
get,'' Clausen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cool wasn't how I felt as I made my way toward the park's
KidZville area, trailing my ``escort,'' Kaleena Zanders, 18, who
would serve as my eyes and ears when interacting with crowds. (All
characters are accompanied by an escort. It's too easy to become
disoriented otherwise.)
</P>
<P>
   Beneath my costume I wore a T-shirt, shorts, socks and a
headband, and still I was broiling before I stepped through the
gate and into KidZville. Outside, the temperature was in the
mid-80s. Inside my outfit, it must have been near 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Yogi!'' I heard a kid shout from somewhere, and Zanders
steered me in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't remember how Yogi Bear was supposed to walk. The
brief orientation I'd been given hadn't covered this point.
</P>
<P>
   Improvising, I quickly came up with a who's-the-man sort of
strut _ as if Yogi had starred in ``Saturday Night Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   A Fleeting Embrace
</P>
<P>
   Through my tiny view holes I made out a pair of small girls
coming at me like little missiles. ``Yogi!'' one cried, slamming
into my padded belly. I bent down as best as my costume allowed and
gave her a loose hug.
</P>
<P>
   The other girl followed suit, and again I hugged back.
</P>
<P>
   This was a strange experience. Reconstructed by years of
political correctness, I had grown accustomed to a few simple
rules, one of which being that you don't ever touch children you
don't know, let alone give them a hug.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here I was exhibiting behavior that, under virtually any
other circumstance, would have landed me in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hug is OK,'' Edora had told me earlier. ``But you want to
keep it simple. You don't want to move up and down the back of the
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcompensating, I kept my hugs relatively brief, favoring
instead a friendly pat on the back or a ruffling of hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yogi, over here!''
</P>
<P>
   A parent wanted me to pose with her kids. I waved and
instinctively smiled, forgetting, as I would again and again, that
my face was hidden beneath a big grinning bear mask.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Liberation, Feet First
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's something immensely liberating about being in
costume. I'm not the sort of person, for example, who dances about
in public.
</P>
<P>
   But with the park's loudspeakers playing an endless stream of
light, chirpy tunes, I soon found myself filling the brief moments
between encounters with little impromptu jigs and shuffles _ a Yogi
Bear who was either profoundly happy or heavily medicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Yogi!''
</P>
<P>
   I waved in the approximate direction of the voice. I couldn't
see a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Zanders confined my walkabout to KidZville. This was undoubtedly
deliberate. I'd been warned by other performers that things can get
a little hairy in other parts of the 100-acre park, particularly
when rowdy teens decide to have a little fun with Scooby or Yogi.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be around teenagers a lot,'' said Larsen,
who connected so intensely with Barney Rubble. ``They're the ones
who cause trouble. You get hit a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Being bopped on the head is most common, with the blow
resonating through your vertebrae. Occasionally a kid might try and
pull your head off, which is why most costumes include chest
straps.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the more intangible hazards. The performers spend
a great deal of time perfecting their characters. They agonize if
the illusion is broken.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Carson, a student at Stagg High School in Stockton,
takes enormous pride in her depiction of Fred Flintstone. When
teens try and mess with her _ not knowing that inside the burly
caveman costume is a 16-year-old girl _ she has learned to defuse
the situation with some hip-hop pantomime intended to put Fred on
the same wavelength as his antagonists.
</P>
<P>
   Illusions Shattered
</P>
<P>
   But Carson still hasn't figured out how to deal with parents who
refuse to join in the fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once had a little girl play with me,'' she recalled, ``and
she said to her mom, `Is he real?' And she said, `No, it's just
someone in a costume.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carson's expression turned somber. ``That really hurt,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Strutting and dancing and waving and smiling (mask or no mask),
I faced no such dilemmas in the half-hour I made my rounds _ the
usual time that a performer remains in costume before returning
backstage for a break.
</P>
<P>
   But as Zanders led me back to the gate, I could feel my energy
and enthusiasm rapidly waning. It's hard work being Yogi Bear. I
couldn't imagine doing it five or six times a day like the pros.
</P>
<P>
   It was with more than a little relief when I finally hauled
myself into the wardrobe room and peeled myself out of the furry
outfit, which, like most other Great America costumes, would head
off for a daily cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Clausen, the entertainment manager, knew exactly what kind of
shape I'd be in. He handed me a towel and a bottle of water. I
chugged it down in a single gulp.
</P>
<P>
   Then I hung out with the other performers, swapping war stories.
I'd paid my dues.

WITH THE M'S HORSES, NO WISHES NECESSARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A closed-door meeting with all sorts of Mariner
front-office people after Thursday's 7-2 win over the Angels made
Lou Piniella late for the postgame buffet.
</P>
<P>
   These are busy times in Marinerville. The team is rolling,
having reeled off an 8-2 homestand with dizzying pitching and
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, before the team headed off to Texas, Pat Gillick, Lee
Pelekoudas and Roger Jongewaard piled into Piniella's office to
talk some things over, calling in pitching coach Bryan Price for a
few words, too.
</P>
<P>
   Could a trade be on the horizon?
</P>
<P>
   As if the poker-faced Gillick is going to give anything away.
</P>
<P>
   While no word of a deal came down, Piniella was at least direct
about the catbird seat in which the Mariners sit.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are so flush with pitching that one can almost
imagine the jealousy and covetousness in places like Cleveland, New
York and Boston, where they are dying for live arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what. We're one of the few teams that you can
say that about right now,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with Freddy Garcia needing at least one more minor
league rehab start and Brett Tomko still on a seesaw as to where he
fits into the rotation, the Mariners will have some adjustments to
make soon in their well-stocked pen.
</P>
<P>
   Now that starters Gil Meche, Paul Abbott, Jamie Moyer, Aaron
Sele and John Halama are going six or more innings, the strain on
middle relievers has diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Rodriguez, Tomko and Robert Ramsay are finding it hard
to get work with Jose Paniagua, Arthur Rhodes, Jose Mesa and
Kazuhiro Sakaski locked in. The late innings have been clockwork,
not fireworks as in previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Rhodes extended his shutout streak to 13 innings.
Paniagua got the win, knocking his June ERA down to .074.
</P>
<P>
   And, Mesa _ who fans and talk show hosts said might as well be
cut after that nightmarish loss to Tampa Bay _ was again
overwhelming in relief, striking out three of the five batters he
faced.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa has benefited from four days of intense instruction from
Price, who moved Mesa to the right side of the rubber, making the
ball harder for the batters to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   Price has encouraged Mesa to use the four-pitch arsenal he
developed as a starter. He is mixing speeds and angles.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who watched Angels batters fooled by some big
breaking curveballs during the final two games of the homestand, it
is hard to imagine the new Mesa is the same pitcher that had some
people thinking it would be better for the Mariners to eat his $3
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to the Mariners' catbird seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a bullpen like this since Cincinnati,'' Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit like this at the end of '95, but I haven't
had this many options since Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting over a pile of spaghetti laced with some shrimp and a
thin little strip steak, Piniella wasn't going to get on the plane
hungry. Nor was the skipper shy about putting the Mariners' most
pressing needs on the table.
</P>
<P>
   If the team is stocked with arms, it is missing a key ingredient
for countering pitching moves by opponents and helping run
production, Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just lost a left-handed bat in our catcher with (Tommy)
Lampkin out (for the season with ligament damage to his elbow.) If
we can add one, we're going to try and do it,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Accentuating the mood for player movement was the news that the
Yankees traded outfielder Ricky Ledee to Cleveland for David
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, we have been told, have been working the phones
the last few weeks, looking for infield help and left-handed bats.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, it seems as if it's going to be the Mariners
getting the calls, not making them.
</P>
<P>
   They are in the envious position of inviting suitors to make
them an offer _ a rare thing considering this was a team that once
sent away Jason Varitek and Derek Lowe in one foolish deal, just
because no one worked hard enough to stockpile the kind of goods
other teams would come crying for.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the turn of events in Marinerville:
</P>
<P>
   ``John Hart (Cleveland general manager) called here and said
they knew we were interested in a left-handed bat but they said
they were pretty far down the road with one team already,'' said
Jongwaard, vice president of baseball operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they were all the way down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is, while the Mariners may not have had a lot of time
to ponder this deal, they are being offered good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   They are the ones who are in a position to barter from strength,
not weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the paucity of left-handed bats in the Mariner line-up
was hard to distinguish.
</P>
<P>
   That's because John Olerud and Stan Javier both rapped homers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Olerud had two. Raul Ibanez stroked a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``See what left-handed hitting does?'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   If the skipper gets his wish, we might see what more left-handed
hitting does, if the M's get the right call.

SCATHING REPORT OF AMAZON IS A MUST-READ FOR STOCK OWNERS 
 &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's blistering report on Amazon.com by Lehman Bros.
convertible bond analyst Ravi Suria is a must-read for anyone
owning stock or bonds in any dot-com company.
</P>
<P>
   But unless you're a Lehman client or a reporter, it's not easy
to get your hands on the full report, which is even more damning
than snippets you might have read.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site  &LR; www.multexinvestor.com  &LR; will begin selling it
Monday for at least $75. But it probably won't be offered on
 &LR; www.amazon.com &LR; . So it's worth quoting from at some length here.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-page missive is unlike anything you'll see from a stock
analyst. That's because research is becoming a key sales tool for
Wall Street investment banks, and most firms are squeamish about
publishing anything that might jeopardize a stock-underwriting deal
from an existing or potential client.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Lehman Bros. also underwrites bonds, and why Suria was
allowed to take Amazon apart limb by limb is a mystery. Suria says
he's stopped talking to the press ``for political reasons.''
(Lehman's equity analyst has a buy rating on Amazon stock and is
none too happy about her colleague's June 22 report on its bonds.)
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's stock fell from $46.06 the day before the report was
released to $33.88 the day after. It has since rebounded to $37.13,
thanks to a herd of Wall Street bulls who rushed to Amazon's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of what's in the report had previously been reported in
bits and pieces. What makes it powerful is the way Suria builds his
case, using numbers, charts and caustic wording.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the company will run out of cash within the
next four quarters, unless it manages to pull another financing
rabbit out of its rather magical hat,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   The report is nominally about Amazon's two huge convertible bond
issues. Convertibles are bonds that can be swapped for stock at a
presetrate. But it's really a critique on Amazon's fundamental
business plan.
</P>
<P>
   While stock analysts generally focus on the income statement,
Suria concentrates on cash flow, a complicated analysis that most
investors ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the fourth quarter of last year, Amazon evolved from a
virtual business to a real-world retailer,'' he writes. ``While the
operational characteristics of Amazon are not that different from
an online retailer, they are a lot more distressed than even
mediocre real-world retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``fundamental problem,'' he continues, ``lies in the fact
that Amazon does not generate positive net cash flow per unit of
product it sells.''
</P>
<P>
   He lays part of the blame on Amazon's poor inventory management.
Amazon's inventory turnover _ how many times a firm's inventory is
sold and replaced during a period _ has steadily declined,
``clearly reflecting an inability to effectively manage sales
growth.'' He says that from 1998 to 1999, sales grew 170 percent,
while inventory grew 650 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As the company moves into toys and electronics, ``managing
inventory is going to become more difficult,'' he writes. ``We
believe that the upcoming holiday season is going to be a
significant operating and logistics challenge for the company and
could largely determine the credit outcome for debt holders.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has been able to finance its negative operating cash flow
by borrowing money _ tons of it. Its $2 billion in long-term debt
accounts for an astronomical 99 percent of its total
capitalization, compared with43 percent for Barnes &AMP; Noble and 28
percent for Borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1997 through the latest quarter, the company has received
$2.8 billion in funding, while its revenues have been $2.9 billion
_ a whopping 95 cents for every dollar of merchandise sold,'' Suria
points out.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Amazon starts generating positive cash flow, it will have
to raise more capital. And that won't be as easy as it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Given its high debt load and dearth of tangible assets, Suria
doesn't see bank loans, high-yield (junk) bonds or more convertible
bonds as a likely option.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon could sell more shares, ``but given that the stock is
down more than 55 percent from its highs, it is likely to be
difficult,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A strategic investor could come to the rescue, such as ``Prince
Alwaleed, who loves to make cash infusions into cash-starved
world-class brands,'' he writes. Or, Amazon could sell private
equity to a buyout fund, a portal company or a real-world retailer.
But such an investment would take a backseat to $2 billion in debt,
``which might be a sticky point.''
</P>
<P>
   Less obvious sources of financing: Amazon could use its stock to
acquire a company with a cash horde (it's done so before). And then
there are Amazon employees, who could help out by exercising stock
options. (That raises money because employees have to buy stock
from the company before they can sell it.)
</P>
<P>
   However, Suria points out that ``from a credit perspective, it
certainly is not good for a company to depend upon cash from
employee option grants for its funding needs.''
</P>
<P>
   His conclusion: ``At the end of the first quarter, the company
had approximately $1 billion (in cash). Going into what is arguably
its most challenging holiday season, we believe that the
combination of negative cash flow, poor working capital management
and high debt load in a hyper competitive environment will put the
company under extremely high risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe that the risk in the credit is priced into
the convertible bonds and therefore recommend that investors avoid
the securities.''
</P>
<P>
   AMAZON'S RESPONSE: Amazon has criticized Suria for not
consulting the company before writing the report. His response:
``Anything I need to know is in the company's (SEC) filings.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Stone, Amazon's director of investor relations, says the
report is ``a point of view that is based upon a historical
analysis rather than taking into consideration where the company
and many other folks think the business is going.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, he says Amazon will be ``strongly growing sales on a
year-over-year basis while also driving operational improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicts the company's pro-forma operating margin (operating
loss as a percent of sales) will shrink from 26 percent at the end
of December to 17 percent at the end of March to ``single-digits''
by year end.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those improvements, he thinks the company will turn
cash-flow positive by December and will end the year with $1
billion in cash. That would obviate the need for additional
financing, although he says the company won't rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   Stone disputes Suria's criticism of Amazon's inventory
management. ``In periods going forward, we would expect that we
would turn our inventory faster than has been in the case in the
physical world. We have warehouses that (allow us to) ship directly
to customers, so we don't have to deploy merchandise from
warehouses to retail stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon says it will increase sales by expanding products,
services and customers here and abroad and enhancing its
relationship with existing customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the expense side, we will improve the way we operate our
distribution network,'' rather than building new distribution
facilities, like it did last year.
</P>
<P>
   A BULL'S OPINION: Henry Blodget, an Internet analyst with
Merrill Lynch, believes that Amazon can turn itself around this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first five years, Amazon emphasized growth and
customer service at any cost. In 1999, it built 10 times as much
distribution capacity as it had the prior year. When you're
building that quickly, it's extremely difficult to run efficiently.
At the end of last year, it was as inefficient as it will ever
be.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Amazon will emphasize efficiency over growth.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget believes the company can achieve positive cash flow by
year end, although it will go negative again early next year when
it pays off its Christmas bills. (Amazon demands payment upfront,
via credit card, from its customers, but it can stretch out its own
payments to suppliers.)
</P>
<P>
   He believes Amazon now ``is where AOL was in 1996. There was
tremendous controversy. Lots of smart people were convinced (AOL)
would never make money.'' And yet thanks to strong management, it
maintained its leadership position in an enormous market. ` &UR; ` &LR; Those
situations, if they work out, make for goods stocks. But they don't
always work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Blodget thinks Amazon will work out, ultimately. ``If you're a
long-term investor, go ahead and buy now. But it's not going to be
a heroic stock in the near term.''

JIM ROYER, FORMER FOOTBALL EXECUTIVE, IS DEAD AT 69 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Royer, who for 20 years oversaw efforts by the New York Jets
to assess and sign players on other National Football League teams,
died Tuesday. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Royer joined the Jets in 1975, in what was the midst of a decade
of futility. The Jets did not have a winning season from 1970 until
1981. But Royer was part of a front office that acquired enough
quality players to turn the Jets' fortunes around, making the team
competitive for much of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a key person in the development of the team over two
decades,'' the Jets' president, Steve Gutman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Royer's title for much of his tenure before retiring in 1996 was
as pro personnel director. He was intimately acquainted with many
of the league's arcane rules involving the movement of players and
the intricacies of contracts. He not only understood the front
office, but also the play on the field as well.
</P>
<P>
   At a first meeting, especially with player agents who often saw
him as adversarial, Royer could come across as gruff.
</P>
<P>
   A former Marine and a graduate of the United States Naval
Academy, he was precise and serious, at least until he got to know
the person with whom he was dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his graduation from the Naval Academy in 1957,
Royer served as head coach of a Marine Corps team in Okinawa,
Japan. For the next 10 years, he was a collegiate assistant coach
at Navy, Buffalo, Tulane and Pittsburgh. He was also a defensive
coordinator in the Atlantic Coast League.
</P>
<P>
   From there he became the offensive line coach of the New Orleans
Saints in 1970 and then joined the Washington Redskins as a talent
scout, leaving to join a scouting combine and, finally, the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978 he became the Jets' director of pro personnel,
responsible for finding players other teams had cast aside,
including former collegians who did not initially make it in the
pros.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unheralded players he helped sign for the Jets were
Brad Baxter, a fullback; defensive back Jerry Holmes; offensive
tackle Jeff Criswell; nose tackle Scott Mersereau; and Louie
Aguiar, a punter.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Linda; a son, Brian, of New York;
and a daughter, Jamie, of Malverne, N.Y. &QL;

TIME FOR DODGERS TO GET ON WITH IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With 6:11 showing on the Dodger Stadium clock
Thursday evening, Darren Dreifort rocked into his distinctly
uncomplicated windup and delivered a fastball low and away to the
San Diego Padres' Eric Owens - and the 2000 baseball season was
under way.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it felt, anyway. Like a second Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' longest losing streak of the season had ended with
back-to-back, last-at-bat victories the past two nights. The
Dodgers had waived Orel Hershiser two days earlier, and cleared the
sentimental mist from their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier Thursday, baseball eased or eliminated most of the
suspensions stemming from the Dodgers' fight with Wrigley Field
fans - and lifted the wintry cloud that has hung over the team for
more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   It is springtime once again for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for the city to wake up with its Lakers hangover
and ask, ``Hey, are the Dodgers are still in the race?'' Yes, they
are, and now they can turn their full attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Paul Beeston, baseball's president and chief
operating officer, was a repudiation of vice president for on-field
operations Frank Robinson's May 24 decision and a clear-cut victory
for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of 19 suspensions eliminated. Combined player suspensions
reduced from 60 days to 24. All of which said the Dodgers were
right to argue that there weren't 19 guys committing mayhem on the
skulls of Chicago Cubs fans that May 16 night.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers didn't get everything they sought on appeal. They
still must pay the original fines. They still can't choose the
games the suspended players will miss. They still lose Gary
Sheffield for five games; that's the one they'd like to have back.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office didn't back down from its message,
that players should stay out of the stands, even if somebody
pinched a $20 cap.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the commissioner's office realized that it, in
turn, should stay out of the pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   With the easing of the suspensions, it's up to the players to
win or lose the National League West, no excuses.
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson announced the original penalties, I wrote that the
Dodgers could turn their outrage into a rallying cry, that this
could be the misfortune that brings the team together. A couple of
readers asked if I had some other set of Dodgers in mind, a corps
with the (begin ital)esprit(end ital) to rally around.
</P>
<P>
   Touche! Between that day and Thursday, the Dodgers went 15-18,
dropped from second to third in the division, and slipped from 2 to
4 games. They didn't rally. They wallowed.
</P>
<P>
   Now they can move on.
</P>
<P>
   A further appeal on the players' behalf by their union is
scheduled. The Dodgers should not encourage it.
</P>
<P>
   They should count their blessings and their legal victory. In
the language of Wrigley Field: Dodgers win! Dodgers win!
</P>
<P>
   Nice way to start a season.

TOBIN ROTE, 72, A CHAMPIONSHIP QUARTERBACK FOR THE LIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 3rd graf to delete incorrect information about Bart Starr)  By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tobin Rote, an outstanding quarterback for 16 years in three
professional football leagues and the architect in 1957 of the
Detroit Lions' last National Football League championship, died
Tuesday at a hospital in Saginaw, Mich. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Julie, said he suffered a heart attack, almost two
weeks after back surgery. His back and knees were battered from
football, and he had undergone knee replacement and triple-bypass
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Rote began his pro career in Green Bay, playing for the Packers
from 1950 through 1956. The Packers drafted Bart Starr, a future
Hall of Fame quarterback, in 1956 _ even though Rote led the NFL in
touchdown passes (17) in 1955 and went on to lead the league in
passing yards (2,203) and touchdowns (18) in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   During training camp in 1957, the Packers traded Rote to the
Lions, who used him to back up Bobby Layne, another future Hall of
Fame quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   When Layne broke an ankle in the next-to-last game of the 1957
regular season, Rote replaced him. Two weeks later, in the Western
Division championship game, the San Francisco 49ers led the Lions,
24-6, at halftime, and started celebrating early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could hear them laughing,'' Rote once recalled. ``The walls
were paper thin. They were going on about how they were going to
spend their championship game money. It made us angry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Lions scored three touchdowns within
five minutes and won, 31-27. The following Sunday, they routed the
Cleveland Browns, 59-14, and won their third NFL title in six
years. Rote passed for four touchdowns and ran for one.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions were so impressed that early in the 1958 season they
traded the popular, free-wheeling Layne. Then they won only seven
games over that season and the next, and Rote was gone.
</P>
<P>
   From 1960 through 1962, Rote played for the Toronto Argonauts of
the Canadian Football League and broke all their passing records.
When the San Diego Chargers of the American Football League offered
him a $10,000 raise to $35,000 a year, he moved there for two
seasons and led them to a league title. He sat out the 1965 season,
played three games for the Denver Broncos of the AFL in 1966 and
then retired.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin Cornelius Rote Jr. was born in San Antonio. At 6 feet 2
inches and 211 pounds, he led Rice University to a Southwest
Conference title. In 149 games over 13 pro seasons in the United
States, he passed for 18,850 yards and 149 touchdowns and rushed
for 3,128 yards.
</P>
<P>
   After his pro career, he became a corporate executive in
Detroit. In 1993, he and his wife retired to a Lake Huron
waterfront home in Port Hope, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Rock Rote, of
Delafield, Wis., a sports broadcaster; daughters Julie Struble, of
Bay City, Mich., and Toni Stapley, of Woodland Hills, Calif.; seven
grandchildren; a sister, Barbara Rote of San Antonio; and a cousin,
Kyle Rote, the former wide receiver for the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   As a Lion, he never received the credit he deserved, partly
because Detroit fans considered him an interloper from Green Bay
and partly because he replaced the popular, flamboyant Layne. But
his teammates appreciated him.
</P>
<P>
   As Joe Schmidt, the Lions' Hall of Fame linebacker, said when he
heard of Rote's death, ``It was a blessing that he was here.''  &QL;

   IMF TO CONSIDER CHANGES IN CONDITIONS PUT ON LOANS
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, which has ordered developing
nations to enact wrenching reforms as the price for emergency aid
in recent years, is likely to curtail the demands it makes of
clients who borrow money in the future, a senior fund official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Streamlining the conditions the IMF imposes on borrowers is one
of the changes Horst Koehler, the new managing director, is
weighing as a panel he set up to study the agency's role finishes a
draft report.
</P>
<P>
   SEPSIS DRUG LIFTS ELI LILLY SHARES
</P>
<P>
   Eli Lilly said that advanced trials of a drug it is developing
to treat the bacterial infection sepsis had met its goals for
lowering death rates. Zovant, if eventually approved, would be the
first drug to treat complications of the disease, which kills 1,400
people a day worldwide. Lilly said it expected to submit an
application to the Food and Drug Administration for approval by the
first quarter of 2001. Shares of Lilly soared $15.125, to $102.25.
</P>
<P>
   PROFIT WARNINGS PULL DOWN STOCKS
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices fell broadly as several prominent companies,
including Ericsson, Unisys and Goodyear Tire, warned of
lower-than-expected profits. The Nasdaq composite index slid 63.11
points, or 1.6 percent, to 3,877.23. The Dow Jones industrial
average slumped 129.75 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,398.04. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 12.43 points, or 0.9
percent, to 1,442.39.
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINES' PLANS HURT PRICELINE
</P>
<P>
   Stock Shares in Priceline.com dropped 8.4 percent after a report
that six major airlines _ America West Airlines, American Airlines,
Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines, United Airlines and US
Airways _ plan to invest in a competing Web site for customers
looking for discounts on plane tickets online.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST-QUARTER GDP REVISED UP
</P>
<P>
   Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic
activity, grew at an annual rate of 5.5 percent in the first
quarter instead of the 5.4 percent estimated a month ago, the
Commerce Department said, raising the prospect of more
interest-rate increases this year.
</P>
<P>
   DRUCKENMILLER TO REJOIN DUQUESNE
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Druckenmiller, who quit Soros Fund Management in April
and also told investors in his Duquesne Capital Management fund
group that he was taking a break, is now telling Duquesne investors
that he will return in September, according to investors in the
firm. Duquesne, based in Pittsburgh, has about $2 billion in assets
from clients that include Bowdoin College, Druckenmiller's alma
mater in Maine; Berea College in Kentucky; and Denison University
in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   NOMINEE FOR COMMERCE SECRETARY
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton nominated a former congressman, Norman Mineta,
as secretary of commerce for the rest of his presidency. Mineta
would become the first Asian-American to hold a Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   FORD IN EXCLUSIVE TALKS FOR DAEWOO
</P>
<P>
   Ford won exclusive rights to negotiate the purchase of Daewoo
Motor of South Korea with a $6.9 billion offer that would be Ford's
largest foreign acquisition and could significantly strengthen its
operations in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. PROPOSES CHANGES IN SUBSIDIES
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration introduced a sweeping proposal at the
World Trade Organization to change the way governments subsidize
farmers, challenging the European Union's extensive agricultural
subsidies.

200,000-ACRE HANFORD WILDFIRE UNDER CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CANDY HATCHER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. _ Southeastern Washington, charbroiled and
stinky after walls of fire hip-hopped through about 200,000 acres
in two days, began to clean up Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By dusk, firefighters had the Two Fork fire, America's
fastest-growing wildfire in the past decade, under control. The
blaze, fueled by dry sagebrush and shifting winds, burned thousands
of acres in and around the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, including
three old radioactive waste sites.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, it destroyed 36 buildings, most of them homes
near Benton City. It sent one resident to Harborview Medical Center
in Seattle with burns over one-fourth of his body, and 10 others to
hospitals to treat smoke inhalation. It blanketed communities many
miles away with a lingering, acrid odor.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials said they detected no radiation
releases from Hanford, although further tests were planned.
</P>
<P>
   About 900 firefighters, including more than 50 from the
Seattle-Tacoma area, helped fight the fire, which Washington's
emergency response team called ``the top fire priority in the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven thousand people had fled Benton City, Horn Rapids and West
Richland on Wednesday. On Thursday, as they returned home, in some
cases to rubble, they described the fireballs, 30 to 40 feet high,
that had barreled toward them at 40 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were goners,'' said Marty Peck, 43, who left with
his daughter, Kristin, just before one of their two mobile homes
near Benton City was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The family had watched the flames come down nearby Rattlesnake
Mountain, a wall of fire that nothing could stop. Kristin Peck, 17,
had time only to grab a blanket and an album of photographs of her
mother, who died when Kristin was 3.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned, all that remained of the mobile home where
she lives with her grandmother was blackened rubble. But 30 feet
away, her father's mobile home was fine.
</P>
<P>
   The fire razed their barn and destroyed the well and one car,
but it left a car in the same driveway unscathed except for a
melted tail light.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, even as officials declared 40 percent of the fire
contained, flames glowed like bright orange snakes and sent gray
smoke billowing upward. The fire blackened hills and fields for
miles around Hanford, scorching land in some cases to the banks of
the Columbia and Yakima rivers.
</P>
<P>
   At one farm, several horses trotted in a green pasture
surrounded by blackened earth. A white barn still stood, but other
buildings on the property were reduced to rubble.
</P>
<P>
   At another farm, a circular field of crops was split in half _
lush and green on one side, black and burnt on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, smoke from the fires hung in a gray haze above
the rural area, some of it more than 20 miles from the center of
the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   CRASH SPARKED FIRE
</P>
<P>
   The fire began Tuesday with a car crash in dry grass near the
west gate to Hanford.
</P>
<P>
   A car left the road, then veered back onto pavement and slammed
head-on into a tractor-trailer rig. The car's driver died; the
truck driver was injured. The fire, fanned by stiff winds, exploded
Wednesday afternoon as temperatures pushed 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze doubled in size, jumped the Yakima River near the
Wanawish Dam, threatened homes in West Richland and consumed some
outside Benton City. Companies along the northern edge of Richland
sent their employees home.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-third of the sagebrush plain that makes up the
560-square-mile Hanford reservation was scorched. Hanford,
established to help build the atomic bomb during World War II,
contains the nation's largest volume of nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke declared a state of emergency in Benton County,
activating the National Guard to help with evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   COMMAND CENTER
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of people drove from the burning area, hundreds of
others, professionals and volunteers whose job was to quench the
flames, headed toward the smoky desert in 90-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them arrived before dawn Thursday, trudging into a
dense, gray hell with their specialized coats and bunker pants,
leather gloves, thermal boots and helmets.
</P>
<P>
   They worked in shifts, 600 fighting fire and 300 resting.
Helicopters and tankers dropped flame retardant on the fire.
</P>
<P>
   While firefighters worked the front lines Thursday afternoon,
about three dozen emergency workers monitored the fire lines at the
state Emergency Response Center at Camp Murray in Tacoma, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Things had slowed a bit around dinner time in the large room
with a dozen pods of desks, computers and fax machines. The workers
caught their breath between crises in the room lined with maps and
bulletin boards. They had nine clocks set in different time zones,
and 16 televisions and three giant screens tuned to the news and
fire line maps.
</P>
<P>
   Each pod of desks had its own focus, from the National Guard to
the state social services to the media.
</P>
<P>
   At the cluster responsible for coordinating firefighting
resources, Trooper John Farrow of the State Patrol fire prevention
bureau and his colleagues coordinated which resources went where.
Sometimes, he said, especially in the first hours of a fire, that
requires balancing the needs of firefighters demanding help with
fire departments spent beyond their resources.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Farrow's 18-hour workday Wednesday, fire had torn
through about 100,000 acres and the emotions of those calling
Farrow for help had worn raw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen that often, but (Wednesday) night it
happened,'' Farrow said. ``It's not a pleasant thing to deal with
folks who are desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   `HOLD YOUR BREATH'
</P>
<P>
   In much of the Tri-City area, people were looking forward to the
holiday weekend. Nearly 6,000 Jehovah's Witnesses came to town for
a convention, filling hotels in Kennewick. The Tri-Cities Visitor &AMP;
Convention Bureau was busy trying to find hotel rooms for reporters
covering the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cups runneth over,'' said one bureau worker who cited the
soccer tournaments and horse shows and Jehovah's Witness convention
that would keep the community hopping through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The River of Fire Festival, slated for July 4 in Kennewick, is
still scheduled. Ditto, luckily, for Benton City's Eighth Annual
Blues Festival July 7. The festival, appropriately, is featuring
barbecue and blues.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Brodzinski, owner of the Seth Ryan Winery hosting the
festival, said this week's fire wasn't the first time her family
has had to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, who lives on the back side of the winery along Highway
224, called Wednesday night, asking what he should pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the sagebrush,'' Brodzinski said, ``it's a very serious
thing. You do kind of hold your breath.''
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporters Angela Galloway, Hector Castro and The Associated
Press contributed to this report.

OLYMPICS: A TALE OF THE TAPE
</HEADLINE>
 IN FOURTH GRAPH TO 9 1/2-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dick Ebersol should have been drooling
uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, as the chief of NBC Sports was beamed via satellite
to all the network affiliates Wednesday to give a progress report
on the upcoming coverage of the 2000 Sydney Olympics, he subtly
slipped in a few interesting facts that, when closer examined,
should have a chilling effect on the future coverage of live
sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Due to the advertising sales and contributions from the
affiliates, ``we will eke out a small profit,'' Ebersol said,
mentioning that the $705 million in rights fees the network had to
put up for this event would probably be offset by $900 million in
sponsors contributions.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, there's going to be fewer advertising minutes per
hour during the 84 hours of prime time - just 9 minutes as opposed
to the 9 1/2 that they did in Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, they project more viewers for these Aussie games
than watched four years ago - 215 million, this after Atlanta set a
record with 206 million, he figured they'd actually lose about $70
million on the proposition.
</P>
<P>
   And, he repeated for those hard of hearing, it'll all be on tape
- 441 hours, divided up between the network and its two cable
channels.
</P>
<P>
   All of which only reinforces the foundation of his grand scheme.
No matter how much anyone screams for a live Olympics, it doesn't
make business sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several years ago, we made the decision for all videotape,''
Ebersol repeated, despite the fact some media outlets still believe
he'll change his mind sometime before the Sept. 15 opening
ceremonies. ``The first three days of the Olympics, we've made a
commitment to telling viewers that it's all on tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Rub it in, more like.
</P>
<P>
   We've already been over the fact that a prime-time event in
Australia will pretty much be a prime-time event on the West Coast
(which is 18 hours behind). That means West Coast newspapers will
have a fair amount of same-day results of major events in the next
day's edition. But NBC will show them about 24 hours after they
happen.
</P>
<P>
   And most of those NBC events, Ebersol disclosed, will be the
``family coverage,'' or individual-type sports that fall into the
``Up Close and Personal'' category, such as swimming, gymnastics
and track and field. The cable outlets - MSNBC and CNBC - will be
the dumping ground for team sports and boxing.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're hard up enough to actually want to know results as
they happen, Ebersol said that the network's Web site -
nbcolympics.com - will take care of that.
</P>
<P>
   Which, again, is great news for anyone who doesn't have cable
TV, let alone a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Apologist: All it took for Lakers center Shaquille
O'Neal to get back into the good graces of his fellow striking
Screen Actors Guild members was to issue a nice statement of
support following all the guff he took for his participation in the
gratuitous Disneyland commercial after the Lakers won the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through two work stoppages in my career, and I know
how very difficult they are to union members and their families,''
O'Neal's statement read, making no mention of how agent Leonard
Armato has been trying to spin the appearance as a public service
announcement. ``As a SAG and AFTRA member, I fully support the
strike and hope that negotiations can resume in the very near
future so both sides can get back to business as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A SAG spokesman told the Hollywood Reporter that O'Neal wouldn't
face disciplinary actions, but SAG joint strike committee chairman
Todd Amorde was quoted as saying: ``I have a real issue with
Disney, with Nike and all these other corporations making a cynical
grab to exploit young athletes and performers during their moment
of glory and use them to bust our unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's bite: Notice how no one in the TNT studio would follow
up when Charles Barkley tore into the Clippers after they picked
high schooler Darius Miles during Wednesday's NBA draft coverage?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Clippers are a good environment for the
Miles kid,'' said Barkley, who wasn't in the studio but at his home
doing remote analysis. ``They are a terrible organization ... I
hope he gets out of there. They should've re-signed their two free
agents (Derek Anderson and Maurice Taylor).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clippers are one of the problems in sports. People think
you have to win to make money, and the Clippers are a perfect
example of a team that lets all of their good players go every year
and just keeps giving the fans a bad product. People assume that
every organization is trying to win, and there's just no excuse for
what the Clippers have been doing the last 10 to 15 years, letting
all their good players go.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the gang in Minnesota, anchor Ernie Johnson and analysts
Rick Majerus, John Thompson and Kenny Smith were as responsive as a
snow plow.
</P>
<P>
   At least Thompson has an excuse - he's been mentioned as a
possible new Clippers coach. In fact, after the team traded for
Orlando's Corey Maggette, Derek Strong and Keyon Dooling, Thompson
said: ``It may be time to go back for another interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Might as well. Your TV work has shown an astonishing display of
mediocrity since you left Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   More interoffice bashing: It was crazy enough for the Atlanta
Braves to order that TBS broadcasters Skip Caray, Pete Van Wieren,
Don Sutton and Joe Simpson be left off the charter after they
exposed the shortening of the catcher's box at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   You know that they all work for the same company, right? Imagine
the Fox-owed Dodgers punishing Fox Sports Net play-by-play legend
Vin Scully by making him fly commercial after he questions another
one of Davey Johnson's suspect managerial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But then, CNN sports anchor Vince Cellini, another Time-Warner
employee under Ted Turner's fiefdom, throws in his opinion on
Tuesday's ``Sports Night'' after the broadcasters were reinstated:
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta get a timeout. I mean, kicking the Braves announcers
off Monday's chartered flight to Montreal is beyond absurd. I never
thought the acerbic Skip Caray could ever be a sympathetic figure,
but Braves president Stan Kasten made it happen. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing the Braves needed was another public relations
gaffe - but old Stan served one up. ... Is that how you treat
longtime employees? How petty. How small. And this announcer
doesn't care how this flies with Stan.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Cellini and the points over Kasten in the company picnic's
water balloon toss competition.
</P>
<P>
   The last word: Said Skip on the TBS telecast as John Rocker
walked off the mound after throwing a shutout inning against the
Mets on Thursday night and went straight to the dugout: ``Not a
word, my friend ... way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   -The sight of 1150-AM's Arnie Spanier hosing down cars in Studio
City on Thursday, making good on a promise to wash everyone's
vehicle in L.A. if the Lakers won the NBA championship. It may not
be the most original sports-talk radio promotion, but at least this
does the city good while wasting some of Northern California's
water at the same time. Spanier took it upon himself to even steam
clean a few engines - using only his own breath.
</P>
<P>
   -The extended piece - 14 minutes, in fact - that Fox Sports
Net's National Sports Report did on Atlanta Braves pitcher John
Rocker during Wednesday night's ``Open Mike'' segment. Credit FSN
producer Sean Pamphilon with doing a masterful job editing the
various opinions from national journalists, clergymen, an AIDS
activist and kids who live in Macon, Ga. - Rocker's home town. It
was then followed up by some interesting commentary by anchor Keith
Olbermann, who questioned the media's role in how to cover this
``story,'' including whether Fox Sports Net was justified in doing
this piece considering it could be construed as promotion for its
airing Thursday night's Braves-Mets game (plus Saturday's game on
the network to nearly half the country).
</P>
<P>
   -Fox and NBC told baseball there'd be no walk-off victory after
the networks were informed it'd be in their best interest to pay
triple the rights fees if they wanted to keep promoting their
product on an annual basis. If Fox has to pay $345 million a year
(instead of $115 million) and NBC is supposed to kick in $240
million (over their current $80 million), guess who's gonna be
footing that bill?
</P>
<P>
   -Marv Albert, on TNT's coverage of Wimbledon, talking about
ex-UCLA star Justin Gimelstob on Wednesday's telecast: ``Recruiters
made certain to keep Justin away from Bill Walton before the
decision was made to attend UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   -First Anna Kournikova, now Dennis Miller on the cover of Sports
Illustrated. Next, a follow-up on the controversy surrounding how
Derek Jeter was No. 2 behind George Clooney on People magazine's
list of the most eligible bachelors in the country.
</P>
<P>
   -Sport magazine will suspend publication following its August
issue, citing a huge loss in advertising revenue, according to
Peterson Publications.
</P>
<P>
   -We now understand why Jason Kapono reconsidered applying for
the NBA draft - had he been picked, UCLA basketball coach Steve
Lavin would have been right there (after leaving the Jermoe Moiso
press gathering) to be his media spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   -Chick Hearn's summer vacation - doing more Sparks games for
KCAL Channel 9. Why not take a break? Starting with Saturday's
broadcast (5 p.m.), he'll be on three of the next four Saturdays.
Did you know: He actually did play-by-play on the Sparks' TV game
Sunday, June 18 - the day before the Lakers' clinched the NBA
title?
</P>
<P>
   -Reader contribution of the week: When ESPN2 aired a delayed
broadcast of Sunday's CART race from Portland, it continued to run
its sports ticker at the bottom of the screen. Which, a half-hour
into the race, revealed the winner.

SPORTS COLUMN: ROCKER SAYS MOVE AHEAD; HE'S RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bearbaiting having been abolished and pigsticking
being currently out of fashion, the public still needs spectacles,
preferably vulgar and ominous.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the spectacle comes in the form of a troubled boxer
named Mike Tyson threatening to eat other people's children, and
sometimes it comes in the tattooed form of Dennis Rodman, saying
anything and wearing anything to get attention.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night the spectacle was the return of John Rocker to
Shea Stadium for the first time since he made his crude comments
about the citizens of New York and particularly the diverse riders
of the No. 7 elevated train that runs from Manhattan to the borough
of Queens in all its zestful ethnic glory. He pitched a scoreless
eighth inning as the Braves beat the Mets once again, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's remarks escalated like some new strain of virus let
loose outside the laboratory of his own mind. But then again, the
news media gave Rocker's remarks the ultimate breeding dish, and
the populace provided the heat.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of blame to go around for the foolish tableau
that had Rocker make a feint toward taking the IRT to the ballpark
until wiser heads prevailed. There was more blame for the dolts who
sent notices of Battery Night for this first visit by the Atlanta
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Stengel used to say that every day in baseball you see
something you never saw before (a pretty strong statement for a man
who managed until he was 75), but it is quite possible nobody had
ever seen a player's mixture of mea culpa and nolo contendere
beamed from a message board.
</P>
<P>
   The Romans, who put men in the ring with bulls, or any other
combination with potential for gore and titillation, would have
been perplexed by the sight of Rocker, looming larger than life
high above the stands, reading a quirky prepared statement he
claimed to have written, and probably did.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said he was ``happy to be back in New York, believe it or
not,'' and he referred with proper irony to ``my presumed hatred
for the people of New York'' and he said he was sorry for the
disruption to all, and he noted that he had apologized several
times already, but he added, ``Many people perceived these comments
to be malicious, and for this again I apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded by saying, ``I am not the evil person that has been
portrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   The early arrivals razzed Rocker, but almost reflexively, which
may be a good sign that the fans are not up to perpetual menace.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sports Illustrated enterprisingly sent down a reporter to
see what manner of chap had come up with a huge case of rabbit ears
during the playoffs, Rocker has been pursued by the furies,
including the occasional scolding from his absolutely perfect
little corner of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's ugly remarks about gays, people on welfare, people who
speak foreign languages and others different from him _ and the
righteousness and the outrage have a cost. Seven hundred police
officers who could have been out righting wrongs (or giving tickets
for parking at broken meters) were deployed Thursday, including
phalanxes at Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker is coming! Rocker is coming!
</P>
<P>
   Rocker is no fool. Some people think this was his Rodmanesque
way of creating a second career as a professional wrestler, which
seems unlikely, but he may surely have been messing with New York's
mind by threatening to ride the No. 7 train, which his team and
baseball was not about to permit. To this particular ploy, Rocker
is entitled to say, ``Gotcha.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he is guilty of starting this madness, by shooting off
his mouth with vile comments that didn't come from nowhere. Has he
learned a lesson? The process seems to have wiped the smirk off
Rocker's mouth, finally.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night police officers were crouching in the front row,
there was a temporary roof and partition around the Braves'
bullpen, and the announced crowd of 46,998 waited to boo Rocker.
The joint was not exactly bristling with the malice that seethes in
New York ballparks during the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   There was room for a few sportsmanlike cheers for the recovering
cancer patient, Andres Galarraga, but the crowd seemed drained by
the eighth inning, until Rocker made his trademark sprint to the
mound. The crowd chanted a few nasty names, but he got three
straight outs and then walked tall to the dugout as a few officers
stood guard. Afterward, he said, ``I'm going to quit while I'm
ahead and not talk, and he did not, while a security guard shooed
reporters away.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for trouble will stay around all weekend, but
maybe outright brutality has been averted at the cost of massive
police overtime. There's got to be a better way to react to a few
dumb remarks.

HOUSE VOTES TO SPEND $1.3 BILLION ON DRUG WAR IN COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 12th, 22nd grafs with quote; SUBS 2nd to last graf to replace
quote)   
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House approved an $11.2 billion spending bill
Thursday night that includes more than $1 billion in emergency aid
to battle drug traffickers and their rebel allies in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to pass the same measure on Friday and
send it to President Clinton for his signature before Congress
adjourns for the weeklong July 4 recess.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has raged over the centerpiece of the legislation,
$1.3 billion to help train and equip Colombian army and police
forces. A crucial component is a fleet of sophisticated transport
and attack helicopters to ferry Colombian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in both major parties have warned that the aid to
Colombia will be a dangerous escalation in an unwinnable
Vietnam-style conflict that has already claimed thousands of lives
in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters, including House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and
Clinton, have pushed hard to help an important Latin American ally
stem the tide of drugs flowing into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to do anything to combat drugs, we must be
responsive to the people who have pledged to fight this plague,''
said Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., who heads the House
Appropriations Committee, which oversees foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   And Hastert, in a statement after the vote, said: ``The crisis
in Colombia will not go away if we stand idly by and do nothing. It
is time to reach out a helping hand to Colombia. This Colombia aid
package is an investment in our future _ a future free from the
scourge of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would also finance the military's peacekeeping
mission in Kosovo, provide disaster relief to flood and wildfire
victims in the United States and make a down payment on a new
Second Avenue subway in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate Republican leaders had bickered for months over
how to package the aid. The House passed a similar $12.7 billion
omnibus bill in late March, but Sen. Trent Lott, the majority
leader, balked at bundling such a wide range of aid, fearing that
it would be a magnet for pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   As the months dragged on with no action, the Pentagon warned
that without prompt financing, the armed services would have to
begin canceling training exercises. President Andres Pastrana of
Colombia cautioned that the delay was hurting his country's
antidrug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators finally worked out a compromise
this week on the size and scope of the package and tacked it on to
a popular spending bill for military construction projects. The
final vote was 306-110, with 171 Republicans and 135 Democrats in
favor, and 44 Republicans, 64 Democrats and two independents
against.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this funding, we will be able to support the courageous
anti-drug efforts of Colombia, which can, in turn, help curb the
flow of drugs in our nation,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans had also hoped to attach an amendment to
permit the limited sale of food and medicine to Cuba. But the
language agreed upon by House Republicans drew a filibuster threat
from Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who said the legislation would
do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuba amendment would bar public and private American
financing for the sale of food and medicine, and it would turn into
law current regulations that restrict which groups _ including
relatives and educators _ can visit Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so wrong, so outrageous,'' said Dodd, who supports
lifting sanctions altogether. ``Only poor and innocent people
suffer when you bar food and medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Cuba leaves the amendment's future uncertain.
House Republicans said they now hoped to attach it to an
agriculture spending bill after the holiday recess, but if
Democratic objections persist, the deal could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package also includes $2 billion to pay for costs the
Pentagon has incurred this year as part of the NATO mission in
Kosovo. The bill provides the military with $1.6 billion to cover
rising fuel costs and $1.3 billion to supplement its health care
program.
</P>
<P>
   Aid was not confined to foreign emergencies. The package has
$661 million to pay reconstruction costs for the 400 families in
Los Alamos, N.M., who lost their homes after the devastating fire
there two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also tucked in were odds and ends, like $17.5 million to improve
fire safety in the Capitol, $4.5 million to reimburse the District
of Columbia Police Department for costs related to protests at
recent meetings of the International Monetary Fund, and $3 million
toward a new Second Avenue subway in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But easily the most contentious part of the package focused on
the antinarcotics aid to Colombia and other countries in the
region, including Ecuador and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   This assistance would lead to a much larger American role in
helping Colombia crack down on a flourishing narcotics trade in
rebel-controlled territory in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Critics assailed the Colombia aid as ill-conceived and a poor
substitute for financing more drug treatment and education programs
in the United States. ``There is no `exit' strategy,'' said Rep.
Mark Udall, D-Colo. ``There is no way to ensure farmers won't
resume cultivating drug crops once this billion-dollar assistance
package dries up.''
</P>
<P>
   The package includes 18 Blackhawk helicopters and 42 Huey II
helicopters, which are needed to ferry special Colombian army
battalions and Colombian National Police. The mix of aircraft
represents a compromise between the House, which favored the
larger, more expensive Blackhawks, and the Senate, which wanted
only the less costly Hueys.
</P>
<P>
   To help address the critics' concerns about the Colombian
military's poor human rights record, the bill includes $122 million
for programs to promote human rights and justice in the region, $29
million more than the administration had requested.
</P>
<P>
   With fears of an open-ended military commitment hanging heavy
over many members, the bill has a provision that limits the number
of American military personnel in support of the Colombia mission
to 500 at any one time, unless more are needed for a rescue
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sending them helicopters, but not troops,'' said
Representative Sam Farr, Democrat of California, who lived in
Colombia for two years as a Peace Corps volunteer, ``but only if
they assure us that they will not violate human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The American aid is going to support an antidrug plan that
Pastrana announced last year, after working closely with
U.S.officials. The strategy, called Plan Colombia, seeks $3.5
billion in international aid in the next three years. Beside the
enforcement components, the plan envisions public investment to
stimulate Colombia's economy.

QUALITY START BY PETTITTE HELPS YANKS STOP A SLIDE
</HEADLINE>
  By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Though the pursuit of a slugging outfielder might have
captivated those who follow trade speculation and might have hung
over the New York Yankees for the last two weeks, it was the woeful
state of the club's pitching that was at the root of the Yankees'
unseemly six-week struggle since May 11, when they were 13 games
over .500.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday night's game against the Detroit Tigers at
Comerica Park, in the wake of a trade that sent David Justice to
the Yankees from Cleveland, the talk was not of how to shore up the
Yankees offense but of just how dramatic the misery of the pitching
staff had been.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone spoke confidently of the notion that all the staff
needed was to get several quality starts in a row to stop its slide
and re-establish the equilibrium of the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night Andy Pettitte, pitching on three days' rest
because the scheduled starter, Ramiro Mendoza, was placed on the
disabled list on Wednesday, stood firm. He said he relished the
opportunity to bolster the staff with this start, but even he had
not counted on such success. He was aiming for seven strong
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently emboldened by the Yankees' eight-run fourth inning,
and pitching aggressively, Pettitte outdid his expectations in
beating Detroit, 8-0, Thursday night. He allowed six hits in
handing the Tigers (32-43) their 10th shutout loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   One night after the Tigers pounded the rookie Ben Ford and the
reliever Allen Watson in a 13-6 demolition of the Yankees, Detroit
succumbed to the first complete game by a Yankees pitcher since the
last time Pettitte (8-4) notched one, on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to be able to give us a good start,'' said
Pettitte, who has one other complete-game shutout in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that all of our problems would go away with a good
pitching performance. Trade or no trade, we win here because we
pitch well. That's the way we've won for four years. Runs are nice,
but good pitching shuts down good offense. I was determined to put
together a good start. It was nice to get something going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (38-35) can exhale a bit with this victory. It was
their first triumph in the Tigers' new stadium after five straight
losses, and it kept them three games behind first-place Toronto in
the American League East as they head to Florida for a three-game
series against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Grimsley is expected to start Friday night and the healing
Orlando Hernandez and Roger Clemens should go on Saturday and on
Sunday. But it was up to Pettitte Thursday night to put a halt to a
stretch in which the rotation was being held together by bandages,
fill-ins and awestruck rookies. Pettitte had been mediocre (1-2,
4.84 earned run average) in the six previous times he had pitched
on short rest, and he had not done it since 1997. But the
left-hander allowed just two hits through the first three innings
before his teammates unleashed a furious assault.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees sent 13 batters to the plate in the fourth inning.
The rally began with Paul O'Neill's single off Dave Mlicki. There
were eight hits in the inning, one a triple to the center-field
wall by Bernie Williams on which center fielder Juan Encarnacion
seemed to have no clue which way to break before watching the ball
sail over his head.
</P>
<P>
   And there were three sacrifice flies in the inning, a feat that
happened one other time, in 1962. It was possible because Jose
Vizcaino's drive to left field with one out briefly nestled in
Bobby Higginson's glove, only to drop out. Vizcaino went to first
base on the error, Scott Brosius scored the fourth run of the
inning, and the play was ruled a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Four more runs followed, the last one on Williams' sacrifice fly
off reliever Nelson Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Such offensive theatrics, even with the acquisition of Justice,
manager Joe Torre said, would not have as much impact on the
Yankees as the revival of the pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``David or Goliath couldn't help us if we don't pitch,'' Torre
said. ``It tells us what we should know already _ all it takes is
someone going on the mound and shutting them down. After that, we
know how to play.''

   Marketplace musings for an extended Independence Day weekend:
</P>
<P>
   The WorldCom-Sprint merger's obit will say it succumbed to
trustbusting zeal, but its demise was more due to bad luck, bad
timing and bad karma.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it passingly curious that the more ``lite'' and ``lo-fat''
comestibles America's food processors bring to market, the more
obesity becomes a problem in this country?
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that because everyone has come to have a cell
phone, including scientific researchers, you don't hear nearly as
much anymore about cell phones causing brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   If the Ben &AMP; Jerry decision to sell its touchy-feely ice cream
empire to Unilever proves nothing else, it proves that everybody
has a price.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the overrated things in the world, April in Kansas City
has to be right up near the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   The way scientists keep reversing long-accepted theories, it
won't be surprising if someday somebody purports to discover that
smoking /{prevents/} lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the commercials on television are more interesting than
the programs they help sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   You know there's still some sanity left in America when ABC's
Earth Day television special with Leonardo DiCaprio does a ratings
pratfall.
</P>
<P>
   Wake me when Kansas City gets a big-league hockey franchise.
</P>
<P>
   You're getting old if you can remember when nearly all adult
male golfers wore slacks rather than shorts while playing in the
warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   One of the iron laws of nature is that human intellectual
development is inversely related to how much humans think they
know, because the dumbest people are almost always those who think
they know everything.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sad day for anyone in the Kansas City area born before
1940 when KFEZ dropped its ``Music of Your Life'' format.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to fight obesity is to pass a federal law
prohibiting restaurants from serving gut-busting portions of
everything on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to David Stockman?
</P>
<P>
   Do older men with bushy eyebrows appreciate how grotesque they
look?
</P>
<P>
   If GOP congressional candidate Greg Musil thinks the evolution
vs. creationism controversy in Kansas is a vote-getter, perhaps
primary opponents Phill Kline and Gary Morsch can counter by
pledging to resolve Johnson County's vehicle registration mess.
</P>
<P>
   Are all those people yakking on cell phones compulsive talkers,
or are they scintillating conversationalists with loads of
worthwhile things to say?
</P>
<P>
   People who contend that current levels of taxation are
reasonable either don't pay taxes or have more money than they can

   Why should taxpayers have to help underwrite the risks taken by
often affluent people who insist on maintaining beach homes in

 Enesco calls off bid to buy all licensing rights for Precious
Moments  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enesco Group Inc., the primary marketer of Precious Moments
products, has called off a deal to pay Precious Moments Inc. as
much as $175 million for all license rights to the inspirational
art.
</P>
<P>
   Precious Moments products, best known for the figurines of
tear-eyed children, rank among the most popular collectibles in the
world. The Precious Moments line was created by artist Sam Butcher.
Precious Moments also operates the Precious Moments Chapel Center
in Carthage, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Enesco has had the primary licensing rights to the art for about
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation of the deal came three days after Enesco's
president and chief executive, Jeffrey Hutsell, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, which was trading at 30 two years ago, has
lost about 56 percent of its value this year. It closed Thursday at
4, up .
</P>
<P>
   Donna Conklin, an Enesco spokeswoman, said that while she
understood other companies, including Hallmark Cards Inc., had
expressed interest in buying the licensing rights to the line,
Precious Moments Inc. had pledged to continue its relationship with
Enesco. Hallmark is among the primary retailers of the Precious
Moments line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two companies could not come to terms on the deal, but we
are going to move forward with business as usual,'' Conklin said.
</P>
<P>
   M. Allan VanDenBerg Jr., who in April was named president and
chief executive of Precious Moments by Samuel J. Butcher Inc., said
the decision to cancel the deal ``was not based upon the strength
of the brand.'' He said there were other considerations within
Enesco.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that other companies had expressed interest in
buying the licensing rights but said Precious Moments had committed
to remain with Enesco.
</P>
<P>
   It was Eugene Freedman, founder of Enesco, who had persuaded
Butcher to expand his line of inspirational cards into other
products more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   VanDenBerg declined to identify the companies.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Hallmark declined to say whether the company
was a suitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a surprise that our name is out there, but we simply
don't talk about those kinds of plans until we do them,'' said
Julie O'Dell of Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   VanDenBerg said cancellation of the deal would have no effect on
plans to expand the Carthage center, where Butcher and his family
have built attractions that include galleries, gift shops, a
museum, a music and water fountain show, Victorian wedding
facilities and the original Precious Moments Chapel.

 McCormick agrees to additional $1 million civil penalty  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCormick Distilling Co. has agreed to a $1 million civil
penalty, on top of $1 million in restitution it already has paid,
to settle charges stemming from its participation in a scheme to
smuggle liquor to Eastern Europe and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The payment, along with McCormick's earlier agreement to suspend
operations for seven days beginning Saturday, is part of a
settlement that resolves alleged violations of the Federal Alcohol
Administration Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most substantial case, in terms of the
breadth of the penalty, that we have handled in the last 20
years,'' said Jeff Cohen, assistant chief counsel with the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the lead investigative agency in
the case. ``We consider this to have been very serious
misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement ends the agency's investigation of the
144-year-old company based in Weston. It is the oldest continuously
active distillery in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In April, McCormick pleaded guilty in Newark, N.J., to a
misdemeanor charge of falsifying liquor export documents to avoid
paying excise taxes overseas. Federal authorities said the liquor,
disguised as industrial alcohol, was sold by Russian mobsters on
the black market as beverage alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, McCormick paid $1 million to the Ukrainian
government to compensate it for excise taxes it was unable to
collect as a result of the smuggling scheme. The company also
agreed to pay a $10,250 criminal fine to the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick officials were said to be attending a board meeting
Thursday and could not be reached for comment. An attorney for the
company, Christopher Lee Milner of Dallas, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCormick is now in the clear, the two-year probe into
the smuggling scheme continues. Federal authorities are focusing on
mob influence at New York shipping harbors and other, so far
unnamed distilleries. In May, the investigation resulted in the
arrests of seven persons on money laundering charges.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, all natives of former Soviet republics and most
now living in Brooklyn, N.Y., reportedly have ties to Russian
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that undercover agents approached
the suspects, pretending to be acting on behalf of big drug
traffickers in Florida and South America whose operations
``generated a lot of cash,'' in the words of the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The agents gave cash to several of the suspects during more than
20 secretly recorded meetings at different hotel rooms. The
suspects allegedly returned the cash to the agents, less a 25
percent commission or checks payable to dummy companies formed by
the agents.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mosley, director of industrial operations in the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' Kansas City field division, said
he couldn't comment on the ties between the suspects and McCormick,
``other than that product manufactured and sold by McCormick was
going into the hands of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City field division led the investigation of
McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said McCormick has cooperated in the investigation, which
also involves the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service and the Customs
Service. The extent of McCormick's participation in the smuggling
scheme remains unclear _ company officials have not returned
repeated phone calls from /{The Kansas City Star/} over the last
two months _ but court documents filed in New Jersey said a key
official ``within substantial authority'' at McCormick was
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. attorney (in Newark) made the decision not to
prosecute any higher-ups at the company,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed by federal prosecutors alleged that from April
1995 to December 1997, McCormick improperly identified alcoholic
beverages shipped to Russia and Ukraine as industrial products,
using descriptive labels such as ``Cleaning,'' ``Cleansol'' and
``Rainbow Cleaning Solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The company reportedly added food coloring to the alcohol to
make it look like paint solvent, windshield washer fluid and other
industrial products. Once the alcohol was in Russia and Ukraine,
members of the Russian mob were said to have removed the food
coloring and sold the liquor on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said McCormick will pay off the $1 million civil penalty
in installments as part of an agreed-to payment schedule. He said
the company will be barred from importing, selling or producing
distilled spirits during the seven-day suspension.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick, as a privately owned company, does not disclose
revenue figures, so the effect of the shutdown on its finances is
unclear. A group of investors bought the company from Midwest Grain
Products Inc. of Atchison, Kan., in January 1993 for about $2
million.

 Commission to hold hearing on Station's $500,000 bonus payment  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Missouri Gaming Commission will hold a public hearing in
August to learn what happened to $500,000 that Station Casinos Inc.
paid a St. Louis lawyer more than four years ago when the company
was seeking a license to operate in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   That money was part of $870,000 that federal prosecutors said
attorney Michael Lazaroff either misappropriated over several years
or failed to report to his partners as law firm income.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Lazaroff pleaded guilty to multiple charges
of financial fraud and federal election fraud in connection with
that money. Those charges made no allegations of wrongdoing by
Station, which is based in Las Vegas and runs the largest Kansas
City area casino.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in St. Louis said
Thursday that no further indictments or charges were expected in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his plea agreement, however, Lazaroff agreed to
cooperate in the continuing investigation by the Gaming Commission.
He could be called as a witness at the scheduled Aug. 30 hearing at
the Westin Crown Center hotel.
</P>
<P>
   One source close to the case said it was clear the commission
had substantial concerns and that testimony presented at the
hearing was likely to have ``important'' consequences for Station.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Fisher, executive director of the gaming commission, said
Thursday, ``We want to try to determine as best we can what the
facts are regarding the payment of $500,000 to Mike Lazaroff by
Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to bring witnesses in and ask them questions about how
Mr. Lazaroff was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher would not discuss the names of potential witnesses but
said some might have to be subpoenaed to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaroff's St. Louis lawyer could not be reached Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While publicly traded Station denies wrongdoing, it acknowledged
Wednesday in a public statement required by the federal Securities
and Exchange Commission that continuing scrutiny of ``certain bonus
payments'' it made to Lazaroff ``could lead to further proceedings
against the company or its executives, which could result in fines
and other penalties against them (or) restrict their ability to
hold gaming licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The company issued a similar statement in March in its annual
report to the SEC. But that statement three months ago did not
specifically warn that any company executives' Missouri licenses
might hang in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials will not discuss particulars of the
Lazaroff case. But in the past the scheduling of such extraordinary
hearings has cost casino executives their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   When it was disclosed that Boyd Gaming Inc., which operated the
now-closed Sam's Town Casino in Kansas City, indirectly had paid
legal fees to the speaker of the Missouri House _ and that there
may have been a cover-up _ the riverboat's 1995 opening was
threatened until company President Charles L. Ruthe stepped aside.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, three top executives of Hilton Hotels Corp. had to
resign over questionable company payments to associates of a former
Kansas City Port Authority official before the commission would
license its Flamingo casino.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing controversy forced Hilton in 1998 to agree to sell
the Flamingo and surrender its Missouri gaming license.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lazaroff situation, the bonus or ``success fee'' payments
came to light late last year during the commission's routine audit
of Station's books as part of the company's proposed $22.5 million
purchase of the Flamingo.
</P>
<P>
   Questions over the Lazaroff payments scuttled the Flamingo's
sale to Station and later triggered the investigation of Lazaroff
by the U.S. attorney in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has never made a public allegation or comment
regarding the bonus payments. But casino regulators held off
approving the $22.5 million Flamingo sale for three months, until
the purchase contract expired and the deal collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   That delay was considered unusual because Station already was
licensed to operate four other Missouri casinos and several in
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of his law firm partnership agreement, Lazaroff was
entitled to keep only about $9,100 of the $500,000 bonus. In
federal criminal court documents Lazaroff acknowledged he had
deposited the money into his own bank account for unspecified
``personal purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, questions have been raised about whether any
of the money paid to Lazaroff was used to improperly influence any
public officials.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lazaroff case became public in December, Scott M.
Nielson, Station's general counsel, said the company had done
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The payments were all in the ordinary course of business,''
Nielson said. He could not be reached Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement issued late Wednesday, Station said,
``Based on the company's own internal review, the company is
unaware of any improprieties on its part'' and is ``cooperating
fully'' in all investigations.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed in the criminal case against
Lazaroff, the lawyer received five bonus payments from Station,
ranging from $50,000 to $150,000, between June 1994 and June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say the payment of success fees by satisfied clients is
a common practice at the conclusion of a legal matter.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Lazaroff pleaded guilty to one count of
soliciting illegal contributions to the 2000 Democratic
presidential primary campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and former
U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   He also admitted to two counts of defrauding his law partners
and clients through falsified expense account billings and other
records, and by pocketing the $500,000 bonus from Station.
</P>
<P>
   Station's stock closed Thursday at 26, down 1. But gaming stock
analysts appeared unfazed by the news. Jeffrey B. Logsdon at WR
Hambrecht &AMP; Co. initiated Station coverage on Thursday with a
``strong buy'' rating.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ader of Bear Stearns reiterated his company's buy
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Station's stock went down a point in a market that was down
150,'' said Harry Curtis, of BancBoston Robertson Stephens, who
also recommends a buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read it as the Gaming Commission fulfilling its obligation
to be satisfied that there was no wrongdoing by any gaming
operators,'' Curtis said of the August hearing.

EMOTIONS AMONG SPRINT CORP. EMPLOYEES RUN GAMUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elated, angry, uncertain, powerless _ those were just some of
the emotions evoked among Sprint Corp. employees when news spread
this week that the WorldCom deal was nearly dead.
</P>
<P>
   Though some employees traded high fives, others adopted the
slumped-shoulder position, while still others had the
deer-in-the-headlights look.
</P>
<P>
   All of those reactions are normal, says Connie Russell, a
licensed clinical social worker and career development coach who
counts several Sprint employees as clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may be feeling relief, because they think it's over. But
that's a false sense of well-being,'' Russell said. ``Those who
have been reading and watching closely know it's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Sprint employees the again-uncertain scenario is worse,
at least emotionally, than the WorldCom takeover scenario they had
resigned themselves to, whether they believed it to be in their
best interests or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be some who are just numb,'' said Don
Blohowiak, a New Jersey-based corporate change expert. ``The
swinging pendulum _ the `it's on,' `it's off' _ can result in a
meltdown of emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there's no shortage of rumors to keep employees
guessing. On Thursday, speculation picked up that Germany's
Deutsche Telekom would bid for Sprint, sending Telekom's stock down
about 9 percent and Sprint's back up more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Rigdon, a Sprint supervisor in data operations, earlier
this week pondered the company's situation as he stood outside a
Sprint facility after the Justice Department had sued to block the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of in limbo, waiting on some kind of decision to be
made,'' Rigdon said. ``There's quite a bit of consternation about
what's going on. We don't have that much information. My take is
that management and executive staff has to be careful about what
they send down. If the wrong message came down, you'd have a lot of
employees looking to bail out.''
</P>
<P>
   E-mail from Sprint employees in reaction to the news was all
over the place. Each e-mailer sought anonymity, citing job security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Some wrote about an expected increase in departures from their
departments; others wrote about a sense of relief mixed with
apprehension; yet others expressed happiness that the merger was
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now, employees are waiting to see what Sprint's next move will
be.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Chairman William T. Esrey, in a letter issued to
employees after the Justice Department sued, sought to assuage
fears and reassure employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that this has not been easy on any of you either, with
the degree of uncertainty and speculation that you have faced,''
Esrey wrote. ``I ask for your patience as we determine our next
steps in the days and weeks ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company's efforts to communicate with employees may be
met with more jaded attitudes than ever, said Richard Ornce, senior
vice president of Human Resources Management Group in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything (management) says now will be speculation on their
part, and employees know that,'' Ornce said. ``Now, more than ever,
anything and everything they say will be taken with a grain of
salt.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who counsels Sprint employees, agreed that management
would be walking a communications tightrope. Before the merger
foundered, she said, some of her clients were skeptical of
management and thought top executives cared most about their own
security.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Russell added, it's vital that executives at the top make
all employees feel secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to retain employees and try to keep morale buoyant,
because the business is not saleable if there is a mass exodus,''
Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from the foundering merger could manifest itself in
many ways, experts said, including projects being put on hold,
positions going unfilled and promotions being put off _ dynamics
that were already occurring under the pending merger.
</P>
<P>
   Those events, in turn, will have ripple effects on Sprint
workers and their families. They'll calculate their savings, ponder
career options, wonder whether they should go ahead and buy a new
house, whether to put vacation plans on hold, where to send the
kids to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``On certain levels, everything just freezes,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Blohowiak said many employees would be reeling from the feeling
of having once again lost control of a vital part of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see lots of aberrant behavior,'' Blohowiak said. ``The
more people lose control of their workplace situation, which is so
vital to their sense of self worth, the more they try to take
control in other ways. And that can sometimes result in some very
bad situations at home and elsewhere.''

KC COUPLE ARE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND CROSS-COUNTRY MOTORCYCLE RELAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN BORMANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're going to buy a Victory motorcycle, then it only seems
right that you should take a ride on the old Victory Highway.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the morning sun sparkling off his blue V92C on
Thursday, Spike Durkin of De Soto and about 20 other Victory owners
from Texas, Minnesota, Iowa, Virginia, North Dakota and elsewhere
pulled out of the Victory Junction Restaurant in Kansas City, Kan.,
to begin the sixth leg of the cross-country Victory Highway relay.
</P>
<P>
   Brand-new motorcycles on a worn and forgotten highway, which
generally follows U.S. 40, seemed a perfect match to the group of
bikers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great old highway and a great new American bike,''
Durkin said. The first Victory rolled out of the company's Spirit
Lake, Iowa, finishing plant just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The relay was organized by Durkin, known better to co-workers at
Sprint ION as Raymond Durkin. Riders left June 23 from Victory,
N.Y., and will end July 4 in San Francisco. (Victory, N.Y., isn't
on the Victory Highway, but it seemed to fit.) Riders meet the
relay team at restaurants, Victory dealerships and cities along the
way of the 11-leg journey.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Durkin said, he is looking forward to sharing
the road with another Victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot in common,'' Durkin said of the relay members.
``What we have in common is that we're all early adopters, we're
chance-takers.''
</P>
<P>
   Each morning the group passes a baton and a souvenir bag from
team to team. By the time the baton _ custom-made by Victory
machinists _ makes it to San Francisco, it will have passed through
the hands of guys called Spike, Roadkill and Sparky Bill, and
through the paws of Blaze, a Pomeranian dog that rode in a knapsack
with a special safety chain.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the bag reached Kansas City, there were notes from
riders and machinists at the two Victory factories and company
keepsakes. The Kansas City group added a Victory Highway Map from
the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after the first Victory motorcycle was produced, a
handful of people, including Durkin, began swapping stories in
Internet chat rooms about custom-made parts, paint detail and
motorcycle rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turning out to be a tight-knit little community,'' Durkin
said. ``We've been talking to each other for so long. We all wanted
to meet each other.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of brainstorming, the Victory Highway was the
natural choice for that meeting. Durkin and his wife, Trish,
discovered a small Kansas City, Kan., restaurant called the Victory
Junction Restaurant that would become the focal point for the
relay. But it was the menu that really piqued their curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It told about the Victory Highway and we said, what about a
Victory ride on the Victory Highway?'' Trish Durkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The group of bikers has been researching the historic highway
ever since. They pooled their money to buy historic maps and
information on the road. If they have anything to say about it, the
roadway won't be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people out there talking about this old
road they've never seen,'' Trish Durkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Several also set out to see it for themselves before the trip
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some towns have died off, but there's still roads there. Back
in the old days it was the way to get through Kansas City,'' she
said. ``You see old gas stations, you see the markets that survived
and the churches with no houses around them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the maps, the highway was built in the 1920s and
honors World War I veterans. The highway has long since been
forgotten, but it is said to be one of the first paved roads to
stretch from coast to coast. Dated maps provide detailed
descriptions for points of interest along the way, including the
Victory Junction Restaurant. The road generally follows U.S. 40,
with a few exceptions, but the bikers reported that only a few
scattered signs remain.
</P>
<P>
   The group's energy has stirred a curious eye from the motorcycle
maker's parent company, Polaris Industries in Medina, Minn. The
$1.3 billion company is known for its snowmobiles, all-terrain
vehicles and personal watercraft.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Laskin, Victory product manager, thinks the riders' pride
and energy comes from buying an American product.

   The company donated T-shirts and other keepsakes but has watched
from the wayside as club members organize and carry out the

   Laskin would not release the company's sales figures, but said
that more than 3,000 motorcycles had been produced since fall 1999.
The company's nearest rivals are Japanese manufacturers and
Harley-Davidson, which has a plant in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the first American mass-production motorcycle to enter
the market in over 50 years,'' Laskin said. ``There's an obvious
pride of owning a Victory motorcycle.''
</P>
<P>
   If industry leaders are curious about the company's future,
Laskin said they need only look at the tattoos on the riders' arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only a few motorcycle brands that can make that
claim,'' he said. ``That's brand loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   As the club has grown from five to 520 members, the Durkins are
hoping the company and its popularity will grow just as the
Harley-Davidson empire has for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kinship we feel with the Victory group is the same kinship
the Harley riders must feel,'' Trish Durkin said. ``There's
something to be said about buying an American-made motorcycle.''

TWELVE DODGERS SUSPENSIONS OVERTURNED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers' confidence in the appeals process was
rewarded Thursday when it was announced the suspensions of 11
players and third-base coach Glenn Hoffman were overturned by Paul
Beeston, chief operating officer of the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   However, keeping the Dodgers from complete elation were the
suspensions that were upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Chad Kreuter's eight-game suspension and the five-game
suspensions of Gary Sheffield, F.P. Santangelo and Carlos Perez
remain intact, as did their $5,000 fines. Right-hander Mike Fetters
had his suspensions reduced from four games to one and was fined,
but the issue is not over.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter was slated to serve his suspension beginning with
Thursday's game against San Diego, but his suspension was
immediately appealed. Representatives of the players association
are expected to meet today and file appeals on the four other
suspended players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happier,'' Dodgers managing general partner and CEO Bob
Daly said. ``I don't think this will have any major effect at all
on the pennant race. I think last time it could have had a major
effect. In that regard, if you want to call that a victory, then
call that a victory. Now, I think it will have a slight effect but
not a major effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The original suspensions, handed down eight days after the May
16 fight with fans at Chicago's Wrigley Field, totaled 89 games and
$77,000. Each of the fines remained intact, but the number of games
lost were cut to 45. Players were originally suspended by Frank
Robinson, vice president of on-field operations for baseball, for
60 games. After hearing appeals last week in Houston, Beeston
trimmed that to 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were most upset about Sheffield's suspension,
especially since the All-Star left fielder gave what insiders
termed an emotional speech to Beeston at the appeals hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt my teammates were in danger, and I was trying to get
them out of danger,'' Sheffield said. ``If the same thing happened,
I'd do it all over again. I wouldn't change a thing. If you don't
have anything to do with it, the first thing you do is protect your
teammates, make sure nobody gets hurt. When you do that, and get
punished for it, I don't know what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Beeston also set up the schedule to serve the suspensions.
Kreuter was to be followed by Sheffield (July 8), Perez (July 16),
Santangelo (July 21) and Fetters (July 22), though that's on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing Sheff for even one game, it's tough,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``Like I said, he's my best player. ... I don't
like to lose any of them, but I hate for him to be out.''
</P>
<P>
   MLB spokesman Richard Levin was asked what the decision meant to
Robinson's power and how much confidence people will have in
Robinson in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's open to your interpretation,'' Levin said. ``Paul's
role is a sort of an appeals court. After talkin to the players in
Houston, the decision was the punishment should be reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Orza, associate general counsel of the players association,
said appealing each of the remaining suspensions wasn't a given.
However, Kreuter's appeal will be filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that Paul saw the light in overturning the
suspensions of the 11 players, but I'm unhappy the light went off
when it came to the other five players,'' Orza said. ``Frank
originally suspended each player that went in the stands three
games, and the players that got three games had their suspensions
cut. Chad's suspension and the remaining suspensions should be cut
by three games.''
</P>
<P>
   Who hears the next set of appeals must be decided. Usually, it
would fall under commissioner Bud Selig, but the players
association is likely to ask for an independent arbitrator. If
they're not given one, a grievance could be filed to take it to an
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the players originally given three-game suspensions had
it wiped out, including reliever Alan Mills, since traded to
Baltimore. Also escaping game punishment were Terry Adams, Darren
Dreifort, Eric Gagne, Onan Masaoka, Antonio Osuna, Chan Ho Park,
Geronimo Berroa, Shawn Green, Todd Hundley and Eric Karros. Each
were fined $3,000, which was upheld.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I saw the tape, the more I thought everyone was
acting in a manner to get the situation under control,'' Green
said. ``We're in a lot better shape, but when you lose Sheff for
five games, not to mention the other guys, it's still something.''

EVEN NEWBORNS CAN BE TESTED FOR HEARING LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID KLEPPER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shirley Gorrell gently placed the sensor against 3-day-old
Calyssa's forehead. Minutes later, the test Gorrell has performed
reveals nothing amiss with Calyssa's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is obvious in Gorrell's smile. Deaf since
adolescence, Gorrell knows full well the hurdles posed by hearing
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Gorrell volunteers at Research Medical Center, where she tests
infants for hearing loss. She performed her first test Thursday,
using high-tech equipment to evaluate an infant's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The tests done by Gorrell and other volunteers will become
especially relevant Jan. 1, 2002, when Missouri will begin
requiring hearing loss tests for all newborns. Kansas will require
the tests beginning Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The tests alert parents and physicians to early hearing loss and
allow them extra time to prepare for the challenges of raising deaf
children. Detecting hearing loss in newborns is vital if parents
are to prepare for the linguistic and social obstacles that lie
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's good to find out early,'' Gorrell said.
``If they are deaf, it's very important to get an early start.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorrell lives in Olathe, where for years she was a teaching
aide. When she retired, she looked for something to keep her
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteering to help with the medical center's newborn hearing
tests was an easy call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw an ad in the paper, and I thought it sounded very
interesting. I like doing things worthwhile,'' Gorrell said. ``But
I didn't know if they'd let a deaf person do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorrell, as it turned out, was perfect for the job. Because her
patients are notoriously bad at following instructions, the test
relies on brain wave analysis. A good bedside manner, warm hands
and computer skills are all that's required.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babies don't talk,'' she said. ``So I do just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorrell learned how to administer the screening with several
other volunteers. She mastered the computer skills. She learned how
to attach the adhesive sensors that monitor the baby's brain
activity.
</P>
<P>
   During the test, clicking noises are produced in a headset
secured over the infant's ears. A nearby computer uses the sensors
to analyze the infant's brain waves. Differences in brain waves
indicate whether the infant heard the noise. The test is painless _
Calyssa slept through the event _ and usually takes less than 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started as a doctor, 31 years ago, plugging a baby into
a computer was science fiction,'' said Dan Bender, supervising
physician for audiology at Health Midwest, which operates Research
and other area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The test is sensitive enough to detect even slight hearing loss.
That, and its ability to test patients who can't yet talk, makes it
a powerful diagnostic tool, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crucial to catch hearing loss early,'' he said. ``If you
don't, it will affect their reading ability, their linguistic
skills _ just about every stage of development.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as six of every 1,000 children are born with significant
hearing loss. Causes include heredity, prenatal infection,
premature birth and side effects from prenatal medication.
</P>
<P>
   If hearing problems are caught in time, Bender said, parents,
teachers and physicians can prepare children to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gorrell is quick to point out that deafness hasn't kept her
from helping others who might share her silent world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deafness is not really a handicap,'' she said. ``I wanted to
do this, and here I am.''

TECHNOLOGY BREAKS DECADES OF SILENCE FOR DEAF MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN MARTELLARO  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   His wife's lips quivered. His mother dabbed with a tissue at the
corner of her eye. And for the first time in his 30 years, Jason
Curry lowered his voice.
</P>
<P>
   It took him a few moments to figure out how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Deaf since birth, Curry never could tell how loud his voice was.
Not until Thursday, when a microprocessor turned him into a hearing
person for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The processor transmits digital simulations of sound through a
surgically implanted electrode, called a cochlear implant, to
stimulate nerve endings in the inner ear.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, of Kansas City, had the electrode implanted weeks ago. On
Thursday, after waiting for the standard swelling and inflammation
to heal, Curry, his wife and parents and about a dozen more family
members and friends gathered to see it turned on for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   They waited for about 45 agonizing minutes while Barbara
Luikart, supervisor of clinical services at the Midwest Ear
Institute at Trinity Lutheran Hospital, painstakingly programmed
and adjusted his processor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to realize that this is going to be quite
overwhelming,'' Luikart said, moments before turning on the
implant, as Curry's wife, Missy, translated into sign language.
``Just try to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   The switch was flipped. Luikart's was the first voice he heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you hear my voice right now?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hear,'' he responded _ followed immediately by a wince,
a shake of his head and an embarrassed smile. Like that of many
deaf persons, Curry's speaking voice is loud.
</P>
<P>
   While Luikart showed Curry how to adjust the volume control on
the processor, family members took turns greeting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Jason,'' his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Jason, this is Mom,'' said his mother, Emma Curry of
Sedalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Jason,'' said his brother David Curry of Springfield.
``Now you know how damn loud you are all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Brother Douglas Curry of Lee's Summit added, ``Welcome to my
wonderful voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Jason told them all, ``I can't believe you have all put
up with my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Curry could hear the words, all of the statements were
still translated into sign language. While the processor worked,
sending the sounds directly to Curry's brain, they ran into a major
roadblock once they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   He still has to train his brain to understand them. That will
take a long time and a lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Getting the message  &LR; tx:Jason Curry was born deaf July 22,
1969. His mother realized it when he was 11 months old. She banged
some pans together just behind his head, and he did not react.
</P>
<P>
   Many deaf children and their parents immerse themselves in deaf
culture, learning American Sign Language and attending schools for
the deaf. The Curry family chose a different path.
</P>
<P>
   Jason started speech therapy at 13 months of age. When he was 4,
he and his family learned Signing Exact English, a different
language from American Sign Language and one that Jason said more
closely approximates spoken English.
</P>
<P>
   Jason was enrolled in public schools, and his mother went to
school every week to conduct sign language classes for the students
so they could interact with Jason.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first deaf student to attend Central Missouri State
University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in business
administration. He was invited to join the Sigma Nu fraternity and
was the first deaf member in the organization's history nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   He met Missy, who has normal hearing, while he was attending
CMSU and she was at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. He now
works as a financial analyst for the U.S. General Services
Administration while trying to build his sideline as a motivational
speaker into a full-time career.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as a deaf-since-birth 30-year-old, Jason Curry is once
again a pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Luetje, Jason's surgeon and a leader in the field of
cochlear implants, said the procedure usually has its best results
with other types of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Children younger than 5, whose brains are still developing
language ability, can have ``spectacular'' successes with the
implants as their brains become hard-wired to the simulated sounds
they hear, Luetje said. And older people who had normal hearing but
lost it through accident or illness can learn over time to adjust
the auditory centers of their brains to react to the new sounds
produced by the implant.
</P>
<P>
   But patients like Curry don't have the still-developing brains
of children or the auditory frame of reference of those who used to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   They face a long, hard road as they try to learn so many things
the hearing take for granted _ to tell a knock on a door from a
footstep on the floor, never mind the hundreds of thousands of
minute variations that make up human speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to try it, and I don't want to deny anybody the
possibility of improvement in their quality of life,'' Luetje said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every patient hopes deep down that they will be able to
understand the spoken word. And I don't know that he won't be able
to do that. But based on past experience, I have doubts that will
become a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry said he wanted to make the attempt because, although he
was born deaf, ``I'm psychologically and culturally a hearing
person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision from my heart to do this, because I wanted
to sit in the back yard and listen to the birds chirping and frogs
ribbiting. One of the things I've always wanted to do was drive
across an old bridge that makes a creaking noise,'' he said. ``I am
a motivational speaker, and my goal is to do this full time at some
point, because I want to get my message across to people and make
an impact on them in a positive way, and to move my life forward in
a positive way.''  &LR; brk:A new sensation  &LR; tx:``I feel it in my head,
not in my ears,'' Curry told Luikart.
</P>
<P>
   She said that was normal. Patients are often surprised when
their new hearing produces no real sensation within the ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing like what I thought,'' Curry said. But he had
known that would be the case. ``There's a part of my brain that
processes information that has been asleep for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Luikart said people who used to hear normally, then get cochlear
implants, often say the new sound has an electronic, synthesized
quality to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their brains quickly adapt to the new sound,'' Luikart said.
``It's all they know, so it becomes their `normal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Curry vowed to ``break all the (learning) curves for people who
were born deaf,'' and Luikart wasn't inclined to doubt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most motivated people I've ever met in my
whole life,'' she said. ``If anybody is going to do it, he will.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry, meanwhile, just kept marveling at the wonder of sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed it was going to be like this,'' he said.
``It's mind-boggling.''

ROCKER SILENCES NEW YORK FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Last call came in the eighth inning - and John Rocker
picked up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   The beer and boos were expected from the 46,998 fans at Shea
Stadium on Thursday night, but it wasn't until Rocker came on to
help close out the Atlanta Braves' 6-4 victory over the New York
Mets that the crowd witnessed one of baseball's most electrifying
pitchers and not just America's Most Wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after apologizing in a news conference for
inflammatory and often vulgar comments aimed at minority groups,
Rocker faced three batters and retired them all.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out Robin Ventura and retired Todd Zeile and Jay
Payton on ground balls before turning the game over to Kerry
Lightenberg for the ninth. As he walked off, Rocker smiled, not
taunting the crowd the way he had during Game 7 of last year's
National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great moment,'' said teammate Bobby Bonilla. ``I
think this was a big step forward in a lot of ways. It's hard to
understand all that was said, but it is important to move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Braves, Rocker also helped provide a breather from the
charging Mets, who entered the game with seven consecutive
victories and trailed Atlanta by two games in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   But division race or not, there was only one reason the fans
were here. Instead of the usual 60 policemen for a game, there were
more than 700 stationed throughout the ballpark. There even was one
in the visitors bullpen wearing a Braves uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes before game time, the Mets played a videotape of
Rocker's pregame comments on the scoreboard in which he apologized
three times for lashing out at the less fortunate. Reading from a
prepared statement, Rocker said he was sorry people took his tirade
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not the evil person that has been portrayed,'' said
Rocker, who was suspended for the first two weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Rocker's teammates, many who have shunned him in the
clubhouse, said they could sense the gravity of the evening. And it
was just the first of four games in this series with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to concentrate out there,'' Braves catcher Javy
Lopez said. ``The crowd was wild and you just never knew if
something was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Beer sales were limited to two per customer and shut off after
seven innings. And though the Mets battled back in the seventh with
Mike Piazza at the plate representing the tying run, the place
didn't start hopping until Rocker arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think falling behind 4-0 kind of took the crowd out of the
game,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ``I wasn't expecting the
crowd to get out of hand. That just doesn't happen as much anymore.
When I broke in with the Dodgers you'd see five or six fights in a
game against the Giants. It would be whole sections fighting other
sections.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, there were four arrests, one for throwing a rubber ball
at Rocker as he ran from the bullpen. There also were 63 summons
issued for open liquor containers.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who has struggled on the mound in the wake of his
comments, arrived at the team's Manhattan hotel around 2 a.m.
Thursday after the Braves defeated the Expos 7-4 in Montreal. He
was ushered through a side door by security to avoid the crush of
media that was assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, he drafted the brief statement he read to more than
300 media members before the game. He did not take questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is Elian Gonzalez and Jon-Benet Ramsay and now it's John
Rocker,'' Mets starter Rick Reed said. ``There is just so much of
this stuff. It can get to you if you let it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker spent two hours Friday afternoon talking to union
officials at the Major League Players Association, which is seven
blocks from the hotel. Among the points discussed was stadium
security and his own conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ride with the fans on the subway as he had vowed the
past two weeks, Rocker was driven to Shea Stadium in an unmarked
police van. He arrived at 4:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was less than 10,000 by the time Rocker ran onto the
field for batting practice. He stood in the outfield with former
Dodger Trenidad Hubbard, then walked to the railing down the
left-field line and shook the hands of a few Mets fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed pretty normal,'' said Vince Lopez from Coney Island,
who was standing nearby. ``Even though he isn't.''

INSURANCE COMMISSIONER DENIES ANY WRONGDOING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ A day after his hasty resignation, Insurance
Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush denied any wrongdoing, even as a
state criminal probe widened to include one of his former top
aides.
<P>
   Former Deputy Commissioner George Grays, who Thursday became the
first person named in the attorney general's criminal
investigation, was allegedly part of a kickback scheme that
funneled money into his own pocket, sources told The Chronicle
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Attorney General Bill Lockyer's office went to
court to force the Department of Insurance to comply with subpoenas
demanding six years of documents dealing with four foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush submitted his resignation Wednesday, avoiding almost
certain impeachment and Thursday's scheduled testimony before the
Legislature. But his resignation _ which is effective July 10 _
does not shield him from criminal and civil probes.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush said he left to ``clear the cloud hanging over the
department,'' not because of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political world up here, and politics is always part
of it,'' Quackenbush told the Northern California News Satellite
service. ``But it's the world we live in. The situation called on
me to move on and the department to get back to being
professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators were investigating Quackenbush's decision to let a
half-dozen insurers avoid up to $3 billion in fines for mishandling
Northridge earthquake claims by giving about $12 million to
nonprofit foundations he created.
</P>
<P>
   One of the foundations, the California Research and Assistance
Fund, was supposed to spend the money to help consumers with
earthquake claims and finance quake-damage research.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, much of the money went to public-service television ads
highlighting Quackenbush and to groups with no connection to quake
issues but direct links to people in the state Insurance
Department. The Legislature is preparing a final report and will
turn its information over to the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer's office has named Grays, who resigned last April, as
the man who ran the fund from inside the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have obtained materials showing check payments to Mr. Grays
that raise very serious questions,'' said Sandy Michioku, a
spokeswoman for Lockyer.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told The Chronicle that Grays and B.T. Thompson,
director of the Skillz Athletic Foundation, allegedly conducted a
kickback scheme, channeling money from the fund into their own
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Skillz _ a football camp in Sacramento that two of Quackenbush's
children attended _ received $263,000 from the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Grays then received nine $10,000 checks from Skillz, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Thompson acquired an ATM card for the account the
fund's money was in and began withdrawing $300 every day, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Grays' attorney did not return phone calls Thursday. On Monday,
Grays took the Fifth Amendment when he was questioned by the
Assembly Insurance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, Lockyer went to court Thursday to
force the Department of Insurance to turn over documents relating
to four foundations, including CRAF, a title insurance fund and a
foundation for holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena requested 71 categories of documents dating back to
Jan. 1, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After being served with the subpoena, senior officials in the
department failed to respond, return phone calls or establish an
agreement under which the materials would be turned over.
</P>
<P>
   More than two weeks late, the department sent 700 pages,
something the attorney general's office described as ``a grossly
inadequate response.''
</P>
<P>
   No court date has been set for a hearing. A spokesman for the
department said every effort was being made to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department's legal staff has worked arduously to comply
with the 71-part subpoena and if further information is needed, the
department will continue to cooperate fully,'' said Scott Edelen, a
spokesman for the department.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, interviewed in his office dressed in khakis and a
golf shirt, said he thinks victims of the Northridge quake got a
fair deal from his department.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than $15 billion was paid out to the victims of the
Northridge earthquake over the years,'' he said. ``We got another
$78 million over that. There are only a handful of claims left out
there, and most of them are tied up in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush said there are ``misperceptions'' about the
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature investigated something that seemed unusual to
them,'' he said. ``Some of those perceptions came out of heavy
inaccuracies, but I didn't think California should have to go
through more of such a long process.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush also addressed one of the hot questions in
Sacramento Thursday _ whether the insurance commissioner should
remain an elected post or revert to being appointed by the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should be an appointed position,'' he said. ``I
think having someone who isn't involved in politics is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters made the insurance commissioner's post an elected
position in 1988 when they approved Proposition 103.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the legislators who were part of the committee
investigating Quackenbush agreed Thursday, saying the mix of
regulator and politician is a poisonous one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are subject to constant demands for prodigious
fund-raising,'' said Republican Assemblyman Tom McClintock of
Northridge. ``They are subject to many political considerations
that are very dangerous when combined with the responsibility to
impartially enforce the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblyman Jack Scott, D-Altadena, said he is not convinced
the voters should be taken out of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Voters) decided in Proposition 103 that they wanted it an
elected office,'' he said. ``I doubt seriously that they will want
to take away that right.''

 IN THE WAKE OF QUACKENBUSH RESIGNATION, SETTLEMENTS POSSIBLE  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The downfall of Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush raises
the possibility that tens of thousands of Northridge earthquake
victims who were cheated out of property-damage settlements might
get some of the money after all.
</P>
<P>
   Such an outcome is by no means certain. Thorny legal issues are
involved, such as the validity of contracts between the Insurance
Department and the insurance companies and application of the
statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush resigned his elected office Wednesday to avoid
testifying under oath before the Assembly Insurance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings before the committee previously had disclosed that
Quackenbush allowed insurance companies to avoid as much as $3.7
billion in Northridge-related fines by paying a relatively trifling
$12 million into nonprofit foundations he created. The companies
faced the fines for allegedly mishandling policyholder claims in
the wake of the January 1994 quake.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Scott, D-Pasadena, chairman of the Assembly Insurance
Committee, said a bill before the committee would require the
Quackenbush-created foundations to distribute $6 million in unspent
funds to the earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said the Assembly also is looking at ways to force the
companies to pay the fines they avoided and any rightful claims
they withheld. But he said this could prove difficult or
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contracts are contracts,'' he observed, ``and it was a
contract duly signed by the state of California in the person of
Chuck Quackenbush and the insurance industry. So I'm not sure you
can un-ring that bell, but I know that if it is possible, we
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott also advised Northridge quake victims who think they were
cheated to file private lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   One potential stumbling block, however, is the statute of
limitations that applies to insurance claims. Policyholders can sue
their insurance companies for dealings in bad faith or breach of
contract, but only within limited time periods.
</P>
<P>
   The statute of limitations for bad faith expires after two
years, while the statute for breach of contract expires after four
years.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of INSURE30 (100056 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Although the Northridge quake happened more than six years ago,
there may be time in some cases, said San Francisco attorney Ray
Bourhis, who specializes in consumer cases against insurance
companies. He pointed out that the two- and four-year periods
generally begin only after the victim becomes aware of the
victimization.
</P>
<P>
   Bourhis also held out hope that the settlements between the
companies and Quackenbush can be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Can the new insurance commissioner reopen an
inquiry into company violations?'' he said. ``You may very well be
able to do that by making a motion in court to set aside the
agreements, on the basis that they were obtained by a conspiracy
between the Insurance Department and the companies. I predict that
the agreements will be set aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sirola, a spokesman for State Farm, the largest homeowners
insurance vendor in California and a party to the settlements, said
his company's lawyers have pondered that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the authority and power of the commissioner, our people
seem to think there's nothing that says he can't reopen the
settlements, but they're just not sure,'' Sirola said.

 VOTE-BUYING CLAIMS TARNISH END OF RACE  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO JUXTLAHUACA, Mexico _ When Oaxaca state Gov. Jose Murat
came to this mountain town recently to give some well-timed aid to
poor local farmers, he was greeted with lots of smiles.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1,377 people who got an average of $72 each, the money
came at just the right moment _ the start of the rainy season _ to
help with planting corn, beans and wheat on their tiny farms.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fact that Sunday's federal elections were only
two weeks away was lost on no one.
</P>
<P>
   As Murat's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) fights
desperately to keep its 71-year hold on the presidency and to
regain control of Congress, it appears to be spending unprecedented
amounts on anti-poverty programs and outright giveaways to gain
votes from the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The handouts range from bicycles to tin roofs, and they often
come with not-so-subtle hints that the recipients should vote for
the PRI. Together with instances of PRI coercion, these practices
have begun to tarnish the credibility of an election campaign that
had been billed as the fairest in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Is the PRI engaging in vote-buying on a vast scale, as critics
say? If so, a victory by PRI candidate Francisco Labastida _ who is
running almost in a dead heat with PAN candidate Vicente Fox _ may
be challenged as fraudulent, plunging Mexico into an extended
period of post-election turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Or is the PRI legitimately enjoying the powers of incumbency,
using the few legal loopholes left in an electoral system that even
PRI opponents admit has been transformed by recent reforms from a
notoriously corrupt one to a process protected by a host of
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with dozens of peasants, Indian leaders, government
officials and election observers suggest that the questions must be
viewed in light of Mexico's poverty and cultural beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, among the country's Indian groups, which comprise
10 percent of the country's 97 million population and most of its
extreme poor, government aid is viewed as conferring a moral
obligation on the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think that if they are given something, they're in
debt to the person who gave it to us,'' said Olga Quiroz, a Mixtec
Indian near Santiago Juxtlahuaca who received a no-collateral
government loan and also gets other aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's so hard for many of the people around here to
vote against the PRI. We can't just pocket (the aid) and go vote
for the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Doling out money, food and other goods is not strictly illegal.
But it is unlawful to tie the handouts to votes. It's also
off-limits for public officials to use their position or government
resources to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Raul de los Santos, who directs a statewide voter-education
campaign, says election ``fairness'' is not necessarily a legal
matter: ``There are deep cultural reasons why rural people in
Oaxaca and elsewhere are susceptible to practices that aren't
necessarily illegal but that do distort the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   In Santiago Juxtlahuaca town hall, where the PRI holds sway,
Vice Mayor Francisco Beristain smiled as he said his party expects
to win the region Sunday despite growing support for opposition
parties. ``The loans definitely help us with people, as well as all
the other programs that we give. The people see that their
interests are guaranteed by the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, government social programs give badly needed aid to huge
numbers of poor people. The two largest such programs are Progresa,
which gives money to about 2.6 million poor  &LR; rural women who agree
to keep their children in school and take them to regular medical
checkups, and Procampo, which assists 2.9 million farmers with
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   But election observers and opposition parties say the PRI's
campaign is pushing _ or outright exceeding _ the boundaries of
what's legal. Among the examples they cite are:
</P>
<P>
   -- Since April 1, President Ernesto Zedillo has sped up the pace
of public works programs, inaugurating projects around the country
worth an estimated $435 million. Zedillo ignored a call from the
independent, highly respected Federal Election Institute, which is
overseeing the voting, to cancel advertising of government programs
in the final weeks before the election. Every day during the
campaign (which ended Wednesday), leading television and radio
programs were punctuated by ads from the presidency and federal
Cabinet agencies touting the successes of government programs. The
ads often ran back-to-back with ads for &LR;   &LR; those of PRI candidates.
Major newspapers and newsmagazines were full of similar, full-page
displays.
</P>
<P>
   -- In recent weeks, Yucatan state Gov. Victor Cervera traveled
to remote rural villages to personally deliver thousands of washing
machines, water pumps, fumigators, tin roofs, machetes, rolls of
barbed wire, bicycles _ all stamped with the emblem of his
government _ to PRI supporters.
</P>
<P>
   -- In Tabasco state, officials appeared suddenly with disaster
relief, which had been delayed since floods in October, and paid
homeowners who support the PRI $600 each while paying opposition
backers $200.
</P>
<P>
   -- Welfare mothers and corn farmers in 13 states have reported
being told by officials that their cash payments will be cut off
unless they pledge to vote for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   -- Workers at the national oil monopoly Pemex have complained
that  &LR; said their bosses threatened to fire them unless they
campaign for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   -- The nation's private media recently reverted to their
traditional pro-PRI bias. A Federal Election Institute survey
released Monday said that this month, Fox received 70 percent of
all coverage with a negative spin, compared to 30 percent earlier.
Meanwhile, the PRI's share of negative coverage dropped from 60
percent early last month to just 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, a congressional commission to review charges of
illegal campaign activity had received 144 complaints of
vote-buying and coercion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign appears to be marred by a growing and disturbing
amount of corruption, coercion and vote-buying,'' said Silvia
Alonso, president of Civic Alliance, an election watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   But the extent of illegal activity may be in the eye of the
beholder.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all observers agree that this year's election appears
likely to be Mexico's fairest ever. The system is much more
fraud-proof and equitable than during the infamous 1988 vote, when
Interior Ministry officials were widely believed to have used a
suspicious, election-night computer crash to give victory to PRI
candidate Carlos Salinas. Before the crash, Salinas had been
trailing leftist candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who is running for
president again this year but is lagging in third place in opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, because of reforms enacted in 1997, Mexico's election
system is in some ways one of the fairest in the developing world,
election observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Reforms include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Mexico has spent billions of dollars to compile a reliable
list of eligible voters, issue 60 million photographic voting
credentials, train nearly 800,000 civilian poll watchers and
provide safeguards that include transparent ballot boxes and
curtained voting booths.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Federal Election Institute has been removed from Interior
Ministry control and converted into a nonpartisan, highly
professional body that is praised by all candidates as well as
Mexican and foreign observers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nearly $400 million in public campaign financing has been
provided to the major parties. This step has gone a long way toward
reducing the PRI's traditionally overwhelming edge in campaign
spending. The five-party coalition backing Cardenas, for example,
was given $109 million _ allowing Cardenas to blanket the airwaves
with advertisements, even in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   -- Opposition parties reported last week that their
representatives would observe balloting at all 113,000 polling
places.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these efforts, many opposition leaders and activists
remain deeply suspicious of the PRI, even when they can't put their
finger on evidence.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, for example, an official from Civic Alliance,
Mexico's main independent observer organization, took a Chronicle
reporter and photographer on a 12-hour tour of the enormous, dusty
slums stretching east of Mexico City _ a trip, he promised, that
would display many cases of coercion and vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
   Although plenty of hearsay accounts of such practices were
relayed by people interviewed in their homes and on the street, and
although several residents expressed fear of discussing their
experiences with government aid administrators, no direct proof was
offered.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Woldenberg, head of the Federal Election Institute, has
said that reports of vote-buying are exaggerated and that even if
somebody bought 400,000 votes _ ``a deliriously high figure'' _ it
would represent only about 1 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   One percent may not seem like much, but it could be enough to
throw the election to Labastida in his neck-and-neck race with Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox warned earlier this month that he may not accept a Labastida
victory if the margin is less than 10 percentage points, prompting
Labastida to retort: ``Those who are predicting fraud beforehand
are doing so merely to cover up their own defeat in free
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fox has since backed off from the warning, he is still
threatening to lead a campaign of civic resistance if he loses by
fraud.

ASSAULT WEAPON BAN IS UPHELD
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The California Supreme Court upheld the state's
1989 assault-weapons ban Thursday, a stinging defeat for the gun
industry that could lead to the prohibition of nearly 200 types of
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   By a 6-to-1 vote, the high court said the law, which bans more
than 60 types of semiautomatic assault weapons, does not violate
the constitutional rights of gun owners. Justice Joyce Kennard
filed the sole dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 law, known as the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control
Act, was the nation's first ban on assault weapons and served as
the model for regulations in other cities and states as well as a
federal ban in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gov. Gray Davis signed an amendment to the law
banning so-called ``copycat weapons,'' firearms designed with
slight modifications to skirt the original law. The addition made
the law the nation's most comprehensive gun regulation.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Bill Lockyer called Thursday's decision
``a major victory for gun safety and public safety in California.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, he said, at least 120 types of
weapons, known as AR-15 or AK ``series'' weapons, will be added to
the list of banned firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge setback for the gun industry,'' said Luis Tolley,
western director of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, which
filed a brief supporting the law on behalf of the California Police
Chiefs Association cq  &LR; and several other law enforcement groups.
</P>
<P>
   He said the 1989 law and its 1999 amendment ``work very
effectively together to really close down loopholes to try to get
around the language.'' The amendment outlaws guns if they have
certain features, such as a detachable magazine and a pistol grip.
</P>
<P>
   Tolley said that a gunmaker could remove the offending feature
to get around the 1999 law, but the gun would still be subject to
the ban if it had been on the 1989 list.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Michel, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs challenging
the law _ a group of taxpayers, gun collectors as well as gunmaker
Colt Industries _ said they might appeal the decision to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, he said, may create consumer uncertainty over which
weapons are legal and which ones are not. Further, it may not be
clear whether a weapon is covered by the 1989 ban or the 1999
amendment. ``There's already a tremendous amount of confusion among
police, lawyers and judges over what is or what is not an assault
weapon,'' Michel said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 law was passed by the Legislature after a crazed gunman
armed with an assault rifle sprayed a Stockton schoolyard with
bullets, killing five children and wounding 30 others.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the banned weapons, the law allows the state
attorney general to add to the list by getting the approval of a
Superior Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   The law was challenged after former state Attorney General Dan
Lungren attempted to add the Colt Sporter to the list.
</P>
<P>
   The gun manufacturer Colt Industries sued to overturn the law,
but a trial judge threw out the suit. In a dramatic move, a state
appeals court in 1998 struck down the law, ruling that it was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court in Sacramento said that the law violated the
equal protection laws because it arbitrarily singled out those gun
owners who owned a firearm that was on the list.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the state Supreme Court said states have broad
powers in regulating the gun industry. They rejected the argument
that gun owners are protected by a fundamental state constitutional
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If plaintiffs are implying that a right to bear arms is one of
the rights recognized in the California Constitution's declaration
of rights, they are simply wrong,'' wrote Justice Janice Rogers
Brown in the court opinion. ``No mention is made in it of a right
to bear arms.''
</P>
<P>
   She also dismissed the notion that the 1989 ban by singling out
some gun owners and not others violates their to equal protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature here was under no illusion that the AWCA would
rid the streets of assault weapons in one fell swoop,'' she said.
``The step-by-step approach adopted here _ the list plus the add-on
provision _ does not violate principles of equal protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also rejected the argument that the law violated the
separation of powers requirement of the constitution by giving a
judge the final say on what firearms can be added to the list.

CLINTON NAMES MINETA TO COMMERCE POST, FIRST ASIAN AMERICAN
IN  JOB
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton named former California Rep. Norm
Mineta as his choice for secretary of commerce Thursday, making him
the first Asian American ever nominated for a Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta, a senior vice president at the Lockheed Martin Corp.,
called his appointment a triumph of the American dream, and
shrugged off concern that he is stepping in at the twilight of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some might say that the months remaining in this
administration are not a lot of time to make a difference in the
life our our nation, but I disagree,'' said Mineta, who passed up a
chance to become secretary of transportation in 1992. ``Six months
is a virtual eternity in the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a century ago, Mineta was forced from his San Jose home
and, along with 120,000 other Japanese Americans, imprisoned in an
internment camp at the order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Thursday, he stood in the Oval Office as the current president
called him a ``strong leader'' and a ``highly skilled negotiator''
who will ``play a critical role in keeping our economic strategy on
track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Norm Mineta's family story tells a lot about the promise of
the America dream,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the Senate, Mineta would succeed William Daley _
leaving to become chair of Vice President Al Gore's presidential
campaign _ as head of the 63,000-person department responsible for
tasks ranging from the promotion of American business abroad to
overseeing the census and the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be another first for Mineta. As mayor of San Jose
in the early 1970s, he was the first Asian American to head a big
city, and, as chairman of the House Transportation and Public Works
Committee, the first Asian American to run a major congressional
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by his family and former staff members, Mineta told
Clinton: ``The substance of your actions today must never be
underestimated or forgotten. Mr. President, you have the eternal
gratitude of not just Japanese Americans or Asian-Pacific
Americans, but, I believe, every American.''
</P>
<P>
   Asian Americans, who make up an estimated 5 percent of the
nation's population, have few representatives at the highest levels
of government. Washington Gov. Gary Locke, elected in 1996, is the
first governor of Chinese American descent. In Congress, only three
of the 435 House members are of Asian descent. Hawaii is the only
state with an Asian American senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nomination sends a signal to the country that Asian
Americans are a significant part of American society,'' said John
Tateishi, executive director of the Japanese American Citizens
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mineta's nomination has a really profound effect on the
perception of others. And for us, it tells us that we've ...
finally reached a point where we have a foot in mainstream
America.''
</P>
<P>
   It may also help repair relations between Democrats and Asian
Americans, some of whom have felt wrongly accused for the Democrats
fund-raising antics in 1996, which included illegal contributions
from foreign sources.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional staffers predicted a quick
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is well known and well respected on Capitol Hill and in the
Senate, and it bodes well for a speedy (confirmation) process,''
said John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he sees any obstacle in the Senate, where many Clinton
nominations have languished, Czwartacki said: ``Not one.''
</P>
<P>
   One GOP staff member said, ``It would be monumentally stupid to
stand in the way of the first Asian American Cabinet secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley has said he will leave his post on July 15. Administration
officials are hopeful they can secure Mineta's confirmation before
the Senate's August recess. If not, they are holding open the
possibility of a ``recess appointment'' that would temporarily
install Mineta in the post without Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta left Congress in the middle of his 10th term to accept a
job working on transportation issues for Lockheed Martin, the
nation's largest defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Some questions were raised Thursday about how he would handle
matters regarding Lockheed at the Commerce Department. A White
House spokesman said Mineta would adhere to any relevant ethics
rules.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of MINETA30 (107059 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  In Congress, Mineta spent years garnering funds for freeway and
transit projects. But he is probably best remembered for his
efforts to secure reparation payments for the tens of thousands of
Japanese Americans who, like himself, were forced into internment
camps during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   When he left Congress in 1995, he was criticized by some public
interest groups for walking away in mid-term. His colleagues
withheld public criticism, even when his congressional seat was
taken over by Republican Tom Campbell in a special election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norm thought he had left politics for good in 1995 when he
left Congress to work for Lockheed Martin,'' Clinton said Thursday,
``but politics and public service have a way of calling the best
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mineta has been courted by the Clinton administration before. He
was the president's top choice for secretary of transportation in
1992, but turned down the job so he could take over as chair of the
House Transportation Committee. He was also mentioned for Cabinet
posts at the start of Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials contacted him within days of Daley's
announcement that he would leave the Commerce Department, sources
said. Mineta has a strong relationship with Gore, and many regard
him as a likely candidate for a Cabinet post if Gore wins the
presidency in November.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Mineta will ``play a crucial role in keeping our
economic strategy on track, opening trade around the world,
investing in our people, promoting high technology (and) bridging
the digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   Mineta did not discuss his possible agenda at the Commerce
Department, saying only that ``there is no more important task than
to further advance the policies that have brought us to this
triumph of economic performance and prosperity.''

2 INDICTED ON CHARGES OF MURDER AT WENDY'S
</HEADLINE>
  By EUN LEE KOH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two men charged in the execution-style slayings of
five workers at a Wendy's restaurant have been indicted by a grand
jury on multiple counts of first- and second-degree murder,
District Attorney Richard Brown of Queens announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he had not decided whether to seek the death penalty
for the men, John B. Taylor, 36, and Craig Godineaux, 30, and would
need to do a ``thorough and painstaking'' review of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a great deal of work to do before reaching that
decision,'' said Brown, who has 120 days from the arraignment,
scheduled for July 27, to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and Godineaux have been charged with 50 counts of first-
and second-degree murder, attempted murder, robbery and weapons
possessions in the May 24 killings at the restaurant, on Main
Street in Flushing. The victims were bound and gagged, their heads
covered with plastic bags, then were marched into a freezer room
and shot one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Nazario, Anita C. Smith, Jean Dumel Auguste, Jeremy Mele
and Ibadat Ali were killed. Two other workers _ Jaquione Johnson
and Patrick Castro _ were critically injured but have since been
released from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also was charged with tampering with evidence. Brown said
that Taylor took the keys to the restaurant and that he removed a
videotape from a surveillance camera there.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who have been held without bail since their arrest in
late May, have admitted to the murders in videotaped confessions,
in which they outlined plans to rob the restaurant and kill the
workers to eliminate witnesses, according to Gregory L. Lasak, the
lead prosecutor in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The confessions also include details of how the slayings were
carried out and how $2,400 in cash was stolen from the restaurant,
Lasak said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of the survivors of the shootings has
identified the two suspects as the assailants, the authorities have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who had worked at the Wendy's before being fired in
October, tried to rob five fast-food restaurants last year, and had
been a fugitive since November for jumping bail, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Godineaux, who had worked as a security guard in a clothing
store, served three prison terms in the last decade for robbery and
drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has sought the death penalty in three cases since New
York's death penalty law was reinstated in 1995, according to Mary
de Bourbon, a spokeswoman for his office.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Brown sought the death penalty for James Allen
Gordon, who was convicted of murdering three women and seriously
injuring two others. Also that year, Brown sought the death penalty
for George Davis Bell, who was convicted of murdering an off-duty
police officer and the owner of a check cashing store.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Brown sought the death penalty for Steven Smelefsky,
who pleaded guilty to killing two people in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   All three received life in prison without parole.

PEDRO MARTINEZ PLACED ON 15-DAY DL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez won't pitch Saturday in Chicago, won't pitch five
days later in Minnesota, and exactly what day he will return to the
Red Sox roster after the July 10-12 All-Star break remains in
question.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, the reigning American League Cy Young Award winner,
was informed late Thursday afternoon that he had been placed on the
15-day disabled list, retroactive to his last start, June 25 in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The decision clearly did not sit well with the 28-year-old
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to say,'' he said, quickly dismissing
reporters clustered around his locker not long before the Sox took
the field against Baltimore, looking to break a five-game losing
streak. ``I did what I could to pitch. I was tight last time. This
time, I feel fine.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does it all mean? Why are the Red Sox shelving the best
pitcher in the AL when the best pitcher in the AL says he is able
and ready to pitch as soon as Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Sox skipper Jimy Williams, it comes down to his
opinion that Martinez is not physically able to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a couple of little medical things that we're going to
take care of,'' said Williams. The manager would not provide more
specific information regarding the ``medical things,'' other than
to make reference to the history of problems Martinez has had with
an oblique muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at it as (going) on the 15-day disabled list
that take care of the little glitches he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Martinez, who shagged fly balls and tossed in the
outfield after being placed on the DL, would not accompany the club
to Chicago for the upcoming three-game series against the White
Sox. According to the manager, the ace will be treated by the
club's medical staff over the weekend, then meet up with the club
next week in Minnesota. The Sox open a four-game series with the
Twins Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to go on (the disabled list),'' said Williams.
``I accept that. It's my decision. It's my responsibility. I think
it's the right thing to do, and he doesn't. That's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   It began to become obvious that management would direct Martinez
toward a fortnight of rest and relaxation Tuesday night, when Sox
general manager Dan Duquette said during a pregame radio show that
such a move could be imminent. Duquette added Wednesday night that
Martinez was ``tight'' prior to making his last start, against the
Blue Jays, and the tightness also lingered after the start.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was obviously working in concert with the GM when he
met with Martinez in the clubhouse not longer after 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line for me is that I'm just trying to protect the
assets of the Red Sox,'' Williams said. ``I want the kid to be able
to pitch for a lot of years here. If I didn't put him on, to be
honest, and he went out and did something severe, it would be
difficult to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams likewise would not provide details regarding what
course of action the club's medical staff would take with Martinez.
He emphasized, however, that Martinez would be ``checked out by the
organization'' _ a clear reference that the righthander wouldn't be
expected to go looking for outside second and third opinions about
the need for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take care of it,'' said Williams, raising his right arm
as if lifting his hand to answer a question in a school room, ``in
the fashion we think is the best way to handle it. And he will join
us in Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox return to action after the All-Star break when the Mets
come to Fenway July 13, the start of a three-game series. Martinez
would be available to return at that point, provided his medical
``glitches'' have been remedied.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's best pitcher is hurting, and by the sounds of it, he
is hurting in more than one place. The scenario is reminiscent of
the '99 postseason when Martinez exited Game 1 of the AL Division
Series against Cleveland with what was diagnosed as a back strain.
Martinez returned in Game 5 and pitched six innings of brilliant
no-hit relief. Williams now wants the pain to go away, and feels he
has no option other than to send pitcher and pain to the sideline
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't my decision,'' emphasized Martinez. ``It was
(Williams's) decision _ the GM's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He can handle a lot of pain,'' said Williams. ``Now, there's
pain and there's injury. We are trying to prevent injury. When you
have pain, your body is trying to tell you something. Now, will
that pain go away? I don't know.''

 SOX FLEX MIGHT, LEAVE ORIOLES IN THEIR WAKE
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Some big bang back in their bats and Tim Wakefield's
flutterballs skipping and dipping like stones skimmed across the
Charles, the bedraggled Red Sox finally showed some life Thursday
in a 12-4 trouncing of the Orioles at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Daubach, his socks on display for a change of luck, belted
two homers and drove in six runs, leading a 16-hit barrage that
brought the Sox only their 13th win in their last 36 games.
</P>
<P>
   On a night that began with Pedro Martinez being placed on the
disabled list, the Sox saw Wakefield pitch into the seventh inning
with a shutout before yielding a three-run bomb to Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   For a club that has done little right over the better part of
six weeks, it was a return to their early-May days of shake,
rattle, and roll, when they were once 12 games over .500. The win
put them two over the break-even mark (38-36) and sent them off for
a Chicago-Minnesota trip with their self-esteem slightly restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahh . . . that was big for us,'' said manager Jimy Williams,
his club snapping a five-game losing streak. ``For (Wakefield) to
pitch like that, that was the key _ a big lift for us. It was big
for him, and the rest of our (pitching) staff _ the whole club.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield was on the plate all night, scattering seven hits
through six innings, only twice allowing runners to reach scoring
position. He didn't give up a walk. Only twice did Orioles hitters
work him to three balls. Making only his fourth start of the
season, it was an outing reminiscent of Wakefield's masterful
(never to be repeated?) 16-8 season here in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bullpen needs a rest, big time,'' said Wakefield, who
provided the perfect respite for some of the tired-going-on-dead
arms among the relief corps. ``I've been out there. I know how
taxing it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Sox' bats gave Wakefield plenty of comfort to go
out and go right at the Baltimore hitters. Daubach slammed the
first of his home runs in the second, a three-run shot off starter
Scott Erickson that sailed into the screen in left-center. Scott
Hatteberg belted a three-run blast of his own in the fifth inning,
helping to build a 7-0 lead, and Daubach added his solo blast in
the sixth to make it 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   A slight adjustment in his batting stride, as well as a fashion
statement that saw him show his red-white-and-blue socks,
contributed to Daubach's change of fortune at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not since Double A ball have I done that,'' said Daubach,
referring to the hauled-up hose. ``I'm pretty sure they'll be up
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach drove in his fifth and sixth runs with an infield roller
in the eighth that went for a double. The night before, following
an 11-inning loss to the Orioles, the Sox locker room was full of
guys who said their luck had to change. One sure sign of fortune
taking a turn is a grounder back up the middle that first ricochets
off the pitcher, then eludes the second baseman and rolls to the
outfield for a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Sang Lee, the Korean reliever called up to fill Martinez's
roster spot, took over after Wakefield faltered in the eighth (a
walk, double, and Belle's blast). The lefthander gave up a Jeff
Conine pinch-hit homer, but otherwise pitched well (12 pitches, 7
strikes). John Wasdin closed it out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big win for us,'' said Williams. ``It really was.''
</P>
<P>
   With Martinez out of the rotation, and no starter yet named for
Saturday's game in Chicago (look for another call to the minors),
Wakefield likely can figure on living the starter's life for at
least a little while longer. He'll likely start Tuesday in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched a heck of a game,'' said Williams. ``We will savor
the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Licking their wounds for a month-plus, the Sox finally had a
moment to lick their chops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not half the season is over,'' said Daubach. ``We get some
people back, get healthy . . . ''

   MISSILE-DEFENSE (Undated) _ Special Report: For ages, nations
have dreamed of building invulnerable shields to protect themselves
from hostile forces. Now the Clinton administration and its
military advisers are trying again, this time with a limited
antimissile weapon they think will go a long way toward immunizing
the United States against attack at least from missiles launched by
adversaries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq. Officials at the
Pentagon and experts outside the government say this defense
technology has reached a new level of maturity, and they argue that
the combination of miniaturized electronics and high-speed rockets
can produce an agile, light-weight weapon that can find and ram an
incoming bomb at supersonic speed. But critics are skeptical. By

   BENNINGTON-TRAVEL (Bennington, Vt.) _ Beyond providing an excuse

perhaps a town like Bennington, whose ambience runs from the
workaday to the artsy, should count itself fortunate to have so
visible a reminder of Revolutionary valor. That would be the
Bennington Battle Monument, a limestone shaft that does double
duty, commemorating the Battle of Bennington in 1777 and providing
a perch to which visitors can ascend for impressive views of the
countryside. Reminders of revolutionary glory are only one
diversion in southwestern Vermont, a place rich in recreational
opportunities (the Appalachian Trail runs through the area) and in
its association with famous people, from poets to the kin of

   SUMMER-INDY-FILMS (Hollywood) _ Every summer, as sure as the
snowbirds return from Miami Beach, the major Hollywood studios
unleash their biggest, loudest and most expensive and star-studded
films into a world of vacationing families and entertainment-hungry
teenagers. Tom Cruise hangs from impossible cliffs. Mel Gibson
skewers sneering Brits. Jim Carrey rides the wild highway. The
rules are simple: cars exist to be chased, guns to be fired,
affairs to be consummated, rockets to be launched. Special effects
blossom like wildflowers on the prairie. Have sequel, will travel.
But off to the side, clustered together, are a growing number of
smaller, less heralded movies _ independent features, foreign
language films, this year's quirky Shakespeare adaptations _ that
somehow find themselves battling it out in the nation's theaters
with the big Hollywood quarterbacks. In these movies, cars exist to
be driven, guns to be decried, affairs to be analyzed and rockets?
Well, there are no rockets. Have subtitles, will travel.

FALK TALKS OF NEW FUTURE WITH CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Go ahead. Rubs your eyes. Clean your ears.
</P>
<P>
   Three young first round NBA picks - Darius Miles, Keyon Dooling
and Quentin Richardson - sat in the Staples Center Thursday
afternoon, happy to be the future of the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   And afterward Clipper adversary David Falk, the agent for Miles
and Richardson, talked about a new future between himself and the
Clipper organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a person who always believes that you learn from your
experiences,'' Falk said. ``I hope we all learned something and
perhaps we can turn the page. It's a very positive day for the
Clippers.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk was at the Staples Center as the Clippers introduced their
three first round acquisitions: the third picks Miles, an
18-year-old high schooler; the 10th pick Dooling, a 20-year-old
point guard out of Missouri; and, the 18th pick Richardson, a
20-year-old swingman out of DePaul.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Falk in the same room at such an event, let alone talking
of working with the Clippers didn't seem likely last February.
</P>
<P>
   That's when a deal to send free agent forward Maurice Taylor to
the New York Knicks fell through. Falk blamed the Clippers. The
Clippers blamed Vancouver, a third team in the proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Taylor situation is unfortunate,'' Falk said.
</P>
<P>
   Falk described the relationship the two sides as
``cantankerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The detente between the two sides appears mutual. Clipper vice
president of basketball operations Elgin Baylor said he is looking
past the Taylor situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the past,'' Baylor said. ``This is the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor added, ``The players weren't drafted because David
represents them. The players were drafted because they are talented
players. Dave and I have a good relationship. We've always had a
good relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The players want to be together and on the Clippers. They spent
the new conference laughing and joking in front of the Los Angeles
media.
</P>
<P>
   Miles, who had never been to Los Angeles before, said that
Falk's past relationship with the Clippers hasn't impacted his
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy...and (Falk) wants us to be happy because we're
his client,'' Miles said. ``I would love to rebuilt...it's shows
how strong I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk said a key in the rebuilding process is the selection of a
coach. Falk lobbied for John Lucas, Falk's first client and a
number one draft pick in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got tremendous energy,'' Falk said. ``I think he is very
close to Odom as well. I think as a former player and a number one
pick in the draft and a thinking man's point guard I think he will
be an outstanding coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said that he has received and expects to receive more
interest in the coaching opening since the Clipper moves. But he
stopped short of saying that he is restarting the selection
process.
</P>
<P>
   The top candidates so far are Lucas and Clipper assistant coach
Dennis Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Without a new coach, Falk said that both Miles and Richardson
will play summer league in Chicago and not with the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   As Falk left he came over the Baylor and the two shook hands and
the two appeared ready to work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really fond of Elgin and I hope the Donald Sterling seizes
the opportunity Elgin has created to make this a positive change,''
Falk said. ``Only time will tell but this is a very strong first
step.''

HOLIDAY PLANS RUN THE GAMUT FOR SOUTHLAND
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Independence Day, Valley Village resident
George King -- better not call him King George -- is staging his
own American revolt.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to work.
</P>
<P>
   But at the British Social Club in North Hollywood, bygones seem
to be bygones -- they're hosting a ``Happy Birthday, America''
dinner -- dance Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And the folks on Liberty Bell Road in Calabasas are almost
obligated by their address to break out the briquets, burgers, and
Stars and Stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband always makes certain he puts out the flag. Not many
people do anymore,'' Maxine Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fourth of July approaching faster than a glaring red
rocket, Los Angeles-area residents are celebrating their freedom of
choice in more ways than candles on the country's birthday cake.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Oaks native Darva Conger -- who is exposed in the
current Playboy and answered Fox's ``Who Wants to Marry a
Millionaire?'' with ``I do'' -- said she'll pass the holiday at a
uniquely American landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to be at the Playboy Mansion enjoying Hef's party on
the Fourth of July,'' said Conger, a former emergency-room nurse
who served in the Army during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a military veteran I take great pride in, and celebrate
with profound joy, our observation of Independence Day and the
advent of America as a country that is matched by no other.''
</P>
<P>
   As Liberty Bell Road homeowners for 32 years, Maxine and William
Welch are living up to the name of their lane for Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably have our family over for a barbecue --
hamburgers, hot dogs, ice cream for dessert. Sit around the pool,
chase the grandchildren,'' Welch said. With a family of 14 to help
celebrate, ``we have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   But just like that other John Adams 224 years ago, John Adams of
Van Nuys may have to work July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, a motion picture sound editor who's unsure if he's
related to the Founding Father, said an accelerated work schedule
may put him on the clock for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, I'm going to get my kids and get them someplace to
see fireworks,'' Adams said. ``We'll barbecue -- that's kind of
traditional -- get together with some friends and maybe play
ping-pong. Pretty low-key.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as low-key, however, as the plans of Sparky Anderson, the
Thousand Oaks resident and former Cincinnati Reds and Detroit
Tigers manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do nothing,'' he said of how he celebrates the Fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed further, Anderson -- who's the only manager to have led
teams to World Series championships in both the American and
National leagues, and who will be inducted into the Baseball Hall
of Fame on July 23 in Cooperstown, N.Y. -- said he'll be getting
together with family members who live in the area. He admitted
he'll probably talk about the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not nervous,'' Anderson said. ``I don't believe I will be
nervous until I step up (to give my acceptance speech). It's like a
loaded gun, you know, you don't get nervous until someone points it
at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bats and balls of another sort will be in play at the
Independence Day Cup cricket tournament, running today through
Tuesday at the Woodley Avenue Park cricket fields in Encino. From
10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day, spectators can picnic, relax in the
shade and enjoy the free matches between world-class teams from
Jamaica, Western India, the United States Cricket Association and
the Southern California Cricket Association.
</P>
<P>
   At the British Social Club, site of Saturday's ``Happy Birthday
America'' dance, time has dimmed the difference between patriots
and loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly for expatriate Britons, the club started admitting
Americans, and was eventually swallowed by another organization,
the Mayflower Club, said Richard Dunham, a New York native who is
part of the club's color guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be the British Social and Athletic Club,'' but that
got absorbed, said Dunham, who's married to an Englishwoman. ``It's
gone from there to being anything and everybody. Now it's basically
just the Mayflower Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Score another one for the Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   Independence Day commemorates the date in 1776 when the Second
Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence.
Written by Thomas Jefferson, it decried the British oppression of
its American colonies, and declared ``all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, England's King George III wasn't too fond of the
date, seeing as how he lost the colonies and eventually his sanity.
But what does George King think about the Fourth of July?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found on major holidays like this if you travel with the
crowd you usually have more headaches than fun,'' said King, 63, a
Valley Village real-estate agent. So instead, he'll work, and get a
jump on everyone else who's taking the day off. ``The roads are too
crowded, the campsites are too crowded. The following weekend we'll
probably go camping.''
</P>
<P>
   And that way, he said, he stiffs the gas stations, whom he
believes jack up their prices for the holiday weekend. ``It's my
own little revolt.''
</P>
<P>
   A King in revolt?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really been teased about King George for years,'' said
King, 63. ``Oh, King George -- should I curtsy? What's it like
being a monarch? Have you had anybody killed lately? Everybody
seemed to find that so comical.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike King, Richard Riordan is doing like so many others and
taking advantage of the long weekend to get out of town. The Los
Angeles mayor and his wife, Nancy, are heading to Hailey, Idaho, to
attend a rodeo there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of their favorite places to escape to,'' said mayoral
spokesman Peter Hidalgo. He said Riordan's favorite part of the
holiday ``is the food -- the corn on the cob, the hamburgers, the
baked beans.''
</P>
<P>
   But a different repast will be on the menu at Ye Olde King's
Head Pub in Santa Monica, the unofficial center for British
emigrants in the L.A. area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just be serving our fish and chips and good English
beer,'' said manager Nicki Coleman. ``Basically for us it's just
another day.''

CRAVEN TWINS PICK USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twin brother basketball players Errick and Derrick
Craven of Bishop Montgomery High in Torrance have decided to attend
USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's close to home and my family will get to see me play,''
Derrick Craven said. ``I wanted to stay in California. We wanted to
be able to come home on the weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Errick (6-foot-2, 170) is considered one of the top guards in
the West. He averaged 20.9 points, 7.3 rebounds, 3.7 assists and
3.6 steals as the twins led Bishop Montgomery to the Division III
state title last spring. Derrick (6-2, 170) averaged 17.1 points,
5.8 assists, 5.6 rebounds and 3.1 steals.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Craven said the twins expected to officially inform USC
coaches on Thursday night of their decision.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools that recruited the twins were UCLA, Stanford and
California. Some colleges balked at taking both brothers, who
insisted on attending the same school.
</P>
<P>
   They are projected as combo guards in college, capable of
playing either the point or shooting guard position.

DALAI OFFERS BLESSINGS FOR PEACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DONNA HUFFAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ The Dalai Lama blessed a Tibetan-Buddhist
shrine at Forest Lawn Memorial Park on Thursday that is the first
of its kind in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then, since even a Tibetan-Buddhist shrine blessing wouldn't be
complete in Los Angeles without a Hollywood celebrity, the Dalai
Lama appeared onstage with Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   The exiled Tibetan leader spoke to more than 900 people gathered
at Forest Lawn's Hall of the Crucifixion-Resurrection in a
question-and-answer session hosted by the actress, an outspoken
advocate for the Tibetan cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``When affection is there, caring is there,'' the Dalai Lama
told the capacity crowd as he advised them to use their
intelligence positively, live holistically and open themselves to a
more positive existence. ``Automatically our minds become more
widened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barefoot and wearing a feather boa, the star of ``Basic
Instinct'' and ``Casino'' wondered beforehand how she would
introduce the religious leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, referring to
him as ``Mr. Please, please, please let me back into China'' and
``the hardest working man in spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old actress, who with her husband, Phil Bronstein,
recently adopted a baby boy, said one of the things gleaned from
Buddhism is empathy for one another and the complete freedom to
love another human being whom you have never met before.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama blessed the Shi-tro Mandala, which is being built
at Forest Lawn, in a private ceremony. The first three-dimensional
mandala to be created in the United States, it is one of only a few
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The intricately carved and brightly colored work by artist Pema
Namdol Thaye is dedicated to universal peace. Expected to be
completed in three months, it will be available for exhibition in
museums and other venues throughout the United States before it's
permanently installed at the Chagdud Gonpa center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Maxwell, executive director and co-founder of the local We
Care For Youth group, has been involved with the mandala since the
project began and helped bring it to Forest Lawn. At the
question-and-answer session, she praised the attendance of a group
of 22 teens from Camp Scott of the Los Angeles County Probation
Department, saying they would benefit from the Dalai Lama's
Buddhist teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you turn kids' minds to peace, they go there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the teens asked the Dalai Lama how she can keep herself
out of trouble when trouble is often brought to her.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing laughter, he told her, ``Life is not easy,'' then
suggested she take note of Jesus and other teachers of peace. After
encouraging the girl to build her self-confidence and fight life's
challenges with wisdom, knowledge and determination, he summoned
her to the dais. As she wiped away tears, they exchanged hugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, born in 1935 when Tibet was an independent
country, assumed leadership when he was 16, after the Communist
Chinese invaded Tibet. Nine years later, he was forced into exile
in India and his return has become an international cause.
</P>
<P>
   His teachings are revered by followers around the world. San
Diego residents Sara and David Hamilton have practiced Buddhism for
a few years and have seen the Dalai Lama several times. They
brought their 9-month-old daughter, Lila, on Thursday, saying it is
important to show support for his teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddhism is a really good place to put your mind. I love the
discussions, even if you can't hear everything because you're
running around after a baby,'' Sara Hamilton said.

HOUSE VOTES TO GIVE DOCTORS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following story, previously eliminated, is now
restored) By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House early on Friday morning passed a bill
that would give doctors an exemption from antitrust laws so they
could bargain collectively with insurance companies over fees and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 276-136.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association lobbied for the bill, saying
doctors needed protection so they could serve as advocates for
their patients in dealing with huge insurance companies and health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But federal antitrust officials strenuously opposed the bill,
saying it would allow doctors to fix prices and increase their
charges. The Congressional Budget Office, the Justice Department
and the Federal Trade Commission all predicted that the bill would
lead to higher health care costs for patients and for employers who
provide health benefits to employees.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., the chief sponsor of the bill, said
it would restore ``a fair balance between doctors and insurance
companies,'' so doctors could provide more adequate care for their
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for the bill in the Senate is uncertain. Several
senators have expressed support for it, but doctors have not found
a Senate champion for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would exempt health care professionals from major
provisions of the antitrust laws when they negotiate with HMO's and
insurers over fees and contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who are employees _ at hospitals, for example _ can
already join labor unions and collectively negotiate with their
employers under existing law. The House bill would grant similar
immunity from the antitrust laws to independent doctors who are
supposedly competing with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., a co-author of the bill, said it
provided ``an important antitrust exemption for doctors,'' and he
added: ``Doctors are being restricted in their ability to make
decisions for patients. We've seen a massive consolidation of the
health insurance market. We need to give relief to doctors. They're
feeling the pinch. Some doctors are in dire circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's bill became entangled in a furious debate over
abortion rights. Conservatives led by Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla.,
proposed an amendment to make clear that the right to bargain
collectively did not apply to negotiations to force a health plan
to perform or pay for abortions. The House approved this amendment
by a vote of 213-202.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said the amendment was needed to prevent doctors from
trying to force Catholic hospitals to provide abortions. But
supporters of abortion rights said the amendment was irrelevant to
the purpose of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation expressed the same frustrations
that have inspired a nationwide campaign to define patients' rights
and to regulate HMOs and insurers. Campbell said some health plans
required doctors to see 10 patients an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are well paid by comparison with most workers but say
they have been squeezed financially by insurance companies trying
to earn profits for investors at the expense of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers, HMOs, employers and many nurses opposed the Campbell
bill, saying it would legalize ``doctor cartels.''

DREIFORT SUFFERS FOURTH STRAIGHT LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Darren Dreifort won out over Major League Baseball
on Thursday. He has yet to figure out how to beat San Diego,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has no explanation for his slump, and everyone wonders
when he'll next beat anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres extended Dreifort's season losing streak to four
games with three home runs and earned a split in the four-game
series with a 5-4 victory in front of 50,171 fans at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The only National League team Dreifort hasn't beaten is San
Diego _ he's 0-5 lifetime. Now, he's 1-6 in his last seven starts
this season and hasn't won since June 7 at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Dreifort (4-7) had his three-game suspension
overturned by Major League Baseball president and CEO Paul Beeston.
</P>
<P>
   He will have to settle for just that victory after surrendering
two-run homers to Wiki Gonzalez (in the second inning) and Phil
Nevin, and a solo shot to Ruben Rivera, both in the fifth. Before
each two-run homer, Dreifort walked the leadoff batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadoff walks (stink),'' Dreifort said. ``They'll kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's line: five earned runs and six hits in six innings,
with three walks and seven strikeouts. He has given up 31 earned
runs in his last 45 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to not be right since May 17 in Chicago when, in
the fourth inning, he jammed his left knee sliding into third base.
He also had a test done on his biceps this week, but nothing came
from it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, neither he nor pitching coach Claude Osteen nor manager
Davey Johnson can find anything seriously physically wrong with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a theory, I'd be doing better,'' Dreifort said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not 100 percent,'' Johnson said. ``I'm not seeing the
same vroom-vroom. I'm not seeing what I've seen. He's not getting
that rhythm. Six innings and about 100 pitches. that's not low
key.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tried to give Dreifort a no-decision by challenging
in each of the final three innings. They chased starter Matt
Clement (7-7) in the seventh after getting runners at the corners.
Reliever Carlos Reyes got one out before balking in Alex Cora to
make it 5-3 then got another out and walked Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Walker gave up Green's RBI single and walked Eric Karros
to load the bases before ending the threat by getting Todd Hundley
to foul out.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Whiteside stranded Adrian Beltre after walking him to lead
off the eighth, and Trevor Hoffman earned his 20th save with a
one-walk, one-strikeout ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Clement gave up four runs and five hits with six walks and six
strikeouts in six-plus innings. His walk and strikeout totals are
consistent with his season. Clement has walked six batters three
other times this season and struck out six or more six other times.
He also threw his 13th wild pitch of the season, ranking him second
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers cut San Diego's lead to 2-1 on Green's sacrifice fly
in the third off Clement, then tied the score on Todd
Hollandsworth's single that scored Dreifort, who hit a broken-bat
double to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to be a little sluggish on offense,'' Johnson said.
``We swing at some bad pitches. The bats have kind of been cold the
last 10 days. The middle of the lineup is struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   The middle of the lineup - Sheffield, Green and Karros - were 1
for 9 Thursday with two RBI and went 6 for 43 (.140) during this
four-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Green had an answer, ``I've learned over the years the harder
you try, the worse you dig yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one had an answer for Dreifort.

HIV PARENTS TRY TO COPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SYLVIA L.OLIANDE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Keeping up with children is difficult enough,
but for the 62,000 parents who are HIV-positive, managing the
illness on top of that can bring a whole new set of difficulties,
according to a study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Susan Gutierrez, 37, an HIV-positive mom being treated at
UCLA, where the study was done. Gutierrez said distractions that
come with her two young daughters sometimes mean going the whole
day forgetting to take the handful of medicines she needs to stay
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see my pills when I'm washing the dishes and figure I'll
take them when I finish, but I don't finish them before I have to
run after (her older daughter) or change the baby,'' the Glendale
resident said. ``By the time I'm in bed, I remember, but I'm so
tired I don't get up to take them.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing out on medication is one of the many problems that hit
HIV-positive Americans who have children under age 18, according to
the UCLA and Rand Institute study being published in the American
Journal of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 120,000 children have parents infected with the
virus, and the challenges of dealing with the disease, let alone
making ends meet when facing expensive but critical medical
treatments, are among the many faced by this forgotten corner of
the AIDS population, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen percent of parents surveyed who had sought treatment
for HIV stalled their own health care, primarily so they could
afford necessities for their children, said Dr. Mark A. Schuster, a
Rand researcher and UCLA pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   The consequence of putting off treatment, he said, is simply
that those parents might not live as long as they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are medications that can prolong their lives, but they
need to be taken regularly, and if they're not able to do that, it
could compromise their health,'' Schuster said. ``Lots of these
parents will live to see their children and their grandchildren,
but they need to take care of their health.''
</P>
<P>
   This first national study on families surveyed 2,864 adults
across the country who are undergoing treatment for HIV. It found
that 28 percent of those infected by the AIDS virus have children
under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Women were more likely than men to have children _ 60 percent of
the women vs. 18 percent of the men.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez contracted the virus more than five years ago, the
consequence of a 13-year heroin addiction. She learned she was
HIV-positive in October 1995, while undergoing treatment to get
clean.
</P>
<P>
   She said the first thing she did was pray to be able to have a
healthy child with her then-boyfriend Cesar, also 37, whom she
married last year. She has an 18-year-old daughter from a previous
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Rand-UCLA study found that, like Gutierrez, 12 percent of
women surveyed conceived and bore their children after a diagnosis.
But only 14 percent of those children tested positive for the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Under the watch of UCLA's Clinical AIDS Research and Education
Center, daughter Ryanna was born in August 1997. The little girl is
HIV-negative. Soon after, the couple decided to have another child
and Rebecca was born six months ago _ also negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I had a healthy baby, I talked to the doctors and nurses
and wanted to get pregnant again,'' Gutierrez said. ``I don't know
what's going to happen to me. I didn't want to go out of this world
leaving my husband and (Ryanna) alone. I wanted to have a whole,
little family.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rand-UCLA study showed that 76 percent of women and only 34
percent of men reported caring for their children, a disparity that
did not surprise the doctor. Schuster said these were likely men
who would not have been raising their children regardless of their
HIV status.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also found that 45 percent of those infected parents
showed symptoms of psychiatric disorders, 5 percent said they were
heavy drinkers and 10 percent required drug or alcohol treatment in
the previous six months. And like Gutierrez, 10 percent had a
history of drug dependency.
</P>
<P>
   But financial hardships were the primary concern reflected by
the 13 percent who did without medical care to afford necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez, who does not have full-blown AIDS, worked until she
was laid off two weeks ago from her secretarial job, so the family
will have to adjust to living on Cesar's wages. She said she hasn't
considered what to do if they suddenly found themselves with
financial problems, adding they'd probably turn to their families.
</P>
<P>
   Schuster said 20 percent of those surveyed reported no close
friends and 16 percent said they saw family members once a month or
less. Sixty-seven percent of the parents had enrolled in at least
one government welfare program.
</P>
<P>
   The study recommends that any social or governmental planning to
deal with the epidemic in the future will have to consider the
impact on children of having parents with a chronic and potentially
fatal condition.
</P>
<P>
   An issue that needs to be looked into, Schuster said, is
discrimination. Often parents have to hide the fact they have the
virus and so aren't comfortable reaching out to friends or
families.
</P>
<P>
   Schuster said the most hopeful message of the survey is that
people are getting help, having families and are thought to be
living longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade ago, we would have been talking about these children
as orphans, losing their parents while they are still quite
young,'' he said. ``Now there are going to be children who are
orphans but many will grow up with their parents.''

GILLESPIE SIDES WITH SON-IN-LAW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Gillespie had been scheduled to appear at
Dodger Stadium on Thursday night. He didn't know it would be a dual
role, as baseball coach and father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie, the USC baseball coach, appeared before the game as
part of USA Baseball's college national team that will play Japan
today at Dodger Stadium as part of an annual five-game goodwill
series.
</P>
<P>
   However, since he's also Chad Kreuter's father-in-law, Gillespie
visited with the Dodgers catcher and discussed his favorite
player's situation.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball upheld Kreuter's eight-game suspension
Thursday, stemming from his actions in mid-May in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence showed clearly Chad acted in self-defense,''
Gillespie said. ``Nowhere in this country would you be allowed to
let a guy assault you, and take your cap, and (provoke) you, and
not be able to defend yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's absurd. Major League Baseball had to save face
after (vice president of on-field operations) Frank Robinson did
what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The players' union has appealed the decision on Kreuter's
behalf, so Kreuter was available to play Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter declined comment. But his agent, Scott Boras, said,
``The issue now is about the safety of the workplace for the
players. If a fan knows a player is going to get suspended for
eight games even though the player is acting in self-defense, and
is restraining a perpetrator ... the fans are going to have a free
lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie spoke with Kreuter for about 10 minutes before
Thursday's game and expressed his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how I feel,'' Gillespie said. ``I think it's very,
very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaching change: Bullpen coach Rick Dempsey replaced John Shelby
in the first-base coaching box. Shelby began serving his eight game
suspension on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Another view: Don Newcombe, the team's director of community
relations, also was emphatic in his support of the Dodgers'
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That person has no right to take his personal property,'' said
Newcombe, who pitched for the Dodgers in the said of the Cubs fan.
``What are you supposed to do? They went into the stands to protect
their family. These players were (Kreuter's) family.... We're human
beings. Why can't we protect Chad Kreuter?''
</P>
<P>
   Return engagement: Kevin Elster returns to San Francisco's
Pac-Bell Park, site of his three-homer game April 11 in the first
regular-season game at Pac-Bell.
</P>
<P>
   But will he play? Elster pulled his left hamstring diving for a
ball hit up the middle during Tuesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' he said. ``(The pain is) right on my (rump). It
hurts to sit.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster is listed as day-to-day, ``but it ain't today,'' manager
Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come hell or high water, I'll play Saturday,'' Elster said.
Left-hander Kirk Rueter is scheduled to start for San Francisco
that day.
</P>
<P>
   Emphatic: There was talk Terry Adams, not on the DL but
suffering from pain in his lower shoulder, would be placed on the
disabled list after being examined Monday by Dr. Frank Jobe.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' response: ``No chance.'' He's right, physical therapist
Pat Screnar said. Adams threw during batting practice Tuesday and
did fine. Then he got the win Wednesday with two perfect innings.
</P>
<P>
   Staff writer Brian Dohn contributed.

STUIOD OPENS 6TH SOUND STAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you build it, they will come.
</P>
<P>
   Ray-Art Studios owners Robert Papazian and James Hirsch showed
their newest sound stage, Stage 6, built specifically for Dr. Laura
Schlessinger's talk show for Paramount Domestic Television.
</P>
<P>
   Taping for the daytime talk show is expected to begin next
month, said Daniel Tibbets, vice president of development for the
Canoga Park studio located in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The 15,000-square-foot sound stage, rated for an audience, took
eight months to build on 12 acres that used to be part of the
company's parking lot, Hirsch said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like this west of the 405 freeway,'' said
Hirsh, who is also one of the producers of ``Nash Bridges'' for
CBS. ``If a production company needs an audience-rated facility,
they have to drive to Paramount or CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   Stage 6 was built for just under $4 million and can accommodate
an audience of 300 for each show, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new sound stage will help bring attention and high-wage jobs
to the west San Fernando Valley, predicted City Councilwoman Laura
Chick, whose 3rd District includes the studio site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts us on the map by making us a larger player in the
television and film production business,'' said Chick. ``It also
means a lot of good jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio, which employs 400 people, now has six sound stages
with wood floors, elephant doors, production facilities and a
full-service commissary, which can cater to all production needs
from prop food to production meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new sound stage is just the beginning for the studio, with
the ultimate goal being the establishment of a campus of creativity
in the West San Fernando Valley,'' said Hirsch. ``We want to make
Ray-Art an alternative to the major studios.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also has been laid for a seventh sound stage,
said Papazian.
</P>
<P>
   Ray-Art Studios is also a full-service production facility where
producers can create television shows, feature films and new media
productions from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Papazian/Hirsch Entertainment purchased the 11-acre property on
Variel Avenue almost three years ago and has spent about $18
million upgrading and expanding the former Redken Laboratories
site.
</P>
<P>
   Spelling Entertainment occupies five of the sound stages to
shoot the WB television series ``Charmed.'' Other tenants have
included Warner Bros., Fox, MGM, NBC and Disney.

FOUNDATION HEALTH SYSTEMS TO CUT BACK MEDICARE COVERAGE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Foundation Health Systems Inc. said it will end
its Medicare-plus-Choice HMO coverage of 19,000 members in six
states, blaming the federal government's policies on
reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Haines, a spokeswoman with FHS, said Thursday a 2 &UR;  &LR; percent
reimbursement cap in these markets didn't cover the ever-increasing
costs of the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Dec. 31, Foundation Health members in 36 counties in
Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, New York and
Pennsylvania will no longer get coverage under the
Medicare-plus-Choice HMO product.
</P>
<P>
   In California, FHS subsidiary Health Net will cease offering its
Medicare HMO product in Fresno and Sonoma counties, affecting 3,200
Medicare enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both areas, we didn't have a lot of market share, which
makes it tougher from a negotiating standpoint with our
providers,'' Haines said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sonoma County, for example, for every $120 Health Net spends
treating a patient, the government reimburses the company $100, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Health Net will continue to provide Medicare coverage
in 20 California counties, including Los Angeles, Ventura, San
Bernardino and Riverside counties.
</P>
<P>
   FHS also announced that it would significantly reduce pharmacy
and other benefits in the majority of the 36 counties nationwide
where it will continue to offer a Medicare-plus-Choice product next
year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company was expected to increase supplemental
premiums in many of these counties, which could lead to further
attrition in its Medicare-plus-Choice program.
</P>
<P>
   Haines said the subsidiaries are contacting all affected
enrollees, physicians and employer groups, notifying them of these
decisions and informing them of other Medicare options for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   All of the health plans will work closely with their members to
ensure a smooth transition to another Medicare HMO or back to
traditional Medicare, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which
revised the way Medicare was funded, FHS health plans offering
Medicare HMO products have left 64 counties, affecting 38,000
enrollees nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Effective Jan. 1, FHS will have ceased offering its HMO product
in 82 counties, affecting 57,000 Medicare enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Woodland Hills-based Foundation Health Systems closed
up 0.31 cents to $14.31 on volume of 701,100 shares traded on the
New York Stock Exchange.

DALAI OFFERS BLESSINGS FOR PEACE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Clarifies lede: first of its kind built...) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DONNA HUFFAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ The Dalai Lama blessed a Tibetan-Buddhist
shrine at Forest Lawn Memorial Park on Thursday that is the first
of its kind built in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then, since even a Tibetan-Buddhist shrine blessing wouldn't be
complete in Los Angeles without a Hollywood celebrity, the Dalai
Lama appeared onstage with Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   The exiled Tibetan leader spoke to more than 900 people gathered
at Forest Lawn's Hall of the Crucifixion-Resurrection in a
question-and-answer session hosted by the actress, an outspoken
advocate for the Tibetan cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``When affection is there, caring is there,'' the Dalai Lama
told the capacity crowd as he advised them to use their
intelligence positively, live holistically and open themselves to a
more positive existence. ``Automatically our minds become more
widened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barefoot and wearing a feather boa, the star of ``Basic
Instinct'' and ``Casino'' wondered beforehand how she would
introduce the religious leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, referring to
him as ``Mr. Please, please, please let me back into China'' and
``the hardest working man in spirituality.''

   The 42-year-old actress, who with her husband, Phil Bronstein,
recently adopted a baby boy, said one of the things gleaned from
Buddhism is empathy for one another and the complete freedom to
love another human being whom you have never met before.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama blessed the Shi-tro Mandala, which is being built
at Forest Lawn, in a private ceremony. The first three-dimensional
mandala to be created in the United States, it is one of only a few
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The intricately carved and brightly colored work by artist Pema
Namdol Thaye is dedicated to universal peace. Expected to be
completed in three months, it will be available for exhibition in
museums and other venues throughout the United States before it's
permanently installed at the Chagdud Gonpa center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Maxwell, executive director and co-founder of the local We
Care For Youth group, has been involved with the mandala since the
project began and helped bring it to Forest Lawn. At the
question-and-answer session, she praised the attendance of a group
of 22 teens from Camp Scott of the Los Angeles County Probation
Department, saying they would benefit from the Dalai Lama's
Buddhist teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you turn kids' minds to peace, they go there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the teens asked the Dalai Lama how she can keep herself
out of trouble when trouble is often brought to her.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing laughter, he told her, ``Life is not easy,'' then
suggested she take note of Jesus and other teachers of peace. After
encouraging the girl to build her self-confidence and fight life's
challenges with wisdom, knowledge and determination, he summoned
her to the dais. As she wiped away tears, they exchanged hugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, born in 1935 when Tibet was an independent
country, assumed leadership when he was 16, after the Communist
Chinese invaded Tibet. Nine years later, he was forced into exile
in India and his return has become an international cause.
</P>
<P>
   His teachings are revered by followers around the world. San
Diego residents Sara and David Hamilton have practiced Buddhism for
a few years and have seen the Dalai Lama several times. They
brought their 9-month-old daughter, Lila, on Thursday, saying it is
important to show support for his teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddhism is a really good place to put your mind. I love the
discussions, even if you can't hear everything because you're
running around after a baby,'' Sara Hamilton said.

CAPSTONE GAINS 200 PERCENT IN NASDAQ IPO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Heralding the apparent resurgence of the market
for initial public offerings, Capstone Turbine Corp. gained 200
percent Thursday in its debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are clearly seeing that a bottom has been defined,'' said
David Menlow, president of IPOFinancial.com. ``As to whether it's a
resurgence, it's certainly not a reinstatement of the way things
used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   For well-run companies with solid products, the IPO market is
not as perilous as it has been in the past, Menlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Capstone, which makes microturbines that power buildings and
vehicles, priced its 9.1 million share initial offering at $16 per
share, the top of its proposed range.
</P>
<P>
   Shares rose steadily through the day to close at $48 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The successful IPO is a boon to lead underwriter Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co., Menlow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was Goldman's day to stick their tongue out at the other
underwriters,'' he said. ``This is another strong notch in the belt
of Goldman, Sachs.''
</P>
<P>
   Capstone Turbine makes microturbines that can be used in hybrid
vehicles. The company's product has been in commercial use since
July 1999 in buses in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Nashville and Tempe,
Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The units run on a number of gaseous and liquid fuels and use an
air bearing to lubricate the one moving part, the spinning turbine.
</P>
<P>
   The air bearing creates a high-pressure pocket of air for the
turbine that acts as a bearing but does not require lubricants such
as oil or grease.
</P>
<P>
   The company's turbines also can be used to generate power for
homes and businesses. Its current product generates 30 kilowatts of
electricity, enough to power a typical convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   A 60-kilowatt system is expected to be commercially available in
a few months, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Field, Capstone Turbine spokesman, declined to comment
Thursday, citing the customary quiet period imposed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission on companies at the time of
their initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The offering raised $145.4 million for Capstone, which said it
plans to use the proceeds to buy equipment, expand its sales and
marketing and develop its products.
</P>
<P>
   The company had a net loss of $29.5 million on revenues of $6.7
million in fiscal 1999. In the first quarter of 2000, the company
lost $7.8 million on revenues of $3.74 million.

COSTLY LOSS FOR AVENGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All the success enjoyed by Todd Marinovich the
past few weeks was bound to be balanced out at some point, and
Thursday night brought a devastating dose of adversity to the
Avengers and their quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich sprained his foot in the second quarter and committed
two crucial errors near his own goal line as the Avengers had their
Arena Football playoff hopes all but destroyed by a 64-52 loss to
the Milwaukee Mustangs before 10,991 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich, the Arena League's player of the week after a
10-touchdown performance against Houston Friday, completed 22 of 34
attempts for 317 yards and seven touchdowns. But a lack of
protection from his offensive line left Marinovich under pressure
for much of the game and contributed to the two game-turning plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers trailed by five with less than a minute remaining
and had the ball at their own 10, but Marinovich couldn't handle
the snap from center Brett Clark. Milwaukee's Lincoln Coleman
recovered the fumble, and quarterback Kevin McDougal scored on a
9-yard draw to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to hear me blame Todd for anything,''
Avengers coach Stan Brock said. ``This is a team game, and Todd did
a great job out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The other crucial play came midway through the second quarter,
when fullback Brian Easter missed a block and Marinovich was sacked
near his own goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Avengers lineman Rob Stanavitch recovered the ball in his own
end zone for a safety, and the Mustangs scored on the ensuing drive
to take a 29-14 lead that the Avengers could not overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one hurts, there's no doubt,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers, who had big efforts from receivers Chris Jackson
(11 catches, 150 yards) and Travis Hannah (six catches, 121 yards)
fell to 3-9. Even though 12 of the Arena League's 17 teams make the
playoffs, this game was considered a must-win for the Avengers,
since they host division-leading San Jose next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loser of this game is toast,'' Milwaukee coach Rick
Frazier said.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee improved to 4-7 and improved its playoff situation
significantly, thanks in large part to McDougal, the former Notre
Dame option quarterback who completed 22 of 34 attempts for 315
yards and eight touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal's 40-yard touchdown pass to Lamart Cooper with 5:18
remaining in the fourth quarter put the Mustangs up 57-45 and
appeared to seal the game. However, five minutes is plenty of time
to mount a rally in arena football and the Avengers nearly did it.
</P>
<P>
   With 2:24 remaining, Marinovich and Hannah connected on a
22-yard scoring pass. The Avengers forced the Mustangs to try a
57-yard field on their next possession, and the Avengers returned
the ball to their own 10 with 52 seconds to score a winning
touchdown, but the fumble ended any comeback hope.

SEVERAL TEAMS INTERESTED IN COTTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Schea Cotton remains a basketball player looking
for a place to play.
</P>
<P>
   After dealing with the surprise of not being selected in the NBA
draft, the well-traveled former Long Beach City College star has
received interest from a number of teams.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the draft concluded, Cotton's agent Steve Kauffman
said he received a call from the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman has also heard from the Minnesota Timberwolves and
Miami Heat. Kauffman said that Cotton, who left Alabama after his
sophomore season, has might have a better chance of finding a team
he can make as a free agent
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him this last night that sometimes when you are drafted
mid late second round, you might round up with a team you don't
have a chance of sticking with,'' said Kauffman on Thursday. ``If
he winds up going to a team (as a free agent) he is arguably better
off than being picked randomly in the mid to late second round.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotton averaged 15.5 points per game last season at Alabama. The
6-foot-6, 215-pound Cotton began the season playing shooting guard
but was moved out of position to power forward during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman said the move hurt Cotton's numbers at school and his
status heading into the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Kauffman said Cotton was able to show one-on-one
ability in workouts and they expected a mid-second round selection
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a surprise,'' Kauffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton played the 1998-99 season at Long Beach City College,
averaging 25.8 point per game and leading LBCC to a 33-3 record. He
was named a JUCO All-America.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton has been a heralded player since the eighth grade when he
was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   But his path to the 2000 NBA Draft has been winding.
</P>
<P>
   He won a CIF championship at Mater Dei in his sophomore season.
But his high school career included a stop at St. John Bosco, then
Mater Dei and then back to St. John Bosco.
</P>
<P>
   He signed letters on intent to play at Long Beach State, UCLA,
and N.C. STate but never played at any of the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a really nice kid,'' Kauffman said. ``Some people think
of the bouncing around but he's a really nice kid.''

   WASHINGTON _ I once bragged to a friend in Mexico that in the
United States we know the winner of a presidential election within
minutes after the polls close. That was nothing, he replied. ``Here
in Mexico we know almost a year before.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the joke may be on the Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI), which has ruled Mexico by hook or by crook for seven
decades. Francisco Labastida, its presidential candidate, is
running neck and neck with Vicente Fox of the National Action Party
(PAN).
</P>
<P>
   Next week the PRI may need its mapaches, the so-called devious
raccoons who tamper with the votes. Or it can hope that Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, the third major candidate in the race, will be the
spoiler by siphoning off more than 15 percent of the votes, mostly
from Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter who wins the election, democracy wins.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico will finally have a vibrant multiparty system with an
opposition Congress, an independent judiciary and a free press _
developments that would have been unthinkable only six years ago
when President Carlos Salinas won approval of the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the groundbreaking treaty with the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Because of NAFTA, the whole world will be watching to see that
the elections are conducted fairly. It's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   When Fox drew even in the polls, Labastida exchanged his
``softly, softly'' approach for the more familiar PRI tactics of
vote-buying and coercion.
</P>
<P>
   He also called in the old guard, known popularly as the
dinosaurs, led by former Interior Minister Manuel Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett was accused of faking a computer crash to steal the
1988 presidential election from Cardenas and deliver it to Salinas
and the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, when polls showed that a PAN candidate for
governor of Chihuahua was leading by 3 to 1, the PRI manufactured a
victory for its man.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett explained that a PAN win would open the door to the
historic enemies of Mexico _ the church, the United States and the
business community. So if there was fraud, he said, it was
patriotic fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Because of NAFTA, Mexico can now afford the luxury of democracy.
Inflation is relatively low, commercial banks are on their way to
recovery and foreign debt is under control.
</P>
<P>
   With an export-led growth strategy, commerce between the United
States and Mexico has expanded by more than 150 percent to $220
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Mexico replaced Japan (which has an economy 11 times
its size) as the No. 2 trading partner with America. In less than
10 years it will be numero uno, replacing Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has free trade arrangements with 28 other countries,
including those in the European Union. Given its history as a
protectionist economy, this is an extraordinary turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   These economic changes are affecting every aspect of life.
Within five years Mexican women will average two children, a sign
of a growing middle class. In 1975 women had a fertility rate of
six.
</P>
<P>
   New prosperity, zero population growth and fewer job seekers
will reduce the flow of illegal immigrants to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico still has a long way to go. Forty percent of its
population lives on less than $2 a day. Corruption and violence
have gone from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatista uprising in the remote southern border state of
Chiapas remains unresolved. And Mexico's multibillion-dollar
narco-trade with its addicted neighbor to the north is a powerful
destabilizing force.
</P>
<P>
   But because of NAFTA, these problems will be addressed
democratically.
</P>
<P>
   The next Mexican president will not be one of the new breed of
authoritarian-style leaders who have taken over in half a dozen
Latin American countries. These autocratic so-called populists, who
have assumed power through the ballot box, are ultranationalistic,
militaristic and impatient with the niceties of constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States wants to do more than pay lip service in
encouraging democracy in Central and South America, it should
negotiate an American Free Trade Agreement that extends all the way
from Canada to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   President Salinas remarked after the NAFTA vote: ``For the first
time ever, Mexico has a deadline for becoming more efficient. There
is no more manana.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting on July 2, Mexican democracy will not have to wait for
tomorrow, either. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The Nuclear Emergency Search Team _ the Energy
Department unit likened to a nuclear bomb squad that kept sensitive
information on the two computer disks that disappeared recently at
Los Alamos _ is a highly secretive outfit little-known to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   NEST, as it is called, was formed to allow a speedy response to
any credible report that a terrorist group might have planted a
nuclear device somewhere on U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   Its mission was given particular urgency, and its budget
considerably increased, in the aftermath of the Feb. 26, 1993,
terrorist attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   While that truck-bombing, using simple chemical explosives,
claimed six lives, a similar attack using even a small nuclear
device could have felled the towers and devastated the southern tip
of densely populated Manhattan Island, killing scores of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has thus built the capacity to fly a search and
response team of nuclear scientists and engineers, radiation
technicians and communications specialists to any spot in the
United States at a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   NEST, at a remote corner of Nellis Air Force Base in a vast
installation in the desolate reaches of southern Nevada, keeps a
cargo plane ready on the tarmac, loaded with vans, generators,
communications equipment and highly sophisticated detection
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Its staff comprises volunteers from Nellis and also from the
national nuclear laboratories of Los Alamos and Sandia in New
Mexico and Lawrence Livermore in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Some are experts in nuclear-bomb-making, others in the
dismantling of nuclear devices. Their identities are kept secret,
as are those of Energy Department briefers on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The department, which oversees the team, will reveal little
about how it does its work, in order not to provide unwitting
assistance to terrorists. Only rough outlines are known.
</P>
<P>
   One of the secrets most closely held about the group's work is
how it would disarm or neutralize a terrorist nuclear device. That
information was contained on the missing hard drives in the Los
Alamos lab.
</P>
<P>
   Such information might be useful to a terrorist group, allowing
it to booby-trap a nuclear device. But espionage at a level that
could penetrate America's most closely guarded laboratories would
seem far beyond the capacity of almost any terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   However, the disks also included data on U.S., Russian, French
and Chinese nuclear systems, useful to bomb-disarmers if a device
was based on such technology. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Could investing in Cuba become a reality in the near
future?
</P>
<P>
   For years, investors with a taste for exotic plays have had
their eye on the Caribbean island, in hopes that an easing of the
38-year U.S. trade embargo would provide a windfall.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that hope has proved futile, but change may be in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The granting of permanent normal trading status to China by the
U.S. House of Representatives and the easing of trade sanctions on
North Korea makes American policy toward Cuba look outdated, say
observers.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is growing from U.S. companies that want to export
everything from food to pharmaceuticals to the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   So how to take advantage of a possible easing in U.S. policy?
The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, run by Thomas J. Herzfeld
Advisors Inc., a Miami-based specialist in closed-end funds, is one
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, introduced in 1993, was originally called The First
Cuba Fund, but Thomas Herzfeld, the portfolio manager, said that
when it became clear that the embargo would not be lifted, it took
its present name with a mandate to invest in the region. It still
carries its original ticker symbol of CUBA.
</P>
<P>
   Since Cuba has no public companies, the fund invests in American
and international companies that stand to benefit from better
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The companies must be able to do well, even with no change in
Cuba, but if there is, they would have a ``Cuba kicker'' Herzfeld
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he owns Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Seaboard
Corp., which has an extensive commercial shipping network in the
region. The portfolio also includes Empresas ICA SA, the Mexican
construction company, and Puerto Rican Cement Co., likely
participants in rebuilding the country's crumbling infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean Basin Fund is listed on the Nasdaq Small Cap
Market, and traded at about $5 on Thursday, at about a 1.5 percent
discount to the value of the fund's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Herzfeld also has a new offering, The Cuba Fund, which would
invest directly in the country. It had been in registration, but
was ``on hold,'' he explained. ``We have to file an amended
registration to bring it back to life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors with a heartier appetite for risk may want to consider
a single play on Cuba's flourishing tourism industry. Leisure
Canada Inc. has a joint venture with the Castro government to build
four luxury tourist complexes.
</P>
<P>
   While the projects sound promising, Leisure Canada's shares,
which trade on the Canadian New Ventures Exchange, a merger of the
Vancouver and Alberta Stock Exchanges, have tumbled from 22.25
Canadian dollars ($15.10) last July to trade at 1.55 dollars on
last Thursday. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ Standing next to the museum display, the warm eyes,
generous smile and smooth complexion of Phan Thi Kim Phuc make it
hard to believe she is the same person as the girl in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone old enough to remember the Vietnam War, the
photograph of the naked 9-year-old girl running toward a camera
screaming in agony as napalm burned her flesh is seared into the
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Her image has become a symbol of the barbarity of war that
transcends debate about the rights or wrongs of U.S. intervention
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Its iconic status also serves as a constant reminder to Kim Phuc
of the day in June 1972, when a U.S. commander ordered South
Vietnamese planes to drop napalm near her village in the Central
Highlands of South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the pictures and the documentary,'' she said, referring
to a film that was made of her life three years ago. ``That makes
me remember all the time. I saw the airplane. I saw the fire. I got
burned. I was so scared and crying and running out of the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   But far from trying to avoid the memories, Kim Phuc is proud of
the photograph and wants to see it exposed to future generations.
``Let the world see how horrible wars can be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, along with shots of the bombing and her initial
rescue by a television film crew, is going on display as part of a
$75.2 million extension of London's Science Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The new Wellcome Wing opens to the public next week, but Kim
Phuc and Nick Ut, the Associated Press photographer who took the
pictures and helped save her life, were in London Tuesday for a
formal opening of the extension by Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Phuc is not overtly political, perhaps understandably. After
being used as a propaganda tool by the Vietnamese government, she
defected with her husband, Bui Huy Toan, during a refueling
stopover in Canada on a flight from Moscow to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to have freedom myself, and build my family,'' she
said. The couple live in Toronto with their two boys, Thomas, 6,
and Stephen, 3.
</P>
<P>
   She is happy to be an anti-war symbol, though. She was named a
goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) three years ago, and she has
established the Kim Foundation, which trains doctors and supplies
artificial limbs to help child victims of land mines in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move on to help each other,'' she said. ``I really
want to say, `Thank God I'm alive.' I want to forgive the people
who caused my suffering. I did.'' She laid a wreath at the Vietnam
Memorial in Washington in 1996 _ ``and so I am free from hatred and
bitterness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ut, who took up a camera after his brother was killed as an AP
photographer, didn't hesitate to help 28 years ago. After shooting
the Pulitzer-Prize photo, he doused Kim Phuc's body with water and
drove her to a hospital. And he has kept contact through her
painful recovery, which included 17 operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saved my life,'' Kim Phuc said of the man she calls Uncle
Ut. ``He's wonderful, isn't he. I'm so grateful that he didn't only
do his job, but he's a human being helping another.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Underground acquifers are diminishing on every
continent. Scores of countries face shortages as water tables fall
and wells go dry.
</P>
<P>
   Population increase means that 80 million extra people each year
need access to water resources. Nearly all the projected 3 billion
people to be added to the population in the next half century will
be born in countries that are already experiencing water shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Overpumping of water has occurred mainly in the last 50 years.
Only since powerful diesel- and electrically-driven pumps were
developed have we had the capacity to pull water out of aquifers
faster than it is replaced by precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 percent of the water consumed worldwide is used for
irrigation. Another 20 percent is used by industry, and 10 percent
is used for residential purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In the increasingly intense competition for water among sectors,
agriculture almost always loses.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000 tons of water used in India to produce a ton of wheat
worth perhaps $200 can also be used to expand industrial output
that is worth 50 times as much.
</P>
<P>
   Urbanization and industrialization expand the demand for water.
As villagers in developing countries move to urban high-rise
apartment buildings with indoor plumbing, their residential water
use can easily triple.
</P>
<P>
   As people move up the food chain, consuming more beef, pork,
poultry, eggs and dairy products, they use more grain because
livestock and poultry are fed on grain.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. diet requires 800 kilograms of grain per person a year,
whereas diets in India, dominated by a starchy food staple such as
rice, typically need only 200 kilograms. Using four times as much
grain per person means using four times as much water to grow the
grain.
</P>
<P>
   Once a localized phenomenon, water scarcity is now crossing
national borders via the international grain trade.
</P>
<P>
   The world's fastest growing grain import market is North Africa
and the Middle East. Virtually every country in this region is
simultaneously experiencing water shortages and rapid population
growth.
</P>
<P>
   As the demand for water in the region's cities and industries
rises, it is typically satisfied by diverting water from
irrigation. The loss in food production capacity is then offset by
importing grain.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Iran imported 7 million tons of wheat, eclipsing Japan
to become the world's leading wheat importer. This year Egypt is
also projected to move ahead of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The world water deficit grows larger each year, making it
potentially more difficult to manage.
</P>
<P>
   If we decided suddenly to stabilize water tables everywhere by
simply pumping less water, the world grain harvest would fall by
some 160 million tons, or 8 percent, and grain prices would
skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   If the deficit continues to widen, the pain and dislocation
caused by the eventual adjustment will be even greater.
</P>
<P>
   Unless governments in water-short countries act quickly, their
water shortages may soon become food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that the growing number of water-short countries
with rising grain import needs will overwhelm the exportable supply
in food surplus countries. Millions of people in low-income,
water-short countries will be trapped: thirsty and hungry, unable
to escape.
</P>
<P>
   There are still opportunities for developing new water
resources, but restoring the balance between use and sustainable
supply will depend primarily on reducing demand by stabilizing
population and making more efficient use of water.
</P>
<P>
   The first step toward this goal is to eliminate the water
subsidies that encourage waste. The second step is to raise the
price of water to reflect its cost.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting to technologies, crops and forms of animal protein that
do not guzzle water offers huge potential for raising water
productivity. Such shifts will move faster if the price of water
more closely reflects its value. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Butler, the outspoken Australian who led the
United Nations efforts to strip Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction after the Gulf War, says he fears that Iraq has used
the 18 months without U.N. monitors to rearm.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been under sanctions since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
but in an interview with the Independent, Butler said that Iraq had
exploited divisions among the five U.N. Security Council permanent
members _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has even ensured that ``Saddam has a veto at the Council
table'' by insisting that Iraq must approve of the future
inspection procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence from Iraq of such (disarmament) work should be a
source of grave concern,'' says Butler.
</P>
<P>
   If the Big Five U.N. members are united, then military action
should not be necessary to enforce international law, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who has just published a book ``Saddam Defiant'' on his
own frustrating experience as top weapons inspector, said that
``The world will never be the same'' if a missile loaded with nerve
gas were to hit Tel Aviv, a single canister of VX nerve gas were
released into the New York City subway system, or a single nuclear
explosion hollowed out central London.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is now faced with a tough policy decision on Iraq in the
coming weeks when the new disarmament body prepares to test Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's willingness to allow intrusive
inspections aimed at ensuring that he has given up the capacity to
build weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   If Iraq defies U.N. provisions by refusing entry to the U.N.
inspectors, the Security Council will once again have to decide
whether to take military action to force the sanctions-hit country
to comply with international law.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's last refusal to cooperate with UNSCOM inspectors led by
Butler prompted the United States and Britain to launch Operation
Desert Fox in December 1998. The two countries have kept up a
low-level bombing campaign in allied-patrolled ``no-fly'' zones
since that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a crunch in August,'' Butler predicted.
</P>
<P>
   That is when UNMOVIC, the new organization which he describes as
the ``sickly son of UNSCOM,'' will have recruited and trained up
its politically- and geographically-correct team of experts.
</P>
<P>
   They were mandated by the Security Council last December to
complete the elimination of Iraqi nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons, and long-range missiles capable of striking Iraq's
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM fell apart in the aftermath of Desert Fox, which split
the Security Council, amid accusations that UNSCOM was being used
by the U.S. and Israel for spying purposes, and was disturbing
Iraqi sensibilities through its ``cowboy'' methods.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, backed by Russia and China, continues to insist that it
has already complied with U.N. disarmament requirements and that
sanctions should be lifted forthwith. Baghdad has also warned that
it will not cooperate with UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
   Once the UNMOVIC teams, now led by former IAEA chief Hans Blix,
are up and running at the end of August, the Security Council will
have to decide whether to force the issue by attempting to send
them back to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who is now diplomat in residence at the Council for
Foreign Relations in New York, says that Britain will come under
huge pressure in the Security Council from the Russians and
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will call for a shift in policy, then they can get
UNMOVIC in,'' he says. ``Russia, China and France say first lift
the sanctions on the promise to let the monitors in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice for the West is: will they take Iraq's word for
it?... And then the Council will have been conned,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that August is only three months ahead of the U.S.
presidential election, Butler says that the attitude of the other
hard-liner on Iraq in the Security Council cannot be predicted at
this stage.
</P>
<P>
   Washington seems somewhat disengaged on Iraq at present,
according to U.N. diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats commented that Butler may be premature in
predicting a new crisis with Iraq in August, and that the Security
Council may continue to sit on its hands when presented with the
new-look inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The current deadlock, under which Iraq is benefiting from a
loosened oil-for-food humanitarian program while receiving the
occasional bomb from a U.S. or British warplane, may actually
benefit all the players concerned, including Britain and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if the inspectors go back this side of
Christmas,'' one diplomat said. &QL;

are up and running at the end of August, the Security Council will
have to decide whether to force the issue by attempting to send
them back to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who is now diplomat in residence at the Council for
Foreign Relations in New York, says that Britain will come under
huge pressure in the Security Council from the Russians and
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will call for a shift in policy, then they can get
UNMOVIC in,'' he says. ``Russia, China and France say first lift
the sanctions on the promise to let the monitors in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice for the West is: will they take Iraq's word for
it?... And then the Council will have been conned,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that August is only three months ahead of the U.S.
presidential election, Butler says that the attitude of the other
hard-liner on Iraq in the Security Council cannot be predicted at
this stage.
</P>
<P>
   Washington seems somewhat disengaged on Iraq at present,
according to U.N. diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats commented that Butler may be premature in
predicting a new crisis with Iraq in August, and that the Security
Council may continue to sit on its hands when presented with the
new-look inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The current deadlock, under which Iraq is benefiting from a
loosened oil-for-food humanitarian program while receiving the
occasional bomb from a U.S. or British warplane, may actually
benefit all the players concerned, including Britain and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if the inspectors go back this side of
Christmas,'' one diplomat said. &QL;

   MEXICO CITY _ With less than a week left before Mexico's
closest-ever presidential election, the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party is stripping down for action and going after
the female vote.
</P>
<P>
   A quintet of buff male dancers pranced in cowboy boots,
strutting their stuff and snapping their thongs for 15,000
shrieking women at a recent political rally on the outskirts of the
capital. The organizers had enticed poor urban housewives out in
record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes were on the message spelled out on the backsides of the
tight boxer shorts worn by ``The Sexy Boys'': VOTE FOR PRI! When
these, too, were cheekily flung away, the screams were almost
supersonic.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these women from the PRI stronghold of Mexico state,
which has 7.5 million potential voters, arrived six hours early to
secure an unobstructed view of the stage.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from the dull PRI campaigns of the past. There
was no brass band wheezing tunes while a rent-a-crowd of day
laborers cheered the candidate's stilted speech, then waved his
convoy of flashy cars off to the next fly-blown town.
</P>
<P>
   A big banner for the PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco
Labastida, was prominently displayed as a backdrop while the
entertainers did their bumps and grinds. However, the silver-haired
technocrat did not attend as a speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it in a Mexican political
campaign,'' said Josefina Franzoni, an analyst at the Mexican
Institute of Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
   When male strip shows first took Mexico by storm last summer,
National Action Party (PAN) stalwarts and right-wing Catholic
clergyman often were tempted to score political points by revoking
permits at the last minute in the name of public decency.
</P>
<P>
   This only added to the show's mystique, and one touring stud
cabaret, ``Solo Para Mujeres,'' set box-office records. In less
than a year, the ruling party has seized on the gimmick as a crowd
puller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that we can see nude men, but I would like to see
more political proposals,'' said Franzoni.
</P>
<P>
   Comprising 51 percent of Mexico's 59 million registered voters,
women can swing this tight election and they are being courted by
all candidates. Some four million households are headed by single
women, and they are changing the dynamics of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's wife even went on a walkabout in one of Mexico
City's tough neighborhoods to speak on crime. ``She's the first
wife of a candidate with her own personality,'' said Miguel Acosta
of the Mexican Human-Rights Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls waver, but for the first time the authoritarian
PRI is facing a viable challenge in a transparent election process.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, conservative candidate for an alliance of the PAN
and the Mexican Green Ecologists, has been riding high with his
appeal to young professionals. He even led by five percentage
points in one recent poll.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the left-wing spoiler from the Democratic
Revolution Party, gained support following a television debate in
which he appeared statesmanlike, but his electoral chances are
slim. Some of his party have defected, but he refuses to join Fox
in his alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Spin and image have been greater factors in this campaign than
in previous elections where a PRI victory was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   An American political consultant, James Carville, helped to
devise Labastida's campaign slogan, ``Change with a course,'' as an
antidote to the corrupt image the PRI acquired during seven decades
in power.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive, is more succinct: ``Enough!''
is his rallying cry.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a backlash from women's groups, offended by the
PRI's spectacle. A full-page advertisement in a leading daily
newspaper recently denounced the skin show, but reproduced raunchy
images from it.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Movement to Fight for Human Rights and the Equality
of Women said: ``No, Mr. Labastida, Mexico is grander than this.
You are not able to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they would have been satisfied had female strippers
received equal time is unclear. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ The new United Nations commission for arms
inspection in Iraq is likely to be used by the U.S. government to
trigger a confrontation with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the
run-up to the November presidential elections, a former U.N.
inspector claimed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ritter, who resigned from the previous UNSCOM, said it was
commonly recognized in Washington and New York that the new
mission, under the chairmanship of Hans Blix, has no realistic
chance of being allowed into Iraq while sanctions and air strikes
by American and Britain continues.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's blocking, he maintained, would be used by Washington as
an example of non-compliance to the U.N., leading the way to an
escalation of bombing without the U.N. Security Council being asked
to vote on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The former U.S. Marine Intelligence Colonel left his post with
UNSCOM in August 1998 after complaining that information covertly
gathered by the U.N. was turned over to the U.S. by the team's
chief Australian Richard Butler, and used in the bombing campaign
Operation Desert Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter was in London to address the inaugural meeting of the
Great Britain Iraq Society. The man once accused by the Iraqis of
being a CIA spy, now believes that the sanctions against Iraq are
doing nothing to damage Saddam's regime and only victimizing the
civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Independent Ritter accused the U.S.
government of hypocrisy, and Britain of acquiescing to this.
</P>
<P>
   He said that both government's knew Iraq did not now possess the
capability for using weapons of mass destruction, but the Clinton
administration was still pursuing a cynical policy for short-term
political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new commission, UNMOVIC, will not be allowed into Iraq in
August, a month of primaries and three months away from the
election. You have got a vice president, Al Gore, trailing behind
in the polls and what better way to appear tough and switch
attention away to a so-called foreign threat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. Security Council did not vote on Desert Fox and we
can expect the same thing to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. would not like to take unilateral action; it needs
Britain to give it in appearance of something multilateral,'' said
Ritter. ``And sadly, when the U.S. says jump, Tony Blair asks `how
high?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The ironic thing,'' he continued, ``is that the longer the
inspectors stay away from Iraq, the more time the hard-liners there
have to rebuild their weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intelligence services of the U.S., Britain and Israel
realize this, but there is nothing they can do while the U.S.
administration wants to keep Iraq as the whipping boy they can
wheel out at times of domestic difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter has held extensive talks with congressmen in Washington.
He said: ``Both Republicans and Democrats accept the current policy
on Iraq is a mess. But it seems little will be done this side of
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's strident criticism has led to the U.S. government
launching a FBI investigation into allegations that he had supplied
Intelligence to the Israelis. On the subject, Ritter said: ``That
started in 1996 and is still going on. It has cost me $120,000 in
legal fees so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``After endless requests the FBI finally agreed to meet me last
month. I am not demeaning their investigation, it is a very serious
issue, but I have nothing to hide.'' &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The U.S. software giant Oracle made the
sensational admission Wednesday that it had hired a firm of private
detectives to discredit its arch-rival Microsoft and undermine its
efforts to fend off the government's antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after a flurry of office break-ins,
computer laptop thefts, and attempts to buy off janitorial staff at
consultancy firms associated with Bill Gates' company.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a hastily orchestrated piece of damage
control, Oracle admitted it had hired Investigation Group
International to try to establish links between Microsoft and a
number of supposedly independent consultancy firms, which had
testified on its behalf in court. It insisted, however, that it had
not sanctioned any illegal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said it had ordered the investigation into two groups,
the Independent Institute and the National Taxpayers Union, because
it suspected they were not as impartial as they claimed. Evidence
of their financial links to Microsoft subsequently appeared in The
Wall Street Journal and other newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact their work was funded by Microsoft for the express
purpose of influencing public opinion...'' an Oracle company
statement alleged. ``Left undisclosed, these Microsoft front groups
could have improperly influenced the outcome of one of the most
important cases in U.S. history,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Oracle statement made no mention of a third group,
the Association for Competitive Technology, which recently reported
a woman investigator trying to obtain its trash by offering cash to
its office cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   It also made no mention of a series of laptop thefts reported at
yet another group, Citizens for a Sound Economy, whose links to
Microsoft were subsequently written up in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Institute has also complained of laptops going
missing. Microsoft suffered a break-in at its Washington office
earlier this month, although it has yet to determine if any
important effects or documents were taken.
</P>
<P>
   The Oracle statement said it did not stipulate how IGI should go
about its investigations. ``We did, however, insist that whatever
methods IGI employed, those methods must be legal. IGI repeatedly
assured us that all their activities were in fact 100 percent
legal.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. business press, ever sensitive to the bitter rivalry
between Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Oracle's chief executive,
Larry Ellison, are delighting in what they are already describing
as a Watergate-style scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Microsoft antitrust suit, Ellison has taken the
moral high ground, describing Gates as a ``convicted monopolist''
and arguing for an aggressive company break-up to stem his power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when someone breaks the law, he should be punished,''
Ellison told The Independent in an interview in January. Now,
however, the pressure is on for Ellison to demonstrate that he did
not stray from the high ground himself.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the private investigation affair, The Wall Street
Journal reported Wednesday that Oracle had hired a Washington
public-relations firm, Chlopak, Leonard, Schechter and Associates,
to circulate damaging stories about Microsoft in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is dramatic proof that Microsoft's competitors have been
funding and orchestrating a massive PR and lobbying campaign in an
effort to tarnish Microsoft's image and invite government
intervention in an industry that has been very competitive and
serving consumers very well,'' a Microsoft spokesman said. ``We
think it's a very sad day and a huge embarrassment for Oracle and
all its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode that first put the spotlight on IGI occurred on June
1, when a team of cleaners at the Washington offices of the
Association for Competitive Technology was approached by a woman
asking if she could buy their trash.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying herself as Blanca Lopez and speaking Spanish to the
Latino cleaning crew, she said she was investigating a criminal
case and wanted the trash moved to the adjacent offices of a firm
called Upstream Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The cleaners turned down her offer, and rebuffed her again five
days later when she came back with $1,200 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Upstream Technologies, which only began leasing the office space
last month, has since shut up shop and appears to have been a
phantom organization. The person whose name appeared on the lease
application, Robert Walters, has been identified in the past as an
IGI investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Zuck, the Association for Competitive Technology's
president, was quoted Wednesday describing the trash episode as
``despicable'' and said he was contemplating legal action for
violation of his employees' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope to get a letter of apology from Larry Ellison and
an explanation of how, in a climate over so much concern over the
issue of privacy, he could think this is an acceptable business
practice,'' he told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not dumpster-diving in offices outside the building,
this is bribery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Oracle refusing to acknowledge any link with the episode,
Ellison now faces the famous Watergate question: what did he know,
and when did he know it?
</P>
<P>
   IGI, a well-known investigation firm which worked for the White
House during the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit against U.S.
President Bill Clinton, said Wednesday that it did not want to
comment on the Microsoft/Oracle matter.
</P>
<P>
   Press reports, however, suggested a variety of potential
embarrassments for the company, including the revelation that it
accepted work from Microsoft on a software counterfeiting case
earlier this year while under contract to Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   News reports have also focused attention on the string of recent
break-ins and laptop thefts, although nobody has yet furnished
evidence that they are more than a bizarre coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   The least suspicious is the Microsoft break-in, which was one of
a number of burglaries committed in the same part of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The consultancy firms that have lost laptops, only to see
confidential files contained in them appear in the newspapers, are
straining themselves not to jump to conclusions. &QL;

   MEXICO CITY _ Nearly three-quarters of a century after it took
power, Mexico is preparing to reject the political party that has
exerted an iron grip on the life of the country for as long as most
people can remember.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before Mexico's presidential election, the race looks
set to be the closest and most bitter in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet polls consistently indicate that the seven-decade rule of
the Partido Revolutionario Institutional (PRI) will be broken, an
event as historically significant as the fall of the Berlin Wall,
according to the main opposition candidate and presidential
front-runner, Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But as the usually jaded Mexican voters sense their ballots
could actually make a difference and are showing up for campaign
rallies in record numbers, complaints of intimidation, vote-buying
and coercion by the establishment have been logged across the
country, in spite of a new independent electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
   And while Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who leads the
center-right Alliance for Change, urges the young and disaffected
to unplug the old political machine, all the well-oiled mechanisms
of the PRI are being brought to bear against its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who dares suggest that the PRI will resort to fraud is
``crazy or irresponsible,'' its candidate, Francisco Labastida,
told 100,000 supporters in Mexico City's main plaza earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that unless the PRI triumphs by a decisive margin of 10
percent _ more than it would be able to manipulate _ he will refuse
to accept defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The former mayor of Mexico City, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who
founded the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, is running third
with barely 20 percentage points, while the other candidates each
claim twice this support.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Cardenas joined with Fox to denounce the government-run
petroleum industry, Pemex, for pressuring civil servants to
campaign for the PRI or else lose their jobs. This son of a former
president railed against the PRI for its ``blatant attempts to
blackmail the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Every lamp post is now plastered with some politician's smiling
face and competing banners are strung across the skyline like
bright laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Government pledges to keep the campaign clean drew smirks this
month when the Yucatan governor, a PRI loyalist, doled out more
than 1,000 washing machines and packets of detergent to poor
housewives in his district.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials in Tabasco state finally released flood
disaster payments which had been tied in red tape since last
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers reported that homeowners supporting the PRI were
given $600 while opposition backers made do with $200. Poor
citizens who depend on cash payments from social programs fear that
they risk getting cut off unless they actively back the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government's social programs are PRI programs and
we're going to use them to win the presidency,'' said Manuel
Bartlett, a former interior minister, while campaigning for
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who turns 58 on election day _ July 2 _ is appealing to
youthful voters, who rarely have bothered to take part in past
elections, as well as to women.
</P>
<P>
   Running on an anti-corruption manifesto, the former Guanajuato
governor stands 6-ft., 5-in. in his cowboy boots and claims he has
raised new standards in political life. But old-time Mexicans do
not quite know how to deal with this brash outsider, who sells his
vision of the future with earthy soundbites. &QL;

   Every lamp post is now plastered with some politician's smiling
face and competing banners are strung across the skyline like
bright laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Government pledges to keep the campaign clean drew smirks this
month when the Yucatan governor, a PRI loyalist, doled out more
than 1,000 washing machines and packets of detergent to poor
housewives in his district.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials in Tabasco state finally released flood
disaster payments which had been tied in red tape since last
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers reported that homeowners supporting the PRI were
given $600 while opposition backers made do with $200. Poor
citizens who depend on cash payments from social programs fear that
they risk getting cut off unless they actively back the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government's social programs are PRI programs and
we're going to use them to win the presidency,'' said Manuel
Bartlett, a former interior minister, while campaigning for
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who turns 58 on election day _ July 2 _ is appealing to
youthful voters, who rarely have bothered to take part in past
elections, as well as to women.
</P>
<P>
   Running on an anti-corruption manifesto, the former Guanajuato
governor stands 6-ft., 5-in. in his cowboy boots and claims he has
raised new standards in political life. But old-time Mexicans do
not quite know how to deal with this brash outsider, who sells his
vision of the future with earthy soundbites. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ To see how far President Robert Mugabe, one-time
national hero of Zimbabwe, has fallen you had only to attend the
opposition's recent election rallies. It could be measured in the
raucous laughter that followed the numerous, and sexually risque,
``Bob and Grace'' jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The gags about President Mugabe and free-spending Grace, four
decades his junior, whom he married in 1996, lost something in
translation from Shona to English. But the biting sarcasm, that
even a few years ago few would have dared express in public,
survived.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians _ come-standup comedians _ who worked the crowds
linked the president's political and private sins, and concluded
that Mugabe's kleptomaniac tendencies were so ingrained that he had
even felt compelled to steal Grace, another man's wife.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone had dared tell the old man about the daily ridicule,
he might have wondered when, and possibly even why, the rot set in.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that over twenty years Mugabe allowed his
overriding greed for power to cloud his judgment and distance him
from his people.
</P>
<P>
   During the weeks of pre-election, state-sponsored violence, many
ordinary Zimbabweans concluded that Bob loved power more than his
country, and perhaps he always had.
</P>
<P>
   It all started so well. In 1980, when Mugabe became prime
minister, after his successful bush war against the minority white
regime of Ian Smith, he was largely adored and the former British
colony he inherited was in healthy shape.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy hardly mattered after the common black enemy _
colonialists and white racists _ was defeated, and Mugabe was feted
at home and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The president had made his own sacrifices for the cause. He
spent ten years in jail, separated from his first wife Sally,
courtesy of the Smith regime, and was inside when their
four-year-old son _ their only child _ died.
</P>
<P>
   And to be fair, Mugabe, who acquired several degrees in jail,
set about improving the conditions of his downtrodden people. He
poured money into education even when the international monetary
institutions disapproved.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, some Zimbabweans say, is that by creating an informed
population, he was educating himself _ in the long term _ out of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe was always authoritarian but throughout his reign his
greed for power just kept growing. He made laws, amended the
constitution and massacred rivals to increase his control and that
of his party, ZANU-PF.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe became a one-party state, run by ZANU and its corrupt
cronies, where dissent was discouraged, sometimes brutally.
</P>
<P>
   When the much-loved Sally Mugabe died in 1992 so did some of the
public's affection for her husband. Grace's arrival - along with
the revelation that Mugabe had fathered a child by her when Sally
was still alive _ just added to public disillusion.
</P>
<P>
   Demands for multiparty democracy began to emerge in the late
1980s, championed by trade union leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, who
would, a decade later, form the Movement for Democratic Change _
and challenge Mugabe. But it was the economic disaster Mugabe
presided over during the 1990s that created the mass clamor for
political change.
</P>
<P>
   With his back against the wall, Mugabe acted like a dinosaur. He
harked back to a bush war that meant little to a new generation,
and spouted now meaningless Cold War rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   And when he tried to play his last card _ the racist one _ and
blame white farmers for the country's ills, few Zimbabweans bought
it. Many just laughed at the old man, hero turned despot and now
figure of fun. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. electorate is treating the Gore-Bush
presidential contest as one colossal yawn.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits forecast that the turnout in November could be the
lowest on record. The television networks are scaling down their
campaign coverage, and most have decided to leave gavel-to-gavel
coverage of the nominating conventions in July and August to the
specialist cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   But news is gradually seeping out that Al Gore and George W
Bush, two bland offspring of famous political families, will not
have the publicity field entirely to themselves this summer, not
during their setpiece conventions, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on an idea from Arianna Huffington, the glamorous and
sharp-tongued columnist formerly married to the millionaire and
failed senatorial candidate, Michael Huffington, an alliance of
groups is organizing two alternative conventions to shadow the
official ones, day by day and hour by hour.
</P>
<P>
   These shadow conventions promise to be more fun, and probably
more glitzy, than the official ones, which could well displease the
many commercial sponsors of the Gore and Bush extravaganzas.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, for instance, the band will strike up, the
strobe lights flash, and on to the stage will stride John McCain
with his hearty wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good evening and welcome,'' he will shout to ecstatic cheers,
before lambasting the corruption of a political system that
railroaded through its favorite sons before half the electorate had
had a chance to choose.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Democrats can expect Warren Beatty to reprise
his Bulworth act from the film of that name, unleashing a torrent
of invective about the real state of the nation and the cynicism of
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   They will also be treated to tub-thumping equality rhetoric from
Jesse Jackson, and maybe a touch of insurrectionist argument from
Ralph Nader, devoted advocate of ordinary people and newly crowned
nominee of the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing a technique used at recent party conventions, when
``real'' people are recruited to praise the nominee, both shadow
events will hear from ordinary citizens who say they have been
victimized during the past eight years of the Clinton presidency.
There will be entertainment, with contributions from such household
names in U.S. television satire as Bill Maher and Al Franken.
</P>
<P>
   Participants are also likely to be treated to Huffington's
biting satire and newfound social conscience. She could read choice
excerpts from her diary, written as though from the White House
Lincoln bedroom, or from her new book _ her rich woman's epiphany
about the wealth gap and poverty in America. &QL;

   BEIRUT _ The Independent on Sunday didn't make it onto the
newsstands here in Beirut the weekend before last. Nor did Business
Week. Nor did the Economist. Or Newsweek. Or Time magazine. Or Le
Figaro. Or Le Monde...
</P>
<P>
   There was, it seemed, a little problem with the coverage of a
recent Middle East event: the death of President Hafez el-Assad of
Syria, whose memory was not always treated in the international
press with quite the respect it deserved.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent's sin, it seems, was to have recorded the
genuine grief of Syria's citizens while noting the lack of black
flags in the ancient city of Hama where a 1982 fundamentalist
insurrection was bloodily repressed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Lebanese can read anything they want on the Internet,
the Surete Generale felt it necessary to explain the reason for its
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were well aware that articles could be read on
the Internet, the Surete said. But refusing permission for
offending publications to go on sale was a way of expressing the
government's ``moral disapproval.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities, an official statement added, had a duty to
counter comments which were disrespectful of the head of state or
``the head of state of a neighboring country.'' In other words,
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of conjecture as to whether the Syrians are as
frightened of criticism as the Lebanese are on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's government ministers have long accepted that foreign
journalists won't show the same respect as such giants of
journalism as Al Baath or the Syria Times. And Syria's new
heir-president, Bashar el-Assad, is fascinated by computers and the
Internet _ indeed, he was himself brought online by a Lebanese
communications expert.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, the problem has nothing to do with the press.
It's about the relationship between Lebanon and ``Sister Syria,''
the presence of some 21,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon and the cozy
way in which Damascus and Beirut become ever closer.
</P>
<P>
   Take the telephone. Syria's international code is 0096311. But
in Beirut, I have only to dial 02 for Damascus. When I'm in
Damascus, I dial Beirut not through the international code 009611
but just 061. Overnight, the two capitals became just local calls
apart.
</P>
<P>
   True, Syria has not annexed Lebanon, as its critics would have
the world believe. The Syrians have not introduced their currency
to Beirut and the Lebanese _ not the Syrian _ flag flies over
government ministries.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a Boulevard du President Hafez el-Assad near the
airport, there are plenty of highways dedicated to Lebanese
presidents and prime ministers. In Beirut, even the lunatic General
Michel Aoun _ who thought he was General de Gaulle when he launched
a war against the Syrians in 1989 but then ran like Petain for the
French ambassador's residence the moment the Syrians bombed him in
1990 _ can find his rantings printed in the Beirut press.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a certain amount of hypocrisy uttered about the
Syrians. I often hear the Lebanese complaining that their sons
cannot find jobs because of the presence of 400,000 Syrian guest
workers (or a million if you believe some) in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the Syrians can be found cleaning streets, selling bread,
washing houses _ menial jobs which the Lebanese have always refused
to do. If the Syrians weren't here, I suspect an army of Filipinos
would be forthcoming. There's already reported to be a legion of
240,000 Sri Lankan housemaids in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the cry from the Christian Maronites that with the
Israelis in retreat, it's time the Syrian forces also left Lebanon
_ a demand which conveniently forgets that it was the Maronites who
demanded the Syrian presence in the first place, and that the
mainstream Christian community never lifted a finger to oppose the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians, of course, remember 1982 and the Maronite
government installed by the Israelis _ Syria's troops and guns and
tanks are here to ensure that Lebanon does not again fall under the
sway of Syria's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Lebanese and Syrian intelligence services work
closely together. There has even been a joint passing-out parade of
Syrian and Lebanese cadets.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not quite that simple. The treaty of brotherhood and
cooperation between Beirut and Damascus provides for Syria's
protection of her tiny neighbor in the event of ``Zionist
aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is that, while Syria may have saved Lebanon
from an Arafat-style capitulation to Israel, it clearly cannot
defend Lebanon from Israeli military attack. The Israeli air force
has eight times bombed Lebanon's power stations with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, needless to say, the Syrians tell you how grateful
the Lebanese should be, how many sacrifices Syria has made for
Lebanon _ a view not exactly reciprocated in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese, I suspect, have never gotten over the fact that
the Syrians _ who were cruelly regarded before the civil war as
backward and uneducated _ had to enter Lebanon when the
sophisticated, over-educated Lebanese tore themselves apart in
bloody internecine war.
</P>
<P>
   They forget, too, that an estimated 36 percent of the millions
of dollars invested in Beirut's banks is Syrian money.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it all goes back to the one-armed General Henri
Gouraud who carved ``Greater Lebanon'' out of Syria after the
1914-18 war. Before that, Beirut was a Syrian port.
</P>
<P>
   If you go up to the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli today,
you'll find thousands of families with relatives living in the
central Syrian cities of Hama and Homs, a reminder that back in the
aftermath of the First World War, most of the population of Lebanon
wanted to remain unified under the old Ottoman-style ``vilayet'' of
Damascus. Only the Maronites and the French demanded a new state.
</P>
<P>
   In the north of Ireland, another frontier was being drawn about
the same time. And around the new state of Yugoslavia. Thus did the
power and authority of the old mapmakers help to doom future
generations. &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT _ The Independent on Sunday didn't make it onto the
newsstands here in Beirut the weekend before last. Nor did Business
Week. Nor did the Economist. Or Newsweek. Or Time magazine. Or Le
Figaro. Or Le Monde...
</P>
<P>
   There was, it seemed, a little problem with the coverage of a
recent Middle East event: the death of President Hafez el-Assad of
Syria, whose memory was not always treated in the international
press with quite the respect it deserved.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent's sin, it seems, was to have recorded the
genuine grief of Syria's citizens while noting the lack of black
flags in the ancient city of Hama where a 1982 fundamentalist
insurrection was bloodily repressed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Lebanese can read anything they want on the Internet,
the Surete Generale felt it necessary to explain the reason for its

   One of Alice's adventures in Wonderland takes the form of a
race. When it is over, she asks who has won. ``Everybody has won,''
the judge, a dodo, replies, ``and all must have prizes.'' The race
to sequence the human genome _ or, rather, to claim the credit for
sequencing it _ is now over. So the White House's dodo-in-chief,
Bill Clinton, has duly awarded prizes to everybody. But let's not
forget that this particular race was not to the finish-line, but to
the starting-line. Knowing the sequence is really just the
beginning. &QL;

   His strategy for winning last weekend's parliamentary election
in Zimbabwe was worse than a crime. It was a mistake. Ready to
wreck the country in order to hold on to power, Zimbabwe's
president, Robert Mugabe, ruthlessly tried to refight the
liberation war, encouraged brutal intimidation of the opposition,
played the race card against whites, and promised to seize their
land and give it to landless blacks. Mugabe believes his right to
rule is absolute; Zimbabwe's voters beg to differ. For their sake,
his party, ZANU, could do itself and Zimbabwe a favor by dumping
Mugabe now. &QL;

<P>
   It used to be said that every foreign article about Japanese
general elections began with the same two sentences, adjusted for
the odd change of dramatis personae: The Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) would again form the government. And there would be no change
of policies. After the poll on June 25, the same can be said again.
But there is a difference: once, this saying was a compliment
(don't meddle with success). Now, it's a sign of despair (while
Japan's society is changing, its political system remains
paralyzed). &QL;

   Markets notoriously overshoot, in both directions. So, it seems,
can dot.com obsessions. For much of the past three years, shares in
Internet firms have climbed stratospherically, regardless of
whether they were making any profits or even any sales. The future
promised land, it was felt, was all that mattered. But now the
price of Amazon.com and other dot.com shares have tumbled, forcing
a rethink of ``real'' offline firms vs. ``virtual'' online ones.
The truth is, business bosses can behave badly, and companies can
make losses, whether in the new or the old economies. &QL;

   DENVER, COLO. _ Thank God for Greens. Amid the general po-faced
seriousness of American politics, here is a party that doesn't dare
to be dull. One pony-tailed wannabe presidential candidate from
Tennessee says that he hasn't smoked pot with Al Gore for a long
time. Another, named Jello Biafra, wants a maximum wage _ around
$200,000, he thought, should suffice _ and the abolition of both
the CIA and sports-utility vehicles (SUVs). And delegates in formal
evening wear carried placards saying ``Billionaires for Bush and
Gore. We bought the election so you don't have to.'' &QL;

   MEXICO CITY _ The last four presidential terms have ended in
economic turbulence, but this time it is going to be different. So
Mexican officials have sworn and, until recently, investors had
believed them. But a bout of nerves that began last month seems to
be worsening. This week the peso fell, briefly, to its lowest point
since February 1999. It is not just political uncertainty over this
weekend's election that is to blame. Investors are also worried
about the effect on Mexico of a hard landing in the United States,
which takes 90 percent of its exports. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Live by the sword, die by the sword. In less than two
decades, Bernie Ebbers made his way from small-time motels to
big-time telecoms, eventually controlling a third of America's
long-distance calling and nearly as much of its Internet traffic
through his empire, Worldcom. Last year he crowned his run with a
deal that was then the biggest in history: a $115 billion bid for
Sprint, America's third-largest long-distance carrier and perhaps
its best wireless firm. But on June 27, the streak ended: Sprint
was one acquisition too many. Both America's Department of Justice
and the European Union's regulatory authorities moved to block the
deal. &QL;

   One of Alice's adventures in Wonderland takes the form of a
race. When it is over, she asks who has won. ``Everybody has won,''
the judge, a dodo, replies, ``and all must have prizes.'' The race
to sequence the human genome _ or, rather, to claim the credit for
sequencing it _ is now over. So the White House's dodo-in-chief,
Bill Clinton, has duly awarded prizes to everybody. But let's not
forget that this particular race was not to the finish-line, but to
the starting-line. Knowing the sequence is really just the
beginning. &QL;

   His strategy for winning last weekend's parliamentary election
in Zimbabwe was worse than a crime. It was a mistake. Ready to
wreck the country in order to hold on to power, Zimbabwe's
president, Robert Mugabe, ruthlessly tried to refight the
liberation war, encouraged brutal intimidation of the opposition,
played the race card against whites, and promised to seize their
land and give it to landless blacks. Mugabe believes his right to
rule is absolute; Zimbabwe's voters beg to differ. For their sake,
his party, ZANU, could do itself and Zimbabwe a favor by dumping
Mugabe now. &QL;

   It used to be said that every foreign article about Japanese
general elections began with the same two sentences, adjusted for
the odd change of dramatis personae: The Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) would again form the government. And there would be no change
of policies. After the poll on June 25, the same can be said again.
But there is a difference: once, this saying was a compliment
(don't meddle with success). Now, it's a sign of despair (while
Japan's society is changing, its political system remains
paralyzed). &QL;

   Markets notoriously overshoot, in both directions. So, it seems,
can dot.com obsessions. For much of the past three years, shares in
Internet firms have climbed stratospherically, regardless of
whether they were making any profits or even any sales. The future
promised land, it was felt, was all that mattered. But now the
price of Amazon.com and other dot.com shares have tumbled, forcing
a rethink of ``real'' offline firms vs. ``virtual'' online ones.
The truth is, business bosses can behave badly, and companies can
make losses, whether in the new or the old economies. &QL;

seriousness of American politics, here is a party that doesn't dare
to be dull. One pony-tailed wannabe presidential candidate from
Tennessee says that he hasn't smoked pot with Al Gore for a long
time. Another, named Jello Biafra, wants a maximum wage _ around
$200,000, he thought, should suffice _ and the abolition of both
the CIA and sports-utility vehicles (SUVs). And delegates in formal
evening wear carried placards saying ``Billionaires for Bush and
Gore. We bought the election so you don't have to.'' &QL;

<P>
   One of Alice's adventures in Wonderland takes the form of a
race. When it is over, she asks who has won. ``Everybody has won,''
the judge, a dodo, replies, ``and all must have prizes.''
</P>
<P>
   The race to sequence the human genome _ or, rather, to claim the
credit for sequencing it _ is now over. It is time to declare
victory and get back to work.
</P>
<P>
   So the White House's dodo-in-chief, Bill Clinton, has duly
awarded prizes to everybody. There are prizes for the leaders of
the Human Genome Project, the publicly-funded entry in the race.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a prize for Craig Venter, the entrepreneurial
scientist who fired the shot that turned what had been a leisurely
stroll into a contest in the first place, by founding a company
called Celera Genomics to do the whole thing with private money.
</P>
<P>
   The prizes to the public project's scientists are the pretense
that the race was actually a tie, and that a commercial upstart
that is barely two years old did not really beat them to it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Venter's prize is the officially sanctioned respectability
that should give him a place on the invitation list (traditionally
limited to three people) to receive a Nobel award for medicine from
the hands of the King of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably, the unravelling of the full sequence of the human
genome _ a list, in order, of the chemical bases that encode the
information needed to assemble and run a human body _ is a
scientific wonder.
</P>
<P>
   It is not diminished by the fact that what have been announced
are ``draft'' sequences, and that dotting every genetic ``i'' and
crossing every ``t'' will actually take years.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it diminished by the fact that this particular race was
not to the finishing-post, but to the starting-line. Knowing the
sequence is really just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The actual benefits will come from the hard graft of
interpreting the data and coming up with uses for them. Those
benefits will be real, and may be spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Genomic knowledge, of humans and other species, will transform
medicine by introducing side-effect-free drugs that work first
time, expanding the range of diseases that are treatable and
refining diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   If allowed, it could transform agriculture by increasing the
nutritional value of crops and making them easier to grow. Even
industry should benefit, as microbes are harnessed to produce
chemicals that are currently either impossible, or too costly, to
make.
</P>
<P>
   And at a more elevated level, the biological knowledge generated
will enhance understanding of what, exactly, it means to be human.
</P>
<P>
   When triumphalism is in the air, however, it is always wise to
pause. These new technologies create extraordinary possibilities
that people find disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Many such fears, perhaps most, will prove unwarranted; and the
astounding benefits that this new technology is capable of
delivering are not to be cast away without good reason. But caution
is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The genome revolution will move the world into places that are
ethically, as well as scientifically, uncharted. That people are
nervous about genomic technology is obvious from the reaction in
Europe, and increasingly in America, to genetically modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   All the scientific evidence suggests that these are harmless to
people and no more harmful to the environment than more traditional
methods of farming. Yet a few uses of the ``F'' word
(``Frankenstein,'' not the other one) in newspaper headlines have
supermarkets clearing their shelves and activists clearing fields.
</P>
<P>
   If that sort of reaction greets the idea of plants that have had
single genes for things such as herbicide resistance transferred
into them, what will be the response to more heavily engineered
plants and animals?
</P>
<P>
   Quite apart from fears about health, which will probably
diminish if research continues to show them to be unfounded, there
is the question of what happens if something runs wild. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The risk that this may happen needs to be faced _ provided it is
also remembered that no technology is entirely safe and that the
most it makes sense to demand is that the risks are understood and
kept low.
</P>
<P>
   Any new organism will be designed for the cosseted environment
of farm or fermentation tank, not the big, bad world where
everything is trying to eat you or steal your food. But things can
go wrong, as with the spread of prickly pear in Australia early
last century or zebra mussels in the North American Great Lakes at
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   A sensible risk assessment therefore needs to ask, in each case,
how bad could things be if the worst happens?
</P>
<P>
   More dangerous, however, than the inadvertent spread of
genetically engineered species is the risk that somebody will use
the technology to do deliberate harm _ by building better
pathogens, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Those who worry about Saddam Hussein cloning himself using the
new technology should probably worry more about what he is cloning
in his country's germ-warfare laboratories. That is because knowing
the human genome, and knowing the genomes of numerous pathogens, it
might be possible to re-engineer the latter so that the former
cannot resist.
</P>
<P>
   Against this threat there are only two defenses. One is the
eternal vigilance of the intelligence services of civilized
governments. The second is the creation of laboratories that could
analyze a threat rapidly and respond to it with a treatment using
the same technological nous that created the threat in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   For many, though, the real ``F'' nightmare is tinkering with
human genes in egg and sperm cells, or in recently fertilized eggs.
</P>
<P>
   This might be done for the best of motives _ to prevent disease.
But it might also be done for motives that some people, at least,
would regard as more suspect, such as slowing the process of aging;
or for motives that make most people, at present, very
uncomfortable, such as making your child more intelligent, or
better-looking, or more sociable.
</P>
<P>
   Quite possibly, parents will one day be able to equip their
children with capacities that are currently inhuman.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing lines across this squirming territory is going to be
difficult. What is ``natural'' is no guide. Man has already left
nature far behind, thank heaven: open-heart surgery is
``unnatural.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Morally, it is straightforward to put state-sponsored eugenics,
at least, utterly beyond the pale. At the moment, however, many
governments extend sweeping prohibition of genetic interventions to
individual parents, as well.
</P>
<P>
   For now, that seems sensible and cautious. But if the technology
proves reliable in other animals, pressure will grow for the bans
to be relaxed _ and it might then be wise to relax them, at least
in part.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, it might be right to shift the burden of proof from
individuals who wish to use these technologies to governments that
wish to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   It is at least imaginable that, in a liberal regime, the sum of
individual parental decisions might, for example, reduce genetic
diversity in undesirable ways. And governments, which rightly act
against child abuse, would be right to act against ``genetic''
child abuse in the unlikely event that perverse parents began
adding damaging genes to their children. &QL;

for the humans who are engineered, a light hand of regulation will
in the end be most appropriate.

<P>
   His strategy for winning last weekend's parliamentary election
in Zimbabwe was worse than a crime, it was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to wreck the country in order to hold on to power,
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, tried to refight the
liberation war, encouraged brutal intimidation of the opposition,
played the race card against whites, and promised to seize their
land and give it to landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Like his predecessor, Ian Smith, who believed that white rule in
Zimbabwe would last a thousand years, Mugabe believes his right to
rule is absolute. Zimbabwe's voters beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he now has the sense to listen to them, the damage
Mugabe has done in recent months will take years to repair. And the
nightmare may not be over yet.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an opposition victory, Mugabe had claimed, could
be entertained only in dreamland. Yet the dream almost came true.
</P>
<P>
   Roused from years of political apathy and determined to stand up
to Mugabe's thugs, Zimbabweans turned out in their greatest numbers
since independence and, for once, the majority did not vote for the
ruling ZANU-PF party.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the main opposition party, the Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC), defied Mugabe's racism by electing four
white MPs. Several ministers, close cronies of the president, lost
their seats. Crucially, Mugabe has lost the two-thirds majority in
parliament that he needs to change the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In time, this election may be seen as having broken the back of
Mugabe's increasingly autocratic one-party state. But it has also
created an explosive situation.
</P>
<P>
   The election showed up the natural divisions Mugabe has
exacerbated: the disaffected towns were mostly for the MDC, the
rural areas for ZANU; the minority Ndebele parts of the country
voted solidly for the opposition, the majority Shona areas stayed
loyal to the government.
</P>
<P>
   But for the intimidation in rural areas, the opposition might
have won a majority of seats. Yet the MDC leader, Morgan
Tsvangirai, has behaved with statesmanlike restraint, so far.
</P>
<P>
   He has accepted an unfree, unfair election because it has given
him and his supporters a moral victory. He has yet to say whether
he would join a national-unity government, if asked. Mugabe has yet
to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe badly needs a change of direction. The economy is in
ruins; it is expected to shrink by about 5 percent this year. The
country may not be able to feed itself. There is not enough foreign
exchange to buy fuel and electricity. Inflation may soon rise to
nearly 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation is an essential part of any recovery strategy. But
that means that a country already feeling impoverished by bad,
corrupt government is about to get poorer. Under such conditions,
one more stupid move by Mugabe could bring violent upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes are now on the president. In order to prevent economic
collapse, he needs emergency loans. But to obtain those he must win
back the trust of the donors.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks of national reconciliation, but such words have been
cheapened by his own recent actions. The president has ten
parliamentary seats to appoint. He could offer one to Tsvangirai,
who failed to win his seat in the open election, and give others to
national representatives instead of ZANU party hacks.
</P>
<P>
   His government says it will push ahead with land acquisitions.
That will be fine, so long as the change of farm ownership benefits
the poor and landless, not the rich and well-connected, and so long
as Mugabe follows the law instead of encouraging violent
occupations. And he should let the police and courts pursue those
who used violence and intimidation during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's own eyes are on the presidential election in 2002, and
so are those of his supporters and rivals within ZANU. The party is
no slavish monolith. There have been two attempts to unseat Mugabe
in the past year. He held on by promising a huge election victory
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Now that so many voters have deserted him, Mugabe may yet change
his policies in the hope of facing a more contented and united
country in two years' time. But that is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ZANU could do itself and Zimbabwe a favor by dumping Mugabe
now. &QL;

ONCE AGAIN (YAWN), TWO SENTENCES SUM UP JAPAN'S ELECTION

<P>
   It used to be said that every foreign article about Japanese
general elections began with the same two sentences, adjusted for
the odd change of dramatis personae: The Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) would again form the government. And there would be no change
of policies.
</P>
<P>
   After the poll on June 25, the same can be said again. But there
is a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Once, this saying was a compliment; it was best not to meddle
with success. Now, it is a sign of despair; there is scant prospect
of an end to Japan's failure.
</P>
<P>
   Failure? Isn't that a little strong? Despite a decade-long
slowdown and then recession, which followed the collapse of the
country's stock market in 1990-91, Japan remains the world's
second-largest economy. Its unemployment rate, when measured in
comparable ways, is higher than in America but lower than in
France. Japanese people remain comfortably off.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some disturbing signs of social
deterioration, Europeans and Americans can still find much to envy
there. And the best Japanese companies remain world-class,
producing brilliant new gadgets or reliable cars with typical
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Japan is suffering from failure, nonetheless. The failure is
that, ten years after the lean times began, no government has
introduced the sort of broad reforms that are needed to take the
economy out of intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some changes, to be sure: more competition in
finance, more, thanks to deregulation, in sectors such as retailing
and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But, by and large, every government since the troubles began has
followed a policy of wait and hope: of postponing painful reforms
in the hope that the economy will revive of its own accord. That is
the policy that the re-elected, LDP-led coalition is expected to
leave unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that fortune will smile upon Japan. The economy
has been recovering for the past few months, with a bit of extra
consumer spending and some more corporate investment.
</P>
<P>
   If that were to carry on for another year or two, consumers
might gain enough confidence to run down their savings and spend
even more, and the government might be able to trim back its huge
budget deficit, now approaching 10 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   The room, and the political backing, might emerge for a genuine
clear-out of dead wood in the banking and life-insurance
industries, for wider competition in telecoms, and for other
much-needed deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the past five years, however, economic revivals have
been brought rudely to a halt. In 1995 the Kobe earthquake
destroyed lives and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1997 came the East Asian financial crisis, amplified by
Russia's debt default in mid-1998: the crisis walloped Japanese
exports, as well as adding to the already large pile of bad loans
at Japan's banks.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these shocks was Japan's fault. Nor, if it comes,
will the next one probably be: it is likelier to arise from a slump
in America, or a political crisis of some sort in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's fault is one of negligence: that by shrinking from
implementing proper reform, successive governments have left Japan
terribly vulnerable to another shock.
</P>
<P>
   If one comes, Japan's fiscal tanks will be empty; public-sector
debts already exceed 120 percent of GDP, and loom even larger once
the government's full liabilities are totted up.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, much of the Yen110 trillion ($1 trillion or so) in
fiscal-stimulus packages in the past decade has been frittered away
on unproductive projects, which have shovelled public money into
the grateful hands of one of the LDP's main backers, the
construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the main banks have in effect been nationalized. And
the public bailouts continue, this time with a rescue of a bankrupt
retailer, Sogo.
</P>
<P>
   What Japan needs is a vigorous clean-out of the banks' loan
books and their managements; the liberalization of farm trade;
deregulation and proper antitrust enforcement in telecoms and a
myriad other sectors.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no current prospect of this, or anything like it,
happening. Wait and hope. &QL;

E-COMMERCE ``NIRVANA'' GETS A NEEDED REALITY CHECK

<P>
   Markets notoriously overshoot, in both directions. So, it seems,
can dot.com obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past three years, shares in Internet firms have
climbed stratospherically, regardless of whether they were making
any profits or even any sales. The future promised land, it was
felt, was all that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   But now the price of Amazon.com, the most famous e-commerce
pioneer of them all, has tumbled. Some investors seem to have
decided suddenly that nobody will ever make any money from commerce
on the Web, so they are dumping almost all their dot.com shares.
</P>
<P>
   The truth lies, as ever, between these two extremes. The
Internet does not, and never did, hold out the hope of a nirvana in
which such things as cash flow, delivery of goods or sales service
would become trivia.
</P>
<P>
   It is therefore right to judge the performance of firms that do
business over it, whether with consumers (so-called B2C) or with
other businesses (B2B), on such traditional criteria as the
soundness of their business plans and their prospects for sales
revenues and profits.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what the markets are starting to do. At the same
time the Internet offers a splendid new medium through which to
transact business. That is why online sales of so many goods and
services are growing so fast, and it is also why so many
old-economy firms are redesigning their businesses around it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are some features of the Internet that justify a
substantial premium for the more successful e-commerce firms. A
combination of network effects, high fixed costs and negligible
marginal costs makes it easier for such firms to expand rapidly, to
trade globally and to preserve their first-mover advantages against
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with Internet as with some other new-technology
businesses, the creation of temporary monopolies or near-monopolies
that permit the creaming-off of high returns may be easier to
achieve than it is in most traditional industries.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the really striking point about business on the Internet
is not that it is a passing fad that is dying out; it is that
almost all companies, from glamorous e-tailers to boring car
makers, are now doing it.
</P>
<P>
   One effect is to blur the boundaries between ``virtual'' online
firms and ``real'' offline ones.
</P>
<P>
   In retailing, for instance, Amazon now has a substantial
warehouse and logistical infrastructure, while Wal-Mart is building
a big online retail arm. As this boundary-blurring continues, the
underlying judgment about such companies will come to depend not on
how they are doing business but on whether they are any good at it.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers such as the recently deceased boo.com or the
once-troubled Toys ``R'' Us will suffer the consequences of poor
performance, but their pain will not have been caused by the
Internet. It will rather be down to such humdrum failings as being
badly run companies that do not make enough money.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of a convergence of online and offline worlds can be
detected well beyond the field of e-commerce. Consider the
much-hyped ``new'' economy, which has often been said to justify or
even to necessitate new rules.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that, as an OECD report this week has confirmed,
the new economy is far more talked-about than measurable. It is
also that, whether new or old, the economy actually observes pretty
much the same rules: overheating can trigger inflation, structural
rigidities will mean higher unemployment, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to another conclusion: that, online or offline,
regulation by government should be decided on broadly the same
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, new-economy zealots have tended to assert that all
antitrust intervention, whether in the case of Microsoft or, this
week, over WorldCom's planned takeover of Sprint, is bound to be
wrongheaded.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is that monopolies in the new economy are likely to
be more frequent but also more temporary than in the old. Best,
therefore, for regulators to stay out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   There is something to this. Because new technology and the
Internet can display network effects and increasing economies of
scale, some parts of them may tend naturally towards monopoly; and,
at the same time, technological change is so rapid that such
monopolies may sometimes prove temporary.
</P>
<P>
   So antitrust regulators should indeed be wary of intervening too
heavily and too often. Yet the lesson of the Microsoft trial is
that such intervention can still be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Business bosses can behave badly, and companies can make losses,
whether in the new or the old economies; the response in either
case should be much the same. &QL;

   DENVER, COLO. _ Thank God for Greens. Amid the general po-faced
seriousness of American politics, here is a party that doesn't dare
to be dull.
</P>
<P>
   One pony-tailed would-be presidential candidate from Tennessee
says that he hasn't smoked pot with Al Gore for a long time.
Another, Jello Biafra, wants a maximum wage _ around $200,000, he
thought, should suffice _ and the abolition of both the CIA and
sports-utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates in formal evening wear carried placards saying
``Billionaires for Bush and Gore. We bought the election so you
don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   And, turning to serious business, the platform calls for a
30-hour working week, the decriminalization of marijuana and
proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Greens had 43 elected officials in 13 states. This
year, the figure is 78 in 19 states. California's Green Party has
over 100,000 members, the largest single green party (they claim)
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Blithely ignoring the petty detail that he is not actually a
member of their party, the Greens' presidential candidate is Ralph
Nader, the celebrated consumer advocate, protectionist and
Economist contributor. (Yes, he once wrote a series of articles for
us on car safety but he has since grown up and condemns capitalism
utterly.)
</P>
<P>
   After the WTO rumpus in Seattle and the McCain insurgency, the
timing might be ripe for an anti-globalization independent. But
third-party surges have a way of looking good in June and petering
out in November.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ross Perot's 19 percent of the vote in the 1992 election
was disappointing compared with what might have been: in June he
had been leading the polls. And this time Pat Buchanan's Reform
Party is also competing for independents.
</P>
<P>
   For the Greens, electoral success means getting 5 percent of the
vote, enough to secure federal funding next time around. Their best
cards are Nader's name and the notion of a ``blue-green'' alliance
between blue-collar workers worried about competition from cheap
labor abroad and environmentalists worried about trees.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance of Teamsters and Turtles can work. The leader of
the Green Party of Gary, Indiana (one of America's biggest steel
towns) runs it from the offices of the local steelworkers' union.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Green Party was founded last year in the Houston
headquarters of the AFL-CIO after the two sides had teamed up
against a firm that had offended Greens by felling redwoods and the
union by locking out aluminium workers.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the Green platform, with its support for union
rights and a more generous social safety net, looks close to that
of a European socialist party.
</P>
<P>
   What about the idea that the unions are only supporting his
turquoise alliance to discipline Gore? Nader replies that he will
attract voters away from George W. Bush as well.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he will mobilize the 50 percent of Americans who do not
vote at all. If so, that would be a miracle. But nothing else has
got them to the polls. Perhaps some populist business-bashing
will. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The nine justices of the Supreme Court are famously
shy of the limelight, yet their dramatic timing is impeccable.
</P>
<P>
   They like to announce their most politically contentious
decisions on the very last day of their nine-month term and then go
off on vacation, leaving a swirl of controversy behind them.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they turned in a vintage performance. On June 28, in
four split rulings, the court overturned a Nebraska law banning
so-called ``partial-birth'' abortions, upheld a law restricting
anti-abortion protests, allowed taxpayers' money to be used to buy
computers for religious schools, and ruled that the Boy Scouts can
exclude gays.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, it had upheld the famous Miranda warning to
criminal suspects (``You have the right to remain silent...''),
overturned a referendum result allowing voters in California to
cast a vote in any political party's primary, and knocked down a
New Jersey hate-crime law which gave too much sentencing power to
judges rather than juries.
</P>
<P>
   This week's judicial fireworks capped a term littered with
attention-grabbing cases. It coincided with a presidential election
year.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, this has highlighted the question: how much impact
can the next president have on the direction of the court? A lot,
is the most widely held view.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School, points out
that both candidates have promised to add more conservative and
liberal justices respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The most vulnerable ruling could be Roe v Wade, the
controversial 1973 decision which guaranteed American women the
right to an abortion. ``It might take three appointments to
overturn Roe, but even just one could undermine it,'' says Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal, then, seems to depend on how many justices (and
which ones) retire in the next four years. No one has retired since
1994, and several justices have had serious health problems,
including Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 75.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the nine are Republican appointees, and so might be
less willing to be replaced by Al Gore than by George W. Bush. But
with eight justices over 60, nature may intervene anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are reasons to doubt that appointments by the next
president, whoever he is, will matter as much as people suppose.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the current character of the court. The Rehnquist
court is often described as sharply divided, with a narrow
conservative majority, largely because of a series of 5-4 votes on
federalism, affirmative action, religion and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The inflammatory language of dissenting opinions written by
justices in the minority has often bolstered this impression. In a
scathing dissent from the Miranda decision, Justice Antonin Scalia
seemed to threaten civil disobedience by continuing to apply the
law the court had just knocked down.
</P>
<P>
   And yet such overheated rhetoric is somewhat misleading. Most
closely contested cases have been over relatively narrow
differences of opinion about how to apply earlier court precedents
to new situations.
</P>
<P>
   The Rehnquist court has not overturned major laws or signalled a
sharp change of direction for the nation, as the 1960s Warren court
did. It was not supposed to be this way.
</P>
<P>
   In their five appointments, Presidents Ronald Reagan and George
Bush consciously set out to make the court more conservative. But
three of their appointees, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and
David Souter, have proved to be fairly moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The court's most consistent line of decisions has aimed at
restricting federal power in favor of states' rights, and it has
chipped away some of the civil-liberties protections. But it has
moved with comparative caution even in doing this.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone applauds the court's pragmatism. Douglas Kmiec, a
law professor at Pepperdine University in California and a former
Reagan administration official, complains that the court has once
again ``delivered the expected, common-sensical outcomes without
paying attention to the demands of the Constitution or its
history.''
</P>
<P>
   This may suit most Americans, but it turns the court into a
third legislative chamber. ``If arguments are not anchored in
constitutional argument, it becomes almost a lawless process,'' he
argues.
</P>
<P>
   In his view conservative justices such as Scalia, who claim to
adhere strictly to the text of the Constitution, are as guilty of
ad hoc rationales as the ``liberal'' justices. The result has made
the court's decisions difficult to predict.
</P>
<P>
   This term, for example, has seen Stephen Breyer, a
Clinton-appointee, lecturing Justice Kennedy, a Reagan-appointee,
on why soft-core pornography should not be delivered unfiltered
into homes via cable-television.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Rehnquist, long a fierce critic of the Miranda
decision, wrote this week's opinion upholding it.
</P>
<P>
   And Justice Scalia, a strong supporter of the court's
states-rights agenda, wrote the opinion knocking down California's
primary system which many _ including the two dissenting justices
who have consistently opposed expanding states' rights _ thought
was preeminently a matter for the states.
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual incoherence, as well as political moderation,
of the court could make it more difficult for the next president to
push it sharply in any one direction, at least with only one or two
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, given their centrist positions, neither Bush nor Gore
may want to risk a bruising confirmation battle for a controversial
appointee. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Politics has few rules, especially in an election
year. But here is one: it generally lags commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 19th century, party bosses paid the ultimate
compliment to the brand-new system of industrial mass-production by
inventing ``machine politics.'' Now that commercial America is in
love with the Internet, when will that, too, turn politics upside
down?
</P>
<P>
   The arguments for sooner rather than later are not difficult to
make. The proportion of the voting-age population with Internet
access will hit 70 percent by election day.
</P>
<P>
   This wired world includes the vast majority of the people that
politicians drool over _ those with a high propensity not just to
vote but also to volunteer time and money.
</P>
<P>
   A traditional direct-mail pitch costs 30 to 40 cents per address
and yields a response rate of 1 percent to 1.5 percent. Targeted
banner ads on the Web have a similar yield for a dime or less. And
it is generally easier to get the people you want.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the old mailshots which ask raving right-wing
libertarians to give generously to Hillary Rodham Clinton. (``I'll
fight my heart out for the values you and I share.'')
</P>
<P>
   Now computers allow politicians to talk only to people who are
reasonably susceptible to their blandishments.
</P>
<P>
   Wistful politicians talk of reinventing the old face-to-face
politics of wards and precincts on a new basis: not the accident of
geography, but the glue of common interests and aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet gold rush is spreading to politics. All you need is
a moderately catchy name (vote.com, voter.com, speakout.com); a
moderately well-known political figure (Susan Molinari, Randy Tate
and Michael Deaver have all been recruited by start-ups on the
grounds that somebody, somewhere knows who they are); and a
moderately clever gimmick (attracting visitors to Web sites that
specialize in politics and then selling their names to candidates,
or selling ``campaign starter-kits'').
</P>
<P>
   Then you too can turn democracy into a money-spinner. But before
you rush to buy shares in one of these start-ups, it is worth
remembering one awkward fact.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's presidential race, the people who have made the
biggest fuss about the Internet have all got one thing in common:
they're losers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes predicated his entire campaign on the assumption
that the Internet would redefine politics in much the same way that
television did in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   He launched his campaign on the Internet, employed five
full-time staffers to work on his Web site, invented something
called the ``e-Precinct,'' which encouraged supporters to enroll
friends in ``e-Blocks'' and ``e-Neighborhoods,'' and even held
virtual fund-raisers, featuring private e-chats with the man
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He got just two delegates. John Kasich, another Republican,
styled himself as the ``JFK of the information age'' and maintained
such a sophisticated Web site that voters from Iowa, New Hampshire
and Ohio got different pages when they logged on. They didn't vote
for him, though.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley and John McCain had, by common consent, much better
Internet operations than the party machines that crushed them.
</P>
<P>
   The party that is currently making the most fuss about the
Internet is the Reform Party. Its members will be able to vote for
their presidential candidates online (which might save the world a
few punch-ups).
</P>
<P>
   One of the candidates for the job, John Hagelin of the Natural
Law Party, assures the world that the Internet will break the mold
of traditional politics. The establishment candidates are far more
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   With George W. Bush, this might be expected. But Al Gore, a man
whose idea of bliss is reading position papers on ``government in a
networked world,'' runs a Web site that is less professional than
his rival's.
</P>
<P>
   They have dabbled in ``electronic town halls.'' They have even
engaged in (rather tame) e-mail wars.
</P>
<P>
   In general, they have used the Internet as a means of speeding
up old-fashioned political combat rather than a means of changing
the rules of engagement. Thus they post plenty of useful
information. (It is particularly nice to be able to search position
papers and, in Bush's case, get up-to-date lists of donors.)
</P>
<P>
   They get volunteers to sign up (100,000 for Bush). But they shy
away from driving the political debate. Which is exactly as it
should be.
</P>
<P>
   For both candidates have grasped what eluded the cerebral
Forbes: that even in a country as big and wired as the United
States, politics is still about pressing the flesh rather than
personalized e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   As Joe Klein put it in his 1992 political novel, ``Primary
Colors'': ``The handshake is the threshold act, the beginning of
politics... He (i.e., President Bill Clinton) is interested in you.
He is honored to meet you... He'll flash that famous misty look of
his. And he will mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no substitute for the personal touch if you are going
to convert people to your cause. Presidents Kennedy and Reagan
moved hearts with the force of their rhetoric. Bill Clinton seduced
normally cynical journalists into becoming shameless apologists.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's success in raising more than $6 million online is
certainly impressive. But what really made his campaign was the
months he spent talking to ordinary voters in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   There is also no substitute for the personal touch when it comes
to mobilizing your political base.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore have raised about $1.6 million online _ a
paltry sum compared with the $21.3 million that Bush raised at a
dinner in Washington on April 26, or the $26.5 million that Clinton
and Gore raised at a blue-jeans rally there a month later.
</P>
<P>
   The very least you want if you are going to part with serious
money is a good dinner. That is not to say that the Internet is a
mere irrelevance. As the television and the computer merge, more
personality will be able to seep into the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Internet is wonderful at giving a vent to the angry
or a voice to the powerless. In 1998, with barely any effort, a
California couple accumulated $13 million and 500,000 signatures
when they pledged to stop Clinton's impeachment. Zack Exley's spoof
Web site, www.gwbush.com, has infuriated the governor as much as
anything else in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One day, as the technology improves, it may even produce the
fabled world of electronic wards and precincts. But for the time
being, at least, the handshake is still far more potent than the
Web page. &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The last four presidential terms have ended in
economic turbulence, but this time it is going to be different. So
Mexican officials have sworn and, until recently, investors had
believed them.
</P>
<P>
   But a bout of nerves that began last month seems to be
worsening. This week the peso fell, briefly, to its lowest since
February 1999, and the central bank, worried about inflation,
tightened monetary policy slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The jitters were ostensibly triggered by worries that the result
of the presidential election on July 2 will be both close and
disputed. But investors have been uneasy for a while.
</P>
<P>
   When Moody's, a credit-rating agency, announced in March that it
was awarding investment-grade status to Mexican bonds, the premium
these yield over United States Treasury bonds fell for only a few
days before rising again.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just political uncertainty that is to blame. Investors
are worried about the effect on Mexico of a hard landing in the
United States, which takes 90 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
   And Mexico's economy is showing signs of overheating: GDP grew
at an annual rate of 7.9 percent in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials point out that this is partly because of strong
American demand for Mexico's exports. But cynics detect a typical
pre-election boom, engineered partly by higher government spending:
buoyed by higher oil revenues, this increased by 15 percent in real
terms in the first quarter compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales are racing ahead, too, boosted by higher real
wages. All that points to a slowdown after the election.
</P>
<P>
   But the odds are still against a 1994-style crash. The peso's
fall is not yet alarming: indeed, it was (and perhaps still is)
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the economy President Ernesto Zedillo will bequeath
to his successor on Dec. 1 is far sounder than the one he
inherited: the current-account deficit is much smaller, there is
almost no short-term foreign debt, the floating peso gives
flexibility, and management is more open.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect growth to slow to 5-6 percent for the year as a
whole. But that slowdown could still be bruising, if, say, Mexico
was unlucky enough to suffer post-election political turmoil, a
crash in oil revenue, and a sudden cooling in American demand.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the handover of power from one president to the
next, rather than the election itself, has been the trigger for
Mexico's economic eruptions. But this year, for the first time, the
election result is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   History is not doomed to repeat itself in Mexico, but officials
and investors alike will need to remain vigilant for the next few
months. &QL;

   HAVANA _ Fidel Castro might have won his Battle for Elian, the
six-year-old boy shipwrecked off Florida last November, who finally
returned to Cuba with his father on June 28. But his hopes that
this victory would prompt bigger changes in American policy towards
Cuba seem premature.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the United States' House of
Representatives agreed this week to a plan that would allow sales
of food and medicine to Cuba. But this apparent easing of America's
trade embargo comes with so many conditions attached that Castro's
officials dismissed it as ``a great joke which would in practice
change nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   How quickly the proposal will become law is not clear. On paper,
it is the biggest change in the embargo since it was imposed in
1960. Some supporters of the measure believe it heralds the further
gradual easing of American policy towards Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But under the new proposal, Cuba will not have access to private
or public credit from the United States to finance any purchases;
and barter, a common Cuban trading method, will not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Transport will be difficult and expensive, since any ships
visiting the island will still be banned from putting into a United
States' port during the following six months.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also bans the purchase of any Cuban goods by
American firms, and potentially stiffens the ban on United States'
citizens visiting Cuba by turning this from an administrative
ruling into a law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does it not soften the blockade, in some aspects it
makes it worse,'' said Ricardo Alarcon, the president of Cuba's
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Since Cuba is desperately short of hard currency, it is unlikely
to be able to buy much food or medicine on the proposed terms
(although American firms may eventually find ways around this).
</P>
<P>
   Any strengthening of the travel ban, however, could hurt Cuba's
economy. Tourism is now the island's biggest industry, and tens of
thousands of Americans have visited the country illegally over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Only a month ago, Cuban officials were speculating that the
fight over Elian would herald a real easing of the trade embargo,
and perhaps the lifting of the travel ban.
</P>
<P>
   That was because it seemed to show that the leaders of Miami's
exile community, who pushed for the boy to stay, were out of touch
with mainstream American opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the congressional deal shows that the Cuban-American lobby
still has political weight. In effect, the Cuban-Americans have
blocked a push by business lobbies for more open trade with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Many businessmen argue that the embargo has been ineffective at
toppling Castro, but effective at excluding them from a market
dominated, as a result, by European and Canadian rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Now that America has agreed to normal trading relations with
China, the United States Chamber of Commerce is to make eliminating
the Cuba embargo its top priority, said Craig Johnstone, its
vice-president, during a visit to Havana last month.
</P>
<P>
   But neither George W. Bush nor Al Gore seem to agree: to
Castro's annoyance, both candidates have sided with Miami over both
Elian and the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four decades, Castro's main objective has been
political survival. The fact that Congress and the Clinton
administration are at last discussing the embargo is being
portrayed in his government's propaganda as evidence of Cuba's
``power of resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the upshot of that discussion suggests that Congress is only
slightly more likely than Castro to start blinking. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Live by the sword, die by the sword.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two decades, Bernie Ebbers made his way from
small-time motels to big-time telecoms, eventually controlling a
third of America's long-distance calling and nearly as much of its
Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   He built this empire with a classic new economy strategy of
buying real assets with virtual money, in this case shares pumped
high by stock market enthusiasm for his company, WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he crowned his run with a deal that was then the
biggest in history: a $115 billion bid for Sprint, America's
third-largest long-distance carrier and perhaps its best wireless
firm.
</P>
<P>
   But, on June 27, the streak ended: Sprint was one acquisition
too many. Both America's Department of Justice (DOJ) and the
European Union's regulatory authorities moved to block the deal on
competition grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Although both Sprint and WorldCom are officially keeping their
options open, the merger is dead.
</P>
<P>
   For the DOJ, the problem boiled down to simple arithmetic: it
reckoned that it was bad for competition to move from three big
long-distance firms to two.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the stated objection was to the unhealthy
concentration that would arise from combining the Internet
operations of WorldCom and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the European regulators may have been reacting more to
the shabby way WorldCom behaved in acquiring MCI.
</P>
<P>
   It first promised to spin off some MCI Internet holdings to
Cable &AMP; Wireless to satisfy regulatory concerns, and then did so in
such a halfhearted way (it stole back employees and kept customers)
that the British firm had to take it to court (C&AMP;W settled for $200
million).
</P>
<P>
   Big companies on buying sprees run into antitrust issues all the
time. But this is different. Ebbers is a serial buyer like no
other.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade he has bought nearly 70 companies,
including several larger than his own. MCI, then America's
second-largest long-distance firm, was three times WorldCom's size
when the upstart bought it with stock in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   From its base in Clinton, Miss., WorldCom snapped up fiber-optic
networks, Internet infrastructure, data services, calling-card
firms and local telecom carriers, emerging as one of the world's
leading Internet carriers and business telecoms suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing did Ebbers call his first yacht ``Aquasitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers argued (as he would, of course) that the deal was good
for competition. Certainly, in a business where the price of
long-distance calling may soon reach zero (in part because of a
swarm of smaller competitors, including free Internet calling
services), the harm to consumers of reducing big long-distance
firms from three to two may be limited.
</P>
<P>
   Upstarts, such as Qwest, are well capitalized, while the
remaining Baby Bells should soon be entering the market in force.
Bell Atlantic already has nearly 1 million long-distance customers
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There is also plenty of competition (and money to create new
competition) in Internet infrastructure, the area that worried the
EU.
</P>
<P>
   But the regulators' real concerns went deeper. After MCI,
regulators on both sides of the Atlantic had simply seen enough
megamergers for now, especially from the cowboy from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't come back soon with another big one like this,'' one had
reportedly warned Ebbers in the wake of the MCI deal. Yet a year
later he did exactly that with Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the regulators saw in the WorldCom-MCI
deal echoes of a reanimated Ma Bell, the end-to-end monopolist that
they had broken up in 1984 after years of painful litigation. In
Europe, too, WorldCom was simply seen as an untrustworthy predator.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sets of regulators highlighted aspects of the deal
that they disliked, the list of parts that WorldCom would have had
to spin off (at less than preferential terms, given such a forced
sale) was impracticably long.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last days there was talk of wholesale divestitures,
from long distance to local networks, to allow the deal through.
But WorldCom decided that they would have undermined the merger's
financial logic and left the table. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 700, OR CONTINUE TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT NEXT FOR WORLDCOM? &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom's core competence is buying other companies and making
more of their assets than their previous owners did. Now, it can no
longer simply buy its way to the top. It needs a new strategy. But
what?
</P>
<P>
   For a start, Ebbers could still buy other firms, provided they
were smaller and did not overlap much with its existing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom still needs wireless; Sprint's digital PCS network had
been that company's main attraction. Other wireless firms, such as
Nextel and Voicetel, are still available. But WorldCom decided last
year that Nextel was too expensive; since then Nextel's market
value has doubled while WorldCom's has shrunk, making it dearer
still.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, WorldCom could expand more abroad, especially in
markets and businesses where it is not yet strong. Or it could
change tack, seeking to increase revenues more from its operations
than from acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom has always been a better operating company than it was
given credit for; some of its acquisitions, especially MCI's
consumer business, were actually a drag on earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom now talks of shedding its consumer long-distance
business, which is both slower-growing than the rest of its
operations and an antitrust obstacle, and focusing on the more
lucrative business market.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point every company has to be about execution instead
of just acquisition,'' says Richard Klugman, an analyst with
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, an investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it could turn from predator to prey. There are plenty
of potential buyers, including European firms such as Deutsche
Telekom, France Telecom and BT.
</P>
<P>
   This week Deutsche Telekom, which has previously expressed an
interest in WorldCom, completed a bond issue that raised $14.5
billion; it also recently won shareholder approval to use shares
valued at $100 billion for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely, however, that the German firm, which believes
it needs to do a big deal in America, will now go for Sprint. It
already has a 10 percent stake and knows the company well from the
recently dissolved Global One alliance that included France
Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is likely to make life any easier for Ebbers or
his company. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It looks increasingly likely that the eventual
replacement for the internal-combustion engine in motor vehicles
will be the fuel cell.
</P>
<P>
   This is a device that reacts hydrogen and oxygen together to
release electrical energy. Environmentalists like it, because its
exhaust is water. And, after some initial hesitation, the world's
car makers are now investing heavily in turning it into a practical
reality.
</P>
<P>
   The latest prototype comes from General Motors. The archly named
HydroGen1 is a third of the size of the company's previous version,
yet it produces about 60 percent more power _ 80 kilowatts, the
equivalent of an average 1,600cc engine _ and GM's researchers
estimate its thermal efficiency at somewhere between 53 percent and
67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, up to two-thirds of the energy in HydroGen1's
fuel is ultimately channelled to the vehicle's wheels. That is
nearly four times more than the best gas-engined vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The car maker claims to have achieved several other significant
breakthroughs with HydroGen1.
</P>
<P>
   It can operate at temperatures as cold as -40degreesC. Even in
such conditions, it takes less than 30 seconds to boost itself into
operation, compared with five minutes or more for existing fuel
cells.
</P>
<P>
   But it is its compactness that really makes it look a plausible
predecessor to a production version.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel cell and hydrogen-storage system in the previous
prototype took up not only the engine compartment of an Opel
Zafira, but the vehicle's trunk and half the rear seat as well.
</P>
<P>
   HydroGen1 squeezes most of its hardware under the hood, while
raising the floor of the trunk by a modest 10cm (2.5 inches) and
the rear seat by 4cm. And the fuel tank, which holds enough
hydrogen to drive the car some 600km (400 miles), is the same size
as an ordinary gas tank.
</P>
<P>
   This environmental (and, potentially, commercial) paragon is not
the result of some startling breakthrough. It is, rather, the sum
of a lot of humdrum engineering refinements.
</P>
<P>
   These include simpler pipework, miniaturized electronics and a
better understanding of the ``envelope'' of operating conditions
that a commercially available vehicle must be able to tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   The previous prototype was found to be overdesigned. By paring
things back to match capabilities to requirements, a smaller,
cheaper fuel cell becomes possible.
</P>
<P>
   If it can keep up this process of continuous improvement, GM
hopes to get its first fuel-cell-powered car into the showrooms by
2004. &QL;

 &HT;    PANNING BRITAIN'S MILLENNIUM DOME: Expensive attraction's slow
start confuses some, angers others
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, England _ Emerging from the Body Zone on a recent
afternoon, David Owens said he had seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then, that's it,'' fumed Owens, whose annoyance was
stimulating a powerful desire for a cigarette. ``I'm embarrassed as
an Englishman, as a European and as a human being. They spent
untold millions on this and at the end of the day it's money down
the pipe, isn't it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Body Zone is perhaps the best known of the 14 themed sectors
in the Millennium Dome, the US$1.2 billion attraction intended to
make an important statement about modern Britain at the dawn of the
new century.
</P>
<P>
   However, at the midpoint of the Dome's troubled life, the
statement being delivered is not exactly what its backers had in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who paid about US$100 for a family ticket, waited 30
minutes with his wife and twin 5-year-olds to enter the colossal
peach-colored, androgynous body. The journey began with a view of a
giant naval _ pierced stylishly with a huge ring _ continued with a
ride up an arm past the thunderous pounding of a giant heart, a
talking brain, a Volkswagen-sized eyeball and then down the stairs
and out the leg.
</P>
<P>
   After finally lighting up and taking a thoughtful puff, the best
thing Owens could say about the experience was that it was brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, five minutes?'' he asked his speechless wife. ``I can
withstand anything for five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Britain must withstand six months more of the misery
generated by the ill-fated Dome since its inauguration on New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Dome quietly welcomed its 3 millionth visitor.
That's the good news. The bad news is that the attraction's
managers last year projected that the Dome would have 12 million
visitors for the year that is now half over.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing opening in January the projections were
slashed to 7 million _ a figure that may still be elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Slow ticket sales have had the predictable effect on the bottom
line. Losses are reported in the British media to be already more
than US$150 million. In May, the government had to come up with a
nearly US$50 million emergency cash injection to keep the doors
open. The government intends to sell the Dome in July to a private
bidder. At the end of the year, it is to be reconfigured into some
other use.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, Britain's largest selling tabloid, reported earlier
this week that the Dome would run out of money in September and
close four months early _ an assertion that the Dome's management
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the most recent group of managers, headed by
EuroDisney veteran Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, acknowledges that the
earlier attendance estimates were wildly optimistic and that the
Dome has been slow to work its way into the public's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Gerbeau, a Frenchman who speaks with an American accent, blames
much of the problem on the British press, which has been gleefully
merciless in its attacks on the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gerbeau used an appearance at Parliament to appeal
for less vitriolic coverage. ``Why don't you stand behind us for a
change and let us on a pace to become London's surprise top
attraction for the year.
</P>
<P>
   This can be explained by two important factors: the Tate is free
and in central London. A ticket to the Dome is more than US$30 and
the structure is set in a car-free zone on former industrial land
about 15 miles east of London.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, many observers believe the Tate provides the smart
and funky experience promised but not delivered by the Dome.
Stephen Bayley, who resigned as creative director of the Dome
before its opening, believes that the Tate has been well-received
because it appeals to the public's intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People so wanted something intelligent, smart and optimistic
and now it seems as though it is Tate Modern that has supplied
that,'' Bayley said. ``The Tate does not characterize the British
public as drooling morons, whereas the Dome insults with
patronizing rubbish.

for less vitriolic coverage. ``Why don't you stand behind us for a

</P>
<P>
   The Dome's new advertising campaign urges the public to ignore
the press. A new television spot casts Dome critics as sheep and
ends with the line, ``You've got a mind of your own _ take it to
the Millennium Dome.''
</P>
<P>
   However, people seem to be taking their minds elsewhere. In a
nagging coincidence, the new and much acclaimed Tate Modern museum
also marked a milestone Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Open just seven weeks a few miles up the River Thames, the Tate
welcomed its millionth visitor and is on a pace to become London's
surprise top attraction for the year.
</P>
<P>
   This can be explained by two important factors: the Tate is free
and in central London. A ticket to the Dome is more than US$30 and
the structure is set in a car-free zone on former industrial land
about 15 miles east of London.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, many observers believe the Tate provides the smart

before its opening, believes that the Tate has been well-received
because it appeals to the public's intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People so wanted something intelligent, smart and optimistic
and now it seems as though it is Tate Modern that has supplied
that,'' Bayley said. ``The Tate does not characterize the British
public as drooling morons, whereas the Dome insults with
patronizing rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dome is a national disgrace, a catastrophically expensive
lesson and we should all be ashamed. The dimwits responsible should
be publicly stoned.''
</P>
<P>
   While there have been a number of resignations, no one has been
stoned _ so far.
</P>
<P>
   Dome designers say they meant to appeal to the masses and are
dismissive of complaints that they dumbed down the exhibits. ``We
have been accused of having low standards and pandering to the
lowest common denominator, but I don't apologize for that at all,''
Ben Evans, one of the Dome's four content editors, said in a recent
BBC radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to be family-orientated and to be inclusive, not
exclusive, and ensure that as many people as possible could come
and enjoy themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The 14 zones within the huge Teflon-roofed structure _ which is
twice the size of the Georgia Dome _ were intended to illustrate
human life, work and play as well as the social and environmental
challenges of the 21st century. Unlike Disney's Epcot Center, the
exhibits are not rides but rather strolls, climbs or meanderings
through the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Body Zone, the Dome offers such attractions
as the Journey Zone, which chronicles the history of
transportation; the Money Zone, which invites visitors to spend
vast sums and watch the inflationary effects of their extravagance;
and the Faith Zone, which represents various forms of religious
worship.
</P>
<P>
   Some zones may seem peculiar at best to a visitor. Living
Island, which faithfully replicates the Spartan pleasures of a
British beach, offers a fine collection of what can be best
described as washed up garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Other sectors are more successful. The Play Zone has a variety
of entertaining family games, and the Self Portrait Zone, with its
thousands of photographs contributed by ordinary and famous
Britons, makes a fine national time capsule.
</P>
<P>
   The Dome also seems to fare better with conventional
entertainment. Each day, the Millennium Show provides a stunning
extravaganza of dance, acrobatics and high-wire theatrics in the
Dome's cavernous central arena.
</P>
<P>
   Impressively, the Dome also offers the largest McDonald's
restaurant in the world _ an odd feature in an attraction intended
to celebrate modern Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Dome's standing as favorite target for the city's
journalists, comedians and artsy class, it nevertheless does seem
to please many of its visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Loren Keene, who also exited the Body Zone on a recent
afternoon, said she was impressed. ``I'm quite weary with all the
comments in the press,'' she said. ``I think this is a bright and
cheerful place, and many of the exhibits are brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Dome's managers constantly remind everyone that
their studies show that people who actually see the Dome enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Gerbeau, the Dome's chief executive, believes he will achieve
the revised target of 7 million visitors, which would place it
among Europe's most popular attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any standards, the Dome is clearly an overwhelming success
both in terms of visitor numbers and the positive feedback from
those who visit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, many visitors may share the reaction of French
President Jacques Chirac, who had only one question after seeing a
model of the Dome in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's it for?'' asked a puzzled Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   The answer still isn't completely clear.

   MIAMI _ It was a made-for-television story: a cute little boy
survives a nightmare-at-sea, only to come ashore into a maelstrom
of battling sound bites, dueling legal teams, shouting protestors,
an aging but forceful dictator, defiant mayors, crying
grandmothers, a warm-hearted nun and a shocking pre-dawn raid.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez's story grabbed the imaginations of millions
around the world. Propelled by an avalanche of televised images, it
grew from the story of an improbable, 6-year-old shipwreck survivor
into a fiery international debate that summed up 40 years of bitter
Cuban exile politics.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally went home to Cuba on Wednesday, the television
networks broke into regular programming and broadcast live pictures
of the motorcade and the jet's taxi and take-off, as if Elian were
a major world figure.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, he was.
</P>
<P>
   Observers disagree over the long-term legacy of Elian's case.
But most agree that the images will linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a story dominated by visuals,'' said Dario Moreno, a
Cuban-American professor of political science at Miami's Florida
International University. ``In a way, there are a lot of
similarities to the O.J. Simpson case. It was a tremendously
dramatic story that captured the interest of a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But many believe more than the images will linger.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the furious reaction to his story, the impish little
boy is being credited _ partly _ with helping open a crack in the
four-decades-old U.S. embargo against Cuba. Congressional leaders
reached a deal to allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba just
a day before Elian went home, although the measure has yet to win
final passage.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Elian made the American public more aware than
ever of their country's tortured relationship with Fidel Castro's
communist Cuba. Before Elian, mainstream America knew little about
Cuba. But with the case grabbing headlines and heartstrings, many
Americans were shocked that a father's blood ties to his son might
be sacrificed for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Their questions raised the most serious challenge ever to the
power of a small but determined band of Cuban-American lobbyists
who for decades have held great influence over U.S. policy toward
the Caribbean island sitting just 90 miles off Florida's coast.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showing that two-thirds of Americans wanted Elian to go
home to Cuba also served as a wake-up call for many of South
Florida's 800,000 Cuban-Americans. After 40 years of exile, they
were accustomed to having their way on the Cuba issue in the
national political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the American public was rejecting the heart of their
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't understand us,'' added Josefina Inlimo(CQ),
50, a Cuban-American housewife who fought back tears outside the
home Elian shared with his Miami relatives on the day the boy
returned to Cuba. ``Before Elian, I was proud to be an American.
Now I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian's legacy is one of confusion, heartbreak and
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the true believers, the reaction is retrenchment,'' said
Damian Fernandez, another Cuban-American academic and author of the
book, Cuba and the Politics of Passion. ``Others feel frustration.
A third group feels apathy and withdrawal, that they don't want to
play the game of politics anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Fernandez and Moreno feel the Cuban-American leadership
stumbled badly in their handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their error was to say that it was an issue of communism
versus democracy, while the rest of the world saw it as a
father-son issue,'' Fernandez said. ``Now, they've not only lost
Elian, but they've also lost the public relations battle. Their
image is tarnished in the eyes of the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Vazquez, a spokesman for the Cuban-American National
Foundation, the most powerful exile lobbying group, dismissed the
criticism, saying the case was a tragedy that will only re-double
the determination of Castro's foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation's obituary has been written so many times and
it's the furthest thing from the truth,'' he said. ``The Elian saga
is a tremendous tragedy, but the mission of the foundation remains
the same: to bring freedom and democracy to the Cuban people.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno agrees that the community suffered losses, but questions
the long-term impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the attention the case got, the political impact was
really minor,'' he said. ``The pressure to loosen the embargo had
been getting stronger every year. And nothing earth-shaking has
happened. We still really haven't seen how it will play out
politically.''
</P>
<P>
   One interesting impact of the case has been its effect on young
Cuban-Americans. Many observers had believed the younger generation
was more moderate than their parents were, and would inevitably
soften the hard line against Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian shattered that notion,'' Fernandez said. ``Polls
consistently showed that 90 percent of Cuban-Americans wanted Elian
to stay here, regardless of age. I think Elian embodied something
about the Cuban experience that became a cause for them to define
what it means to be Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Elian case will have a lasting impact on U.S.-Cuba
relations in the long-term remains to be seen. But some longtime
Cuba watchers say the case has already triggered important changes.
</P>
<P>
   John Kavulich(CQ) of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council
believes the Cuban and American governments took an important step
in their handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, whenever there has been a problem with one facet
of the relationship, all the other facets shut down until the
problem was resolved,'' he said. ``In this case we saw a real
effort by both governments to isolate the Elian problem while they
continued to make progress on other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Kavulich also credits the boy's saga with educating the American
public about Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a necessity for the media to present the context in
which the Elian issue was being debated,'' he said. ``The stories
were substantive and went into areas of Cuban life that were not
discussed before. They also provided a picture that many people
were uncomfortable with, of shouting and threats and the separation
of a parent and child.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, those images will stick with many Americans for years
to come: Cuban-American politicians angrily defying the federal
government; protestors burning American flags in the streets of
Miami and the controversial video made by Elian's Miami relatives
showing the boy lecturing his papa.
</P>
<P>
   Also disturbing was the infamous news photo of a gun-wielding
federal agent reaching out for a terrified Elian.
</P>
<P>
   But the unkindest blow for many Cuban-Americans is in the fact
that Fidel Castro comes out once again looking like the victor,
having somehow turned the tables on the exiles and won the public
relations battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro is clearly the big winner, while in many ways, Elian
has left this community shipwrecked,'' Fernandez said. ``It's left
us without a sense of direction. Unfortunately, I don't see any
institutional effort at change. The community is in shock. I'm not
sure what lessons have been learned, and by whom.''

 &HT;    FOR RALPH NADER, PRESIDENTIAL QUEST IS ONE STEP IN A LONG
JOURNEY
 &HT;    820&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ralph Nader understands that he is not going to be
elected president of the United States this year. But then, winning
the White House is not exactly what his campaign for the presidency
is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victory is defined in many ways,'' Nader insisted Thursday at
a breakfast with political reporters from nearly every major
newspaper in the country.
</P>
<P>
   What he wants, as the nominee of the Green Party, is to do for
the fledgling political organization what Ross Perot did for the
Reform Party: win 5 percent of the vote in November to earn a share
of federal funding this year and in the 2004 election. That would
give the Greens a toehold in the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we want to have a significant third
party that will draw thousands of local, state and national
candidacies in the coming years,'' said Nader, a legendary consumer
advocate and anti-corporate crusader.
</P>
<P>
   If that means siphoning off liberal-leaning voters who might
otherwise vote for Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
Democratic nominee, well, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Nader wants to see Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
likely GOP nominee, in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with George W. Bush is he's beyond satire,'' Nader
said. ``The challenge for me is: how do you satirize satire? This
guy is straight out of central casting.''
</P>
<P>
   He also described Bush as the ``corporate welfare king of all
presidential candidates,'' a reference to the governor's $14
million profit from the sale of the Texas Rangers after securing a
taxpayer-financed stadium for the professional baseball franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Gore is the more infuriating, because he's such a
hypocrite,'' Nader added. ``He doesn't know who he is any more.
He's a plastic person.'' He also called Gore an ``environmental
imposter'' who supports trade treaties that subordinate the
environment and a ``gee-whiz techno-twit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader's disdains Gore and Bush equally as ``indentured'' to the
corporate interests that hold sway over the political process in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader is positioned to hurt Gore more in the fall election.
A favorite of liberal activists and union members, he is polling
between 5 and 9 percent in some states that are crucial to the vice
president's campaign. He is strongest in California, the linchpin
of Gore's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign is somewhat dismissive of Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The undeniable likelihood is one of two people is going to be
president, Al Gore or George W. Bush,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane. ``And if you care about progressive causes, you would be
supporting Al Gore. A vote for anyone else is tantamount to a vote
against progressive causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while trailing Bush and Gore by 40 points or more,
Nader is running third in most polls, ahead of staunch conservative
Pat Buchanan, who as the Reform Party nominee was expected to be
the wild card in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader does not see himself as a ``spoiler'' in this year's
election. He sees himself as a reformer in the mold of movements
that challenged the corrupt political machines in the country's
major cities in the early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they viewed themselves as spoilers,'' he said.
``They viewed themselves as reformers. You can't spoil a system
that's spoiled to the core.''
</P>
<P>
   The political system, he said, has moved from ``legalized
bribery'' of public officials to ``legalized extortion'' by
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party in the United States was organized in Minnesota
in 1984. It is an offshoot of the European Greens, which sprouted
in 1978 in West Germany as a pro-environmental, anti-nuclear
movement. Currently, 79 Greens hold elected offices in 18 states
and Washington, D.C. This year, 177 are running for state, local
and federal offices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their political differences, Nader and Buchanan are
allies in trying to secure a place for themselves in the
presidential debates this fall. They have filed suit together
challenging the legality of the corporate-funded Commission on
Presidential Debates, which has set standards for inclusion in the
debates that could bar Nader and Buchanan _ specifically, a minimum
15 percent standing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Nader has run for president, but it
is the most serious effort by the 66-year-old public interest
lawyer. In 1992, he briefly promoted a ``none-of-the-above''
candidacy in New Hampshire. And in 1996, he allowed his name to be
placed on the ballot in several states, but did not campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, he has already visited all 50 states and is
trying to get on the ballots of at least 45. Since accepting the
Green Party's nomination last Sunday, he has begun assembling a
campaign headquarters staff of 21 people and a field staff of at
least 30 organizers.
</P>
<P>
   He also has set a fund-raising goal of $5 million. ``We get a
lot more out of $5 million than the other candidates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Nader's name recognition is helpful in some parts of the
country, he admitted. While he mostly depends on news coverage of
rallies and ``word of mouth'' for exposure, he also said he will
try to ``push the frontier'' with his campaign Web site, conducting
some live events on it.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he will try to advertise some this fall. He already
has hired Bill Hillsman, the advertising whiz whose television
spots helped put former pro wrestler Jesse Ventura in the
governor's mansion in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Nader's chief issues arise from his distrust
of corporations. He wants to end ``corporate welfare'' tax
loopholes, institute a system of public financing of political
campaigns, renegotiate international trade agreements and
strengthen labor laws and environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But most of his campaign rhetoric flows from his advocacy of an
all-out effort by the federal government to end child poverty in
the United States. His solution involves universal health care and
a ``national minimum income'' for poor families.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't abolish child poverty now, we will never abolish
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a 66-year-old bachelor, came to national prominence in
1965 with the publication of the book ``Unsafe at Any Speed,''
which criticized the safety standards of the auto industry. Since
then, he has established a number of public interest organizations,
helping to finance them by donating about 80 percent of his
earnings from royalties and fees.
</P>
<P>
   He lives austerely on $25,000 a year in a rented apartment in
Washington. But his anti-corporate image took a hit recently when
he disclosed that he has personal assets total close to $4 million,
much of it earned through investments.

<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we want to have a significant third
party that will draw thousands of local, state and national
candidacies in the coming years,'' said Nader, a legendary consumer
advocate and anti-corporate crusader.
</P>
<P>
   If that means siphoning off liberal-leaning voters who might
otherwise vote for Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
Democratic nominee, well, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Nader wants to see Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
likely GOP nominee, in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with George W. Bush is he's beyond satire,'' Nader
said. ``The challenge for me is: how do you satirize satire? This
guy is straight out of central casting.''
</P>
<P>
   He also described Bush as the ``corporate welfare king of all
presidential candidates,'' a reference to the governor's $14
million profit from the sale of the Texas Rangers after securing a
taxpayer-financed stadium for the professional baseball franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Gore is the more infuriating, because he's such a
hypocrite,'' Nader added. ``He doesn't know who he is any more.
He's a plastic person.'' He also called Gore an ``environmental
imposter'' who supports trade treaties that subordinate the
environment and a ``gee-whiz techno-twit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader's disdains Gore and Bush equally as ``indentured'' to the
corporate interests that hold sway over the political process in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader is positioned to hurt Gore more in the fall election.
A favorite of liberal activists and union members, he is polling
between 5 and 9 percent in some states that are crucial to the vice
president's campaign. He is strongest in California, the linchpin
of Gore's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign is somewhat dismissive of Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The undeniable likelihood is one of two people is going to be
president, Al Gore or George W. Bush,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane. ``And if you care about progressive causes, you would be
supporting Al Gore. A vote for anyone else is tantamount to a vote
against progressive causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while trailing Bush and Gore by 40 points or more,
Nader is running third in most polls, ahead of staunch conservative
Pat Buchanan, who as the Reform Party nominee was expected to be
the wild card in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader does not see himself as a ``spoiler'' in this year's
election. He sees himself as a reformer in the mold of movements
that challenged the corrupt political machines in the country's
major cities in the early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they viewed themselves as spoilers,'' he said.
``They viewed themselves as reformers. You can't spoil a system
that's spoiled to the core.''
</P>
<P>
   The political system, he said, has moved from ``legalized
bribery'' of public officials to ``legalized extortion'' by
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party in the United States was organized in Minnesota
in 1984. It is an offshoot of the European Greens, which sprouted
in 1978 in West Germany as a pro-environmental, anti-nuclear
movement. Currently, 79 Greens hold elected offices in 18 states
and Washington, D.C. This year, 177 are running for state, local
and federal offices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their political differences, Nader and Buchanan are
allies in trying to secure a place for themselves in the
presidential debates this fall. They have filed suit together
challenging the legality of the corporate-funded Commission on
Presidential Debates, which has set standards for inclusion in the
debates that could bar Nader and Buchanan _ specifically, a minimum
15 percent standing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Nader has run for president, but it
is the most serious effort by the 66-year-old public interest
lawyer. In 1992, he briefly promoted a ``none-of-the-above''
candidacy in New Hampshire. And in 1996, he allowed his name to be
placed on the ballot in several states, but did not campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, he has already visited all 50 states and is
trying to get on the ballots of at least 45. Since accepting the
Green Party's nomination last Sunday, he has begun assembling a
campaign headquarters staff of 21 people and a field staff of at
least 30 organizers.
</P>
<P>
   He also has set a fund-raising goal of $5 million. ``We get a
lot more out of $5 million than the other candidates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Nader's name recognition is helpful in some parts of the
country, he admitted. While he mostly depends on news coverage of
rallies and ``word of mouth'' for exposure, he also said he will
try to ``push the frontier'' with his campaign Web site, conducting
some live events on it.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he will try to advertise some this fall. He already
has hired Bill Hillsman, the advertising whiz whose television
spots helped put former pro wrestler Jesse Ventura in the
governor's mansion in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Nader's chief issues arise from his distrust
of corporations. He wants to end ``corporate welfare'' tax
loopholes, institute a system of public financing of political
campaigns, renegotiate international trade agreements and
strengthen labor laws and environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But most of his campaign rhetoric flows from his advocacy of an
all-out effort by the federal government to end child poverty in
the United States. His solution involves universal health care and
a ``national minimum income'' for poor families.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't abolish child poverty now, we will never abolish
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a 66-year-old bachelor, came to national prominence in
1965 with the publication of the book ``Unsafe at Any Speed,''
which criticized the safety standards of the auto industry. Since
then, he has established a number of public interest organizations,
helping to finance them by donating about 80 percent of his
earnings from royalties and fees.
</P>
<P>
   He lives austerely on $25,000 a year in a rented apartment in
Washington. But his anti-corporate image took a hit recently when
he disclosed that he has personal assets total close to $4 million,
much of it earned through investments.

 &HT;    TAXING INTERNET SALES GAINING FAVOR IN CONGRESS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last month, the U.S. House overwhelmingly approved
a bill to block new taxes on the Internet for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of moving smoothly through the Senate as expected,
the tax moratorium bill has stalled, and legislation intended to
help states collect taxes on online transactions is gaining
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sales tax is the backbone of most state budgets and the
foundation for the funding of education, police, fire and
transportation needs in our communities,'' Rep. Spencer Bachus,
R-Ala., said Thursday at a House subcommittee hearing on his bill.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Congress lets states tax out-of-state merchants who reach
customers in cyberspace, ``Internet retailers will continue to
enjoy a tax haven, while brick and mortar retailers will pay higher
and higher taxes to make up for the revenues lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many congressional staff members and lobbyists say the the
Bachus bill, and a similar measure in the Senate sponsored by Sen.
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., probably won't have time to make it all the
way to President Clinton's desk this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the pro-tax bills may be gaining enough momentum to stymie
efforts in the Senate to pass a five-year extension of the current
moratorium on Internet access taxes, as the House did in May.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium lasts until October 2001, and many lobbyists
expect Congress to put the matter off until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales taxes are in force in 45 states, but states cannot force a
company with no in-state store or warehouse to collect taxes. That
means online merchants and catalog companies generally collect
taxes only from in-state customers.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the University of Tennessee has projected that as
electronic commerce grows, states will eventually lose more than
$10 billion annually from untaxed transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-tax forces have been lobbying Congress heavily to
prevent such a loss. They include not only state and local
officials, but traditional retailers who say they are being put at
an unfair competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey suggests tax policy does tend to shift business
away from Main Street. Fifty-seven percent of home Internet users
said they took sales taxes into consideration when making
purchases, according to a poll by PC Data Online.
</P>
<P>
   However, opponents of taxing online sales say merchants would be
unduly burdened by the maze of arcane rules in thousands of tax
jurisdictions coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Sales tax advocates respond by saying states should be given the
time and encouragement to created simple and uniform tax policies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bachus and Dorgan want Congress to help states form
compacts with common tax regimes. While state and local governments
impose sales taxes, Congress would have to give its blessing to
joint tax collection plans.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
commercial and administrative law, Bachus said his bill would
``provide a framework for simplification and allow states to
require (tax) collection when the simplification process has been
completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say states will never be able to coordinate their tax
policies well enough to create a single compact, but the National
Governors Association says it needs only a couple of years to
develop a uniform tax system under which shoppers would pay the
same taxes, whether buying in stores, by mail or on the Internet.

 &HT;    PANNING BRITAIN'S MILLENNIUM DOME: Expensive attraction's slow
start confuses some, angers others
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, England _ Emerging from the Body Zone on a recent
afternoon, David Owens said he had seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then, that's it,'' fumed Owens, whose annoyance was
stimulating a powerful desire for a cigarette. ``I'm embarrassed as
an Englishman, as a European and as a human being. They spent
untold millions on this and at the end of the day it's money down
the pipe, isn't it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Body Zone is perhaps the best known of the 14 themed sectors
in the Millennium Dome, the US$1.2 billion attraction intended to
make an important statement about modern Britain at the dawn of the
new century.
</P>
<P>
   However, at the midpoint of the Dome's troubled life, the
statement being delivered is not exactly what its backers had in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who paid about US$100 for a family ticket, waited 30
minutes with his wife and twin 5-year-olds to enter the colossal
peach-colored, androgynous body. The journey began with a view of a
giant naval _ pierced stylishly with a huge ring _ continued with a
ride up an arm past the thunderous pounding of a giant heart, a
talking brain, a Volkswagen-sized eyeball and then down the stairs
and out the leg.
</P>
<P>
   After finally lighting up and taking a thoughtful puff, the best
thing Owens could say about the experience was that it was brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, five minutes?'' he asked his speechless wife. ``I can
withstand anything for five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Britain must withstand six months more of the misery
generated by the ill-fated Dome since its inauguration on New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Dome quietly welcomed its 3 millionth visitor.
That's the good news. The bad news is that the attraction's
managers last year projected that the Dome would have 12 million
visitors for the year that is now half over.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing opening in January the projections were
slashed to 7 million _ a figure that may still be elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Slow ticket sales have had the predictable effect on the bottom
line. Losses are reported in the British media to be already more
than US$150 million. In May, the government had to come up with a
nearly US$50 million emergency cash injection to keep the doors
open. The government intends to sell the Dome in July to a private
bidder. At the end of the year, it is to be reconfigured into some
other use.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, Britain's largest selling tabloid, reported earlier
this week that the Dome would run out of money in September and
close four months early _ an assertion that the Dome's management
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the most recent group of managers, headed by
EuroDisney veteran Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, acknowledges that the
earlier attendance estimates were wildly optimistic and that the
Dome has been slow to work its way into the public's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Gerbeau, a Frenchman who speaks with an American accent, blames
much of the problem on the British press, which has been gleefully
merciless in its attacks on the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gerbeau used an appearance at Parliament to appeal
for less vitriolic coverage. ``Why don't you stand behind us for a
change and let us prove ourselves to the general public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dome's new advertising campaign urges the public to ignore
the press. A new television spot casts Dome critics as sheep and
ends with the line, ``You've got a mind of your own _ take it to
the Millennium Dome.''
</P>
<P>
   However, people seem to be taking their minds elsewhere. In a
nagging coincidence, the new and much acclaimed Tate Modern museum
also marked a milestone Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Open just seven weeks a few miles up the River Thames, the Tate
welcomed its millionth visitor and is on a pace to become London's
surprise top attraction for the year.
</P>
<P>
   This can be explained by two important factors: the Tate is free
and in central London. A ticket to the Dome is more than US$30 and
the structure is set in a car-free zone on former industrial land
about 15 miles east of London.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, many observers believe the Tate provides the smart
and funky experience promised but not delivered by the Dome.
Stephen Bayley, who resigned as creative director of the Dome
before its opening, believes that the Tate has been well-received
because it appeals to the public's intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People so wanted something intelligent, smart and optimistic
and now it seems as though it is Tate Modern that has supplied
that,'' Bayley said. ``The Tate does not characterize the British
public as drooling morons, whereas the Dome insults with
patronizing rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dome is a national disgrace, a catastrophically expensive
lesson and we should all be ashamed. The dimwits responsible should
be publicly stoned.''
</P>
<P>
   While there have been a number of resignations, no one has been
stoned _ so far.
</P>
<P>
   Dome designers say they meant to appeal to the masses and are
dismissive of complaints that they dumbed down the exhibits. ``We
have been accused of having low standards and pandering to the
lowest common denominator, but I don't apologize for that at all,''
Ben Evans, one of the Dome's four content editors, said in a recent
BBC radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to be family-orientated and to be inclusive, not
exclusive, and ensure that as many people as possible could come
and enjoy themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The 14 zones within the huge Teflon-roofed structure _ which is
twice the size of the Georgia Dome _ were intended to illustrate
human life, work and play as well as the social and environmental
challenges of the 21st century. Unlike Disney's Epcot Center, the
exhibits are not rides but rather strolls, climbs or meanderings
through the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Body Zone, the Dome offers such attractions
as the Journey Zone, which chronicles the history of
transportation; the Money Zone, which invites visitors to spend
vast sums and watch the inflationary effects of their extravagance;
and the Faith Zone, which represents various forms of religious
worship.
</P>
<P>
   Some zones may seem peculiar at best to a visitor. Living
Island, which faithfully replicates the Spartan pleasures of a
British beach, offers a fine collection of what can be best
described as washed up garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Other sectors are more successful. The Play Zone has a variety
of entertaining family games, and the Self Portrait Zone, with its
thousands of photographs contributed by ordinary and famous
Britons, makes a fine national time capsule.
</P>
<P>
   The Dome also seems to fare better with conventional
entertainment. Each day, the Millennium Show provides a stunning
extravaganza of dance, acrobatics and high-wire theatrics in the
Dome's cavernous central arena.
</P>
<P>
   Impressively, the Dome also offers the largest McDonald's
restaurant in the world _ an odd feature in an attraction intended
to celebrate modern Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Dome's standing as favorite target for the city's
journalists, comedians and artsy class, it nevertheless does seem
to please many of its visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Loren Keene, who also exited the Body Zone on a recent
afternoon, said she was impressed. ``I'm quite weary with all the
comments in the press,'' she said. ``I think this is a bright and
cheerful place, and many of the exhibits are brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Dome's managers constantly remind everyone that
their studies show that people who actually see the Dome enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Gerbeau, the Dome's chief executive, believes he will achieve
the revised target of 7 million visitors, which would place it
among Europe's most popular attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any standards, the Dome is clearly an overwhelming success
both in terms of visitor numbers and the positive feedback from
those who visit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, many visitors may share the reaction of French
President Jacques Chirac, who had only one question after seeing a
model of the Dome in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's it for?'' asked a puzzled Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   The answer still isn't completely clear.

<P>
   MIAMI _ It was a made-for-television story: a cute little boy
survives a nightmare-at-sea, only to come ashore into a maelstrom
of battling sound bites, dueling legal teams, shouting protestors,
an aging but forceful dictator, defiant mayors, crying
grandmothers, a warm-hearted nun and a shocking pre-dawn raid.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez's story grabbed the imaginations of millions
around the world. Propelled by an avalanche of televised images, it
grew from the story of an improbable, 6-year-old shipwreck survivor
into a fiery international debate that summed up 40 years of bitter
Cuban exile politics.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally went home to Cuba on Wednesday, the television
networks broke into regular programming and broadcast live pictures
of the motorcade and the jet's taxi and take-off, as if Elian were
a major world figure.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, he was.
</P>
<P>
   Observers disagree over the long-term legacy of Elian's case.
But most agree that the images will linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a story dominated by visuals,'' said Dario Moreno, a
Cuban-American professor of political science at Miami's Florida
International University. ``In a way, there are a lot of
similarities to the O.J. Simpson case. It was a tremendously
dramatic story that captured the interest of a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But many believe more than the images will linger.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the furious reaction to his story, the impish little
boy is being credited _ partly _ with helping open a crack in the
four-decades-old U.S. embargo against Cuba. Congressional leaders
reached a deal to allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba just
a day before Elian went home, although the measure has yet to win
final passage.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Elian made the American public more aware than
ever of their country's tortured relationship with Fidel Castro's
communist Cuba. Before Elian, mainstream America knew little about
Cuba. But with the case grabbing headlines and heartstrings, many
Americans were shocked that a father's blood ties to his son might
be sacrificed for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Their questions raised the most serious challenge ever to the
power of a small but determined band of Cuban-American lobbyists
who for decades have held great influence over U.S. policy toward
the Caribbean island sitting just 90 miles off Florida's coast.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showing that two-thirds of Americans wanted Elian to go
home to Cuba also served as a wake-up call for many of South
Florida's 800,000 Cuban-Americans. After 40 years of exile, they
were accustomed to having their way on the Cuba issue in the
national political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the American public was rejecting the heart of their
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't understand us,'' added Josefina Inlimo(CQ),
50, a Cuban-American housewife who fought back tears outside the
home Elian shared with his Miami relatives on the day the boy
returned to Cuba. ``Before Elian, I was proud to be an American.
Now I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian's legacy is one of confusion, heartbreak and
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the true believers, the reaction is retrenchment,'' said
Damian Fernandez, another Cuban-American academic and author of the
book, Cuba and the Politics of Passion. ``Others feel frustration.
A third group feels apathy and withdrawal, that they don't want to
play the game of politics anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Fernandez and Moreno feel the Cuban-American leadership
stumbled badly in their handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their error was to say that it was an issue of communism
versus democracy, while the rest of the world saw it as a
father-son issue,'' Fernandez said. ``Now, they've not only lost
Elian, but they've also lost the public relations battle. Their
image is tarnished in the eyes of the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Vazquez, a spokesman for the Cuban-American National
Foundation, the most powerful exile lobbying group, dismissed the
criticism, saying the case was a tragedy that will only re-double
the determination of Castro's foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation's obituary has been written so many times and
it's the furthest thing from the truth,'' he said. ``The Elian saga
is a tremendous tragedy, but the mission of the foundation remains
the same: to bring freedom and democracy to the Cuban people.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno agrees that the community suffered losses, but questions
the long-term impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the attention the case got, the political impact was
really minor,'' he said. ``The pressure to loosen the embargo had
been getting stronger every year. And nothing earth-shaking has
happened. We still really haven't seen how it will play out
politically.''
</P>
<P>
   One interesting impact of the case has been its effect on young
Cuban-Americans. Many observers had believed the younger generation
was more moderate than their parents were, and would inevitably
soften the hard line against Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian shattered that notion,'' Fernandez said. ``Polls
consistently showed that 90 percent of Cuban-Americans wanted Elian
to stay here, regardless of age. I think Elian embodied something
about the Cuban experience that became a cause for them to define
what it means to be Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Elian case will have a lasting impact on U.S.-Cuba
relations in the long-term remains to be seen. But some longtime
Cuba watchers say the case has already triggered important changes.
</P>
<P>
   John Kavulich(CQ) of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council
believes the Cuban and American governments took an important step
in their handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, whenever there has been a problem with one facet
of the relationship, all the other facets shut down until the
problem was resolved,'' he said. ``In this case we saw a real
effort by both governments to isolate the Elian problem while they
continued to make progress on other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Kavulich also credits the boy's saga with educating the American
public about Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a necessity for the media to present the context in
which the Elian issue was being debated,'' he said. ``The stories
were substantive and went into areas of Cuban life that were not
discussed before. They also provided a picture that many people
were uncomfortable with, of shouting and threats and the separation
of a parent and child.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, those images will stick with many Americans for years
to come: Cuban-American politicians angrily defying the federal
government; protestors burning American flags in the streets of
Miami and the controversial video made by Elian's Miami relatives
showing the boy lecturing his papa.
</P>
<P>
   Also disturbing was the infamous news photo of a gun-wielding
federal agent reaching out for a terrified Elian.
</P>
<P>
   But the unkindest blow for many Cuban-Americans is in the fact
that Fidel Castro comes out once again looking like the victor,
having somehow turned the tables on the exiles and won the public
relations battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro is clearly the big winner, while in many ways, Elian
has left this community shipwrecked,'' Fernandez said. ``It's left
us without a sense of direction. Unfortunately, I don't see any
institutional effort at change. The community is in shock. I'm not
sure what lessons have been learned, and by whom.''

 &HT;    PANNING BRITAIN'S MILLENNIUM DOME: Expensive attraction's slow
start confuses some, angers others
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.

<P>
   GREENWICH, England _ Emerging from the Body Zone on a recent
afternoon, David Owens said he had seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then, that's it,'' fumed Owens, whose annoyance was
stimulating a powerful desire for a cigarette. ``I'm embarrassed as
an Englishman, as a European and as a human being. They spent
untold millions on this and at the end of the day it's money down
the pipe, isn't it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Body Zone is perhaps the best known of the 14 themed sectors
in the Millennium Dome, the US$1.2 billion attraction intended to
make an important statement about modern Britain at the dawn of the
new century.
</P>
<P>
   However, at the midpoint of the Dome's troubled life, the
statement being delivered is not exactly what its backers had in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who paid about US$100 for a family ticket, waited 30
minutes with his wife and twin 5-year-olds to enter the colossal
peach-colored, androgynous body. The journey began with a view of a
giant naval _ pierced stylishly with a huge ring _ continued with a
ride up an arm past the thunderous pounding of a giant heart, a
talking brain, a Volkswagen-sized eyeball and then down the stairs
and out the leg.
</P>
<P>
   After finally lighting up and taking a thoughtful puff, the best
thing Owens could say about the experience was that it was brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, five minutes?'' he asked his speechless wife. ``I can
withstand anything for five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Britain must withstand six months more of the misery
generated by the ill-fated Dome since its inauguration on New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Dome quietly welcomed its 3 millionth visitor.
That's the good news. The bad news is that the attraction's
managers last year projected that the Dome would have 12 million
visitors for the year that is now half over.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing opening in January the projections were
slashed to 7 million _ a figure that may still be elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Slow ticket sales have had the predictable effect on the bottom
line. Losses are reported in the British media to be already more
than US$150 million. In May, the government had to come up with a
nearly US$50 million emergency cash injection to keep the doors
open. The government intends to sell the Dome in July to a private
bidder. At the end of the year, it is to be reconfigured into some
other use.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, Britain's largest selling tabloid, reported earlier
this week that the Dome would run out of money in September and
close four months early _ an assertion that the Dome's management
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the most recent group of managers, headed by
EuroDisney veteran Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, acknowledges that the
earlier attendance estimates were wildly optimistic and that the
Dome has been slow to work its way into the public's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Gerbeau, a Frenchman who speaks with an American accent, blames
much of the problem on the British press, which has been gleefully
merciless in its attacks on the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gerbeau used an appearance at Parliament to appeal
for less vitriolic coverage. ``Why don't you stand behind us for a
change and let us prove ourselves to the general public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dome's new advertising campaign urges the public to ignore
the press. A new television spot casts Dome critics as sheep and
ends with the line, ``You've got a mind of your own _ take it to
the Millennium Dome.''
</P>
<P>
   However, people seem to be taking their minds elsewhere. In a
nagging coincidence, the new and much acclaimed Tate Modern museum
also marked a milestone Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Open just seven weeks a few miles up the River Thames, the Tate
welcomed its millionth visitor and is on a pace to become London's
surprise top attraction for the year.
</P>
<P>
   This can be explained by two important factors: the Tate is free
and in central London. A ticket to the Dome is more than US$30 and
the structure is set in a car-free zone on former industrial land
about 15 miles east of London.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, many observers believe the Tate provides the smart
and funky experience promised but not delivered by the Dome.
Stephen Bayley, who resigned as creative director of the Dome
before its opening, believes that the Tate has been well-received
because it appeals to the public's intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People so wanted something intelligent, smart and optimistic
and now it seems as though it is Tate Modern that has supplied
that,'' Bayley said. ``The Tate does not characterize the British
public as drooling morons, whereas the Dome insults with
patronizing rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dome is a national disgrace, a catastrophically expensive
lesson and we should all be ashamed. The dimwits responsible should
be publicly stoned.''
</P>
<P>
   While there have been a number of resignations, no one has been
stoned _ so far.
</P>
<P>
   Dome designers say they meant to appeal to the masses and are
dismissive of complaints that they dumbed down the exhibits. ``We
have been accused of having low standards and pandering to the
lowest common denominator, but I don't apologize for that at all,''
Ben Evans, one of the Dome's four content editors, said in a recent

</P>

   MEXICAN-ELECTION (Mexico City) _ Arms outreached in eagerness,
thousands of peasants, Indians and blue-collar workers lunged for
the sandwiches, potato chips and soft-drinks tossed in plastic bags
from open trucks. They weren't victims of a flood, hurricane or
earthquake. They were voters hauled in from all over Mexico by the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to attend a rally
in Mexico City's colonial Zocalo plaza. If voters are the quarry,
Mexico's ruling party is the expert hunter in a country where new
election laws are trapped by old political traditions. The election

   MEXICAN-ELECTION (Mexico City) _ Arms outreached in eagerness,
thousands of peasants, Indians and blue-collar workers lunged for
the sandwiches, potato chips and soft-drinks tossed in plastic bags
from open trucks. They weren't victims of a flood, hurricane or
earthquake. They were voters hauled in from all over Mexico by the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to attend a rally
in Mexico City's colonial Zocalo plaza. If voters are the quarry,
Mexico's ruling party is the expert hunter in a country where new

 c.2000 The Boston Globe Magazine  
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine years ago, Sebastian Junger (pronounced ``younger'') was
hanging from a tree on a hot summer day, looking at the bloody tear
he had just ripped down the back of his leg with his chain saw,
when the idea for his book blossomed. Cutting trees, he mused, was
difficult work, like firefighting, logging or commercial fishing.
Why not a book about those jobs?
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, three storm systems collided off the coast of
New England, creating a meteorological debacle so disastrous, and
so improbable, that a weatherman dubbed it a ``perfect storm,'' or
a storm that could not have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the maelstrom of 100-mph winds and 90-foot waves, a
72-foot swordfishing boat out of Gloucester, Mass., called the
Andrea Gail went down with her crew of six. Junger, then living in
Gloucester, clipped a newspaper article about the missing vessel,
which was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Sebastian Junger, 38, a Belmont, Mass., native, became
chronicler of that 1991 fishing disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, what started out as a chapter on fishing had
turned into a whole book, ``The Perfect Storm.'' Suddenly, Junger
was the Sexiest Author in America, and the book was a publishing
marvel being aggressively optioned by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   As publishing leaders see it, it was Junger's own willingness to
stump for the book, coupled with his publisher's savvy marketing
strategy, that led to the book's singular success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it didn't hurt that he was very good-looking,'' says
Daisy Maryles, executive editor of Publishers Weekly. ``These days,
when a publisher looks at an author, obviously, they consider the
manuscript, but they're also looking at the kind of publicity the
author can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Publisher W.W. Norton says it wasn't because of Junger's
appearance or manner. It was because of his obsession with his
subject. Norton is a prestigious publishing house known for
literary quality and a traditional interest in nautical topics.
When Junger approached Norton, he was an unknown. He had never
written a book. He had written only a handful of pieces for such
magazines as Men's Journal and American Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   And his book proposal had been turned down by a dozen publishers
who did not see how a book could be written about a storm. But
Starling Lawrence, Norton's editor-in-chief, sat down with Junger
in his Manhattan office and liked him immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an obsessional quality to his interest in the
material that I liked,'' says Lawrence, who gave Junger a $35,000
advance. ``Obsession is always an interesting, maybe essential,
quality in a writer. I personally am not interested in books that
don't have to be written.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Junger's obsession was his nature. He tends to fixate.
But part of it was that he had once had a near-drowning experience
himself while surfing on Cape Cod, and the sensation of water
pressing against his lungs had been seared into his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Junger's book is a combination of reportage and deduction: He
tells a compelling and factual human story of the fishermen's lives
leading up to the departure of the boat, as well as that of others
who survived the fateful storm. But he also plunges deep into
imagination to narrate what might have happened in the Andrea
Gail's final hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' is chock-full of information about such
things as how human beings drown, and waves form, and boats are
built, and hurricanes crest. One of the most riveting sections of
the book describes in unflinching detail the fishermen's probable
final moments as their boat sank, after Capt. Billy Tyne's final
radio transmission: ``She's comin' on boys, and she's comin' on
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Junger's best guess as to what happened:
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew of the Andrea Gail either have laryngospasms or
completely inundated lungs. They are suspended, open-eyed and
unconscious, in the flooded enclosures of the boat. The darkness is
absolute and the boat may already be on her way to the bottom. At
this point only a massive amount of oxygen could save these men.
They have suffered, at most, a minute or two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason this book is so good is we know so much more about
the weather _ all this scientific information. The weather is a
principal character in this book,'' says Peter Davison, former
editor at Houghton Mifflin and currently poetry editor for The
Atlantic Monthly. Junger ``is also willing to go the final mile and
tell how people die. Most people end with a cry _ and the mate was
washed off to starboard and never seen again _ and that kind of
crap. Junger really deals with this. It is a brave book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm,'' published in May, 1997, has sold just
over 2.5 million copies. (It has since been made into a movie, of
the same title, that is due out in July, and features heartthrobs
George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg.)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times and The Washington Post ran glowing reviews,
as did many others. National Public Radio alone did five interviews
with him, and People magazine did three stories, the last of which
dubbed him one of the Sexiest Men Alive (author division). He was
on ``Good Morning America'' twice, CNN three times, and made
appearances on Charlie Rose, ``CBS Sunday Morning,'' Tom Snyder,
CSPAN and Fox News. And then Oprah waved him into a chair along
with several other of People's Sexiest Men Alive. One writer dubbed
the show ``Hunk Writers With Less Substance Than Their Books.''
</P>
<P>
   Junger balked. He did not want to do it. He did not have a suit.
His chain saw needed oiling. People would think he was using the
book, he says, ``to catapult myself into some weird, glamorous fame
world.'' But Norton editor Starling Lawrence presented Oprah to
Junger in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawrence said, `Look. The amount of book sales we're going to
get from this, the amount of money we're going to get from this, is
huge. And you may not feel like you need the money' _ and I did
feel that way _ `but we're a business, and the more money, the
better for us.' He said, `You know, it will allow us to publish a
lot of guys like you, what we thought you were. And that struck
home. I said OK.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, Junger had done 134 interviews, most with
the national media, four of them online. He had participated in 46
book events and traveled to 40 locations on tour. And reporters
loved him. ``He's affable and enthusiastic, articulate, charming,
frank, modest but not overmodest, romantic but not hopelessly so.
God, isn't there anything wrong with this guy?'' gushed Britain's
Manchester Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's brave. He's built. He's literate,'' exclaimed New York
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, love letters and marriage proposals poured into
Norton's office by the fistful. And now the former tree-cutter and
would-be journalist who could barely get his stories published, was
transformed into The Perfect Author.
</P>
<P>
   It seems significant that Junger did not have a girlfriend in
high school. Now, Junger's life could easily be divided into Before
the Book and After the Book. And not having a girlfriend seemed to
symbolize many of the things he felt he could not have before the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, in fact, started out with a healthy portion of the
conventional ``good things.'' Although he has been lionized in the
media as a kind of wrangler writer, Schwarzenegger with a laptop,
Junger was raised in the prosperous suburb of Belmont, the son of
an artist and a physicist. He attended tony area schools before
graduating from Wesleyan University in 1984 with a degree in
cultural anthropology and, at last, a girlfriend. His book is
dedicated to his father, ``who first introduced me to the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, the very tameness and predictability of his
suburban youth that drove him to build a lean-to in the woods _ ``I
didn't want to kill things, but I wanted to know that I could if I
wanted to'' _ and to scale 100-foot trees with his chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   Junger wandered for several years, trying to launch a writing
career without success. Newspapers turned him down. He wrote some
stories for an alternative paper in Washington, D.C., and for The
Boston Phoenix. He waited tables at the old Casablanca restaurant
in Cambridge, Mass., to pay the bills, then wandered down to New
Orleans and tried his hand at fiction. But after six years, ``the
writing thing was going nowhere. And I wanted it so bad. It was
like trying to get a girlfriend in high school. I was like, `What
is wrong? Why won't this connect?'''
</P>
<P>
   And then, one day in 1989, he sat down at a bar next to a guy
who offered him a job cutting down trees. And things began to
connect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it immediately,'' says Junger. ``I felt, here I have
something which is exhausting, which makes you incredibly dirty,
and you're doing something very scary and that can kill you. And at
the end of the day, you've won. The tree is a stump. A huge dead
oak over this person's house is a stump. Through a mix of machinery
and brute strength and athletic ability and engineering, you have
brought this thing down. It is a tremendous feeling. I fell in love
with it immediately and actually had a hard time giving it up as I
got more into writing.''
</P>
<P>
   And he hasn't, altogether. There is the chain saw, after all,
right there on the bare wooden floor of his two-bedroom apartment
in Manhattan's East Village. (Junger moved to New York from Cape
Cod midway through writing the book, because, he says, he needed a
change.)
</P>
<P>
   There's a picture of him pressing the saw into a 90-foot tree.
It is tacked to the wall, right next to the picture of Ethel
Shatford, bartender at the Crow's Nest, the Gloucester bar that
anchors ``The Perfect Storm,'' and the mother of one of the men who
died on the Andrea Gail.
</P>
<P>
   Junger became close to Ethel Shatford during the countless hours
he spent talking to fishermen in the Nest. In writing the book, he
wrestled with whether to include details of the men's drowning,
thinking largely of its impact on Ethel. In the end, he did
describe their deaths, and Junger later wrote her a letter
explaining why. ``I didn't want her blindsided,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the book came out, he started a fund to help the
children of commercial fishermen, called ``The Perfect Storm''
Foundation, and he remains closely involved.
</P>
<P>
   Junger sold the paperback rights to his book for $1.2 million
and made another $500,000 on film rights, although he will not say
how much more he has made on the book.
</P>
<P>
   His third-floor apartment, at a $2,500 monthly rent, counts as
one of the handful of things his new wealth has allowed him. He
bought a sailboat for $4,000. And an 1820s farmhouse in Truro,
Mass. He is also planning on opening a bar in Manhattan in June,
with some friends, that will have a ``journalistic'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Junger's first book has also garnered a host of
writing assignments he could not have dreamed of before. He's
written several pieces for Vanity Fair, one about the forensics
being practiced at the mass graves in Kosovo, another about the
mysterious death of a Greek shipping magnate's son, called
``Addicted to Danger.'' He wrote ``The Lure of Danger: Confessions
of an Adrenaline Junkie'' for Men's Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, he will drive from Brussels to Sierra Leone to
deliver a school van and will write about it for The New Yorker. He
is currently working on a piece for Vanity Fair about Albert
DeSalvo, the man who claimed to be the Boston Strangler and who,
once upon a time, did some carpentry for Junger's parents. He has
an idea for a new book but says only that ``it will surprise people
that I did it, but they will understand by the time they are
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fame and fortune that have come his way, however,
many who know him say that he has been little changed by his new
status.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, they say, remains a rogue adventurer who far prefers his
worn jeans and tattered black T-shirt to the pressed shirts he
grudgingly dons for public appearances.

&HT;     `ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE': NO FUN INTENDED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' Universal's update
of the 40-year-old ``Bullwinkle Show,'' is an insulting thing to
ask a kid to slog through.
</P>
<P>
   The jokes are the same desperate cops to coolness that the
Muppets have been choking on for years. The biggest gags are in the
dead-on, but largely dead, casting, and thankfully will leave the
young unsullied.
</P>
<P>
   The original series co-opted a benign entertainment format to
throw political daggers at the Cold War. The movie is a dim conceit
in search of a fast-food tie-in; it doesn't even work as passable
kitsch, and Rene Russo and Jason Alexander (as Natasha and Boris)
are too mechanical for even midlevel camp. Anyone thinking that
bringing the two famously bumbling Russian spies into the flesh was
a brilliant idea must have missed Sally Kellerman and Dave Thomas
in ``Boris and Natasha'' (1992). Nonetheless, they have done it
anyway with ``Rocky and Bullwinkle.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with a teen-age FBI agent (Piper Perabo, a plucky
girl who seems in over her head anyway), the obtuse moose and
flying squirrel remain cartoon relics left to fend for themselves
and foil Boris, Natasha and Robert De Niro's bottomlessly scary
Fearless Leader. The trio still wants to obliterate Rocky and
Bullwinkle and take over the world, only to find it has changed
over 35 years, which means they are hatching their plan even more
slowly than they did in the cartoon series.
</P>
<P>
   And die-hards should be relieved to know that they also are
still punishing in their stupidity. In fact, inside and out, idiocy
rules ``Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' a movie too dumb to realize that
the senselessness is viral. The deadly puns move faster than the
story by playwright Kenneth Lonergan, and the hipness quotient
ropes in Nickelodeon sketch comics Kennan and Kel, as well as good
names like Janeane Garofalo, Whoopi Goldberg, Billy Crystal, John
Goodman, Carl Reiner, David Alan Grier and a triple dose of a
craggy Jonathan Winters.
</P>
<P>
   There are Crips and Bloods who come out of drive-bys less
scathed. Some (Crystal, Reiner) seem coerced, others (Garofalo,
Goodman) look bored, and Goldberg actually spends half her stint
dozing off.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Des McAnuff, it's less ``Roger Rabbit'' and more the
``Rabbit'' imitation of ``Cool World.'' The whole thing looks and
feels like the cheap, plotless satire ``Austin Powers'' somehow
avoided though sheer self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   In what I imagine was meant as a poignant gag, Rocky and
Bullwinkle are still despondent over their life in reruns, smarting
perhaps over the dominance of ``The Simpsons'' and the lack of
Cartoon Network support. But they are not vengeful, they are mopey.
The film is clinically depressed, too. And it doesn't take long for
the self-pity to grow contagious then mutate into audience
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   In all fairness, my date with ``The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle'' was a kidless one. There was no one to snicker when
Bullwinkle talks to a wall or cheer when the Boris, Natasha and
Fearless get their big kiss-off. Yet, when Russo confesses to
Alexander, ``Let's face it darlink, we suck,'' is there a child
alive who would sit there unarmed with a comeback? Is there a kid
who would prefer to be at the movie than in line for Harry Potter
4?

&HT;     THE EXTANT CHARMS OF `DISCREET' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Luis Buuel was as old as the 20th century when he made ``The
Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie'' in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   His alignment with the 20th century took on a cosmic, psychic
dimension. Time was his twin, a sibling that he learned to bend
violently to his satirical, anti-realist will. Their rapport only
deepened as Buuel aged, and ``The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie'' is the tidy manifestation of those years.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of Buuel's hundredth birthday (he died in 1983), Rialto
Pictures has re-released the film in a refurbished print with new
subtitles that better preserve the verbal wit often overshadowed by
the visual glee. Six upper-class diners in search of the perfect,
undisturbed meal never get a decent meal as, with sublime
ridiculousness, food is snatched from their mouths whenever
possible. The film plays as the cheekier, more blithe converse of
``The Exterminating Angel,'' in which a group of dinner guests is
trapped at a meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discreet Charm'' is more repast interruptus, with the three
men and three women being denied food over an indefinite or
infinite period. Time is banished here, as politics intrude, death
knocks, circumstances are misperceived and dreams are tethered to
dreams within dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a reaction against bourgeois living and bourgeois
filmmaking. And this film is funny where something like ``Belle Du
Jour'' or ``The Milky Way'' was contentedly dour in its gimmicks.
Buuel let the anger go, the embers of his cynicism having cooled
into room-temperature mockery.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Rey plays the French ambassador from the South American
principality of Miranda. He is a Casanova, engaged in indiscretions
with one of the other men's wives (Delphine Seyrig). The men
(Jean-Pierre Cassel and Paul Frankuer are the other two) are covert
partners in a hot coke-smuggling operation. The women (Seyrig,
Bulle Ogier and the ever-striking Stephane Audran), meanwhile, are
ladies-who-lunch types. They sit around in restaurants and cafes on
the verge of being appalled. They live in contempt of a service
industry that couldn't possibly conceive of the subtler pleasures
lurking in society's upper echelons, but they're hardly
contemptible themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Buuel is careful _ no, carefree _ not to typify the principals.
Sure they show glimmers of disaffection. Ennui is a four-letter
word, and Buuel is far from pulling strings on automatons. These
characters have always lived like this and they love it.
</P>
<P>
   The film's discreet charm is Buuel's finesse. The six characters
always look simultaneously pleased with themselves and completely
confounded. With each thwarted meal comes a look of astonishment as
if letting the actors know that something absurd was about to
happen had slipped Buuel's mind. If there's a granddaddy of breezy
situationalism, it's probably Buuel.

&HT;     THE IMPERFECT `STORM' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't long after the money shot of that minuscule fishing
boat meeting that obscenely large wave that I knew it was OK to
throw ``The Perfect Storm'' back in.
</P>
<P>
   The boat's name is Andrea Gail, and she has barely survived an
exciting thrashing, her six-man crew holding on for dear life. But
there's Mark Wahlberg, separated from the ship, bobbing in the
monstrous digi-waves of the Atlantic, offering this psychic
assurance to his ladylove who sits forlorn thousands of miles away
in a bar watching the news hoping he'll return home: ``There's only
love, Christina. There's only love.''
</P>
<P>
   That's merely the climax of the misty-eyed audio missive
delivered to the audience, who serves as Christina's (tittering)
stand-in. Inexplicably, the filmmakers have chosen to superimpose
Diane Lane, our Christina, over the calming tempest, next to
Wahlberg's plaintive face. It's a moment so savagely Marky Mark
that it's a wonder no one thought to have the Funky Bunch
hydroplaned in. It's also a betrayal of a guy who has worked his
abs off to become a persuasive actor.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, ``The Perfect Storm,'' an enthralling special-effects tour
de force with a lover's nook. Rare is that summer blockbuster with
the nerve to sport a wife-beater while whispering sweet nothings
like Mike Tyson. Adapted from Sebastian Junger's best-selling
account of a true meteorological anomaly and directed by the
reliable action-flick sophisticate Wolfgang Petersen, ``The Perfect
Storm'' knows you've come for brutal oceanic action but also thinks
you demand to see ``Titanic.'' Of course: titanic weather, titanic
death, titanic sea-faring facial hair growth!
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the romance in this,'' our beloved Christina tells
Wahlberg's Bobby as he heads back out to sea. Neither do we.
</P>
<P>
   The film, written by William Dale Wittliff, has visions of
Ahab-like passion to conquer turbulent waters and conquer the
marine life. Let's face it though, the boys, with their blue
collars and land-locked responsibilities, are in it for the money.
After receiving far less pay from his haul of swordfish than he
expected, captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) mounts a small
Gloucester, Mass., crew to hit the Atlantic for what is played as
the old One Last Score. In the meantime, a nor'easter has taken a
great deal of steroids and become Mother Nature's bastard child, a
storm unprecedented in its scale.
</P>
<P>
   On land, each of the women, exercising her intuitive rapport
with the weather, has a terrible feeling about this trip. They show
up at the dock with their extra-strength goodbyes belying the wan,
worried morning sickness on their faces. It's the sensitive,
instinct-driven equivalent of the way cups of water would ripple
before T-Rex struck in ``Jurassic Park.'' Only, you feel nagged.
</P>
<P>
   Excepting the nice touch of the grime beneath the actors
fingernails, the film is more interested in the sacrificial heroism
of the mission than the grit of the job. Read: They're in it for
the effects.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the industrial light and magic arrives with a storm
monstrous in its scope, ominous and loud enough to leave you in
appropriate awe. Petersen is of the
more-bang-for-your-bargain-matinee-buck school of efficiency,
deftly moving almost rhythmically between the plight of the Andrea
Gail, the Coast Guard rescue of Cherry Jones and Karen Allen from a
yacht and the women gathered in Bobby's mother's bar watching the
Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Andrea Gail's rogue skipper, Billy. Well, call him
Clooney. Clooney's stern drive is classy, straightforward and
inwardly heroic. He's not asked to do anything more grandiose than
keep a flinty, altruistic gaze fixed on the computer-generated
waves. The remaining five guys in this six-pack of manly types
(John C. Reilly, William Fichtner, Allen Payne) are drawn straight
from the ``Poseidon Adventure'' course on how antagonistic
personality types in an enclosed space generate tension, chaos,
healing.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years before, Petersen did this with unfurling,
nightmarish precision over the 210-minute run time of ``Das Boot.''
It's still his finest hour as a technician of the kinetic and the
unknown. His best film since, ``In the Line of Fire,'' used a
similar MO to make a Hollywood cat-and-mouse thriller something
more visceral than it should have been. ``The Perfect Storm'' is
``Das Boot's'' thrill-seeking teen-age American cousin.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Kevin McKrell, like most motorists, is feeling
the pocket-pinching prices of gasoline. Yet the pinch has a tighter
grip on McKrell, because the musician and his band, the McKrells,
travel in a 30-foot motor home that averages 10 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The McKrells normally tour a major portion of the United States
and Canada during the summer. However, McKrell decided to limit
this summer's itinerary to shows within 500 miles of Albany. Rising
gas prices, coupled with a steep entrance fee into Canada for an
American band, prompted him to cancel the Canadian leg of the
band's tour.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel costs affect musicians nationwide, especially those who
provide their own travel and pay their own expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling the pinch of the increase everywhere,'' says Chris
Shaw, a solo artist who normally performs in the Adirondacks of
upstate New York during the summer. ``It's reflected in my airline
tickets, then when I get off of the plane, it hits again at the gas
pump with a rental car.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists call that scenario trickle-down economics, a
situation where an increase in the price of one good will cause
increased prices for many others. Shaw calls it ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   McKrell concurs: ``The profit margin for doing shows is small
enough.'' An excursion to Boston or Philadelphia for a low-paying
gig just isn't worth it, says McKrell, because of fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gamsjager of the Lustre Kings is affected, but he knows
that paying more at the pump is unavoidable. ``We travel 45,000
miles a year just touring,'' Gamsjager says. ``Clubs won't pay a
certain amount more because gas prices are up. You just have to put
your head down and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices hurt audiences as well as performers, which the
artists also have considered. ``Are the people that were going to
vacation in the Adirondacks coming from Pennsylvania now going to
find a closer place?'' asks Shaw, worrying about the turnout he may
receive when he plays Blue Mountain Lake in late July.
</P>
<P>
   Many artists will be swallowing the higher costs of fuel. Most
will keep what McKrell calls the ``Pearl Jam attitude,'' of trying
to keep prices at a reasonable level so that the fans are not
punished.

&HT;     COMPANY PLANTS ITS HEADQUARTERS IN A PARK-LIKE SETTING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TRACY HOBSON LEHMANN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ What do you get when you combine corporate culture
and wildlife?
</P>
<P>
   This is no riddle. It is reality.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely partners of business and nature marry beautifully
at the Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp. (UDS) headquarters in
northwest San Antonio. The corporate campus sits on 54 hilly acres
that were once home to cattle and assorted wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 950 employees work at the site, where green predominates
_ a sharp contrast to typical corporate gray asphalt and concrete.
Wildflowers bloom in medians that look more like meadows than part
of the thoroughfare that funnels automobiles into the parking
garage. Around the visitor parking lot, butterflies float among the
flowers and birds chirp welcoming notes to guests. Shrubs, trees
and flowers native to South Texas provide ample cover for wildlife,
allowing the critters to coexist comfortably with people.
</P>
<P>
   The idyllic setting at UDS reflects the comfortable, laid-back
culture of the petroleum and petrochemicals corporation, says
spokeswoman Tara Ford. The khaki- and polo-clad employees not only
look out over the tree-covered vistas from their cubicles, but they
also enjoy the landscape up close. Paths meander through the trees,
leading workers into the wild for a respite from computers and
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving the natural setting was a goal of former UDS chairman
and chief executive Roger Hemminghaus, says facilities manager
Randy Mellinger. He and Ford were part of an employee committee
that devised a wish list for the new headquarters, completed in
late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says they wanted a building that had a resort look. The
resulting two-story structure, built from limestone quarried
nearby, suits its setting well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building was kept low so you could view the natural
surroundings,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And what a view it is.
</P>
<P>
   Ample windows expose the expanse of green. From the employee
cafeteria, the view includes a mesmerizing fountain and a
stream-fed pond that attracts an array of birds. Bright green
prairie buffalo grass bends in the breeze, its soft texture
reminiscent of a favorite blanket stretched out under the sun.
Beyond, trees envelop the open area, creating a sense of mystery
about the wild world that cohabitates with the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Employees, developers and builders worked to preserve the trees
at the site, Mellinger says. Every tree of more than 4 inches in
diameter was plotted on a map, and the building was sited to save
as many of them as possible.
</P>
<P>
   It is a conservation theme that shaped the landscape around the
building and earned UDS the 2000 Naturalist Preservation Award from
the Texas Master Naturalist group. The corporation was selected
``for preserving the area around the headquarters and choosing to
keep it in a natural state and for including a large variety of
native plants in the landscape design,'' says Master Naturalist
President Thea Platz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept intact pretty much everything that was native,''
Mellinger says. Native species such as lantana, autumn sage and
cenizo were used in plantings around the building.
</P>
<P>
   In wild areas, obvious natives such as live oaks, agarita,
prickly pear and mountain laurels grow alongside lesser-known
specimens common in the wild: senna, cassia, elbow bush and
escarpment cherry.
</P>
<P>
   The native plants, Platz points out, provide food and shelter
for mammals, birds and butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   At UDS, the wildlife seems appreciative. A rock squirrel
scampers along a retaining wall, stopping to survey passersby and
seek out morsels from the ground. The same retaining wall was
natural enough for a fox to have a litter of pups among the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Possums, raccoons, ringtail cats and deer all are among the
animals that browse the UDS grounds and an adjoining 93 acres of
undeveloped land owned by the corporation. And, unlike many
neighborhoods that find their landscapes a buffet for wildlife, the
UDS fauna rarely disturb the flora.
</P>
<P>
   The animals ``don't have to decimate to survive. Natives need
natives; they recognize food sources that are inherent,'' Platz
says. ``This is an awesome example of what can be done with
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Preserving native plants, particularly smaller trees that
provide cover, enables wildlife to survive as humans move into
animal territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's sorely lacking in traditional landscapes is the
understory,'' she explains. ``You have canopy, and you have turf.
But you don't have shelter and food sources.''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage understory trees such as redbuds and mountain
laurels, UDS elected to remove cedar trees. Though Platz contests
the popular theory that removing cedars _ really Ashe junipers _
saves water, she agrees that it is best to remove the familiar
evergreens. ``Oaks and cedars use the same amount of water, but
cedars form mottes so the water can't get into the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Crews cut cedar by hand so they wouldn't disturb other plants
and shredded the trees into mulch.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to aesthetic and wildlife benefits, UDS also sees
payback in maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas many office complexes buzz with the cacophony of mowers
and blowers at least once a week, mowing is kept to a minimum at
UDS, says Brad Hold of Precision Lawn Maintenance. The grass is cut
three or four times a year, which also curtails watering.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were cutting this grass every week, it would cost about
$10,000 a month,'' he says. UDS spends about $3,500 a month on
grounds maintenance. About 30 acres of the developed area is
watered with a carefully programmed automatic irrigation system.
</P>
<P>
   Though individual homeowners don't share such a large-scale
landscape budget, they can take lessons from the corporate
experience and enjoy similar benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have noxious animals no matter what you do,''
Platz says. ``What you won't have is songbirds and butterflies.''

&HT;     TRACK LIGHTING: BRIGHT IDEA FOR SHOWCASING ART 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Track lighting is one of the most versatile forms of artificial
lighting available.
</P>
<P>
   It can be used as task or accent lighting, from showing off
works of art to simply creating a mood.
</P>
<P>
   For flexibility, it can be mounted just about anywhere and cut
or pieced to any length.
</P>
<P>
   This type of lighting is not difficult to install. A good place
to start is with an existing light fixture in the ceiling. From
there, you can branch out in any direction to focus the individual
lights on the areas or objects you wish to illuminate.
</P>
<P>
   Newer designs in track lighting originate from a ceiling outlet
with a suspended track, giving the effect of a contemporary
chandelier.
</P>
<P>
   There are several do-it-yourself track lighting systems on sale
at lighting stores and in most home centers.
</P>
<P>
   The track is secured to the ceiling and individual lamps or
lighting heads are snapped into place and rotated to any direction.
</P>
<P>
   Finishes include black or white, polished, matte or brushed
brass, chrome or graphite.
</P>
<P>
   Before you purchase a system, decide where you are going to
place the track and what you plan to highlight. Research the light
spread, so you don't end up with too little or too much light.
</P>
<P>
   A small light can throw off as much light as a large fixture.
Compact, low-voltage halogen bulbs provide a bright white light,
and reflector bulbs focus light.
</P>
<P>
   A dimmer switch controls the intensity of the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Track lights come in a variety of shapes. Decide what will look
best with the scale and style of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Never try to mix brands or modify fixtures. Tracks are usually
sold in two-foot increments and connectors should be used with runs
of more than 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Track lighting was the brainchild of lighting designer Edison
Avery Price. His work can be seen in hundreds of museums around the
world, including the lobby of the Seagram Building in Manhattan,
the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum and the Louvre.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Larry Ellison and I have almost nothing in
common. I don't have a jillion bucks, a Gulfstream G-5 jet or a
mansion constructed Japanese-style with no nails. My sailboats were
just dinghies and I never took them out in gales. I only wage war
with Bill Gates when I try to use a Windows PC at work, and I
always lose.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one big thing the flamboyant chief executive of
Oracle Corp. and I do have in common. I have gone through other
people's trash, and as a ``public service,'' to use Ellison's
words. It's a basic reportorial technique, but not one taught at
the Columbia Journalism School.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been keeping up, the best trash news lately has
been in the Wall Street Journal, not ``Inside Edition'' or Talk
magazine. Ellison admitted that Oracle hired private investigators
to sift through the trash of groups that supported rival Microsoft
in its antitrust struggles with the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence was there among the orange peels and stained
Styrofoam cups. Oracle's dicks discovered that several of those
``independent'' groups were funded by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Silicon Valley is in a gleeful uproar trying to decide
who's sleazier, Ellison for hacking into other people's crumpled
paper, or Gates for secretly paying for supporters.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I'm concerned, they're both high-living lowlifes, but
then I'm prejudiced. They can afford to pay applauding economic
institutes and trash-sniffing detectives. When I did my Dumpster
diving I had to do it myself, and it was much less elegant than
that Silicon Valley saying about ``garbage in, garbage out.''
</P>
<P>
   In garbage, outing garbage. It's literally the dirtiest of dirty
tricks.
</P>
<P>
   I do mean garbage. Long ago I was an anonymous restaurant
reviewer, and went in a fancy restaurant's Dumpster to determine
exactly what kind of canned and frozen gunk the local celebrity
chef was putting on a plate and selling for the equivalent of one
of his busboy's daily take-home pay.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ellison and his detective agency, I can claim that
technically I didn't break the law. In their case, the paperwork
that companies throw away isn't private because it's been thrown
away.
</P>
<P>
   Dumpsters are trickier than wastebaskets. Read the signs on the
sides. Throwing things in Dumpsters without permission (Dumpster
abuse, as it's commonly called) is a crime. But everything I put in
the Dumpster I took out _ namely, me.
</P>
<P>
   I also took out some confidential culinary information, like the
chef's love of such indelicacies as frozen fish, factory-made
stocks and canned bearnaise sauce. Yes, there is such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   My excuse? The public had a right to know what they were putting
in their mouths at $25 a pop. I knew the food was bad, but I wanted
to see the labels on the cans for myself. Restaurant reviewing _
it's a tough job, but somebody has to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison's excuse? The public has a right to know that an outfit
in Oakland, Calif., called the Independent Institute, which has
criticized the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft, also
took $153,000 from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The more information members of the public have, the better they
can judge for themselves whether they like canned bearnaise sauce
or believe the Independent Institute's ``Open Letter on Antitrust
Protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd rather spoon down a whole can of bad bearnaise
than read any more pap about Microsoft as a powerful engine of
innovation behind the single greatest economic revolution since the
dawn of the industrial age.
</P>
<P>
   It's much more entertaining to read about a billionaire going
through another billionaire's garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the possibilities for the vast landfill of TV. ``And
now, here's Regis Dustbin, the host of ``Who Wants to Be a
Billionaire's Garbologist?''
</P>
<P>
   You don't want to get caught going through anyone's garbage.
That's what I used to think.
</P>
<P>
   You don't want to be called ``Nixonian,'' as Ellison has. That's
what I used to think, too.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm not so sure. I went into that restaurant's Dumpster with
great trepidation, and not only at the thought of wading through E.
coli and possibly getting tetanus from the lid of an
industrial-size can of petits pois.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different time and a different place. In a Southern
city 15 years ago, a gentleman simply didn't climb into another
gentleman's garbage unless very, very drunk or in a Tennessee
Williams play. Well, I did.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have the sight of reporters eagerly asking Ellison if
he's been going through Gates' garbage, and Ellison proudly saying
that it was a public service, and he'd be happy to ship all his
garbage to Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Garbage out? Garbage in.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A few hours south of here, Angel Mina proudly
recites the history of Emiliano Zapata, the Mexican revolutionary
who helped overthrow a dictatorship and usher in a new era for this
country 90 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, Mina said, precisely because he is passionate
about Zapata, he will vote against the political party that emerged
from the revolutionary's cause for land and liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going for change,'' the guide at the Zapata Museum in
Morelos state said firmly, repeating a slogan of opposition
presidential candidate Vicente Fox Quesada. ``Enough of
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Mexico _ the world's fifth biggest oil producer, but
where half the population lives in poverty _ similar calls for
change are making Sunday's historic general election the most
competitive and bitterly fought in modern history. More than 58
million people are eligible to vote for a new Congress, dozens of
local leaders and president.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the
PRI, has controlled this country's presidency for 71 years _ the
longest reign of any party in the world. The party is still
indisputably powerful, but its candidate, Francisco Labastida
Ochoa, is on the defensive against a surge by Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has invested about $1.7 billion in public money since
1998 in election reforms, and balloting is supposed to be the
cleanest ever. The campaign has been clouded, however, by scores of
allegations of vote buying and coercion by PRI operatives.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the election, the PRI governor of Yucatan
presented poor residents of his state with cut-rate washing
machines, water tanks, cement floors inscribed with his name and
machetes. He argued he wasn't buying votes because votes are
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Women enrolled in the federal welfare program Progresa in a
number of states have reported pressure at meetings to vote for the
PRI or lose benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is impunity in this area,'' admitted Jaime Cardenas, one
of Mexico's nine counselors at the independent Federal Elections
Institute. He also said there were sporadic reports of attempts to
take people's credentials to prevent them from voting, or party
officials trying to discourage independent citizens from serving as
poll supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is in Mexico to observe the
elections along with more than 800 other foreigners. In a
pre-election report, the Atlanta-based Carter Center said Mexico
has made ``great strides'' toward ensuring a fair election, but
that ``serious charges of the abuse of government resources have
been made; not all of them have been investigated or pursued as
vigorously as we believe they should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear of reprisal for denouncing coercion still reigns in many
remote areas, said political analyst Jose Antonio Crespo.
</P>
<P>
   A Mixe Indian in Oaxaca state has asked authorities to
investigate the death of his brother, who he claims was killed in
police custody after criticizing a local PRI candidate during a
public meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you speak up in isolated areas, you are not protected,''
Crespo said.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of this tense backdrop, the election is still
considered the fairest and tightest in history.
</P>
<P>
   Media coverage during the campaign, once again, grew
increasingly biased toward the PRI, according to election
officials. But new laws gave top candidates almost equal public
funding and the right to buy radio and television time for ads.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion surveys suggest that Labastida is locked in a dead heat
with Fox, a tall, cowboy-booted rancher and former Coca-Cola
executive who has mounted the toughest campaign ever of any
opposition candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This July 2, rain, thunder or lightning, you have a date with
history. Don't let it go by,'' Fox, a former governor of Guanajuato
state, told Mexicans in a final television ad. A high turn-out
among urban and young voters is critical for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fox's party, the National Action Party, or PAN, is
conservative, Fox has promised to lead a plural ``transition'' from
one-party rule. To win, Fox must attract votes from leftist
candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, who polls suggest trails
in third place. Cardenas, who has labeled Fox a right-wing
reactionary, refused to drop out of the race to unite the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's advantage is among government workers who belong to
PRI-affiliated organizations and people who live in rural
provinces. Labastida, whose slogan is ``change with a purpose,''
has criss-crossed the country to shore up that traditional support.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointment with the PRI is undeniably strong. Although the
economy has recovered to some degree, Mexicans were devastated by a
December 1994 peso crash that cut their purchasing power in half.
</P>
<P>
   They have seen manufacturing for export in their country
flourish, making Mexico in 1998 the United States' second largest
trading partner. Yet Mexico has one of the worst gaps in wages
between rich and poor of any Latin American country.
</P>
<P>
   The average education level is only seven years, less than in
communist Cuba. And revelations of drug-trafficking ties and
corrupt acts by high-ranking PRI officials in recent years have
disgusted Mexicans and strained relations with United States.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has pledged to attack corruption with vigor and pay
more attention to poverty. The three-time cabinet member and former
Sinaloa state governor has promised to help families by cutting
prices for cooking oil, and offering more subsidies to farmers and
poor schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``The era of belt-tightening is over,'' Labastida said in a
final speech. ``The years to come are years when salaries will grow
annually above inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in remote areas, where the PRI has always won, voters
are considering alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear that people are saying, 'No more PRI,''' said Juana
Soto, 58, who lives in Sierra de Nanchital, a remote municipality
dotted with oil wells in eastern Veracruz state.
</P>
<P>
   Residents here say they've been waiting for decades for
authorities to build a decent road into their farming town, but
promises have gone unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no life here,'' Soto said. ``I have 10 children and
only two live here now. Seven of them are in North Carolina
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Soto isn't sure who she'll vote for, but it won't be the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad Hernandez, 40, a local shopkeeper, is for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the moment many of us have decided we need a change,''
he said. ``We're willing to take a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Morelos state town of Tetelcingo, Felix Balon supports
Labastida. He belongs to a PRI farmers' group, and while he isn't
fully happy with the party he credits it with giving him federal
government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Labastida was agricultural secretary we got a well for
about 100 farmers. We got several concrete posts for a fence,'' the
54-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   Balon's younger brother, Antonio, 45, said, ``I'm a PRI member.
But what good does it do me when harvest time comes around and they
don't make sure prices are decent for my crops?''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Balon didn't rule out voting for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Antonia Ramirez of Anenecuilco _ where Zapata was born _ said
she's for Fox and her sister for Labastida. .
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox wants to help people who have to go to the United States
to work,'' said Ramirez, who usually is in Denver working as a
hotel maid. ``But my sister works at Social Security (Mexico's
federal health system) and she says she's been told that if Fox
wins he will get rid of all the unions and privatize government
agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, home to more than 10 percent of the electorate,
illiterate Otomi Indian street vender Josefina _ she wouldn't give
her last name _ will vote for Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   After Cardenas became mayor of Mexico City in 1997, Josefina
said, she started keeping more of the $5 to $10 a day she earns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Cardenas I had to pay $1 or $2 to someone (from the
PRI) so I could sell things here,'' the 37-year-old mother of eight
said. ``Now I don't have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fernando Rodriguez, 23, who washes parked cars for a living,
said, ``Fox seems like an honest person. Let's see if he'll keep
his promises and not steal like the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   In the highly populated state of Mexico, home to 13 percent of
the country's electorate, university student and PRI militant
Claudia Gonzalez said people should be grateful to the party.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the federal government invested heavily in public
works in Chalco, a former slum.

   MEXICO CITY _ A few hours south of here, Angel Mina proudly
recites the history of Emiliano Zapata, the Mexican revolutionary
who helped overthrow a dictatorship and usher in a new era for this
country 90 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, Mina said, precisely because he is passionate
about Zapata, he will vote against the political party that emerged
from the revolutionary's cause for land and liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going for change,'' the guide at the Zapata Museum in
Morelos state said firmly, repeating a slogan of opposition
presidential candidate Vicente Fox Quesada. ``Enough of
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Mexico _ the world's fifth biggest oil producer, but
where half the population lives in poverty _ similar calls for
change are making Sunday's historic general election the most
competitive and bitterly fought in modern history. More than 58
million people are eligible to vote for a new Congress, dozens of
local leaders and president.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the
PRI, has controlled this country's presidency for 71 years _ the
longest reign of any party in the world. The party is still
indisputably powerful, but its candidate, Francisco Labastida
Ochoa, is on the defensive against a surge by Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has invested about $1.7 billion in public money since
1998 in election reforms, and balloting is supposed to be the
cleanest ever. The campaign has been clouded, however, by scores of
allegations of vote buying and coercion by PRI operatives.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the election, the PRI governor of Yucatan
presented poor residents of his state with cut-rate washing
machines, water tanks, cement floors inscribed with his name and
machetes. He argued he wasn't buying votes because votes are
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Women enrolled in the federal welfare program Progresa in a
number of states have reported pressure at meetings to vote for the
PRI or lose benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is impunity in this area,'' admitted Jaime Cardenas, one
of Mexico's nine counselors at the independent Federal Elections
Institute. He also said there were sporadic reports of attempts to
take people's credentials to prevent them from voting, or party
officials trying to discourage independent citizens from serving as
poll supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is in Mexico to observe the
elections along with more than 800 other foreigners. In a
pre-election report, the Atlanta-based Carter Center said Mexico
has made ``great strides'' toward ensuring a fair election, but
that ``serious charges of the abuse of government resources have
been made; not all of them have been investigated or pursued as
vigorously as we believe they should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear of reprisal for denouncing coercion still reigns in many
remote areas, said political analyst Jose Antonio Crespo.
</P>
<P>
   A Mixe Indian in Oaxaca state has asked authorities to
investigate the death of his brother, who he claims was killed in
police custody after criticizing a local PRI candidate during a
public meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you speak up in isolated areas, you are not protected,''
Crespo said.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of this tense backdrop, the election is still
considered the fairest and tightest in history.
</P>
<P>
   Media coverage during the campaign, once again, grew
increasingly biased toward the PRI, according to election
officials. But new laws gave top candidates almost equal public
funding and the right to buy radio and television time for ads.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion surveys suggest that Labastida is locked in a dead heat
with Fox, a tall, cowboy-booted rancher and former Coca-Cola
executive who has mounted the toughest campaign ever of any
opposition candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This July 2, rain, thunder or lightning, you have a date with
history. Don't let it go by,'' Fox, a former governor of Guanajuato
state, told Mexicans in a final television ad. A high turn-out
among urban and young voters is critical for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fox's party, the National Action Party, or PAN, is
conservative, Fox has promised to lead a plural ``transition'' from
one-party rule. To win, Fox must attract votes from leftist
candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, who polls suggest trails
in third place. Cardenas, who has labeled Fox a right-wing
reactionary, refused to drop out of the race to unite the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's advantage is among government workers who belong to
PRI-affiliated organizations and people who live in rural
provinces. Labastida, whose slogan is ``change with a purpose,''
has criss-crossed the country to shore up that traditional support.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointment with the PRI is undeniably strong. Although the
economy has recovered to some degree, Mexicans were devastated by a
December 1994 peso crash that cut their purchasing power in half.
</P>
<P>
   They have seen manufacturing for export in their country
flourish, making Mexico in 1998 the United States' second largest
trading partner. Yet Mexico has one of the worst gaps in wages
between rich and poor of any Latin American country.
</P>
<P>
   The average education level is only seven years, less than in
communist Cuba. And revelations of drug-trafficking ties and
corrupt acts by high-ranking PRI officials in recent years have
disgusted Mexicans and strained relations with United States.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has pledged to attack corruption with vigor and pay
more attention to poverty. The three-time cabinet member and former
Sinaloa state governor has promised to help families by cutting
prices for cooking oil, and offering more subsidies to farmers and
poor schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``The era of belt-tightening is over,'' Labastida said in a
final speech. ``The years to come are years when salaries will grow
annually above inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in remote areas, where the PRI has always won, voters
are considering alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear that people are saying, 'No more PRI,''' said Juana
Soto, 58, who lives in Sierra de Nanchital, a remote municipality
dotted with oil wells in eastern Veracruz state.
</P>
<P>
   Residents here say they've been waiting for decades for
authorities to build a decent road into their farming town, but
promises have gone unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no life here,'' Soto said. ``I have 10 children and
only two live here now. Seven of them are in North Carolina
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Soto isn't sure who she'll vote for, but it won't be the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad Hernandez, 40, a local shopkeeper, is for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the moment many of us have decided we need a change,''
he said. ``We're willing to take a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Morelos state town of Tetelcingo, Felix Balon supports
Labastida. He belongs to a PRI farmers' group, and while he isn't
fully happy with the party he credits it with giving him federal
government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Labastida was agricultural secretary we got a well for
about 100 farmers. We got several concrete posts for a fence,'' the
54-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   Balon's younger brother, Antonio, 45, said, ``I'm a PRI member.
But what good does it do me when harvest time comes around and they
don't make sure prices are decent for my crops?''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Balon didn't rule out voting for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Antonia Ramirez of Anenecuilco _ where Zapata was born _ said
she's for Fox and her sister for Labastida. .
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox wants to help people who have to go to the United States
to work,'' said Ramirez, who usually is in Denver working as a
hotel maid. ``But my sister works at Social Security (Mexico's
federal health system) and she says she's been told that if Fox
wins he will get rid of all the unions and privatize government
agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, home to more than 10 percent of the electorate,
illiterate Otomi Indian street vender Josefina _ she wouldn't give
her last name _ will vote for Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   After Cardenas became mayor of Mexico City in 1997, Josefina
said, she started keeping more of the $5 to $10 a day she earns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Cardenas I had to pay $1 or $2 to someone (from the
PRI) so I could sell things here,'' the 37-year-old mother of eight
said. ``Now I don't have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fernando Rodriguez, 23, who washes parked cars for a living,
said, ``Fox seems like an honest person. Let's see if he'll keep
his promises and not steal like the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   In the highly populated state of Mexico, home to 13 percent of
the country's electorate, university student and PRI militant
Claudia Gonzalez said people should be grateful to the party.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the federal government invested heavily in public
works in Chalco, a former slum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do your schools come from?'' she said. ``From the
government. And remember, that government is a PRI government.
Where does your water come from? From the government. And remember,
that government is a PRI government.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, Elvia Herrera, 65, displayed a Fox sign on her
front window. She lives near an area that was flooded with sewage
recently when neglected pipes burst.

CENTURIES-OLD TREES PRESERVE NEW ENGLAND'S ANCIENT HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILL, Mass. _ As cars and trucks roared behind him on busy Route
2, Bob Leverett looked out from the French King Bridge across the
Connecticut River. A cigarette boat zoomed upstream below, while a
hawk soared over the sagging power lines. But Leverett was
transfixed by a scraggly white pine tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There it is,'' Leverett said, gesturing at the 100-foot-tall
pine jutting above the rest of the woods on the steep riverbank.
``Just look at the architecture of that big old tree. It's exactly
what we look for.''
</P>
<P>
   The weathered 250-year-old tree marks the spot of a 20-acre
stand of rare old-growth forest Leverett discovered two weeks ago.
Somehow, these trees had escaped the woodsman's ax since before the
American Revolution, despite centuries of logging, farming and
construction going on around them.
</P>
<P>
   The forest in Gill is part of a boom in the discovery of ``new''
old growth fueled by amateur old-growth sleuths such as Leverett, a
59-year-old Tennessee native now living in Holyoke. Once believed
to be virtually nonexistent in New England _ where 19th century
farmers denuded most of the landscape _ old growth is making a
remarkable comeback.
</P>
<P>
   These days, old-growth forests are turning up virtually by the
week. There were about 135,000 acres known in the Northeast a
decade ago. But since then, and especially in the last few years,
hundreds of thousands of acres have been found. They now total as
many as 1,700 acres in Massachusetts, 400 in Connecticut, 50 in
Rhode Island, 3,000 in Vermont, 20,000 in New Hampshire, 50,000 in
Maine, and 500,000 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up in Boston in the '50s, I was under the
impression there was virtually no old growth left in New England,''
said John O'Keefe, coordinator of the Fisher Museum at Harvard
Forest. ``But now we're realizing there are significant patches
left, a small amount relative to the entire land area of New
England, but a lot more than we had previously thought. And that
has people excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The old trees aren't just a living museum or curiosity. Ancient
forests may be ecologically different from their younger
counterparts, inhabited by different mosses and funguses on the
aging trees and, perhaps, a different mix of animals beneath their
shade. In a world where biologists are just beginning to look at
the smallest creatures of the forest, old-growth forests could also
be a reserve of rare microbial life.
</P>
<P>
   However, their benefits are not just ecological.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have forests like these that represent a continuity of past
to present, that, to me, is exciting to contemplate, especially
when I'm out here in one,'' Leverett said in his languid Southern
drawl. In a world racing ahead at a dizzying pace and whose idea of
history is the Bush administration, these forests ``give us pause,
give us time to reflect.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no mystery why the new discoveries are turning up. As
environmental concern over forests, new and old, in New England has
surged in the last decade, so has research into the natural history
of the woods _ sometimes for the express purpose of finding ancient
forests that can be used as leverage to block logging.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best known old-growth tracts are already on public
land _ on Mount Katahdin in Maine, the Sandwich Range wilderness of
the White Mountains, Lookoff Mountain in the Green Mountains, and
in Massachusetts' Mount Greylock state reservation. But many of the
more recent discoveries are on private land with no special
protection; the exact ownership of the forest in Gill is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over old-growth forests became a national issue in the
late 1980s, fueled by the high-profile debate over preserving the
majestic tracts of the Pacific Northwest, home to the Northern
spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the experience in the Northwest _ where thousands of
acres of old growth were clearcut as activists protested _ the US
Forest Service is now searching the 774,000-acre White Mountain
National Forest for more old-growth tracts. Legislation has been in
the works for the last two years in Massachusetts to protect
old-growth tracts on state lands, prompted in part by the onetime
proposal to build a ski slope on Wachusett Mountain straight
through such a forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the turn of the 20th century, 80 percent of our forests had
been cleared,'' said Jack Clarke, advocacy director for the
Massachusetts Audubon Society. ``Now nearly 70 percent of the state
is forested, and just a small amount is old growth. It's important
to protect old growth generally, but, at a minimum, on state
property.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason these now-prized patches of white pine, chestnut oak,
hemlock, and other centuries-old trees have survived is because
many of the species _ especially hemlock _ were not considered
valuable in the heyday of rampant logging a century ago. Also, like
the tract here in Gill, clinging to a slope that plummets more than
100 feet to the river, many were tough for loggers and farmers to
get to. As a result, many were overlooked or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Leverett and others say the effort to save these trees could be
hindered by aesthetic values. The term ``old growth'' conjures
images of the towering trees of Oregon or Washington, 10 feet wide
at the base, with cathedral canopies, and fully aged. The image is
not of New England's relatively meager trees, maybe two feet wide
at the base, and sometimes stunted from growing on rocky, windswept
hillsides. That has made it more difficult for environmental
campaigns to set aside much younger forest so that one day they can
be grand ancient forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about eliminating something special that
already exists, like old growth in the West, that's immediate, and
people can get a real sense of loss,'' said Dave Publicover, a
forest ecologist with the Appalachian Mountain Club. ``But trying
to recreate something, when you won't see the benefits of it for
another 200 years, doesn't evoke the same sense of immediacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Four centuries of European settlement in New England have also
instilled a deep cultural sense of using, rather than preserving,
the land, making it that much harder to save old-growth forests,
some say. ``The paradigm in New England is that forests must be
working for man,'' said Chris Haney, a forest ecologist with the
Wilderness Society. ``It's a huge cultural bias that is not evident
in other regions of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   To Leverett, that paradigm is changing. New England's old-growth
forests provide habitats for some of the region's most imperiled
native species, and so play a crucial role in sustaining
biodiversity, he said. ``There are balances in these forests we
don't want to lose sight of, balances the earth may have the last
word on,'' he said. But, as important, he said,is the forests'
value in unveiling the past, so as to root the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my wife and I came to New England in 1975, we saw the
sugar maples, stone walls, great blue herons, church steeples. All
that seemed New England,'' Leverett said, pausing during a hike
through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's New England to a young person? Sprawl,'' said Leverett,
leaning against an old hemlock as yet another boat sped by on the
river and a truck rumbled over the bridge. ``We'd like to bring
back some of old New England. And we have one last chance to do it
with these forests. We won't get another opportunity.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Mrs. Mallard is making her way back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In February, thieves sawed off and nabbed the 200-pound bronze
statue of the determined duck matriarch from Robert McCloskey's
``Make Way for Ducklings.''
</P>
<P>
   They also made off with two of her flock, Lack and Mack.
</P>
<P>
   That left Novodevichy Park with only five of the nine original
ducks that Barbara Bush had given the Soviet Union in 1991, a year
after Raisa Gorbachev had admired the duck sculpture while visiting
Boston's Public Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the bronze carnage was too much for Needham native Beth
Hebert, who now runs a small investment firm in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the theft, they looked so lonely, like they had been
orphaned,'' Hebert said of the five remaining ducks, Jack, Kack,
Nack, Ouack, and Pack. (Another duckling, Quack, had been stolen in
1991.) All that remained of the abducted ducks, she noted, were
their bronze webbed feet, embedded in cobblestone imported from
Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, who has a year-old daughter, said the Moscow ducks had
been popular among Russian children. ``There isn't anything like
them in Moscow, so they were a huge hit,'' she said. ``Kids were
always all over them.''
</P>
<P>
   So she persuaded Boston's State Street Corp., which is the main
owner of her Moscow company, to pay most of the cost of having new
ones made by Nancy Schon, the West Newton sculptor of Boston's
bronze ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Schon's new ducks, which are being made from the plaster molds
first used in 1987, are expected to be finished and sent to Russia
in August. With the death last year of Raisa Gorbachev, officials
at State Street are hoping that her husband, Mikhail, will attend
the ceremony marking the return of the abducted ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had sent the duck family redux to Moscow to mark the
US-Soviet arms treaty known as START I. A plaque in front of the
ducks, which were placed near a real duck house in front of the
16th-century, onion-domed Novodevichy Monastery, reads, ``This
scuplture was given in love and friendship to the children of the
Soviet Union on behalf of the children of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, whose mother, a Boston native, read the McCloskey tale
to her over and over as a child, said that she had seen the Moscow
version and had wanted to send her a mother a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   On the February day she had planned to go, a blizzard blanketed
Moscow. The next day, she went with a camera only to find three
ducks abducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ducknapped!'' declared the English-language Moscow Times.
</P>
<P>
   Despite four similar, though less serious, abductions of her
duck statues from Boston's Public Garden since they were installed
in 1987, including one in November, Schon still recoils at the
thought of losing one of her bronze babies.
</P>
<P>
   And never before had the determined matriarch disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated when I heard they'd been cut off at the knees
and that Mrs. Mallard had been taken,'' their sculptor said. ``The
whole thing was mean and cruel and vicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Schon called the theft a violation against children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few public places, in Boston or Moscow, where
children can go and parents don't say `no,' where they can interact
with a sculpture however they want,'' said Schon, who is part
Russian. ``This is a violation against a lovely, beautiful thought
and gift.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Make Way for Ducklings,'' published in 1941, most of the
ducks wait in the Charles River while Mr. Mallard searches for a
permanent home, which turns out to be a tiny island in the middle
of the Public Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The scene shown in the 35-foot-long duck sculpture is that of
Mrs. Mallard and her eight duckings going to rejoin him _ right
after ``Officer Michael'' stops traffic on Storrow Drive for them
to cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a book about keeping promises, which makes the
theft of Mrs. Mallard all the more upsetting,'' said Schon.
</P>
<P>
   George Russell, director of both community affairs and global
philanthropy for State Street, said that the company is paying
$30,000 of the $55,000 cost of the replacements.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's investment management unit has a majority stake in
the firm that Hebert runs in Moscow, Pallada Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beth mentioned this to us, and after thinking about it we
decided to partly fund the replicas,'' Russell said. ``The major
focus of our philanthropy is programs that support children, and
here is something that really resonated with the children of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus,'' he added, ``we're a Boston-headquartered global
company, and this was an opportunity to do something meaningful in
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   It will almost certainly be satisfying to Gavril Popov, the
former mayor of Moscow, who spoke at the duck dedication ceremony
there in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life in this city is going to be gradually improved,'' Popov
said to the guests, who included both Gorbachevs and author Robert
McCloskey, who was 76 at the time. Then, turning to the ducks,
Popov said, ``You will live here as well and as happily as you do
in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Schon said that given the deterioration of US-Russian relations
since the hopeful and heady days of the 1990s, she felt a need to
see that America's gift to Russia is made whole again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the idea that this was something that connected our
cultures,'' said Schon, who called the experience of working with a
combined American-Russian work crew to install the sculptures in
1991 one of the highlights of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing how wonderfully we all worked together,'' she
said. ``It was a reminder to me that, despite our governments,
people basically love each other.''

FOR TARGET AUDIENCE, A FREE TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pitch was in the form of a cover letter attached to a TV set
with a built-in VCR. Please watch our new ads, the pitch implored,
and here's a complimentary new TV to watch them on.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch came from Trellix Corp., a privately held
Concord-based firm that says its personal-computer applications
enable ``mere mortals'' and ``everyday people'' to create and
publish their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of the consumers who use the company's applications
don't know Trellix by name, so there seems to be little point in
mounting an expensive ad campaign that would seek to transform
Trellix into a megabrand or household brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the dot-com (company) that spent half its marketing
budget on a single Super Bowl ad?'' Trellix's pitch letter began.
``We didn't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending a lot of money on costly network airtime to
reach many people, Trellix has opted to spend $2.5 million to reach
only the handful of business customers whose decisions will have
significant impact on Trellix's revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Trellix hired the Ellenson Group, a New York ad
agency, to create ads that may be viewed by no more than 200
people; to increase the probability that those 200 folks, all
dot-com marketing managers, will actually watch the ads, the ads
are being sent with a complimentary TV set.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why such a marketing ploy might make sense, it's
helpful to understand Trellix's business model.
</P>
<P>
   One of Trellix's biggest customers is Tripod.com, an online
community run by Lycos Inc., the Waltham-based Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   What Tripod offers its members is the opportunity to build,
create, and update personalized Web pages. Though they often don't
know it, Tripod's members use Trellix's applications when they
create these Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Building personalized Web pages is becoming immensely popular.
According to Trellix president and chief executive Don Bulens, half
the people with Internet access could soon have one or more of
their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what's driving this growth, he says, is the popularity
of new digital cameras, which allow folks to fill their Web pages
with flashy photos.
</P>
<P>
   A proud father, for example, might create a Web site to show off
pictures of a new baby, or a caterer might use his Web site to
alert the world to his skill and services.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers, it seems, want more than one Web site. An
entrepreneur, for example, might want a Web site for her business
and a separate Web site for her family.
</P>
<P>
   Tripod makes money by running banner advertising on its members'
Web pages, and Trellix charges Tripod fees for helping Tripod
members publish their Web pages, Bulens says.
</P>
<P>
   Trellix's new ad campaign, complete with its distribution of of
free TVs, is aimed at key executives at some of the online world's
most popular Internet destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Bulens declines to discuss specifics or name names, but
presumably a TV set and a video with Trellix's TV ads on it went to
someone at iVillage, an online community for women.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that the ad and TV will persuade iVillage to hire
Trellix to offer the same homepage building services it now
provides to Tripod members.
</P>
<P>
   Video ads that come with the free TV feature regular folks who
rely heavily on their Trellix-built Web sites. One is a character
actor; another is a breeder of prize rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1995 by Daniel S. Bricklin, a pioneer of the
spreadsheet, Trellix does not disclose earning or revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In April, it announced it raised $35 million in mezzanine
financing from Goldman Sachs, Dell Computer Corp., and Lycos, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   On its free-TV marketing strategy of going after a small,
precise audience, Bulens says: ``It's well worth it to spend a lot
of money to reach the key people who make decisions about our
product.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of a new branding campaign that promotes its ties
to Major League Baseball, FleetBoston Financial has kicked off a
separate $18 million marketing effort to promote its online banking
and investing services known as Fleet HomeLink.
</P>
<P>
   Ads were created by Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos of Boston.
The ads seek to build strong brand awareness for HomeLink.

EXCEPTION PLAYERS THE RULE FOR THE CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recruiting begins Saturday. Or, to be precise, at 12:01 a.m.
At that point, the Celtics and the other 28 NBA teams can start
making their sales pitches to their targeted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   There usually are at least three necessities in enticing free
agents: money, playing time, and a legitimate chance to win. Other
factors include year-round golf and proximity to Las Vegas. The
Celtics come up short in all areas. So you can forget any
big-namers coming here, and that includes not only Tim Duncan, but
Rashard Lewis and Austin Croshere. As for Mark Jackson, if Pitino
is concerned about his locker room, he should not go near the
soon-to-be ex-Pacer.
</P>
<P>
   You're going to be hearing the phrase ``exception player'' a
lot. Translated, it means a free agent who thinks he's worth more,
and maybe really is worth more, but won't get any more than the
exception because that is all teams have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   In some locales, notably Orlando and Chicago, big names and big
numbers will be tossed around. The Celtics will have only the
league-allowed exemptions, one at $2.25 million and the other at
$1.2 million, which puts them in the same class as most of the
other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The drafting of Jerome Moiso was a safe selection, even though
Rick Pitino might be two jobs removed by the time the kid blossoms.
(Pitino said Thursday on Boston radio that Moiso is not going to be
a ``difference maker'' next season.) The Celtics still have the
same needs: interior defense (shot blocking), a shooting
guard/small forward who can score, and a big point guard who can
defend. They may have to address one or more of these needs via
trade (Cedric Ceballos is available), and it's still possible that
they can be in the Jermaine O'Neal chase, using Moiso and two other
first-rounders as bait. If they are, they'll likely wait until
August, when O'Neal is somewhat easier to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be very active,'' Pitino promised. ``We're
trying to get more athletic. We've got to go out there and get the
parts to make our team better.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams are given the month of July to court the free agents, but
cannot sign them (ha-ha) until Aug. 1. The Celtics aren't in a
position to chase any big free agents, but because the field is
level for most everyone else, they can compete, money-wise, for
most of them.
</P>
<P>
   So while Orlando and Chicago are making their pitches for Tim
Duncan, Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady, and Eddie Jones, the Celtics can
turn their attention to more realistic possibilities. While they
surely have others in mind, here are some players who might make
sense, understanding they can only get one unless they make a
trade:
</P>
<P>
   --Adonal Foyle, Golden State: He is still developing as an
interior player and has found it hard to get decent minutes on a
bad Golden State team. Normally, that would not be a good sign. But
he has size (6 feet 10 inches) and holds the NCAA Division 1 record
for blocked shots (OK, he did it Colgate, but he still blocked
them) and that is a huge Boston need. The Warriors say they want to
re-sign him and can offer him more than anyone else. They may
actually mean what they say now that they have dealt the
disappointing Jason Caffey.
</P>
<P>
   --Derek Anderson, LA Clippers: Pitino needs no introduction to
this guy and vice versa. They were both at Kentucky _ Anderson
transferred there from Ohio State. He is a big guard who can play
both backcourt positions and he knows the Pitino style. But he's
looking for big money and it may be unrealistic to think he'd
settle for the veteran's exception. But he also may have no choice
unless the Clips work a sign and trade.
</P>
<P>
   --Tariq Abdul-Wahad, Denver: He is reported to be involved in a
sign and trade with the Clippers and Anderson, which has been
rumored all spring. He is a big, defensive guard who is used to
being the fourth or fifth option. Unless there is a sign-and-trade
deal, he is not going to command a lot of dough. He can score as
well.
</P>
<P>
   --Tony Delk, Sacramento: Another player whom Pitino knows well
from Kentucky, but there is some bad blood here in that Delk feels
he was jerked around last summer by the Celtics before signing with
the Kings. He doesn't have the size Pitino might want, but he knows
the drill.
</P>
<P>
   --Antonio Daniels, San Antonio: He's Tim Duncan's best friend,
so he may end up where Duncan goes. At 6-4, he does have the size
Pitino wants and he started to come around last season after two
uninspiring seasons in Vancouver and San Antonio. His best move
financially would be to re-up with the Spurs, but if Duncan goes .
. .
</P>
<P>
   --Anthony Carter, Miami: He'll probably stay where he is, but
the Heat can afford to pay him only so much. But he was a pleasant
surprise this past season for Miami and showed he can play with the
big boys.
</P>
<P>
   --Brad Miller, Charlotte: He's a restricted free agent and at
least he wouldn't abuse the Celtics four times a year.
</P>
<P>
   --Danny Fortson: He covers none of the bases _ he doesn't block
shots, he's not a scoring wing man or a point guard. The Celtics
basically have written him off as unsignable, but he could be that
player who'll have to take less. It's unlikely he'd return to
Boston because he wants to play.
</P>
<P>
   --Ron Mercer, Orlando: Only kidding. But he is a wing man who
can score. Then we wouldn't have to ask anymore whom the Celtics
got when they traded him.

`PERFECT STORM' IS NO MERE DISASTER FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE PERFECT STORM 
Directed by: Wolfgang Petersen 
Screenplay by: Bill Wittliff (based on Sebastian Junger's book) 
Starring: George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane, Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio, John C. Reilly, William Fichtner, Karen Allen, Allen
Payne, Bob Gunton, John Hawkes, John Hopkins, Dash Mihok, Cherry
Jones, Janet Wright, Rusty Schwimmer 
Running time: 130 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (language and scenes of peril) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' is the working-class ``Titanic'' _ and
then some. It's the only summer movie with any real ambition, and
it's a standout. ``Titanic'' was a case of a cheeseball story
riding terrific effects. ``The Perfect Storm'' is in every
important way deeper. That spectacular monster wave you've been
seeing in the ads is as much a star as George Clooney or Mark
Wahlberg. So is the awesome mass of undulating water under it. The
power in that huge, wild, moving trench of ocean is as humbling and
elemental as anything any computer keyboard has yet splashed across
a movie screen. Yet those pelting, punishing elements are not the
main event. ``The Perfect Storm'' is much more than a seagoing
``Twister.'' Anchored in a real world as few Hollywood films are,
its strength lies in its respectful yet unesentimentalized
depiction of the working lives of six Gloucester fishermen who had
the bad luck to be where three storms converged in the North
Atlantic in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly, the film establishes the human dimension of the story
immediately when a camera pans down a list of names painted on a
church wall, and we realize that this isn't the usual tribute to
war dead. The names are of fishermen who died at sea, on the job,
over the years. The sober dignity of that scene becomes the
signature key for the entire film. Not one of the six who go out
aboard the Andrea Gail late in the season on a last swordfish run
is given to romanticizing the job. They've been around long enough
to be aware of the risks. There are things they take pleasure in on
the open sea _ leaving their problems on land, the macho
self-satisfaction of testing themselves against the elements. But
they know the sea can be tricky and treacherous and can at any
moment swallow them.
</P>
<P>
   There's one big reason they're out there facing the gruelling,
dangerous work of fishing. Their last catch was disappointingly
light, and they're paid in proportion to what they bring home. They
all need the money, they can't make as much on land, and so they
turn around and go back out. A few smaller reasons, too. One is
macho pride. Clooney's captain, Billy Tyne, is needled by the
boat's owner, who observes that a woman captain (Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio's Linda Greenlaw, a model of sane, compassionate
competence) outfished him last time out. Tyne is no Captain Ahab,
but he pushes farther out to sea than usual to make sure they come
home with a hold full of fish. They decide to try and plow through
the storm rather than wait it out because they can't be sure the
fish, although iced in the hold, will remain fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The film puts us in the thick of it with them. The heroics are
refreshingly un-Hollywood _ trying to fix an antenna in a storm,
trying to cover windows with plywood, trying to cut loose a
flailing chain with a blowtorch in a tempest. (As heroic
counterpoint, the film includes a riveting helicopter rescue of
three storm-tossed sailboat crew members.) On the Andrea Gail, talk
is minimal, nerves are frayed, and the men are so exhausted when
they aren't working that they simply sink into their bunks for as
long as they're able. The film's source, Sebastian Junger's
bestseller, is superior journalism. Both spell out the grim fact
that once their radio stops working, the fishermen not only are
plunged into the storm _ they're plunged back into the 19th
century. You not only feel the storm breaking around them _ you
feel how alone they suddenly are.
</P>
<P>
   Junger's book deals in fact. When it extrapolates, it's never
fanciful. But since the book doesn't attempt to describe what the
men on the Andrea Gail said and did after radio contact was lost,
the film had to imagine it. The guessing follows stringent,
fact-based guidelines, but sometimes the made-up parts feel
made-up. They're most plausible in the acting out of details that
add up to a texture and a rhythm of the working life at sea. A few
of the incidents _ a shark landing on the boat and biting one of
them, a man overboard _ happened on other fishing runs. What Junger
captured on the page, the film conveys as felt knowledge, right
down to the rising anxieties in port as the men prepare to go out
again into what everybody knows is a big question mark. Everybody _
those putting out to sea, those staying behind _ looks
heartbreakingly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney's captain Billy Tyne and Wahlberg's Bobby Shatford are
the stars of the film, but not in the usual Hollyowod sense. They
are first among equals in what has to be an ensemble effort to
succeed, and is. John C. Reilly's Murphy projects a bearlike
stoicism, William Fichtner's Sullivan is prickly but fiercely
loyal, John Hawkes's Malone is the lovable runt, and Allen Payne is
the steady Pierre. Diane Lane superbly inscribes the complex play
of feelings as Bobby's fiancee, Chris Cotter. These range from
physical hunger to anger that he's leaving her so soon again, to
poignant hope centered on the fresh start that their planned life
together means to each of them. Janet Wright's Ethel Shatford says
all she has to say with her wise, sad, experienced eyes, those of a
mother of seafaring men and bartender at their hangout, the Crow's
Nest, veteran of a lifetime watching young and old salts come and
go (the real Ethel Shatford died last October).
</P>
<P>
   Tyne represents a step forward for Clooney, who suppresses his
usual playfulness to give us a grizzled, complex man accustomed to
keeping most of what he's feeling inside himself. Wahlberg
continues to grow and deepen as an actor, bringing to the role of
Bobby Shatford exceptional empathy and authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the great mysteries of Hollywood that while most of
its players come from working-class backgrounds, they seem stricken
by amnesia once they're in the movies. Films of the '30s featured
believably gritty working-class textures routinely. Current
Hollywood films have a higher success rate at portraying life in
Tibet than ordinary blue-collar American life. ``The Perfect
Storm'' is one of the few exceptions. It isn't perfect. Some of its
construction is merely functional. But there's an obvious
involvement and commitment to doing justice to the fishermen's
lives that mark ``The Perfect Storm'' as more than just a
waterlogged acting gig. It has a weight of conviction behind it
that makes all the difference. It matters because the characters
mattered to the people making the film.

WYNONNA'S NEW ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The music business doesn't know what to make of Wynonna _ and
she knows it. She's too rock for country radio, too country for
rock, too upfront in her opinions, too unpredictable, too
dangerous. So after she ends her current rock-edged ``Big Attitude
Tour,'' which follows her more sentimental country reunion with the
Judds, she is going home to take stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to be a mom and a farm girl for a while,''
says Wynonna, a single mother with two children, Elijah, 5, and
Grace, 4. ``And then I'm going to reinvent myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might say that Wynonna has already reinvented herself. Her
latest album, ``New Day Dawning,'' has everything from pop ballads
to covers of songs by Joni Mitchell (``Help Me'') and the Fabulous
Thunderbirds (``Tuff Enuff''). But this time, she's talking about
radical reinvention, having become ``disheartened by what's going
on in music right now.''
</P>
<P>
   She's at a crossroads. She might do a gospel album next (``I've
always threatened to do it, but maybe I'll really do it this
time'') or a hard-rocking country album of the sort she made when
first going solo after the Judds's breakup in the early '90s, or
maybe a straight blues record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've confused the country audience so much,'' she admits,
while also realizing that the reviews of her latest album have been
``mixed.'' The album is, to be honest, more of a pop record _ at a
time when she has rekindled her country side in the Judds _ so it's
no wonder that many people, from fans to radio programmers, are
puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bitter, but I am hearing people in this business say,
`We love Wynonna, but we don't know what to do with her.' So why
not pull out for a minute?''
</P>
<P>
   Her minute will actually last six months, starting in August.
That's after her solo dates and after the Judds (meaning Wynonna
and her mom, Naomi), play another 10 shows around the country,
though none near Boston. (They played in Hartford in March and it
was a crowd-pleasing, spiritually uplifting affair.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Judds' tour has been like getting on a train going 100
miles per hour,'' she says. ``It's been an incredible ride _ bigger
and better in some ways than I expected, but at the same time, I'd
look at Mom and say, `This is like a weird movie.' We'd sing at
soundcheck and watch my kids run around and marvel at how weird it
all was. A lot of critics came to the shows with the attitude of
`Aw, another reunion. This is going to be gooey, gooey.' But, you
know, we haven't gotten one bad review. The audiences have been
right there for us. It's been great.''
</P>
<P>
   As for another Judds reunion in the future, she says, ``The only
answer is absolutely maybe. . . . But after this tour, Mom and I
have to separate again for the sake of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now, I want to do something completely different
musically. I want to be a backup singer for Tina Turner,'' Wynonna
says, half-joking. ``Or maybe a Joan Jett wannabe,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of sick of me. Maybe I want to put on a blond wig and
pretend I'm one of the Go-Go's,'' she says, laughing hard into the
phone from her home outside Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Other, more realistic options include collaborating with Sting,
who has invited her to work with him at his castle studio in
Europe. Another possibility is furthering her acquaintance with
James Taylor and Elton John _ both of whom she met at the televised
Joni Mitchell tribute concert in New York earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was touched by the whole event,'' she says of the tribute.
``I got to meet James Taylor and hang out with Elton John and Joni
embraced me. I cried the whole day. And, you know, I want to get
together more with people like James Taylor. I also told Elton that
I wanted to hang out with him for a weekend at his place in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may also want to be a student again and may take piano
lessons. But right now, I just want to stop the bus and get off and
do some laundry,'' she says. ``I've been rocking on the road for so
long. I'm ready for a sabbatical.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynonna, who has also been working through the pains of her
divorce last year, plans to sell her farm (``I've been there 13
years, so there's a lot of closure'') and build a new one on a hill
overlooking the homes of her mother and sister, Ashley, the movie
actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be on top of the hill, so I can spy on them,''
Wynonna says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   And here's another option: Wynonna has been offered a part in a
future movie that Ashley is making. She sidesteps the details, but
sounds very interested. As for Ashley herself, Wynonna says, ``I
adore her. I wish I could merge with her.''
</P>
<P>
   During the sabbatical, Wynonna likewise hopes to lose weight
``and get back to my original weight: 8 pounds, 6 ounces.''
</P>
<P>
   Her interview shtick must come to an end, however, because
Wynonna will soon leave to go sit in with Phish, the Vermont jam
band that is performing in Nashville that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting ready to rent a limo and see Phish and sing `Free
Bird' with them,'' she says, quite seriously this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just on a rock 'n' roll high these days.''

 HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL FINALLY WARMS TO THE WEB  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was ever a sign that the Internet has gone
establishment, this may be it.
</P>
<P>
   After keeping a cautious distance from Web-based ventures for
years, Harvard Medical School is negotiating with an undisclosed
company to offer its 180 continuing education courses for doctors
online within a year.
</P>
<P>
   While Harvard's continuing medical education program is the
largest in the world _ 40,000 doctors and other health care
professionals travel to the classes each year _ the university is
starting to acknowledge the potential threat from online
competitors. And with the number of physicians at Harvard teaching
hospitals moonlighting for health care dot-coms growing rapidly,
Harvard's legendary medical complex is warming up to the Web in
other ways too.
</P>
<P>
   Just two recent examples: Harvard-affiliate Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, where doctors began writing for the
consumer site CBS HealthWatch last year, will start recruiting
residents for the after-hours job in July. The medical school is
also finalizing an agreement to run Aetna US Healthcare's consumer
site, InteliHealth.
</P>
<P>
   Even though health care sites have struggled to make money and
even survive, companies are pursuing Harvard because they believe
the name will bring credibility and eventually dollars. And Harvard
is responding.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have come 180-degrees on this subject,'' said Dr. David
McDermott, a Beth Israel physician who helped launch one of the
first Internet consulting programs at the hospital a year ago.
``The same people who were putting up roadblocks are now saying
`Why didn't we do this sooner?' ''
</P>
<P>
   While medical schools like Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore
_ which ran Intelihealth for five years _ and research hospitals
like the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota have become household names
through their Web sites and contracts with online companies,
Harvard, ever the skeptical traditionalist, has kept its distance
from the wired world.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Goldfinger, medical school dean for continuing
education, said that the Harvard name alone has been so successful
at attracting doctors and patients that there's been an
unwillingness to risk the university's reputation by linking with
dot-coms, many of which are laden with advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also a realization, especially as teaching hospitals
struggle with record operating losses, that successful marketing
increasingly requires an Internet presence. At Harvard, influential
faculty like Dr. Anthony Komaroff, editor in chief of Harvard
Health Publications, also have pushed to loosen attitudes _ and
with the change has come new questions about the proper role for
Harvard's esteemed doctors.
</P>
<P>
   How much time should they devote to Internet ventures? Should
the Harvard name appear alongside drug ads? Are they helping
consumers hungry for medical information _ or just adding to the
confusion?
</P>
<P>
   Answers Dr. Leon Eisenberg, 77, the Maude and Lillian Presley
professor emeritus of social medicine, and an Internet skeptic:
Very little; no; and adding to the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to believe that the driving force is to educate the
public or physicians,'' he said. ``But the driving force is to
collect income as fast as possible. And the lure of the Internet is
almost irresistible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, Eisenberg said he's received four or
five e-mails from Internet health care companies that provide
second opinions offering him $1,000 for 10 minutes of work. ``I
find it all so distasteful I never even answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of Harvard doctors argue that such ventures
help consumers and patients _ as long as they're structured
carefully and physicians stick to providing general educational
information and not personal advice.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,500 medical school faculty members cannot spend more than
20 percent of their time working as outside consultants and a new
policy under consideration would prevent all Harvard faculty from
teaching for competing educational institutions _ actual or virtual
_ without permission.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the medical school is not aware of any doctors who've
run afoul of the 20 percent rule, said spokesman Don Gibbons.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University associate provost Dennis Thompson said that
the new policy means doctors will need permission before they can
teach online.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson said it's unclear whether physicians will be
allowed free rein to consult for online second opinion and consumer
education sites. And as Harvard takes over the Aetna site,
competing with physicians' other consumer-directed ventures, that
could become a thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not exactly the same as competing with Harvard in its
traditional educational role,'' Thompson said. ``Those sites seem
to me more like publishing or writing, getting your ideas out to a
wider public, which is something faculty members have always done.
But could a Harvard faculty member go work for baby Aetna? The dean
would want to go look at that. This is unchartered territory and it
hasn't been decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said there's been a lot of debate about whether it's a
good idea for the medical school to partner with the for-profit
Aetna site, but that it was ultimately decided ``that the
protections are good enough and there are financial awards that can
be used for the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Komaroff, one of the faculty members who is overseeing the Aetna
project, would not discuss the details.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Delbanco, chief of the division of general medicine
and primary care at Beth Israel Deaconess in Boston, said that 15
to 20 doctors who moonlight for CBS HealthWatch try to answer more
than 5,000 questions from consumers annually and review more than
3,000 educational pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been churning out more and more work,'' he said. ``But
there's a difference between practicing medicine over the Internet
and providing education. So we're very careful and we use very
carefully crafted language. And we clearly say that we don't
endorse any drugs or products that Medscape (the CBS HealthWatch
sponsor) is trying to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Medscape is not allowed to say it is working with Harvard
Medical School. But Delbanco can _ and does _ list his title on the
site: professor of medicine, Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Delbanco said he has no equity in the company, but he would not
say how much doctors are paid for their consulting time _ although
if other online health sites are an indication, doctors should not
quit their day jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Onhealth.com pays Beth Israel Deaconess $100,000 a year for the
content that the hospital's doctors provide, but the physicians
receive just 10 percent of that _ which works out to about $100 per
500- to 1,000-word article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many answers are reassurances or just advice to go see your
doctor,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Partners HealthCare Telemedicine, which uses Harvard doctors to
provide second opinions to doctors around the world, pays doctors
$200 to $250 for an opinion, which the program director said is
significantly better than most Web sites. Four-hundred doctors
provide 600 second opinions a year.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a new contract with American Life Insurance Co.,
volume is expected to double this year, and Partners likely will
have to establish quidelines so doctors don't neglect their primary
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Income is a small factor but for most people it's not going to
amount to a major amount of money,'' said Dr. Lowell Schnipper at
Beth Israel, who recently turned down a consulting offer from
Oncology.com because he works for a competing CD-ROM venture,
Oncologyuptodate. ``The biggest reason is visibility. Harvard
sometimes can be very conservative and maybe we're a little late on
the draw. But there is now a desire to raise the flag if it's done
in a responsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Goldfinger is struggling with.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that the continuing education program needs $25
million in the first five years to update technology and marketing.
If it's done right, the hope is that the program will draw several
thousand doctors and that revenues could go for scholarships and
research.
</P>
<P>
   But they have to convince advertisers that it's worth their
while if they get sponsorship credit on the Harvard site, much like
on public radio stations, but are not allowed to specifically
advertise products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a no-brainer to put a Harvard module on headaches
up there sponsored by (pain medication) commercials,'' he said.
``That can't happen. We have to make this solvent without heavy
commercialization.''

IF YOU THINK THE MCAS HISTORY TEST IS RELEVANT, TRY THIS EXAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For my annual alternative to the Fourth of July column, get out
your No. 2 pencils again. Recently I published questions from the
MCAS 10th-grade history test, criticizing them as being grossly
Eurocentric and of questionable relevance for today's job seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many readers saw nothing wrong with the questions.
One wrote that surgeons, construction workers, and software
designers may not need to know about the Edict of Nantes or the
Treaty of Tordesillas at work, but added that such events ``are not
trivia _ they are part of the framework within which we try to
evaluate our own nation's attempts to shape the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us be nice and assume the reader is correct. But if you are
going to be correct about how our own nation shaped itself, you
have to have other questions that are not on the MCAS tests:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1.According to Goree Island's slave museum, the number of stolen
Africans is the equivalent of emptying out the current metropolitan
areas of: (a) Milwaukee; (b) Tokyo; (c) Los Angeles; (d) New York,
Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, San Francisco, and Philadelphia
combined.
</P>
<P>
   2. According to most histories, the number of stolen Africans
who actually made it alive to the Americas is the equivalent of:
(a) New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, San Francisco and
Philadelphia combined; (b) New York, Los Angeles and Chicago
combined; (c) Los Angeles and Chicago combined; (d) just San
Francisco and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   3. The conservative value of slave labor to the American
economy, when it was analyzed in 1983, is nearly the equivalent of
the 1999 spending budget for: (a) Wisconsin; (b) The Rolling Stones
Tour (c) The New York Yankees; (d) The United States.
</P>
<P>
   4. The high estimate of the value of slave labor to the American
economy is two and a half times that of the 1999 budget for: (a)
France; (b) Japan; (c) The New York Yankees; (d) The United States.
</P>
<P>
   5. The World War II generation will bequeath $8 trillion to its
children. In the years 1929 to 1969, wages lost by
African-Americans to discrimination were: (a) nothing, because we
are now a color-blind society; (b) $1.6 billion; (c) irrelevant
because Michael Jordan owns part of the Washington Wizards and
Magic Johnson owns part of the Los Angeles Lakers; (d) $1.6
trillion, nearly equal to 1999 federal budget of $1.7 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   6. One of result of postslavery discrimination is that the
average white baby boomer and the average black baby boomer will
respectively inherit: (a) $50,000 and $42,000; (b) $80,000 and
$50,000; (c) $20,000 and $15,000; (d) $65,000 and $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   7. The term ``40 Acres and a Mule'' traces its roots to: (a)
Spike Lee movies; (b) an overly optimistic Mississippi racetrack
owner; (c) Thomas Jefferson's heartfelt wish to free the slaves;
(d) General Sherman's Field Order 15.
</P>
<P>
   8. Under ``40 acres and a Mule,'' about 40,000 newly freed
slaves were given Southern coastal land that had been abandoned by
unpardoned Confederate families. These black people held the land
for two years before angry white people stole it through beatings,
torture, and legal chicanery. During those two years, the black
occupants were known for: (a) being lazy and shiftless; (b) being
top local athletes; (c) wanting back the good old days, where you
could depend on a bowl of gruel and a watermelon from massa; (d)
fine crops and self-governance.
</P>
<P>
   8. New England is far from cotton fields and sugar plantations.
Thus it is interesting that Brown University: (a) created a chair
in honor of abolitionist John Brown; (b) named its music department
after James Brown; (c) named its graduate school of business after
Ron Brown; (d) was founded by the Browns of Rhode Island, who
profited from the triangular slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   9. The largest taxpayer in the colony of Rhode Island in 1775
made his money through: (a) whaling; (b) online trading; (c)
cranberries; (d) slave trading.
</P>
<P>
   10. New England's exports to the West Indies in 1772 amounted
to: (a) very little because New Englanders were appalled by slave
sugar plantations; (b) very little because Federal Express did not
exist yet; (c) very little because of an explosion of free trade
with England; (d) two-thirds of New England's exports.
</P>
<P>
   11. In Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1835, politicians, law
enforcement, lawyers, doctors and shopkeepers signed petitions to:
(a) call for the end of slavery; (b) volunteer to go south for a
Freedom Summer to understand the plight of the slaves; (c) build a
new Fenway Park for the Red Sox; (d) oppose abolition because the
textile mills depended on slave-picked cotton.
</P>
<P>
   12. African-Americans fought in every US war, hoping their
participation would result in equality. After the Civil War, World
War I, and World War II, black sacrifice for America and the world
was rewarded with: (a) full voting rights; (b) free tickets to Jack
Johnson and Joe Louis fights; (c) free coupons for watermelon; (d)
lynchings and white race riots.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the answer is (d) on all questions.

ANALYSTS SAY PRI AUTOMATION LEADS IN RACE TO THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An investment in any technology stock is a bet on the future. An
investment in PRI Automation is a bet on the future of
semiconductor manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   A number of analysts and money managers think PRI is a good bet
for investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Billerica, Mass. company makes systems and software that
automate the production of semiconductors. Chipmaking is already a
complicated business. A silicon wafer on which chips are made
travels eight to 10 miles throughout the factory over the course of
a 30- to 45-day production cycle. During that time it may undergo
as many as 400 to 500 individual processes.
</P>
<P>
   Think Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and you have some
idea of how convoluted and futuristic the whole enterprise is. We
don't know what a chocolate factory costs, but a semiconductor
factory is expensive. A brand new fab, a chip factory, can cost
more than $1.5 billion. And human mistakes in production, even
small ones, can be very costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You drop one tray and it can mean the loss of hundreds of
thousands of dollars,'' said Alan Loewenstein, manager of the John
Hancock Technology fund.
</P>
<P>
   That's where PRI comes in. Its equipment reduces the human
element in chipmaking by automating more of the operation. In the
not so distant future, that human element may shrink still further.
</P>
<P>
   The chip industry stands on the brink of a major generational
shift. Currently, chips are made on 200 millimeter wafers. In the
new wave of factories, they will be made on 300 millimeter wafers.
The current generation of fabs requires $10 million to $15 million
worth of automation equipment; in the next generation that
requirement could jump to $50 million to $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 300 millimeter wafer represents the sizzle for PRI,'' said
David Smith, a money manager at Loomis Sayles and a PRI fan.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and others say that PRI is the clear leader in the race to
the future. They say its equipment is more sophisticated and
flexible than that produced by its Japanese competitors. In a
recent filing, PRI said it has been making major investments in 300
millimeter technology. In the quarter ended in April, PRI's
research and development expenses were $12.7 million or almost 17
percent of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for PRI, no one has yet ordered a full 300
millimeter fab, although several pilot projects are under way. ``It
is a question of when, not if,'' said Tia-min Pang, an analyst with
SG Cowen Securities Corp, who expects several of the new factories
to be under construction by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that in the hypercompetitive chip business, once a
few big players make the commitment to the new technology, the rest
of the pack will be obligated to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The chip business is notoriously cyclical. Booms give way to
busts overnight. But these days most analysts are bullish about the
industry's outlook for the next few years. Whereas in the past
demand was fueled mainly by sales of personal computers, today the
demand is coming from a raft of telecommunications and wireless
products. Should that strong demand materialize, PRI will be the
beneficiary, as orders come in from both new and older generation
fabs, say analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main risk to this company is a macro risk,'' said Fred
Wolf, an analyst with Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill. A slowdown in the
world economy or a US recession would hit PRI hard, according to
Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Like others in the chip industry, PRI's financial performance
has been erratic. The company earned significant profits in 1996
and 1997 and lost money in both 1998 and 1999 when the economic
downturn in Asia threw the whole chip business into recession.
</P>
<P>
   SG Cowen expects PRI to earn $1.13 a share this year and $2.20
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has also bounced around quite a bit. The
stock got as high as $87 a share in March just before the Nasdaq
Composite Index collapsed. It closed Thursday at $62.25. Since the
spring Wall Street has been edgy about the more speculative
technology companies. Given the uncertainty surrounding the
introduction of the 300 millimeter fab, PRI may be the target of
some of that skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's backers, while conceding the risks, say they
still like the stock. Said David Smith of Loomis Sayles: ``The next
generation fab will happen and at that point no one will want to be
behind the curve.''

SWEET DREAMS OF THE OPEN ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. _ I am sitting in a corner booth in a cheap
knock-off of Denny's on the outskirts of this famously quaint town,
trying to determine from my jumble of maps if Nebraska is beneath
the Dakotas or beside them.
</P>
<P>
   The kind waitress had guided me away from our first table with
the emotionless proclamation, ``Too many flies over here.'' She
answers my inquiry about scrapple by saying, ``Kind of like Spam,
only squishier.'' I decide to take a pass.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, I am free, alive, exhilarated. One day I'm in Boston,
listening to the incessant bickering over Fenway Park and the
bragging of twenty-something Internet CEOS who've made millions
from companies that will never make a dime. The next day I am on
the open road, leaving so much of life's clutter behind.
</P>
<P>
   The open road. I've packed a car with every polo shirt I own and
steered it west on the Massachusetts Turnpike. Destination:
Seattle. As I slip the bonds of Route 128, visions of Lewis and
Clark dance in my mind, and I am in harmony with so many courageous
adventurers who came before me. Well, actually I'm in a rented
convertible, but no need to bog down in details.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I pass Interstate 495, my navigator has made it
clear there's not a rest area in America she won't want or need to
visit. By the time I pass Hartford, I am overcome by hunger and
overwhelmed by exhaustion, and the warning of my skeptical editor
echoes in my mind: ``Two days out, you'll regret this.'' Two days
too generous, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   But no, absolutely not. There are experiences to be had, goals
to be realized, dreams to be fulfilled along this journey from sea
to shining sea.
</P>
<P>
   I want to pat the head of a Iowan hog, provided he's harnessed,
muzzled, and under the full control of several corn-fed farmhands.
I want to see if my Claritin can withstand amber waves of grain. I
want to ride a galloping stallion across a Wyoming ranch _ or at
least a heavily sedated pony at a country fair.
</P>
<P>
   None of that being quite enough, I want to cover myself in the
necessary bugsprays and lay in a Montana field looking up at the
biggest of starlit skies, stand arm in arm with an Ohio dairy
farmer praising the wholesome taste of milk with Nestle's Quick,
experience what John Steinbeck meant when he wrote, ``We do not
take a trip, a trip takes us.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, I want to see the majesty of this land and the beauty
of all its people. And the first such person I meet is a delightful
old woman named Gertie Gepfer.
</P>
<P>
   The hills are alive with the smell of chocolate, as I climb out
of my car on Cocoa Avenue and step inside the ancient manufacturing
plant where Gertie is waiting to rhapsodize about a lifetime
dedicated to the world's most wonderful brand of candy.
</P>
<P>
   She has the requisite gray netting in her hair, a long navy blue
lab coat covering her flowered skirt, and a faux leather Hershey
satchel where she carries a pen-knife and various other tools of
her trade. Big, owlish eyeglasses dominate her soft face.
</P>
<P>
   She operates a pair of Kiss wrapping machines that take the
famous chocolate drops and cover them, twelve at a time, with a
twist of silver foil and a white Hershey flag, then send them on
their way. She's done this for 52 years, overseeing hundreds of
millions of Kisses rolling across machines that haven't changed
since 1921. And this fall, at 83 years old, she has decided she
will retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've worked long enough,'' she says with that
grandmotherly smile of hers, though a few minutes later, she adds,
``I'll probably sit around and wish I hadn't left.''
</P>
<P>
   She is persistent and durable _ uniquely, exquisitely American.
Her mother worked at Hershey in this most benevolent of company
towns, as did her husband back before he died, and all four of her
children at some point in their lives. Several grandchildren work
at the plant now. Gertie lives five blocks away, and has wandered
as far as na with the Hershey travel club, but still loves her
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful town, and they keep everything so
wonderful,'' she says. ``I don't plan to go anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask Gertie what her favorite candy is, and she smiles again
and says, ``Kisses.''
</P>
<P>
   Back outside, I breathe in the chocolately air that would still
make Milton Hershey proud, unwrap a Symphony Bar and point my car
west. The road is long and sweet before us.

BRAKETTES ARE DRIVEN TO SUCCEED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   STRATFORD, Conn. _ People don't come to this town of 48,000 on
the Houstanic River to see tall buildings, visit museums, or watch
a Major League game.
</P>
<P>
   They come here to play softball.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer since 1947, the town has fielded the Brakettes, who
have won 23 national championships and three world championships,
and have virtually become the farm team for the US Olympic squad.
</P>
<P>
   A doubleheader against Team USA, for instance, is nothing less
than a reunion. There are four former Brakettes on the US squad,
one (Danielle Henderson of the University of Massachusetts) is
still on the roster, and Olympic coach Ralph Raymond guided the
Brakettes for 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Kris MacLean, who has been a Brakette for five years,
lives in Brockton, Mass., and plays every weekend. She said friends
shake their heads when they hear about her more than three-hour
commute.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Oh, you travel so far just to play softball,' ''
she said. ``But it's not just softball, it's the best softball in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The team has been part of the fabric of this community since the
Raybestos brake company first sponsored it 53 years ago. That was
when 9-year-old John Stratton started working as a bat boy. He
eventually met and married Brakette catcher Micki Machietto and in
1971 joined the organization, which went on to win eight straight
national titles.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baird, the athletic director at Stratford High, has been
general manager and first base coach for the past 13 years. Patty
Patuski, the town's superintendent of recreation, was a bat girl
for the team and played for the Brakettes.
</P>
<P>
   So if you know Stratford, you likely know the Brakettes.
</P>
<P>
   Stratton has retired from his job as physical education teacher
in the New Canaan school system, but it seems unthinkable he'll
ever retire from softball.
</P>
<P>
   Every winter he goes to Florida, where he works as a pitching
coach and is an assistant in the athletic department at Florida
Atlantic University. His boss? Joan Joyce, the All-American former
Brakette pitcher. Her batterymate was Stratton's wife, Micki, and
both have been inducted into the softball Hall of Fame in Oklahoma
City.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges the almost familylike image of the team. ``Yeah,
it's like we're in a rut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Stratton and Baird sat in the press box above the DeLuca
Field on Main Street where the Brakettes play, they reminisced as
they thumbed through black-and-white photos of former players such
as Donna Lopiano, now director of the Women's Sports Foundation,
Hall of Famers Donna Schumaker, Bertha Tickey, and, of course,
Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Both men seem to have Brakettes events emblazoned in their minds
as they rattled off what year the team lost the world championship
(it came in second to Australia in 1965), and when it beat Japan
for the world title in 1964. Or when it won three straight national
titles, from 1958-60, all in Stratford.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting and tryouts seem just as free-floating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had only one preseason practice and it got rained out this
year,'' Baird said with a laugh and a shrug. As for recruiting,
well, there's nothing official.
</P>
<P>
   Stratton said the team has a Web site (``but it's broken now''),
and he has no e-mail address. Still, he receives about 30 letters
or videotapes a year from young women, saying, ``I want to be a
Brakette.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly he relies on his extensive network of former
players-turned-college coaches to hear about talent, and goes to
college tournaments to see for himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's worked.
</P>
<P>
   He has led the Brakettes to a 179-29 record in four seasons as
field manager, and is 13-1 this year. He took over twice before,
most notably in 1976 when Raymond suffered a heart attack. Stratton
was left with just two Brakettes in April after the rest had bolted
to join the now-defunct professional league that Joyce, Jane
Blalock, and Bille Jean King had formed. He led the team to a
national title.
</P>
<P>
   Raybestos ran the team until 1985, when the company moved to
Indiana, and D'Addario Industries in Bridgeport took over. Then
Raybestos Products reacquired the team from 1990-95, until it
dropped its affiliation but let the longstanding name remain.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the team got an infusion from Bob Wirz of Milford
and David Carpenter of Westport.
</P>
<P>
   Wirz, who used to work for the Kansas City Royals and the
commissioner of Major League Baseball, now runs Wirz Associates
sports marketing firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived in Connecticut 25 years, and I'd known of the
Brakettes for years, so when I learned they were in need of
sponsorship, I went to David, and said, `What do you think?' ''
Wirz said.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, president of Horsehead Industries, one of the
country's largest privately held manufacturing companies, agreed
and is now chairman of the Brakettes.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Wirz said, the Hartford Whalers of the National
Hockey League were also looking to be saved. ``But they didn't have
history on their side, and we really thought of the Brakettes as
Connecticut's hidden jewel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As amateurs, the players don't get paid a salary, but the
estimated $50,000-$75,000 cost of sponsorship goes toward travel
and housing expenses, plus equipment, and rental of the field. He
said part of his challenge is to bring back the draw of the team.
``They used to play for thousands, and we think we can bring it
back to that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the team only drew about 600 fans on a recent weekend,
Patuski of the recreation department expected the Team USA game to
be a sellout at the 2,700-seat ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, the former Brakette coach who's on his second stint
coaching the Olympic team, said he knows well the strength of the
Stratford team that he guided to a 1,992-162 record with 17
national championships. He also knows it can be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond of Worcester, Mass., recalled that in 1965 he took his
Cochuite Motors softball team to play the Brakettes in the Fourth
of July tournament. Being prematurely confident of themselves, the
Brakettes had engraved their names on the winning trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond's team won, they had to stay up all night waiting for
the new trophies, and the next day the president of Raybestos asked
Raymond to take over the team.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he said, the women who played all hoped to be in
the Olympics, but it would take two decades before that would
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was chosen as US coach in 1994, he hasn't looked back,
and doesn't plan to this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I retired from the Brakettes in '94, and it isn't that I don't
care, but I have severed all relations,'' said Raymond, 76. ``I
traveled for 26 years from Worcester to Stratford, and that was
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brakettes insist they won't be intimidated by Team USA.
Nicole Terpstra of Highland, Ind., who just joined the Brakettes
this year, actually benefited from the addition of Brakettes to
Team USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to go to Italy to play, where they have a lot of
pro teams, but John saw me throw and said they needed another
pitcher since Danielle (Henderson) was on the Olympic team,'' said
Terpstra, who has a 7-0 record with a 0.27 ERA as well as one home
run and a .250 average.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Thursday night's game at Sacred Heart, outfielder
Kellie Wilkerson of Mississippi State leads the team with a .633
average and 19 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true Brakette, Terpstra said, ``I'm excited to
play them. I'm not intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as long as there are no trophies to be engraved.

NBC BANKING ON NASCAR, SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, NBC Sports was on the rocks. The once
proud peacock sustained low ratings for the World Series and NBA
Finals. Those performances followed a questionable decision by the
General Electric-owned network not to spend $4 billion for the
rights to NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the NFL was one thing, but the Olympic scandal in Salt
Lake City was a different matter that nearly had a disastrous
effect upon the network.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol lost his cool. He ranted about
the ``economic absurdity'' of carrying AFC games. He defended the
investigation into allegations of widespread corruption in the
bidding process for the 2002 Winter Olympics. He attacked John
Hancock Insurance Company president David D'Alessandro for
threatening to pull advertising from Olympic coverage if serious
steps were not taken to correct problems within the International
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Eberesol publicly ridiculed D'Alessandro. ``His continual
seeking of front-page publicity, for no other reason than to get
his name in the paper, is a tragedy,'' Ebersol told reporters last
year in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate angst appears to have subsided at NBC Sports. Ebersol
is back in the saddle. The network recently bought the rights to
NASCAR events and joined with old buddy Vince McMahon to start the
XFL, a new professional football league aimed at pro wrestling
fans. The near future is even brighter. In 88 days, the Summer
Olympics begin, and NBC, along with its sister cable stations MSNBC
and CNBC, will lair 441 hours of programming, three times the
amount of coverage in Atlanta. The network is carrying 162 1/2
hours of programming aimed at familes. ``This is my passion,''
Ebersol said. ``The Olympics are the single greatest reason that I
am still working.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol feels the Olympics are not just about winning and
losing, but about the process. About how an athlete, who may never
turn pro or receive a commercial endorsement, can sacrifice his or
her life for four years and have success hinge upon 10 seconds, or
a minute. ``It's about the sacrifice,'' said Ebersol.
</P>
<P>
   Its also about the story.
</P>
<P>
   Barring major news, every second of NBC's coverage will be
taped. Every hour will have about 18 commercials. About 85 hours
will air during prime time. There will lots of stories about
triumph and overcoming odds.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol prides himself on telling stories. Lisa Lax, the
award-winning producer, leads the profile department. The Brandeis
graduate says NBC already has 130 stories, only about a quarter are
on Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The signature piece is on Muhammad Ali, with Denzel Washington
doing the voice-over.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said not too long he expected to lose money on the
Sydney Games. NBC paid about $750 million for these Games as part
of a $3.5 billion package with the IOC to televise the Games up
until 2008. News about corruption makes adverstisers uneasy. ``We
thought we could lose between $50 million and $75 million,'' said
Ebersol.
</P>
<P>
   With ad sales expected to reach $900 million by Labor Day,
Ebersol now has a different take. He is expecting to turn a profit
of as much as $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the confidence stems from NBC's decision to air the
Games when most people would be watching.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the events will be over and the results known _
not to mention competition from the NFL and pennant races _ Ebersol
said he anticipates ratings of between 17.5 and 18.5, or about 18
million households. The Atlanta Games earned a 21.6 average ratings
and the Barcelona Games pulled a 17.1 rating. The Los Angeles Games
in 1984 earned a 23.2 rating, but that was before the dominance of
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Costas hosts the network coverage, with Jim Lampley on MSNBC
and Pat O'Brien on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card for NBC will be the performances by American
athletes. How will the Australian swim team perform against the
Americans? Will the US women's soccer team defend its gold medal?
</P>
<P>
   Coverage starts Sept. 11.

<P>
   BOSTON _ The Boston version of ``Do The Right Thing'' was staged
Thursday at Fenway Park and, indeed, Jimy Williams was the man who
did the right thing. In three years, the Red Sox manager will feel
good about his decision; in three months, he may be nauseated.
</P>
<P>
   Williams wanted an injured Pedro Martinez to go on the disabled
list before Thursday night's game at Fenway Park. Martinez didn't
want to do it. Eventually the pitcher was given something most
employees crave in late June: a two-week summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   So Jimy did the right thing, and that means this story will have
a happy ending. In 2002, Martinez will be pleased his manager
protected him from himself. He will see that, for the good of his
health, it is not wise to pitch with both a sore oblique muscle and
sore shoulder when there is half a season to be played.
</P>
<P>
   He had to go on the DL. If he hadn't, he would have continued to
perform hurt. He believes he is obligated to do that, partly
because he is not the only player in his clubhouse _ Jason Varitek
is another _ who plays hurt, and partly because he bristles when
his starts are taken away. That attitude began after Martinez left
the Dodgers, the team that was convinced he could never start
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, there will be a happy ending. There is no
guarantee, though, of a happy now. In the next two weeks, Williams
will have to do a managerial firewalk. He will have to drag his
team, which currently has a Yard Sale/Second Hand chic to it, to
the All-Star break in one piece. He will have to do this without
his best pitcher, who also happens to be his MVP, who also acts as
the bullpen's recharger, who also _ even while hurt _ is the team's
most consistent starter.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot to lose for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy did the right thing. Of course. But the question to many in
New England is this: Did the right thing come at the expense of a
possible World Series ring? The answer is no. Well, not in the way
some people imagine. The Sox beat the Orioles, 12-4, so there will
not be a ghastly losing streak. There will not be a nasty collapse.
But the way the American League is taking shape this year, the Sox
could fall dangerously behind even without a dramatic meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, Boston has to win the AL East if it wants to make the
playoffs. There will be no sneaking and tiptoeing through the side
entrance, also known as the wild-card entrance, for the third
consecutive season. The East will not have the wild-card team this
year. The Sox, then, need to play (and be general managed) like a
team that is trying to win the division.
</P>
<P>
   That was going to be difficult even with a healthy Martinez. It
was going to be difficult when the Sox, Yankees, and Blue Jays were
all in as-is mode. As constructed, those teams were triplets on a
chain gang, too close and too similar to escape each other. If one
were able to get a six-game lead on one of the others, that would
be considered a runaway. That used to be unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But on the same day Martinez went on the DL, the Yankees made a
trade with Cleveland. The Yankees traded for experienced lefthanded
power (David Justice) and gave up inexperience and potential (Ricky
Ledee, two prospects). The New Yorkers should have traded for a
starting pitcher first, but that's not the point; they'll get one.
The point is that they have struck first, giving notice that they
plan to do something to rise above the three-way cluster in the
East.
</P>
<P>
   And that means another character must be added to this tale. His
name is Dan Duquette. He must also do the right thing, even if it
seems impossible for him to do immediately. The Sox trade has to be
for a pitcher. There can be no Ohkas, Ericksons, Lees, or Kims at
this point. Duquette has to pry a No. 2 or 3 starter at a time when
most teams are in denial, still convincing themselves that they are
in a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   Another starter should have been a priority long before Martinez
went on the DL. The necessity should be tolerated because of the
mysterious injuries _ the tight-lipped Sox still haven't said what
they are _ and the Yankees' trade, which is probably the first of
two or three.
</P>
<P>
   As strange as it sounds, the first place Duquette should call is
Houston. The Astros are terrible, flatlining at 27-50 in the
National League Central. They are led by a starter who is 1-12.
Opponents nearly hit .330 against him, and he is part of a staff
that has an AL-like 5.36 ERA. His own ERA is a touchdown-plus:
7.10.
</P>
<P>
   But Jose Lima is exactly the type of starter the Sox need. He is
a 27-year-old righthander from the Dominican Republic who was 37-18
over the last two seasons before sinking this year. He plays on a
bad team that plays in a Coors-Field-in-Texas, homer-friendly,
gimmicky park. Since he is having such a bad season, he would come
cheap. And he would help.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette should call every team that is out of the race and make
offers for solid starters. He could ask Detroit about Brian
Moehler, Florida about Ryan Dempster (a dream trade, admittedly),
the Giants about Kirk Rueter and Shawn Estes, and Minnesota about
the now mythologized Brad Radke (5-9, 4.07 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   Expectations are abstract, so it would be hard to say if
Martinez injured himself by trying to do too much and thus
overreaching for near perfection. That's honorable. It also can be
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sox fall behind another three or four games in the next
two weeks, it would be a major step back in the East race. This
time, I'm not being facetious when I say that.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams did the right thing. Now it's Dan Duquette's turn.

&HT;     JUSTICE DEFENDS POSITION ON NEWSPAPER SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Justice Department has defended its approval
of Hearst Corp.'s proposed purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle
and turned down a federal judge's invitation to take part in an
antitrust case over the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Thursday to U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker, a
government antitrust lawyer said the deal was ``not likely to
lessen competition'' because Chronicle's rival daily and Hearst's
flagship newspaper, the San Francisco Examiner, would continue to
publish under new ownership.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Clint Reilly, an unsuccessful bidder for the
Examiner who sued to block the sale, said he disagreed with the
department's assessment but planned no formal reply and hoped the
judge would proceed directly to a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Hearst and for Ted Fang, the publisher of the
free-distribution Independent newspaper who has agreed to take over
the Examiner, were pleased with the letter and were awaiting a
final verdict from the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The letter should assure everyone that ``this matter was
thoroughly and professionally investigated by the department,''
said David Balabanian, a lawyer for Fang and his family-owned
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This letter and the record at trial supports the position
Hearst has taken,'' said Gary Halling, a lawyer for the New
York-based Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's $660 million purchase of the Chronicle was approved by
the Justice Department March 17 but blocked hours later by Walker,
who said Reilly had raised a legitimate concern that San Francisco
might become a one-newspaper city. Reilly contends that Hearst's
deal with Fang _ essentially giving the Examiner to the Independent
publisher along with a $66 million operating subsidy _ is
insufficient to keep the afternoon newspaper alive is designed to
leave Hearst with a local newspaper monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The trial ended May 31, but Walker issued an order June 9
inviting the Justice Department to consider becoming a party to the
suit or submitting a formal brief explaining its views. The judge
said the department apparently had raised serious questions about
the legality of the sale before approving it, and might have
reached a different conclusion if it had heard the evidence at
Reilly's trial.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from Antitrust Division attorney Mark J. Botti said
the Justice Department had been concerned at first about a
``possible monopoly'' but was satisfied by Hearst's agreement in
March to transfer the Examiner to Fang's company, ExInn LLC.
</P>
<P>
   The department concluded that Fang's company ``had the intent
and the capability to compete in the relevant market, albeit in a
form significantly different from the current Examiner,'' Botti
wrote. Fang has said he plans to concentrate on San Francisco news
and switch from afternoon to morning publication.

<P>
   Botti's letter reiterated the department's March 17 conclusion
but contained a few new disclosures:
</P>
<P>
   _ The department was not convinced by Hearst's initial claim
that no buyer could be found for the Examiner, and advised the
company that the newspaper's viability could be tested by offering
it for sale along with its share of a joint operating agreement
with the Chronicle. The JOA, in effect since 1965 and scheduled to
run through 2005, allows the two newspapers to share business
operations and split profits while maintaining separate editorial
operations.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Hearst declined to include the JOA in the deal and
instead added its printing plant to a previous offer of limited
Examiner assets, the department was still unwilling to accept
Hearst's claim that no buyer was available. With that issue
unresolved, Hearst abandoned its claim that the Examiner was a
``failing'' newspaper, which could be closed without violating
antitrust laws, and announced the agreement with Fang's company.
</P>
<P>
   _ The department, which questioned Fang extensively and visited
his plant, knows he plans to publish on a different scale than the
current Examiner but still considers him a competitor to the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   One argument in Reilly's lawsuit is that the transfer to Fang
would reduce competition between the newspapers in the metropolitan
area, which would have continued through 2005 under the JOA. Reilly
said the department had been misled into believing Fang's Examiner
would compete throughout the area.

FLY-FISHING IN A STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURG, N.H. _ Some baseball aficionados become annoyed by
the poets of the game. Guys like George Will and John Updike who
see baseball less as a sport than a metaphor for some cosmic
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Workaday sports journalists such as Roger Kahn and Eddie
Andleman resent the poets' claim to baseball's Truth and Essence.
``You keep track of the score and the standings,'' the poets seem
to say, ``while we continue to search for baseball's deeper
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Truth and Essence of baseball, point out the annoyed
journalists, go little deeper than ERAs and RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Within the universe of sportfishing, a similar dualism marks two
ends of a spectrum. On one end is the meat fisherman, who chums the
waters with bloody guts in order to take advantage of a fish's
feeding frenzy. He pulls up his catch roughly by the gills and
whacks it over the head to kill it before it bites him. War is
hell.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing is fishing, this guy would say. Don't matter what you do
to get them, long as it's legal. And what's the point of fishing in
the first place if you're not going to kill the fish and eat it?
</P>
<P>
   The other end . . . well, you know the other end. He is the fly
angler who plants himself waist high in a moving stream _ so as to
enter the universe of fish _ and contemplates the reality of trout
until he transcends to a higher plane of nature wherein he is
allowed to think like a salmonoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if I were a brookie, I would swim along that eddy and
feed in the pool under those riffles.''
</P>
<P>
   Little can offend this guy more than a box of nightcrawlers and
a spinning rod. He prefers catch-and-release stretches on streams
where the meat guys would be as much out of place as they would be
at a great books lecture in the Belchertown Library.
</P>
<P>
   So, the other day, I found myself standing midstream in the
Connecticut River, a few hundred yards from the outflow from First
Connecticut Lake, about 30 miles from the Canadian Border.
Fly-fishing. Contemplating.
</P>
<P>
   First, Second, and Third Connecticut Lakes, Lake Francis, and
the stream that links them is an astonishingly beautiful part of
New England, much like Vermont's Northeast Kingdom to the west.
</P>
<P>
   I was fishing with Wayne Ogden, who, as we talked about the leap
in interest in fly-fishing following the 1992 film, ``A River Runs
Through It,'' observed wryly: ``Two years later, all the gear they
bought ended up in a closet when they realized how hard the sport
is. How much you have to know and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one minute the brookies are feeding voraciously on the
surface on small caddis when a little rain drives them a few inches
down, requiring a bead head to drop the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden began fly-fishing as a child when he learned the sport
from his grandfather, and inherited some classic bamboo rods and
gear from his mentor. Standing in a rushing stream, thoroughly
focused on the surroundings, Ogden says it is the angler's
concentration level that so thoroughly removes him from his
workaday world.
</P>
<P>
   ``A morning out on the stream drops my blood pressure about 80
points,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Sullivan, guide and remarkable chef fom Tall Timber Lodge
on Back Lake, also questions the effect of the movie that featured
Brad Pitt as a the A.J. McClane fly-fishing protagonist. ``It makes
catching a trout some kind of competitive event,'' says Sullivan.
``But people who fly-fish know it's so much more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his essay, ``Song of the Angler,'' McClane complains about
``The chirping plague of analysts,'' who seek to invade the deepest
recesses of the angler's motives for fishing. It is beyond simple
analysis, McClane concludes. Whether one is a dry-fly purist or a
wet-nymph, downstream drifter, the angler is looking for that
hypnotic state.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that fly-fishing hypnosis is the cast, which unfurls
behind then loops in a figure-eight before it shoots forward into
the target area. Ted Williams could land a fly in a tin can, and
did so often at the old Boston Sportsman's Show _ a fact to
confound the baseball and fly-fishing poets at once.
</P>
<P>
   For three days we wandered the waters of upper New Hampshire,
from Clarksville where Murphy Dam spills out a pretty blue arc of a
stream, to the white water below First Connecticut Lake to the calm
waters of Back Lake. The mid-June fishing was only fair, with some
very low water flows. Brook trout were biting, but most of the best
fishing was taking place at the remote ponds, according to guide
Tim Savard, from the Lopstick Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon on the river, about a mile below First Connecticut
Lake, I ran across Ken Allard, who was fishing in a party with
Sullivan. Allard was sitting in the middle of a stream in a
wheelchair where he was casting his light Cahill and catching
brookie after brookie from a pool below some tumbling riffles.
</P>
<P>
   Allard was a bait fisherman most of his life in Manchester,
N.H., but 13 years ago he was injured in a motorcycle accident,
which put him in the hospital for a year, and in bed for another.
It was then he began reading about fly-fishing and, when he was
able, to start tying some fly patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was physically challenged,'' says Allard, ``and I wanted a
challenge, so I started fly-fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   His lifelong buddy, Jim Adams _ the two were Boy Scouts together
_ wheels Allard into the stream and back to his van, and the other
day he was in just the right spot to catch the most fish.
</P>
<P>
   Also fishing the Connecticut were father and son Lloyd and Paul
Clauson from Portsmouth, N.H. Lloyd is 86 and often beats his
50-year-old son in the size and number of fish they catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishing,'' says Paul, who works for the New Hampshire State
Liquor Commission, ``is a real bond between us. He is one awesome
dad. We go whenever we can, sometimes to the Isinglass River or
Winnepesaukee. But, once a year we come here. This is beautiful
fishing, something we live for.''

CIRCUS COMES TO TOWN: ROCKER'S BACK IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before the game, John Rocker stood at the podium in a
crowded, steamy interview room and said, ``I'm happy to be back in
New York, believe it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. It sounded like a whopper. Would Salman Rushdie be happy to
be back in Tehran? Would Art Modell like to move back to Cleveland?
Would Drew Bledsoe and Max Lane say they're happy to be back at the
Paradise Club?
</P>
<P>
   Rocker also said, ``I always seem to pitch well here.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he did. Capping one of the more bombastic media events of
this or any baseball season, Rocker pitched and pitched well in his
celebrated return to Shea Stadium, a 6-4 win for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   In a day full of fury, tension, reconciliation, and
anticipation, few expected Rocker would be able to make any
significant baseball contribution in a relatively important June
baseball game at sold-out Shea.
</P>
<P>
   But at 10 p.m., with Atlanta leading the streaking Mets by 2 in
the eighth, Rocker burst through the left-field bullpen door at
full Gump speed. It was what they'd all come to see.
</P>
<P>
   They stood. They booed. Slander. Libel. They used words you
never heard in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker went to work, retiring Robin Ventura (strikeout), Todd
Zeile, and Jay Payton (grounders) in succession to get the Braves
to the ninth. After the final out of his only inning, he walked
off, head high, and made no comments or gestures to the hundreds
hooting behind the Braves' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   In the past eight months, Rocker established himself as New
York's favorite villain. His antics during the playoffs and World
Series, followed by a bigoted rant that appeared in Sports
Illustrated, made him tabloid lunch meat on a par with Bernie Goetz
and Son of Sam. Not since Joey Buttafuoco had there been better
headline fodder. They made him the Ku Klux Kloser. The Hate Hurler.
Johnny Rotten. Stupid Is As Stupid Does. Even his name was perfect.
(itals)Rocker(unitals) as in, ``off his . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   And so he stood at the podium in a packed, sweaty room in the
grimy underbelly of Shea and read the words he'd scrawled on Grand
Hyatt stationery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not the evil person that has been portrayed,'' he said.
``. . . I also am fully aware that the overwhelming majority of the
people in this city are extremely charismatic and full of
personality, although a bit spirited at times, but that doesn't
make them bad people.''
</P>
<P>
   On the big screen in center field, a video of Rocker delivering
his nine-paragraph statement was shown to those ``spirited'' folks
before the game. When it was over, they booed loudly.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was quite a return for the Atlanta reliever. The
Braves arrived at the midtown hotel at about 2 a.m. after
completing their series with the Expos Wednesday night. Late in the
morning, there were TV crews and assembled hecklers standing behind
police barriers at two hotel entrances.
</P>
<P>
   Around noon, Rocker and Joe Sambito, a former Red Sox lefty who
represents Rocker for the vaunted Hendricks Brothers agency, left
the hotel and went to the offices of the Major League Baseball
Players Association. They were escorted by the New York police in a
city van and returned to the hotel around 2.
</P>
<P>
   Never in hardball history had there been so much interest in a
particular ballplayer's mode of transportation to the ballpark.
Against the wishes of the Braves and Major League Baseball
officials, Rocker had pledged to ride the IRT No. 7 train to Shea
(9.43 miles from Grand Central to Shea). In his infamous SI
meltdown, Rocker used citizens of the No. 7 to offend virtually
every minority group in the world.
</P>
<P>
   So we waited. While waiting, I bought a MTA MetroCard just in
case Johnny came through the lobby and rushed downstairs to Grand
Central Station to catch the No. 7. I even called the hotel
switchboard and asked to be connected to Rocker's room (in case he
wanted me to get him a pass or a token), but the operator said
there was no such person registered. One can only imagine what name
he's registered under (David Duke? Mark Fuhrman? Rosa Parks?). I
found it amusing that on the occasion of this visit, the Braves'
hotel headquarters is jammed with hundreds of members of the
Bibleway Church _ almost all of them African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Rocker did not take the train (``Rocker Wimps Out''
screamed the Daily News). Meanwhile, the Braves pulled the old
``bait and switch,'' a trick employed by Brian Epstein when he had
to sneak the Beatles in and out of hotels. Decoy black police vans
were stationed at the second floor, Park Avenue overpass exit, and
out front on 42d Street. A half-hour after the Braves' team bus
departed, Rocker was squired out a service entrance and whisked
into a black Ford Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   The pregame scene at Shea was preposterous. During batting
practice, there was a World Series-like media contingent around the
cage. Rocker shagged flyballs in the outfield, and appeared to
banter with some of the Shea fans. At one point, he went over to
the rail and shook a few hands.
</P>
<P>
   At Shea, new Rocker Rules were in effect. Beer sales were
limited to two (down from four) per purchase. Sales stopped an
inning earlier. A new canopy covered the Braves' bullpen and a
makeshift black corral kept the bleacher folk out of touch. The
game day police force was increased from 60 to 500. The mayor made
a plea for calm.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Only insults were hurled. No double-A batteries.
</P>
<P>
   He did not talk after the game. And he said his pregame
statement would be his last one regarding the hateful diatribe of
last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comments I made over six months ago offended many
people,'' he repeated. ``I am fully aware of this, and for that, I
sincerely apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough. Rocker has apologized. In our country it is not a crime
to be foolish, stupid, or bigoted. We are talking about a
25-year-old relief pitcher, not a pope or head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Time to go back to baseball.

MFA OFFERS VAN GOGH'S PORTRAITS OF THE SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
VAN GOGH: FACE TO FACE 
Organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, the Detroit Institute of Arts
and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. 
At: the MFA, Sunday through Sept. 24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Famously awkward in his relationships with others,
Vincent van Gogh connected with people more successfully through
paint _ in portraits intense and intimate, where sitters seem to
look into their own souls without giving up their secrets. The
boldness of these pictures, especially the later ones, still stuns.
And while the works constitute a progression from darkness into
light, from the gloom of his earliest work to the explosion of
color at the end, they never gave up their gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Of van Gogh's 800 or so paintings, roughly 150 are portraits,
and 80 of these make up ``Van Gogh: Face to Face,'' opening to the
public at the Museum of Fine Arts Sunday. While they represent a
minority subject in the artist's oeuvre, these drawings and
paintings are some of his most riveting, and were of particular
importance to the artist himself, who wrote that portraiture
``moves me to the depths, and it makes me feel closer to infinity
than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of the exhibition was the desire of its three
organizers _ the MFA, the Detroit Institute of Arts, and the
Philadelphia Museum of Art _ to bring together van Gogh's
well-known, well-loved portraits of the family of the postman
Joseph Roulin, friends of the painter during his sojourn in Arles
in 1888 and '89. What van Dyck had been to Charles I and his clan,
van Gogh was to the Roulins, painting them more frequently than any
other sitters save himself. Unlike a van Dyck or a Sargent, though,
van Gogh did nothing to glamorize his subjects, unless you count
the almost fantastical last images of Joseph and Augustine Roulin,
who are set against swirling floral backgrounds that may indeed be
wallpaper or fabric yet give them a fairytale quality.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to visit any van Gogh show without the baggage
of what we all know of his tragic life: his poverty; his touching
desire to help others, first expressed through serving as an
evangelist to coal miners; his failure to sell more than two
paintings during his lifetime; his suicide in 1890, at age 37. The
organizers of ``Face to Face'' have tried to put a fresh face on a
familiar artist through their focus on portraits. At its most
dazzling, this means a whole room of the Roulins, their repeating
faces creating a mesmerizing effect, like the Hapsburg faces that
surround you in certain rooms of the Prado.
</P>
<P>
   There are, though, missing masterworks that would have made the
show stronger. While there are etchings of Dr. Gachet, the famous
oil of the physician the artist painted with what he called ``the
heartbroken expression of our time'' is absent, as are other key
pictures. These include larger canvases like ``The Potato Eaters,''
which would have anchored this show of small to medium works,
sparsely hung in Gund Gallery spaces on the scale of a cathedral;
something more chapel-like might have been more suitable. On the
other hand, the spare installation will make it easier for the
expected crowds actually to see the paintings, and the works look
less lonely thanks to courageous choices of wall colors _
cranberry, midnight blue, pumpkin _ that warm the space.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh was largely self-taught. In the very first work in this
straightforward, chronologically arranged show, the 1881 drawing
``The Daughter of Jacob Meyer, After Holbein,'' he dutifully copies
from a how-to-draw manual. Already, though, his interests in firm
outline and heavy pattern are present. They continue in work he
made while living in The Hague in 1882-83, when, unable to afford
professional models, he painted old-age pensioners. In the 1882
``Orphan Man With Top Hat,'' he attacked the paper with pencil and
lithographic crayon, leaving dents and scratches that act as
metaphors for a battered life. Wayward strokes of black fly off the
man's shoulders with the kind of contrary independence the artist
would later convey through color.
</P>
<P>
   The topography of faces like that in the 1882 drawing ``The
Wounded Veteran'' resembles deeply rutted mountain ranges. The
``Veteran'' wears an eye patch and medal of honor that together
suggest a sad story, yet van Gogh doesn't sentimentalize him.
Instead, he gives him an expression of deepest disillusionment. The
``Veteran'' is also an example of van Gogh's combining different
media to achieve a great range of blacks, from the sooty veil that
reveals the weave of the paper to the bottomless darkness of the
sitter's velvet collar.
</P>
<P>
   In The Hague, van Gogh befriended a seamstress and erstwhile
prostitute known as Sien, who, with her children, moved in with the
artist. Van Gogh used the whole family as models, depicting them
slouching, as if pulled down by life. In ``Sien Sewing'' her head
is covered by a shawl: She looks like an elderly Virgin Mary. She
sits in a room defined by pale, hasty, scribbly strokes; her chair
is a near-ghost.
</P>
<P>
   The culmination of van Gogh's Dutch years is ``The Potato
Eaters,'' one of the signatures of the Van Gogh Museum in
Amsterdam. Studies for the masterpiece, and related heads, are in
the MFA show, the faces in queasy colors, gleaming like oil slicks,
as if they'll never be clean. Van Gogh's devotion to peasant
subjects like these was partly inspired by Millet. But while many
of Millet's peasants have a spiritual transcendence, van Gogh's
look permanently trapped.
</P>
<P>
   In 1886, van Gogh moved to Paris, where his art was transformed
by encounters with Impressionism and artists moving beyond it,
including Toulouse-Lautrec and Gauguin. Despite his adopting a
bright palette and sputtery brushwork, the somber mood of van
Gogh's paintings didn't lift. The most convincing of the Parisian
works in the MFA show are self-portraits, including one where he
looks almost like a wild beast, the sharp, tawny strokes suggesting
an entire face covered in hair, the background an extended,
hallucinatory halo circling his head.
</P>
<P>
   The small 1887 ``Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' reads from all
the way across the room. The face is urgent, pushed to the front of
the picture plane, so much so that the edges of the golden hat are
cut off. The artist looks like he wants to press his way out of the
painting: Here indeed is the evangelist as painter. Turn 90 degrees
and you're confronted with a show-stopper, the ghoulish oil of a
disembodied ``Skull'' with red-rimmed eye sockets and the
appearance of a grin: It's about as close to a smile as the show
comes. A thick zigzag of white paint sticks to the skeletal
forehead, like a remnant of bleached skin. The head hovers against
a burst of yellow that prefigures what's to come _ the complete
liberation of color in the paintings van Gogh made in Arles in
1888-89, when he outlined figures in contrasting hues and set them
against shrieking yellows and turquoise.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most valuable comparisons the show offers is the two
versions of ``The Arlesienne, Madame Joseph-Michel Ginoux.'' In the
slightly earlier one, the color sings; in the revision, it screams.
The influence of Japanese prints is much evident in the Arles room,
but it's the faces of the Roulin family who dominate. The ``Madame
Roulin and Her Baby'' owned by New York's Metropolitan Museum is an
odd composition, with the mother halfway out of the right hand side
of the picture, awkwardly holding up the wobbly-looking infant.
``The Baby Marcelle Roulin'' edges toward comedy, with the pudgy
child looking overinflated, on the verge of exploding. In the later
Roulin portraits, Joseph's once-tame beard takes on a life of its
own, erupting in baroque swirls, like water coursing over rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh made five versions of ``La Berceuse, Augustine
Roulin.'' Three are lined up in the MFA show, in the most
breathtaking display in the entire exhibition. Madame Roulin's
ample figure is one a child could sink into, like the squishiest of
overstuffed sofas. She holds a rope to rock an unseen cradle,
another suggestion of the comfort that was in such short supply in
van Gogh's life. She's a mythic figure; seeing her in multiple
makes her more so.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced by artists ranging from Rembrandt to Millet to the
neo-Impressionists, van Gogh also affected those who came after
him, portraitists from Francis Bacon to Chuck Close. But in the
10th year of his career, as he was creating some of his most
radical images, he ended it all. The final work in the MFA show is
one of his last self-portraits. The brushwork of the blue
background rises almost like vegetation, alive, about to swallow
the painter _ who, less than a year later, killed himself.

`ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE' SOAR ANEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE 
Directed by: Des McAnuff 
Screenplay by: Kenneth Lonergan (based on characters developed by
Jay Ward) 
Starring: Rene Russo, Jason Alexander, Robert De Niro, Piper
Perabo 
Running time: 88 minutes 
Rated: PG (brief mild language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' falls somewhere
between two other movies based on vintage Jay Ward TV animated
series. It's not quite the goony delight that ``George of the
Jungle'' was, but it's miles ahead of ``Dudley Do-Right.'' Never
pretending to be anything more than sheerest eye candy, it's a
sunny, funny, fittingly cartoony blend of computer-generated 3-D
representations of the flying squirrel and his pal the moose with
actors _ in this case Jason Alexander and Rene Russo as the Cold
War enemies, Boris and Natasha, and Piper Perabo's simpatico FBI
agent. True to form, the ex-spies repeatedly bungle their orders
from Robert De Niro's Fearless Leader.
</P>
<P>
   The cheesy drabness of the 1959-64 TV series provided a large
part of the original's flat black-and-white charm. But this
computer-generated resurrection of the squirrel-moose duo gleams
with freshness. They're entertaining to watch in three dimensions,
and the script gives them plenty of three-dimensional space to move
through, what with lots of overhead shots and numerous
opportunities to hurtle through the air or fall from great heights
since being recalled from limbo in Frostbite Falls, Minnesota,
where they've been marking time since their series was canceled in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, no flies have been gathering on Boris and Natasha
since the fall of communism. They've been busy trotting around
firming up the details of the new capitalist Fearless Leader's
cornering of every cable TV outlet, which he plans to use to
zombiefy the American public. Those who might argue that the job
has long since been done, and that the Fearless Leader's efforts
are redundant, would gently be pointed toward the fact that that's
part of the joke. All the film really wants is a flimsy pretext to
set Rocky and Bullwinkle in motion again, and this one is as good
as any. Obviously Janeane Garofalo, Carl Reiner, John Goodman,
Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jonathan Winters thought enough
of it to show up in cameos.
</P>
<P>
   The new R &AMP; B muster goofball charm, and the actors excel at
acting against nothing, with the keyboard wizards having added the
squirrel and the moose later. Nobody's going to suggest that the
Fearless Leader is going to show up on the clip reel at De Niro's
inevitable tribute night. But it's worth noting that he provides
yet another lesson to actors, never once condescending to his role,
which might be described as Hitler without the mustache. He
performs it crisply and with craftsmanlike attention to detail. As
with so many films these days, part of the fun lies in its comic
references to other movies, a game that peaks when De Niro veers
into a juicy little parody of his oft-imitated ``Taxi Driver''
mirror scene. Animation is turning into the bright spot of the
summer movie picture, and ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' is part of the
brightness.

THE SIGN SAYS: GONE TO CUBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call me crazy, but I'm gonna miss Elian Gonzalez. The kid was
good for two or three columns a month _ and more than that when his
Miami relatives went on one of their goofy rampages.
</P>
<P>
   The Elian saga was one of the great long-running media
spectacles of our time, commanding the public's attention more or
less constantly for seven months and three days. Maybe it was no
O.J. trial in terms of star power, but Elian's stay in America gave
us plenty of drama, lots of turmoil and even a pre-dawn commando
raid that added one more chapter to Janet Reno's legacy as the most
controversial U.S. attorney general since ... well, at least since
Ed ``If You're Innocent You're Not a Suspect'' Meese.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's critics hammered her for the decision to grab Elian by
force and return him to his father, but what was she supposed to
do? Juan Miguel Gonzalez wanted Elian back from those Miami
relatives, who had laid claim to him as if he were an abandoned pet
that they'd found alongside the road.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Elian was found clinging to an inner tube after his
mother drowned in an ill-fated attempt to flee Cuba and take up
residence in America. The relatives in Florida, specifically
Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez and Lazaro's daughter
Marisleysis, quickly asserted their custody rights _ even though
they had no custody rights.
</P>
<P>
   When the father arrived in the United States and asked to be
reunited with his son, the relatives refused to comply. They dared
Reno to take Elian by force _ and she did.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives had and still have their defenders in this
country _ I know this because I must have heard from just about
every one of them after I blasted Lazaro and Marisleysis in a
column. But I say their actions were indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Elian's best interests were their top priority _ and
that's a gigantic ``if'' _ the Miami relatives were hopelessly
misguided. What they did, in effect, was kidnap a 6-year-old boy
and force his father to negotiate for the child's release. It was
outrageous and illegal, as court after court properly ruled.
</P>
<P>
   When the case finally reached the U.S. Supreme Court, the
nation's top tribunal would have nothing to do with the bogus
crusade to keep Elian in America _ which cleared the way for Juan
Miguel Gonzalez to take his son home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home,'' unfortunately _ and most of us can agree that it's
unfortunate _ is Cuba, a communist dictatorship ruled by the
notorious Marxist thug Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   It was because of their understandable hatred for Castro that
the Miami relatives and others in the Cuban American community were
so determined to keep Elian in this country. And it was because
Cuban-Americans are voters in this country that so many American
politicians did so much pandering in regard to Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Castro also exploited Elian's plight, helping to turn a family
squabble into an international political extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody seemed to have an ax to grind _ everybody except Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, who just wanted his kid back. Gonzalez jumped
through every hoop that the Miami relatives and the U.S. government
placed in front of him, patiently awaiting the day when he would be
allowed to do what he should have been allowed to do months ago:
take Elian home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the thought of this delightful child growing up under the
iron fist of Castro is abhorrent to most Americans, including Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said during her weekly news conference yesterday that she
was glad that Elian ``is with his father ... I just wish he were
with his father in a democratic, free country.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't we all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone to Castro,'' a protester wailed in Miami's Little
Havana after the Supreme Court refused to keep Elian in America.
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope that one day Elian will see his homeland emerge
from Castro's tyranny _ or that one day, when he's old enough to
make his own decision, Elian will return to America.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the decision was his father's. And the United
States had no right to interfere.

THEY KNOW WHO THEY ARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; There's no talk of a farewell tour this time. Instead, the
members of The Who are not only back, but talking about a real
future together. The British rockers hope to make another album and
keep going the same way as their '60s peers, the Rolling Stones,
have vowed to play until fans stop coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ongoing band now. We're definitely back as a
working band,'' says Who singer Roger Daltrey, who joins Who mates
Pete Townshend and John Entwistle at the Tweeter Center on Monday,
augmented by drummer Zak Starkey (Ringo Starr's son) and
keyboardist John ``Rabbit'' Bundrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back to a five-piece now, with Pete on electric guitar,
and that's the way the band works best,'' says Daltrey. ``That also
gives us room to experiment and do free-form stuff, which hopefully
will give us more ideas for our next album. And Pete is playing
like a man possessed. He's really come alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Formerly known for fragile relations that led to a seven-year
hiatus after one farewell tour in the '80s, The Who is now rocking
with nightly sets that span its catalog, rather than focusing on
the ``Quadrophenia'' album, which the last tour did.
</P>
<P>
   The band is now hitting classics like ``My Generation,'' ``I
Can't Explain,'' and ``Pinball Wizard,'' but also adding songs not
often played, such as ``Pure 'n Easy,'' ``After the Fire'' (``it
wasn't really a Who song, but Pete wrote it for me,'' says
Daltrey), and ``Don't Even Know Myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just having a really good time now,'' says Daltrey. ``I
used to be a worrier _ and would always be pushing, pushing,
pushing _ but now I just accept what's there and enjoy it. And I
think we all realized how much we bloody missed each other. We feel
that whatever time we've got left, we want to make the most of it.
It's as simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I especially missed Pete,'' he adds. ``We go back such a long
way and have been through so much together. I think Pete feels the
same way now. And I've always had a feeling in my gut that with the
kind of writing that Pete does, and with the kind of audience we
have, we could possibly do our best work at our ages now.''
(Daltrey is 56, Townshend, 55, and Entwistle, 54.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're at a whole new level,'' says Daltrey. ``And
I don't think I've lost any of the edge off my voice. It's still
there and, if anything, has developed into other areas. I'm really
looking forward to trying to make a new album. If we come up with
15 songs of rubbish, we won't put it out. But there's something
wonderful about being the ages we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   The return to a five-piece band (``this is much more rock 'n'
roll and is like the old Who shows,'' says Daltrey) was prompted by
a short charity tour as a five-piece last year. That included Who
benefits for the Bridge School (organized by Neil Young) and for
Maryville Academy, a Chicago orphanage. This summer, the band is
mainly playing for-profit shows, but also mixing in some benefits,
such as a recent one in New York for the Robin Hood Foundation,
which raised a startling $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going into the Guinness Book of Records as the
highest amount of money raised in one night for one foundation by
one band,'' says Daltrey. ``I think if you're in a position where
you can do it, I think you should.''
</P>
<P>
   The Who, however, has been attacked by some critics for high
ticket prices on this mostly for-profit tour. At the Tweeter
Center, the prices go up to $150 a seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is taking knocks for high ticket prices,'' says
Daltrey. ``But we're still a lot cheaper than the Stones. And we
have to be realistic. Many of our hardcore fans, the people who
grew up with us, are now CEOs of companies and can afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two more reasons for the high prices. One is that SFX,
the entertainment conglomerate, bought the entire 25-city tour and
paid the band huge guarantees, thus must try to recoup them. And
second is that The Who's ``Quadrophenia'' tour made no money,
Daltrey says, because it was so expensive to produce. ``It was the
most expensive tour we ever did,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The group is keeping expenses down now, not only with fewer band
members but with a minimal stage set that ``is really funky and
stripped-down, almost as though we're playing in a club.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, he hopes the band will undertake another tour,
possibly of universities (undoubtedly with cheaper tickets). ``We
want to show young people what they've been missing,'' he says.
``When we were in our 20s, all our idols were Chicago blues guys
who were in their 60s. The age difference didn't matter. So my
feeling is, why not play universities?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Page/Crowes encore: Last year's Jimmy Page/Black Crowes
teaming was a home run at the Worcester Centrum Centre (complete
with a guest appearance by Aerosmith's Joe Perry), so get ready for
a high-energy return on Sunday at the Tweeter Center. ``I don't
think we'd be here if it hadn't gone so well last time,'' Black
Crowes singer Chris Robinson says of the six national dates (two at
the Centrum) that the Crowes did with the Led Zeppelin guitarist
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about having a good time and playing good music. And
Jimmy is playing unbelievably. Hey, he is Jimmy Page,'' Robinson
says. ``It's been really nice, because we love his songs, and Jimmy
appreciates ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of their sets consist of Zeppelin tunes (with some Crowes
songs and blues covers spliced in), but Robinson cautions, ``We're
not a Zeppelin tribute band. I'm my own vocalist. There are things
I'm going to do as a fan of those records, but it's not note for
note.''
</P>
<P>
   Page and the Crowes are adding some different Zeppelin songs
this time out, but trust us, if you're a Zep fan at all, you'll be
in heaven at this show. ``We've also been doing some new blues
covers and we've been jamming a lot, too, which Jimmy really
digs,'' says Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, blues hotshot Kenny Wayne Shepherd is opening the
show, so it has all the elements of a blast-off evening.

LIBERACE BIOGRAPHY INCLUDES EVERYTHING BUT THE JOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
LIBERACE: An American Boy 
By Darden Asbury Pryon 
University of Chicago Press, 494pp., illustrated. $27.50. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darden Asbury Pyron has written the biography Liberace was
scared to death someone would. ``I don't want to be remembered as
an old queen who died of AIDS,'' Liberace complained privately,
even as the story went out that he was dying from a watermelon
diet.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of nearly 500 frequently footnoted
academic-press pages, Pyron is intelligent, diligent, and
intermittently entertaining _ if not exactly short-winded _ in
setting forth the facts of Liberace's life. Describing Liberace's
swooping, in-flight entrance over the Radio City Music Hall stage,
Pyron's prose tries to take flight too, and crash-burns. ``Just . .
. as his Tinkerbell/Peter Pan excursion through the air
hypostatized his own fantasies, so his flight personalized his
countrymen's impossible dreams as well. The dream of audience and
actor united; his wingless flight _ if Oz-like fantasy _ became a
metaphor of that old American trick of pulling off the
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyron's brows do knit into Gordian knots when he comes to
interpret the facts. His point of departure was Liberace's sexual
nature; he was drawn to the subject when he picked up a remainder
copy of Scott Thorson's ``Behind the Candelabra,'' the tell-all
memoir of the man who sued Liberace for palimony. And the
biographer uses Liberace's homosexuality to explain nearly
everything about him, which is too much; he uses the lens of
Liberace's homosexuality to examine not only Liberace but the
America of his lifetime, which is way too much.
</P>
<P>
   After Liberace dated the transexual Christine Jorgensen, she
reported, ``He's nice _ but a little strange.'' In a way, Liberace
is a godsend to a biographer because the little-known facts are
even weirder than the very strange public phenomenon might suggest.
His lovers included the underground hustler-novelist John Rechy and
the young Rock Hudson, who later complained that Liberace was
condescending, even then. The pianist was so vain about his
hairpieces that he refused to remove his wig before a facelift
until the doctor refused to perform the surgery until he did.
Liberace arranged for Thorson to undergo plastic too, so that the
lad, 40 years his junior, might more closely resemble his lover and
patron. Liberace died before Viagra was developed, so he responded
to sexual dysfunction by installing a silicone implant.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Liberace proved a difficult subject, despite
the fact he sought and won publicity throughout his life. He told
exactly what he wanted known, and nothing else, even if it meant
lying under oath. He successfully sued the London Daily Mirror for
libel after its columnist ``Cassandra'' described him as ``this
deadly, winking, sniggering, snuggling, chromium-plated,
scent-impregnated, luminous, quivering, giggling, fruit-flavored,
mincing, ice-covered heap of mother love.'' Liberace won the same
kind of suit that Oscar Wilde lost, and he lied as blithely as
Wilde did.
</P>
<P>
   But Liberace never became a gay hero, like Wilde. He didn't want
that, and his true constituency lay elsehwere, mostly in the Middle
America where he grew up and learned his values. Although
television made and kept him a star, his work lay outside the
purview even of analysts of popular culture; one of Pyron's
footnotes reveals that Liberace's name appeared in the New York
Times only four times during a 23-year period that included the
peak of his celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Pyron is exhaustive on the subject of Liberace's sexuality, bit
he is less successful in dealing with Liberace's showmanship and
his place in popular culture for the simple reason that he never
saw the showman in live performance. He is also not ideally placed
to discuss Liberace's musicianship. Pyron does not seem musically
literate in either the classical or the popular fields that
Liberace bridged. (He gets the name of Morton Gould wrong,
misspells Morton Downey's, and thinks that the McGuire Sisters sang
``Mr. Sandman.'') This is a drawback because Liberace was not
musically illiterate. It would have been more interesting to hear
from musicians who worked with Liberace, his conductors, for
example, or some of the singers who toured with him (who included
Barbra Streisand and the Met's Jean Fenn).
</P>
<P>
   Liberace was a better pianist than he sometimes let himself be,
and some of his arrangements and improvisations in live performance
were brilliant examples of mental, musical and physical
legerdemain. A critic once told me that Liberace was not a natural
pianist, and throughout his career practiced constantly to keep in
trim. If both Pyron's account of nonstop lechery and the critic are
accurate, one wonders where he found the time.
</P>
<P>
   The millions who did see Liberace in supper clubs, concert
halls, summer tents and at Las Vegas enjoyed the experience, even
people like this writer who never expected to. Liberace was always
ahead of you, and you couldn't say anything much worse about him
than he said about himself. He certainly reveled in excess and
extravagance of every kind, but he also kept it in perspective.
(``I'm glad you like this outfit,'' he would say. ``After all, you
paid for it.'') (It's fun to read that in the baroque excesses of
his luxuriously appointed homes, Liberace preferred not to shave
during periods when he wasn't working and lounged around in a ratty
old terrycloth robe.)
</P>
<P>
   And it was a neat hat-trick that he pulled off, offering a gay
sensibility to people who enjoyed it because they didn't know what
it was. Mae West, a onetime Liberace date, had shown the way. As
the years went on, Liberace dropped more and more beads, but it
wasn't until Bette Midler came along that everyone was in on the
joke. His worst sin was that he was of his own generation, of his
own time and place, rather than a later one. There are many reasons
for Liberace's appeal, and Pyron understands most of them without
stressing the principal one: He enjoyed his life and his work, and
people loved him for it.

RICHARD ASHCROFT LEAVES DEFEATISM BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a perfect coda to its breakthrough single, 1997's
``Bittersweet Symphony,'' British rockers the Verve called it quits
just as the band achieved international stardom. The swan song was
splendid, a majestic and melancholic anthem from its third CD,
``Urban Hymns,'' that lifted the notion of beautiful tragedy to
spellbinding heights of pop songcraft. You couldn't have scripted
better source music for a breakup, especially one that followed a
tumultuous decade of temporary splits, multiple lawsuits, and a
steady diet of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Now, singer-songwriter Richard Ashcroft has risen from the
Verve's ashes with a much-anticipated solo debut, ``Alone with
Everyone'' (Hut/Virgin). Like the proverbial phoenix, Ashcroft
makes a beeline skyward from the pyre. His album is a lavish,
ambitious affair, a sublimely atmospheric collection that builds on
the Verve's textured aura, in the process reviving a genre that's
been all but subsumed by venemous rap-metal and candied teen-pop:
the sprawling rock opus.
</P>
<P>
   The title is borrowed from hard-living poet Charles Bukowski,
but there's not a blood-and-guts rocker on the album. Fans of the
swaggering frontman best remembered for shoving people in the
``Bittersweet Symphony'' video may be disappointed that Ashcroft's
solo effort isn't, as one might have predicted, a surly kiss-off.
It is, rather, informed by the poetry of living not hard, but well.
The man who before lamented ``It's a bittersweet symphony, this
life/Trying to make ends meet/You're a slave to the money/And then
you die'' is now dreaming of his lover _ ``I'm on fire/I'm full of
love and new desire'' _ to the tune of a sinuous, back-looped pedal
steel guitar in ``On A Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft has taken a sharp turn from grandiose defeatism into
the realm of lush romanticism. That may sound like a frightful
recipe for oversized, trite love songs. Truly, one doesn't tend to
associate a happy marriage and becoming a father with inspiration
of the rock 'n' roll variety. To make matters worse, Ashcroft's
lyrics still lack the depth of even his chiseled cheekbones.
</P>
<P>
   But his sweeping love notes to wife Kate Radley, former
keyboardist for the band Spiritualized who plays on Ashcroft's
album, brim with lush, complex textures that require no biting
riffs or chaotic jams to make their point. These are sedate,
accessible mini-epics _ heavy with strings, each lasting five
minutes or longer _ songs whose meaning are conveyed not so much in
word or attitude as in the visceral emotion that subtly unravels
and reveals itself in the moody, flowing layers.
</P>
<P>
   The first single, ``A Song for the Lovers,'' is a temperate,
breezy track, a loose, undulating weave of acoustic guitar,
violins, piano, horns, and percussion. Longtime Verve producer
Chris Potter created a radiant tapestry of instruments, many played
by Ashcroft, with support from ex-Verve drummer Pete Salisbury,
pedal steel guitarist B.J. Cole, bassist Pino Palladino, and
sometime-Rolling Stones pianist Chuck Leavell. Ashcroft's voice is
sullen and charismatic as ever, infusing gently psychedelic pop
songs and fluid, country-flavored ballads with a blessedly
unsettled ambience.
</P>
<P>
   Not every track is as winsome as ``I Get My Beat,'' thick and
propulsive as ``New York,'' sonically enchanting as ``Slow Was My
Heart.'' The rangy ``You on My Mind in My Sleep'' is way too close
for comfort to the Stones' ``Wild Horses'' (this after courts
awarded 100 percent of the publishing rights to ``Bittersweet
Symphony,'' built around a looped sample of ``The Last Time,'' to
the Stones' back catalog company). And ``C'Mon People (We're Making
It Now)'' is ingratiatingly upbeat as the title. By and large,
though, ``Alone with Everyone'' is a mature, complex album that
shines in an increasingly dark, dank rock music landscape.

 HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL FINALLY WARMS TO THE WEB  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was ever a sign that the Internet has gone
establishment, this may be it.
</P>
<P>
   After keeping a cautious distance from Web-based ventures for
years, Harvard Medical School is negotiating with an undisclosed
company to offer its 180 continuing education courses for doctors
online within a year.
</P>
<P>
   While Harvard's continuing medical education program is the
largest in the world _ 40,000 doctors and other health care
professionals travel to the classes each year _ the university is
starting to acknowledge the potential threat from online
competitors. And with the number of physicians at Harvard teaching
hospitals moonlighting for health care dot-coms growing rapidly,
Harvard's legendary medical complex is warming up to the Web in
other ways too.
</P>
<P>
   Just two recent examples: Harvard-affiliate Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, where doctors began writing for the
consumer site CBS HealthWatch last year, will start recruiting
residents for the after-hours job in July. The medical school is
also finalizing an agreement to run Aetna US Healthcare's consumer
site, InteliHealth.
</P>
<P>
   Even though health care sites have struggled to make money and
even survive, companies are pursuing Harvard because they believe
the name will bring credibility and eventually dollars. And Harvard
is responding.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have come 180-degrees on this subject,'' said Dr. David
McDermott, a Beth Israel physician who helped launch one of the
first Internet consulting programs at the hospital a year ago.
``The same people who were putting up roadblocks are now saying
`Why didn't we do this sooner?' ''
</P>
<P>
   While medical schools like Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore
_ which ran Intelihealth for five years _ and research hospitals
like the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota have become household names
through their Web sites and contracts with online companies,
Harvard, ever the skeptical traditionalist, has kept its distance
from the wired world.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Goldfinger, medical school dean for continuing
education, said that the Harvard name alone has been so successful
at attracting doctors and patients that there's been an
unwillingness to risk the university's reputation by linking with
dot-coms, many of which are laden with advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also a realization, especially as teaching hospitals
struggle with record operating losses, that successful marketing
increasingly requires an Internet presence. At Harvard, influential
faculty like Dr. Anthony Komaroff, editor in chief of Harvard
Health Publications, also have pushed to loosen attitudes _ and
with the change has come new questions about the proper role for
Harvard's esteemed doctors.
</P>
<P>
   How much time should they devote to Internet ventures? Should
the Harvard name appear alongside drug ads? Are they helping
consumers hungry for medical information _ or just adding to the
confusion?
</P>
<P>
   Answers Dr. Leon Eisenberg, 77, the Maude and Lillian Presley
professor emeritus of social medicine, and an Internet skeptic:
Very little; no; and adding to the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to believe that the driving force is to educate the
public or physicians,'' he said. ``But the driving force is to
collect income as fast as possible. And the lure of the Internet is
almost irresistible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, Eisenberg said he's received four or
five e-mails from Internet health care companies that provide
second opinions offering him $1,000 for 10 minutes of work. ``I
find it all so distasteful I never even answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of Harvard doctors argue that such ventures
help consumers and patients _ as long as they're structured
carefully and physicians stick to providing general educational
information and not personal advice.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,500 medical school faculty members cannot spend more than
20 percent of their time working as outside consultants and a new
policy under consideration would prevent all Harvard faculty from
teaching for competing educational institutions _ actual or virtual
_ without permission.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the medical school is not aware of any doctors who've
run afoul of the 20 percent rule, said spokesman Don Gibbons.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University associate provost Dennis Thompson said that
the new policy means doctors will need permission before they can
teach online.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson said it's unclear whether physicians will be
allowed free rein to consult for online second opinion and consumer
education sites. And as Harvard takes over the Aetna site,
competing with physicians' other consumer-directed ventures, that
could become a thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not exactly the same as competing with Harvard in its
traditional educational role,'' Thompson said. ``Those sites seem
to me more like publishing or writing, getting your ideas out to a
wider public, which is something faculty members have always done.
But could a Harvard faculty member go work for baby Aetna? The dean
would want to go look at that. This is unchartered territory and it
hasn't been decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said there's been a lot of debate about whether it's a
good idea for the medical school to partner with the for-profit
Aetna site, but that it was ultimately decided ``that the
protections are good enough and there are financial awards that can
be used for the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Komaroff, one of the faculty members who is overseeing the Aetna
project, would not discuss the details.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Delbanco, chief of the division of general medicine
and primary care at Beth Israel Deaconess in Boston, said that 15
to 20 doctors who moonlight for CBS HealthWatch try to answer more
than 5,000 questions from consumers annually and review more than
3,000 educational pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been churning out more and more work,'' he said. ``But
there's a difference between practicing medicine over the Internet
and providing education. So we're very careful and we use very
carefully crafted language. And we clearly say that we don't
endorse any drugs or products that Medscape (the CBS HealthWatch
sponsor) is trying to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Medscape is not allowed to say it is working with Harvard
Medical School. But Delbanco can _ and does _ list his title on the
site: professor of medicine, Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Delbanco said he has no equity in the company, but he would not
say how much doctors are paid for their consulting time _ although
if other online health sites are an indication, doctors should not
quit their day jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Onhealth.com pays Beth Israel Deaconess $100,000 a year for the
content that the hospital's doctors provide, but the physicians
receive just 10 percent of that _ which works out to about $100 per
500- to 1,000-word article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many answers are reassurances or just advice to go see your
doctor,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Partners HealthCare Telemedicine, which uses Harvard doctors to
provide second opinions to doctors around the world, pays doctors
$200 to $250 for an opinion, which the program director said is
significantly better than most Web sites. Four-hundred doctors
provide 600 second opinions a year.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a new contract with American Life Insurance Co.,
volume is expected to double this year, and Partners likely will
have to establish quidelines so doctors don't neglect their primary
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Income is a small factor but for most people it's not going to
amount to a major amount of money,'' said Dr. Lowell Schnipper at
Beth Israel, who recently turned down a consulting offer from
Oncology.com because he works for a competing CD-ROM venture,
Oncologyuptodate. ``The biggest reason is visibility. Harvard
sometimes can be very conservative and maybe we're a little late on
the draw. But there is now a desire to raise the flag if it's done
in a responsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Goldfinger is struggling with.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that the continuing education program needs $25
million in the first five years to update technology and marketing.
If it's done right, the hope is that the program will draw several
thousand doctors and that revenues could go for scholarships and
research.
</P>
<P>
   But they have to convince advertisers that it's worth their
while if they get sponsorship credit on the Harvard site, much like
on public radio stations, but are not allowed to specifically
advertise products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a no-brainer to put a Harvard module on headaches
up there sponsored by (pain medication) commercials,'' he said.
``That can't happen. We have to make this solvent without heavy
commercialization.''

VOTERS SUPPORT POLITICAL SYSTEM FAVORED BY PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda _ Early results of a referendum on Uganda's
political future showed Friday that more than 80 percent of voters
want to continue with the current ``no-party'' system advocated by
the nation's president.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the president, Yoweri Museveni, still declared
victory, saying the turnout was far too low for him to claim a
strong mandate. His opponents had called for a boycott on a
referendum on whether to continue with the so-called Movement
system or return to a multi-party system. Based on returns counted
by Friday evening, just 40.5 percent of registered voters took
part, far less than the roughly 75 percent in the 1996 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ugandans have spoken about the Movement system of
government,'' said Cecilia Atim-Ogwal, an opposition figure here
and leader of one faction of the Ugandan People's Congress. ``They
have rejected it totally.''
</P>
<P>
   But an official with Movement said people did not stay away
because of the boycott but rather because of rainy weather and
because Museveni's victory had not seemed in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, so good,'' the official, Moses Byaruhanga, secretary
to the Movement National Referendum Committee, said Friday
afternoon after the first results were tallied. ``This has showed
what the people want.''
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, the results and low turnout seemed to give both
sides something to campaign on next year, when elections for
Parliament and the presidency will be held.
</P>
<P>
   In this campaign Museveni, a former bush fighter who took power
in 1986, has argued that political parties merely divide Uganda by
tribe and religion. Those divisions, he says, gave rise to two
dictators, Idi Amin and Milton Obote, and a distinctly violent era
of Uganda's history since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the multi-party system say that the Movement
system _ which allows political parties in name only _ violates the
freedom of association guaranteed by the constitution. Moreover,
they argue, the Movement is essentially a one-party system, which
they say Museveni manipulates to his political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats and other experts give Museveni broad credit
for bringing a measure of peace and economic growth to Uganda,
though some western governments have also been pushing him behind
the scenes to open up more politically. He has argued that the
system is open because he appoints his opponents _ like Paul
Ssemogerere, who ran for president against Museveni but later
served as his foreign minister _ to top positions.
</P>
<P>
   The results released Friday accounted for roughly 10 percent of
Uganda's 9.6 million registered voters: the Movement won about 83
percent of the votes cast and the multi-party advocates 17.4
percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview on Thursday with a U.N. news service, Museveni
said that any result under 60 percent would show ``a serious
problem with the Movement system.''
</P>
<P>
   The results varied by region, with voters in sections of the
north, where Museveni is unpopular because of a rebellion and
remaining support for Obote, barely going to the polls. Only 11
percent of voters went to the polls, for example, in the northern
town of Kitgum. Atim-Ogwal, a member of parliament, said less than
10 percent of the people in her town, Lira in the north, had voted.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the votes from the west, Museveni's home region and
where he is popular, was not counted by Friday evening. The
remaining results were expected overnight and on Saturday.

 ASSIST FROM US HELPS MALLARD KIN REUNITE IN MOSCOW 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD HIGGINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mrs. Mallard is making her way back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In February, thieves sawed off and nabbed the 200-pound bronze
statue of the determined duck matriarch from Robert McCloskey's
``Make Way for Ducklings.''
</P>
<P>
   They also made off with two of her flock, Lack and Mack.
</P>
<P>
   That left Novodevichy Park with only five of the nine original
ducks that Barbara Bush had given the Soviet Union in 1991, a year
after Raisa Gorbachev had admired the duck sculpture while visiting
Boston's Public Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the bronze carnage was too much for Needham native Beth
Hebert, who now runs a small investment firm in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the theft, they looked so lonely, like they had been
orphaned,'' Hebert said of the five remaining ducks, Jack, Kack,
Nack, Ouack, and Pack. (Another duckling, Quack, had been stolen in
1991.) All that remained of the abducted ducks, she noted, were
their bronze webbed feet, embedded in cobblestone imported from
Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, who has a year-old daughter, said the Moscow ducks had
been popular among Russian children. ``There isn't anything like
them in Moscow, so they were a huge hit,'' she said. ``Kids were
always all over them.''
</P>
<P>
   So she persuaded Boston's State Street Corp., which is the main
owner of her Moscow company, to pay most of the cost of having new
ones made by Nancy Schon, the West Newton sculptor of Boston's
bronze ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Schon's new ducks, which are being made from the plaster molds
first used in 1987, are expected to be finished and sent to Russia
in August. With the death last year of Raisa Gorbachev, officials
at State Street are hoping that her husband, Mikhail, will attend
the ceremony marking the return of the abducted ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had sent the duck family redux to Moscow to mark the
US-Soviet arms treaty known as START I. A plaque in front of the
ducks, which were placed near a real duck house in front of the
16th-century, onion-domed Novodevichy Monastery, reads, ``This
scuplture was given in love and friendship to the children of the
Soviet Union on behalf of the children of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, whose mother, a Boston native, read the McCloskey tale
to her over and over as a child, said that she had seen the Moscow
version and had wanted to send her a mother a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   On the February day she had planned to go, a blizzard blanketed
Moscow. The next day, she went with a camera only to find three
ducks abducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ducknapped!'' declared the English-language Moscow Times.
</P>
<P>
   Despite four similar, though less serious, abductions of her
duck statues from Boston's Public Garden since they were installed
in 1987, including one in November, Schon still recoils at the
thought of losing one of her bronze babies.
</P>
<P>
   And never before had the determined matriarch disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated when I heard they'd been cut off at the knees
and that Mrs. Mallard had been taken,'' their sculptor said. ``The
whole thing was mean and cruel and vicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Schon called the theft a violation against children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few public places, in Boston or Moscow, where
children can go and parents don't say `no,' where they can interact
with a sculpture however they want,'' said Schon, who is part
Russian. ``This is a violation against a lovely, beautiful thought
and gift.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Make Way for Ducklings,'' published in 1941, most of the
ducks wait in the Charles River while Mr. Mallard searches for a
permanent home, which turns out to be a tiny island in the middle
of the Public Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The scene shown in the 35-foot-long duck sculpture is that of
Mrs. Mallard and her eight duckings going to rejoin him _ right
after ``Officer Michael'' stops traffic on Storrow Drive for them
to cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a book about keeping promises, which makes the
theft of Mrs. Mallard all the more upsetting,'' said Schon.
</P>
<P>
   George Russell, director of both community affairs and global
philanthropy for State Street, said that the company is paying
$30,000 of the $55,000 cost of the replacements.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's investment management unit has a majority stake in
the firm that Hebert runs in Moscow, Pallada Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beth mentioned this to us, and after thinking about it we
decided to partly fund the replicas,'' Russell said. ``The major
focus of our philanthropy is programs that support children, and
here is something that really resonated with the children of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus,'' he added, ``we're a Boston-headquartered global
company, and this was an opportunity to do something meaningful in
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   It will almost certainly be satisfying to Gavril Popov, the
former mayor of Moscow, who spoke at the duck dedication ceremony
there in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life in this city is going to be gradually improved,'' Popov
said to the guests, who included both Gorbachevs and author Robert
McCloskey, who was 76 at the time. Then, turning to the ducks,
Popov said, ``You will live here as well and as happily as you do
in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Schon said that given the deterioration of US-Russian relations
since the hopeful and heady days of the 1990s, she felt a need to
see that America's gift to Russia is made whole again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the idea that this was something that connected our
cultures,'' said Schon, who called the experience of working with a
combined American-Russian work crew to install the sculptures in
1991 one of the highlights of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing how wonderfully we all worked together,'' she
said. ``It was a reminder to me that, despite our governments,
people basically love each other.''

 &HT;     By JOE HOLLEY and BILL HENDRICKS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Roman Catholic Archbishop Patrick Flores wants the
man who held him hostage for nine hours earlier this week to get
some psychological help.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I saw yesterday, I saw a very sick man,'' Flores
said Thursday, a day after the ordeal at his chancery office.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop said he was not in a position to recommend
whether Nelson Antonio Escolero, 40, the man charged in the hostage
taking, should face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am suggesting very highly,'' Flores, 71, said, ``that the
man be given the blessing and privilege of psychological
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Escolero, a native of El Salvador who has been in the United
States for 25 years, was being held in Bexar County Jail in lieu of
$2 million bond in connection with the incident Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Flores recounted his ordeal during a news conference held at the
San Antonio chancery, two floors below the office where he was held
captive.
</P>
<P>
   Unharmed and in good spirits after an overnight stay at Christus
Santa Rosa Hospital, the Catholic leader recalled that he tried to
help Escolero with immigration problems, but that the man
threatened him with what he claimed was a grenade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never seen one,'' Flores said. ``I don't even carry a
pocketknife.''
</P>
<P>
   The weapon turned out to be a harmless military training
grenade, police bomb squad officer Rocky Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   Escolero told Flores he had been arrested twice for possession
of marijuana in 1984 and had paid the fines, but in 1999 he was
jailed and deported for his crimes 15 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted his immigration papers back so he could take his wife
and family to Cuba, ``the only place,'' he said, ``not infected by
capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the afternoon, they were busy with phone
conversations with police negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio police said that a sniper was positioned to take
action if negotiators failed to persuade Escolero to put down his
weapon and release Flores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at every option,'' police Lt. Dan Akeroyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Akeroyd, who heads the police department's special operations,
acknowledged his SWAT team includes snipers and that one of his
marksmen was in position to shoot if necessary in during the
nine-hour standoff that began at 10:22 a.m. Wednesday inside the
Catholic Chancery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the sniper had in his sights,'' Akeroyd
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that he believed the sniper could see inside
the third-floor office where Flores was being held.
</P>
<P>
   About 6 p.m., Flores decided to do his own negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make a pledge to you,'' he recalled telling
Escolero. ``If you do not kill yourself, I will look for a lawyer
or two to look into why you're being deported. I'll even pay for a
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores also told Escolero he would be happy to help his wife and
family with food vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will walk out of here with my hands raised and your hands
raised, too,'' Flores told Escolero. ``You have to leave the
grenade on top of my desk. In the name of God, in the name of
Jesus, in the name of your family, in the name of everybody else, I
ask you not to take life.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, he said OK. But he said, `You better keep
your promise.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two men walked out of the office holding onto each other. In
the hallway, they confronted police officers. They were told to put
their hands up and then turn around in a circle so they could check
for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Escolero asked to lie down on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the last time I saw him,'' Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said Escolero obviously has psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt that he was a very angry individual, and that
psychologically he was very shaky.''

REAL PRAYER OR REAL POWER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the prayers of the administrators of the Santa Fe, Texas,
school district had been answered by the U.S. Supreme Court last
week, it would have been a loss for religion in America.
</P>
<P>
   Now, before correspondence addressed to ``Dear Heathen'' wings
its way to downtown Fort Worth, hear me out.
</P>
<P>
   In order to pass the litmus test for publicly uttered ``prayer''
in a society filled with religions of all stripes, a message has to
be so watered down, so sanitized, so cleansed of any meaning that
it becomes worthless.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't prayer. That's little more than a thought for the
day, with all the spiritual heft of a smiley-face button.

   An issue related to school prayer comes up every winter in the
guise of the display of religious symbols on public property. Yes,
such things can occur and still pass the
separation-of-church-and-state test, under which no government
entity can be viewed as promoting one religion over another. The
Supreme Court, in Lynch vs. Donnelly, opened the doors for
communities to display _ and even pay for _ a creche, and a Jewish
menorah, and a Islamic crescent and star along with a Rudolph
complete with blinking red nose, a lighted Frosty the Snowman and a
row of candy canes on public property.
</P>
<P>
   Voila _ the all-American holiday display that can pass the
separation test. It can also pass the separation-from-taste test.
The significance of the creche, with its Christ child, Joseph and
Mary, falls to the level of holiday kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but the symbols of my faith are worth more than that. I
would hope that Jews and Muslims feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   America is a nation of religious pluralism _ and getting more so
every day. Although the population at the time of the nation's
founding was overwhelmingly Christian in nature, today
non-Christian religions are represented in an increasing portion of
the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   When those numbers take on the faces of children seated at desks
in schools supported by tax dollars, the government's neutral stand
on religion _ as articulated by the Founding Fathers in the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment _ is both visionary and
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, God can never leave a classroom if he's firmly planted
in children's hearts. That's what people of faith should be
concerned about, instead of fixating on what words are broadcast
over a public address system before a football game.
</P>
<P>
   And yet in the hours after the Supreme Court ruled that Santa
Fe's policy for student messages and invocations was
unconstitutional, the TV screen was awash in testimony from folks
who, by golly, don't care a widow's mite what the high court ruled
_ there'll be prayer at Friday night football this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The focus is so intense on the act of publicly speaking a prayer
that some self-described religious people have lost sight of what
the content of the prayer is supposed to be. We're supposed to be
worshipping God, not coveting access to a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   The actions of the intransigents in Santa Fe and other primarily
Southern school districts who vow to ``get God back into the
classroom'' point to the dark side of public proclamations of
religious speech or displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a way to signal who's in control,'' said Melissa Rogers,
associate general counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee on Public
Affairs. ``It's a way to say, `We have the power to make this
happen _ and you don't.'''
</P>
<P>
   Power. Control. Defiance of court rulings. Such aggression from
people who were supposedly taught to behave otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `us against them' approach hardly lives up to the love and
compassion that Christ called His people to live by,'' writes Derek
H. Davis, director of the J.M. Dawson Institute of Church-State
Relations at Baylor University, in an editorial for the Journal of
Church and State. ``In the end, Christians' greatest priority
should be the gospel, not creating a Christian state. The result
might be a more but never completely Christian culture, but one
achieved through persuasion, not law.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus didn't care one nit about creating a Christian nation. He
was about creating Christians. He neither asked nor expected the
government to help him in that mission. It wasn't his way, or his
intention, for one's walk in faith to happen by coercion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I am a volunteer. For three years, I taught public school in New
York City, and since 1994, the summer after my last third-grade
class, I have served as an unofficial mentor to the families of
four of my former students - Adam and James, Jaber (and his younger
brother, Lloyd), Keemy (and his older siblings, Clara, Elizabeth
and Angelo) and Burger, plus a few of their friends. At any given
time, ``the group,'' as we have all come to call it, has numbered
from 6 to 12 kids, a few of them Dominican, the rest of them black.
I am 36 and white.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, we have gone ice skating, bowling, to movies, to
museums and on the occasional overnight trip (to Washington, the
east end of Long Island) and have generally hung out. I have been
on hand for happy moments (the 100th birthday of Jaber's
great-great-grandmother) and sad ones (his grandfather's funeral).
When I met ``my'' kids, they were 7 and 8 years old, smaller than I
am, and liked to hold my hand when we crossed the street. Now they
are 15 and 16, nearly all are in high school and they hulk over me
in puffy parkas or with long legs and gangly arms protruding out of
shorts and tank tops. Not one of them would be caught dead holding
my hand.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, politicians and civic leaders have been
looking to volunteers like me to take over the government's role in
providing vital services to the poor. Although the movement
arguably began in 1988 with the candidate George Bush's invocation
of ``a thousand points of light'' as a response to Reagan-era
cutbacks in social spending, it has been embraced by the current
Democratic administration, which has continued those cutbacks, and
culminated in the 1997 President's Summit for America's Future in
Philadelphia, where President Clinton and Gen. Colin Powell touted
the power of volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
   Now George W. Bush has picked up his father's theme of ``a
kinder, gentler'' America by pushing ``charitable choice'' _ the
provision in the 1996 welfare reform bill that allows faith-based
organizations to contract with government to provide social
services to the poor. (Al Gore supports it, too, though less
vigorously.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Compassionate conservatives'' would probably claim that I am
the kind of ``caring adult'' who can transform the lives of
disadvantaged kids more effectively than any government program.
I'm all for volunteering, but I would disagree. While I don't doubt
that I have had some positive effects on my kids' lives _ studies
show that mentoring can reduce dropout rates and drug use among
teen-agers _ they have mostly been of the ``boosting self-esteem''
variety that conservatives, in other contexts, usually disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I'm not a very good volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   To work, mentoring has to be performed consistently, over a
sustained period of time and preferably one on one. For the first
couple of years, I saw my kids as often as twice a week. But now
I'm lucky if I see them once a month, and I almost never see them
individually. In their lives, I'm less a caring adult than a random
one. And my failure is representative.
</P>
<P>
   Although 55 percent of Americans reported that they volunteered
at some point in 1998 _ a 7 percent rise over 1995 _ this jump does
little more than recover ground that was lost in the early 1990s
and represents just a 1 percent increase over 1989. Moreover, the
total number of hours that people are giving has actually declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new trend,'' says Sara Melendez, the president of
Independent Sector, which compiled this data. ``People are
volunteering, but when they do, it's more of a one-shot deal _ half
a day one Saturday, instead of once a week for x number of weeks.''
Overall, Americans donated 400 million fewer hours in 1998 than
they did in 1995. Consequently, while Powell has made recruiting
100,000 new mentors a top priority of America's Promise, his
volunteer outfit, there is little evidence that people are
sufficiently answering his call.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, for instance, Big Brothers/Big Sisters receives
just 4,000 inquiries each year from potential mentors. Of these,
two-thirds never follow up once they learn they have to commit to
seeing their kids at least twice a month. Another 700 lose interest
after the initial training session or are eliminated through the
program's rigorous screening process. Only 600 people ever become
mentors _ this in a city with more than one million schoolchildren
_ and nationally, the program has a waiting list of some 50,000
kids. To help nonprofits cope with this new unreliable work force,
groups like Impact Online and New York Cares have sprung up that
act like temp agencies, matching the interests (and busy schedules)
of what might be called the impulse volunteer _ someone with an
urge to give but only a few hours to kill _ with openings, arranged
by time slot and geographical location.
</P>
<P>
   But this Filofax approach to giving often robs volunteerism of
the very thing that was supposed to recommend it over government in
the first place _ namely, the personal connection that develops
when you regularly visit, say, the same homebound AIDS patient. And
in a volunteer's market, not every need has a buyer. ``People will
come in and do a project _ a school painting, a school wiring _ and
think they've done a good service and go away,'' says Paul Clolery,
editor of The NonProfit Times. ``But it's not the type of
traditional, week-in and week-out volunteering that a lot of
organizations really need.''
</P>
<P>
   No case perhaps better illustrates how idealism has run amok
than that of Bank of America, which under the rubric of
``volunteerism'' encouraged its employees in San Francisco to
``adopt an ATM'' _ mentoring it, so to speak, by visiting it
regularly, sprucing up its surroundings, wiping away the little
smudges from its face _ until the California labor commissioner
ruled that the company had violated labor laws by trying to get its
employees to work without pay.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Meals on Wheels in Dallas is typical. It can't
find enough volunteers to commit to even a few hours a month to
help deliver meals to the city's elderly shut-ins. ``People can't
get away during the middle of the day,'' says Helen Bruant, the
program's director. ``So, they ask, 'Why don't you deliver in the
evenings?' Well, we looked at that. But for a lot of our clients,
this is their only meal. They eat half at lunch and save the other
half for dinner. Plus, it's not good for the elderly to eat a big
meal at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the program must hire 30 percent of its drivers. Even
paying people, Bruant cannot find enough help. ``We can't compete
with McDonald's,'' she says. ``It can be draining working with the
elderly. A lot of people would prefer to flip burgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if anything, the need is increasing. ``The aged population
has grown by leaps and bounds in the last decade,'' Bruant says,
``but giving and government financing haven't increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, according to a study by the U.S. Conference of Mayors
released in December, requests for emergency food and housing have
climbed at their steepest rate since the early 1990s. As a result,
the heads of some of the most reputable nonprofits _ the United
Way, the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities _ have reported that
they can't keep up with rising demand for their services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having to turn people away, or ration portions, to
stretch supplies,'' says Deborah Leff, the president of America's
Second Harvest, the nation's largest network of soup kitchens. And
while charitable giving is up sharply, the growth has not kept pace
with reductions in government aid to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have replaced some of it with volunteering, some of it
with cash, but not all of it,'' says Richard Steinberg, a professor
of economics at the joint campus of Indiana and Purdue Universities
in Indianapolis. He estimates that for every dollar of assistance
that's cut, charitable organizations can recoup at most a third.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who once worked in the New York public school system,
I am not inured to the problems of government bureaucracy. I have
not forgotten the asbestos crisis (which sealed my own classroom),
the idiocy of the custodians' contract, the mind-numbing hours I
spent at the Board of Education trying to get someone, anyone, to
answer a straightforward question about licensing.
</P>
<P>
   But what's so odd about the current volunteer movement is how
the broad claims often made on its behalf run counter to the
on-the-ground testimony of those, like Bruant, who actually do the
hard work of ministering to the poor. Compared with someone like
her, of course, I am pathetic. Still, in the words of a protester's
placard at the volunteer summit, I've ``volunteered enough to know
volunteering isn't enough.'' As a substitute for the social safety
net, I am as inefficient, indifferent and arbitrary as any
government program. The problem isn't with volunteering, but with
what we're asking it to do.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Tipping Point,'' Malcolm Gladwell's book about social
epidemics, he cites an experiment devised by two Princeton
psychologists to test why people give. The experimenters met
individually with a group of seminarians and asked them to prepare
a short talk. Some were asked to discuss the parable of the Good
Samaritan. Others were given a more neutral topic. Then, just as
they were about to leave for their presentations, they were told
either that they were running late or had a few minutes to spare.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, the seminarians would encounter a man slumped in an
alleyway, coughing and groaning in obvious distress. The idea was
to see who would stop and help. Invariably, people assume that
those who were asked to talk about the Good Samaritan were the most
likely to assist the man. In fact, the only factor that influenced
the outcome was time. Among those who thought they were in a hurry,
only 10 percent stopped to help. Among those with extra time, 63
percent stopped. As Gladwell concludes, context, far more than
conviction, influences behavior.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious reason for the decline in volunteering is that
Americans are working harder. ``With the rise of the two-income
family,'' Paul Clolery says, ``the traditional volunteer who stayed
at home with the kids no longer exists.'' According to one study,
middle-class parents now punch the clock 335 hours more each year _
that's eight solid workweeks _ than they did in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you ask people who are working 50-, 60-hour
weeks, who already have children and elderly parents to care for,
to volunteer on a more regular basis,'' Sara Melendez says. ``The
rhetoric about volunteering hasn't caught up with the reality of
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1995 and 1997, for example, I cut back the amount of
time I saw my kids by three-fourths, to about once a month. The
reason wasn't that in 1995 I was a good person and in 1997 I was a
bad one. Rather, in 1995 I had a flexible job with a lot of
downtime, and in 1997 I took a full-time job as an editor and often
worked into the evening or on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Before I made the shift, I began to look for an exit out of my
kids' lives. At one point, I was approached about a job in
Washington and figured that was how my mentoring would end: I would
leave the city. But the opportunity fell through. I eventually
decided I would get my four original students into a good, small
junior high. (I also helped Angelo get into a good high school.)
The younger siblings, I figured, could then follow suit. My idea
was not to improve the city's schools systematically _ my children
would almost certainly take the places of other poor, equally
deserving students _ but to pass the kids off, into new caring
hands, like batons.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about children in this country, we do very
little for them _ or their families. What my kids really need, I
can't give them: better housing, less crowded schools, access to
affordable health care, a less punitive juvenile justice system,
and for their parents, better child care (so they can work without
leaving their kids unattended) and a living wage. Even the
churches, in whose name the claims of volunteering are often made,
have begun to protest.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a surprisingly large and diverse coalition of
religious leaders _ from the conservative National Association of
Evangelicals to the liberal U.S. Catholic Conference _ came
together in Washington to inaugurate a new group, Call to Renewal,
to insist that government do more to fight poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since welfare reform passed, all these problems have been
dumped at churches' feet,'' says the Rev. Jim Wallis, one of the
organization's founders. ``But we can't do it all.'' As it stands,
the government isn't even doing what it said it would.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that hunger and homelessness are on the rise is that
many states, including New York, have prevented even the deserving
working poor from receiving basic benefits, like health care and
food stamps, to which they are legally entitled. Nationwide, a
million people have lost Medicaid benefits and are now uninsured.
As a result, many working families are worse off financially than
they were under the old system.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, by contrast, has offered ample assistance _ cash
allowances to supplement income, job training, more opportunities
for health and child care _ in addition to requiring that welfare
recipients work. The approach hasn't been cheap, but the results,
according to a widely praised study released in June, have been
remarkable: not only have poverty and homelessness declined but the
marriage rate has also risen, domestic abuse is down, truancy rates
have fallen and children are doing better in school.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to help kids, in short, is not to recruit strangers
to take the place of parents, but to help those _ their families
and teachers _ who are already in the best position to help them.
That's not to say that volunteering has no value. But it doesn't
offer a systematic solution to entrenched problems like hunger,
poverty or homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   I now live in Texas, but I am not happy to have abandoned my
kids. While I would be lying if I said I didn't sometimes still
wish that my kids' lives had never become linked to mine, in truth,
when I try to imagine my life without them in it, I can't.

   MORMONS-HINCKLEY _ SALT LAKE CITY _ Mormon president Gordon
Hinckley turns 90 with a birthday bash that includes Atlanta native
Gladys Knight singing with the Mormon Tabernacle choir. In an
exclusive interview on his birthday, we ask Hinckley about how and
why he has taken the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
more public during his tenure, and ask him about Mormon growth
around the world, especially in the Southeast. (GWhite, Atlanta

   TRUE-LOVE _ True love may wait, but Bill Hayes couldn't. Yes, he
promised back in 1993 to postpone having sex until he was married.
And yes, he held hands with hundreds of other young Christians at
The King's Academy in West Palm Beach and pledged to stay pure. He
even signed a True Love Waits card with the sincerest of
intentions. But that was when he was just 16, before he fell in
love for the first time. ``I didn't plan it or anything,'' said
Hayes, now 23. ``We were dating for nine months. I really cared
about her.'' The moral of this story, supporters of abstinence
programs will tell you, is not that Hayes failed to live up to his
commitment _ though they condemn his failure. It's that abstinence
until marriage has become a socially acceptable standard that Hayes
and other teenagers have set for themselves since they began their
campaign, a movement that has found its way into public school sex
education curriculums. And therein lies their victory. And the
controversy. (Belkin, Dayton Daily News) WITH PHOTOS.

   CYC-TOUR-LANCE _ Feature story on defending Tour de France
champion Lance Armstrong. Tour director Jean Marie LeBlanc calls
Armstrong the best winner the Tour can imagine. ``The rebirtth of
Armstrong is amazing and is good for the rebirth of the Tour,''
LeBlanc said. (Halliburton, Austin American-Statesman). 36.

   CYC-TOUR-STRATEGY _ As the U.S. Postal Service riders gathered
at Futuroscope for the start of the Tour de France, Austinite Kevin
Livingston was asked via telephone about the team's strategy. ``The
overall plan is to get into Paris with Lance wearing the yellow
jersey,'' Livingston chuckled. (Maher, Austin American-Statesman)

<P>
   CYC-TOUR-COMPETE _ Some well-known cyclists claim that defending
Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong's recent achievements are
that monumental. These cyclists, including French hero Laurent
Jalabert, claim it was Armstrong's unique preparation and not his
immense talent that got him his incredible Tour win in 1999.
(Halliburton, Austin American-Statesman). 37.

<P>
   CYC-TOUR-CONTENDERS _ The 1999 Tour de France field wasn't
considered strong, that for the first time in 43 years there was no
defending champion. This year's field, however, is strong and will
include two other Tour champions joining Austin's Lance Armstrong,
the 1999 victor. Armstrong still is clearly the favorite, but he
should be pressed more than last year when he finished with a
7-minute, 37-second cushion over runner-up Alex Zulle. Armstrong's
margin of victory was the fourth largest posted in the past 20
years. (Halliburton, Austin American-Statesman). 21. MOVED.

   CYC-TOUR-FATIGUE _ The Tour de France is the most physically
demanding major sporting event in the world. It's tortuous mountain
climbs and desperate sprints contested over 2,255.7 miles and 21

   The machine itself is nothing much to look at. It's just a
standard laptop computer connected to some common syringe-driving
equipment. What is truly unsettling is the far from prosaic use to
which it has been put. Just by hooking themselves up to it and
tapping in a few very basic commands, four terminally ill patients
have managed to end their own lives under the watchful eyes of
their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   It was developed by an Australian doctor, Philip Nitschke. In
the mid-1990s, the government of the Northern Territory passed a
law permitting voluntary euthanasia under strictly defined
conditions. This law was in force for only a few months before the
Federal House of Representatives legislated to override it. In this
short period, however, four patients obtained permission to end
their lives, and did so with the help of Nitschke's machine.
</P>
<P>
   So why did we decide to buy and display this machine in the
biggest ever development in the Science Museum, the Wellcome Wing?
The answer is simple. Voluntary euthanasia is a big issue. Whether
doctors should be permitted to help terminally ill patients who
want to die is an agonizingly difficult question about which honest
people of good conscience manifestly disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one member of Parliment has written to criticize us for
staging a public debate on the issue of voluntary euthanasia. Yet
surely facilitating a better informed debate on the morally and
socially contentious areas is an essential part of the remit of a
museum of science and technology or art?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Science Museum is committed to dealing with
substantial issues that concern the public, however delicate or
difficult they may be. For example, one of the first exhibits on
the ground floor of the Wellcome Wing will deal with the extremely
controversial question of the use of drugs in international
athletics. This is such a contentious subject that parts of this
exhibit have had to be approved by the museum's lawyers to protect
us from court action.
</P>
<P>
   So the new wing was absolutely the right place for it. In
keeping with the times, the Wellcome Wing won't simply impart
information, it will try to engage visitors in dialogue about the
wider questions that 21st-century scientific ideas and innovations
are raising. Through multiple electronic terminals dotted around
the wing, visitors will be able to express their own views on the
scientific, medical and technological issues of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Nitschke appears to have been motivated by two main desires: to
leave the final decision to die in the hands of the terminally ill
themselves, and to provide them with a means of dying that allowed
them to be surrounded by their loved ones at the key moment rather
than by professional caretakers.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's motives are very different. Our main aim is to
stimulate informed public debate about what is unquestionably an
important ethical, legal and social issue.

   For three decades, Milan Kurepa was professor of physics at the
University of Belgrade. But he resigned in 1998 after watching his
once-thriving lab become what he calls ``a workplace of ghosts''
as, one by one, colleagues and students fled the country. Rather
than suffer in silence, he agreed to speak to New Scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Sandford traveled to Belgrade to hear his story.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: You're a known critic of the Milosevic regime. Have
you suffered personally in any way because of that?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: I've never been harassed or threatened. I know some
academics who have been harassed and even fired because of their
anti-Milosevic political affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give you an example of the kinds of things that happen to
me. A few months ago, I was at a conference of 400 university
physicists and high school teachers. I was due to lecture on the
1998 University Act. This act was brought in by the Milosevic
regime to ensure that all appointments are made on party loyalty,
rather than academic or intellectual ability. It was designed to
stifle universities as centers of free thought and free speech.
</P>
<P>
   I arrived at the lecture theater and it was locked and the three
physicists at the conference who belonged to Milosevic's ruling
Socialist Party _ two of whom were organizers _ refused to let me
give the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: Surely the new law doesn't actually state:
``Appointments will only be made on party loyalty?''
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: Under the new law, all rectors, deans and vice-deans of
universities will be appointed by the Ministry of Education instead
of by the universities themselves. Moreover, these deans now have
the power to hire and fire staff without appeal. This effectively
politicizes the university system and makes appointments dependent
on party loyalty, not academic criteria.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: Is this why you resigned from your university post?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: I did not want to be put in a position where a minister
of education _ a puppet of the ruling party _ has the power to
decide whether or not I can be a professor. We were also asked to
sign a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   This was, in a way, affirming support for the regime. I did not
want to do that. So I preferred to retire. A wave of resignations
and firings have occurred because of the university law. Around 150
academics either quit or were sacked from Belgrade University.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: How has your scientific work been affected by the
breakup of Yugoslavia, the wars between Serbia and its neighbors,
sanctions, and last year's NATO-led bombing campaign?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: In 1990, I had a thriving atomic physics lab with an
18-person staff. We tried to stay at the cutting edge of discovery.
We were planning to work with polarized electrons. Ten years later,
Serbian science is at the level it was in the 1950s. Most of the
staff _ people I nurtured myself _ have left for other countries,
or retired.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: Most UN sanctions against Serbia have now been lifted.
But this doesn't appear to have helped ordinary people like you. If
anything, it seems to have consolidated Milosevic's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: That's a false statement. Now, at least, there is some
free flow of information. When sanctions were in force, Milosevic
used to say to people: ``Look at the EU and the West. They are
against people in Yugoslavia.'' He was able to use sanctions to win
support from people and whip up anti-Western feeling. This was
particularly strong after last year's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember the details of sanctions against South Africa,
but I know that in Iraq children are dying because of sanctions. Is
that Western policy? What kind of policy is that? Has the United
States succeeded in bringing down Castro in nearly 40 years of
sanctions against Cuba? Are there any politicians willing to think
about people _ not about one leader? Poor people suffer, but the
sanctions don't affect the ruling party. Yet most sanctions against
Serbia were lifted quite a while back.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: Aren't you free to travel and resume contacts with
colleagues abroad? I hardly know where to start. We expected to
travel all across Western Europe. Years ago, under the Marshal Tito
regime, Yugoslavia's was the best passport to have in the whole of
Eastern Europe. Now gaining a visa takes time and money. I need a
letter of invitation to go to a conference. Someone has to
guarantee that they will support me with sufficient funds to cover
my basic needs. Sometimes, this is quite a humiliating process.
Then I must wait between two days and two weeks for a visa.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom to travel should have enabled me to visit my former
students in other countries and to re-establish connections with
colleagues abroad and with institutions such as the International
Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. Visits abroad should have meant
guest lectures and joint papers and even joint projects, as well as
access to journals and the chance to buy instruments and equipment.
We probably would also have been able to generate additional
funding. But none of this happened.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: How do you carry out research when you're starved of
contact with the outside world?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: It is not possible to do serious research without
journals, without textbooks, with intermittent water and
electricity, because our experiments take at least a week to do and
we need constant power. Often, we just have to improvise.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: How do you improvise?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: We have a long tradition of improvisation. For the five
years before the collapse of Yugoslavia, we were smuggling in
equipment. We have ended up smuggling all kinds of things in, like
the time a colleague in Manchester brought in parts for an electron
scattering machine. In 1985, I also managed to bring in a large
metal shield, about six feet square, from France. I was fine at
Paris airport but when I reached Belgrade the customs offer asked
what it was and was very suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember how many times during the late 1980s I crossed
the border between Serbia and neighboring countries with gaskets,
potentiometers and other equipment hidden in my pockets, bags,
suitcases, anywhere. Perhaps the most amusing time was when I was
in Brussels and wanted to bring home some xenon gas. It's stored at
very high pressures. We asked the Yugoslav Ambassador if he would
bring it in diplomatic bags, but he refused. A colleague eventually
tried to take it on a plane. When it was X-rayed at the airport,
the security guard asked what it was. When he was told it was gas
under pressure, he just screamed: ``Get it out of here! Get it out
of here!''
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: If it is so difficult to travel to the West, what
about your Western colleagues? Have they maintained contact with
you?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: Some have been very helpful. But generally people have
not been supportive. So many of them never cared enough to even ask
if, for example, we were all right, how we lived, whether we needed
anything. I get letters from some Japanese physicists from the
University of Kyoto, but I have had arguments with my colleagues
from France. Britons are very quiet: they just don't say anything.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: Why do you think your colleagues in other countries
have been largely silent?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: I think in most cases they began to believe the
anti-Serbian propaganda in their countries. They believed all those
stories. All the propaganda that said Serbian people were killing
and raping Croatians and Bosnians, that we are beasts.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: Was this really all propaganda? Surely, some of it was
true?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: We have a very troubled history in this country _
atrocities have been committed by Serbs and against Serbs. Some
Serbs have been killing and raping, but I believe much that has
been reported is not true.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: Bluntly speaking, can you blame us for being
indifferent? After all, we live comfortable lives. No scientist in
a Western country is suffering because of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: If you believe that science is global, then I'm
convinced you should care about your colleagues in other countries.
Colleagues from all over the world are adding to the body of
knowledge called science. It isn't just those in Western Europe. We
in Serbia are no different. If we suffer, then science suffers. We
physicists treat one another as an international gang. We support
each other. It's a sense of togetherness. If I work in five or six
countries, I treat my colleagues there as I treat those here in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: Let's move on. In terms of the future, what
specifically would you like your overseas colleagues to do now?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: There is one thing that they can do: supply us with
journals _ preferably from 1991 onwards. Believe it or not, in the
university, we haven't been getting journals for eight years or
more. We don't know what's going on in our fields, which is fatal
for any scientist.
</P>
<P>
   There's a phrase in physics: ``inventing hot water.'' We've done
it several times over here _ believing that we have discovered
something, only to learn that it has already been discovered and
written about. We didn't know because we did not have the journal
articles.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: Are there any examples where you've written a paper on
something that's already been discovered?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: I recently wrote a paper on inert gas ionization and the
electronic states of molecules, and submitted it to various
journals. One referee wrote back to say that something similar had
already been done, and that the reference was missing from my
submission. But how was I to know? We don't get any journals. This
has happened more than once.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: Countries at war often pay more attention to science _
particularly its military aspects _ than in peacetime. Is this the
case in Serbia? Are any areas of science doing well?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: No areas of science are doing well here. The government
has specialist institutions for defense-related projects, but they
were bombed. I really don't know so much about them.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: Are you unwilling to talk about this because of your
personal security?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: No, if someone's working for defense then they are of
course not allowed to talk about it. That's the same in the United
States and Britain. But I don't want to be involved in questions
about military institutions and defense. I just don't like it. If
my intention when I graduated was to work with the military I would
have gone there straight from university and had a big flat. I
didn't choose to do that. That's the choice. And now I'm a poor
person. It was simply that I chose a different way of life and a
different path.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: Do you think Serbia's present hardship is a price
worth paying, that it may lead to democracy?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: I don't like that question.
</P>
<P>
   SANDFORD: Why don't you like it?
</P>
<P>
   KUREPA: Because behind the question I feel propaganda again.
This is not a logical question. We were brought into this state of
nihilism by our authorities and nobody asked us if we were ready to
pay any price for this stupidity. We don't have democracy here. I
can't see any connection between the current situation in the
country and the possibility of democracy. We are under an
oppressive government and no one asked us if we wanted this current
situation. &QL;

<P>
   To summer hikers and tourists it may look pretty. But America's
Great Smoky Mountains National Park, shrouded in a hazy cloak of
ozone and sulphur dioxide, may be a veritable hell for its rich
spectrum of plant life _ as well as for visitors who suffer from
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is the notoriously high pollution levels in this
swathe of land straddling Tennessee and North Carolina that create
the beautiful pastel-colored sunsets that draw in the sightseers.
</P>
<P>
   This month there will be a few extra visitors to the park, but
they won't be there for the view. Scientists intend to conduct a
novel experiment _ making use of the park's smoggy air to
investigate how wild plants survive and adapt to air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone's ability to damage plants is hardly news. When airborne
concentrations of the gas exceed around 40 parts per billion, some
plants wilt and die. Others become peppered with unsightly spots
and blotches. But so far, the focus has been on agricultural crops.
There is a lot of evidence that crop plants can be bred for
resistance to high levels of ozone, but much less is known about
whether wild plants can also develop resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, ozone concentrations in the park, boosted by winds
that swirl from distant cities such as Chicago, Detroit and even
New York, reached an all-time high of 128 parts per billion. This
is more than three times the level that is considered to be
dangerous for agricultural plants. So how will wild plants be
affected?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers hope that the Great Smoky Mountains Park
project, funded by the National Geographic Society, could give them
the answer. So in Britain, Alan Davison, professor of agricultural
and environmental science at the University of Newcastle, has lots
of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Davison wants to know to what extent the noxious pollution
levels are killing off certain species. He also hopes to find out
how quickly individual species adapt to the harsh conditions. The
answer may have important implications for the way we try to
preserve rare flora in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Davison will fly out to the park to join Howard Neufeld of the
Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C, and Art Chappelka of
Auburn University in Alabama. They are going to set up two gardens
in the park, each at a different altitude. Neufeld has selected
five species known to be sensitive to ozone for the gardens,
including tall milkweed (Ascelpias exaltata) and cutleaf coneflower
(Rudbekia laciniata).
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld suspects that altitude influences the extent of damage,
because ozone generally lingers for longer at higher altitudes. By
analyzing the genetic make-up of hardy and weak specimens of a
species at both altitudes, Davison aims to identify important genes
and eventually crossbreed strains to produce hardy varieties.
</P>
<P>
   During the study, which will initially run for two years with
long-term follow-up, he hopes to see whether vulnerable strains
will simply die or naturally crossbreed with the hardier varieties
and develop resistant traits. By forcing individual species to
evolve tolerance or die, it should then be possible to work out the
long-term effects of high ozone levels.
</P>
<P>
   The results of earlier research projects have hinted at the
outcome. In the mid-1990s, Davison and his colleagues at Newcastle
showed that the common plantain (Plantago major), an abundant weed
that colonizes paths and waste ground throughout northern temperate
regions, develops tolerance to ozone.
</P>
<P>
   However, back in the early days of the Industrial Revolution,
researchers found that wallflowers couldn't survive in the
sulphur-choked air of Leeds, a Yorkshire town that spearheaded the
Industrial Revolution. Around the same time, Scots pine was wiped
out in all the industrial cities in northern England, and
rhododendrons struggled to grow in urban Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, says Davison, some plants benefited from the smog.
Sulphur pollution eradicated a rose disease, black spot, and tar
spot, which affects sycamore trees. The two diseases only returned
when the air became cleaner. Hardy natives In the 1970s and 1980s,
pioneering work by Nigel Bell of Imperial College, London, showed
that some grasses could handle pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1971, we looked at perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) the
most important pasture grass of temperate regions,'' he says. ``All
the native varieties had evolved tolerance to sulphur dioxide, and
had displaced sensitive varieties.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the publicity surrounding acid rain damage to European
forests at the time, clean air legislation helped to cleanse the
air of sulphur. The focus then switched to ozone. During sunny
weather, oxides of nitrogen combine with hydrocarbons emitted from
vehicles and power stations to form ozone.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, as levels of the gas continued to remain worryingly
high, Dave Karnosky of Michigan Technological University in
Houghton identified enclaves of aspen in the US which had become
resistant to ozone. In more recent, and still unpublished
experiments, Karnosky isolated and cloned aspens that were either
resistant or sensitive to ozone. Next, he planted mixtures of the
two at sites of high, intermediate and low ozone pollution, to see
how they would cope. His preliminary results, presented this May in
Houghton at a conference on air pollution and forest damage, show
that at the highest ozone level, the sensitive clones were 40 per
cent more likely to die. Resistant clones at this level had trunks
twice the diameter of their sensitive counterparts-indicative of
their better health.
</P>
<P>
   None of the previous studies reveals how quickly individual
species of wild plants become completely resistant, and what impact
this might have on rival species and biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know what happens in wild populations,'' says
Allen Heagle, professor of plant pathology at North Carolina State
University.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Great Smoky Mountains Park study may reveal.
</P>
<P>
   The list of unanswered questions is long. Heagle has shown that
if you expose individual clover plants to ozone, some will survive
and some won't. But how would the resistance trait be carried
forward in future generations of wild species? Would it be
``diluted'' through sexual reproduction with less resistant
variants?
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the tougher strains should begin to dominate but,
says Heagle, it's unclear how much the genes from weaker varieties
will slow them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's got to be some adaptation, but in the real world you
get dilution, so it could take a thousand years to show,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And resistance might develop at the expense of other traits,
such as color or general appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plants might survive ozone, but look ugly,'' says Heagle.
</P>
<P>
   Bell of Imperial College agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are costs of becoming tolerant to a pollutant,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Bell notes that if the pollution disappears, the sensitive
strains might re-emerge to outcompete the resistant strains, which
may have to waste energy to defeat the pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The Smoky Mountains research should bring some valuable new
clues to what is going on. But however hardy wild plants turn out
to be, the researchers stress the importance of continuing to
reduce pollution levels. Bell's current research, for example, has
revealed the horrendous damage to crops caused by ozone in Pakistan
and India and Davison's group has demonstrated that some crops in
Europe are vulnerable. Karnosky agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about tolerance, it's only in degrees, and they
are still damaged, even when tolerant, with reduced health and
vigor,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Effects on human health, such as aggravation of asthma and other
bronchial conditions, underline the need to curtail air pollution.
But emergence of plants that cope with our pollution is a reminder
that nature has a history of adapting to stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should never stop reducing the amount of pollution, but
things do adapt through natural selection,'' says Karnosky.
``Forests are constantly changing, and what we see now is not what
it was like as little as 100 years ago,'' he says. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Road traffic will regularly grind to a halt and train services
will increasingly be disrupted as a result of global warming, a
scientist at Britain's Meteorological Office recently announced.
Anthony Astbury told a conference organized by Britain's Transport
Research Laboratory about the havoc to come for road and rail
travelers over the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The average temperature of the world is now 0.8 degrees Celsius
higher than it was in 1900. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change expects the temperature to rise by a further 3 degrees
Celsius by 2100. As the world warms up, extreme weather will become
more common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things will gradually get worse,'' Astbury said. ``We're
already seeing the first changes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, rain and snow will come in short sharp bursts.
Although the total rainfall won't change a lot, downpours will
replace drizzle. Snowfalls will be less frequent but heavier. Falls
such as the one that closed the M6 motorway for 36 hours in
December 1990 will become more common, Astbury said. But the
disruption is unlikely to last long. In 1990, ``the snow
disappeared in two days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trains will be held up by the wrong kind of ice _ a change from
the notorious excuse of the wrong kind of snow. There will be fewer
dry, frosty winter mornings, but more nights when rain and melted
snow freeze on the conductor rails.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain will also cause problems. The Met Office expects the
number of days when more than 25 millimeters of rain falls to
increase by 250 percent, causing flooding and landslides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landslips could badly affect railways,'' Astbury said. And
with the ground waterlogged, trees are more likely to be brought
down by high winds, damaging overhead power supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Astbury says that lightning will become common throughout the
year in Britain, instead of being a summertime phenomenon. A
spokesman for Railtrack, which owns Britain's rail infrastructure,
said they have already noticed this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was the worst ever for lightning strikes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, lightning caused four times the delays to passengers as
previous years. Railtrack has set up a lightning task force to find
ways of preventing power surges caused by strikes to overhead wires
and conductor rails, which bring the trains to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   The warmer weather will disrupt transport systems throughout the
world. In the snow belt of the United States and in Russia, Astbury
says, the temperature now stays below freezing from November to
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite easy to drive on compacted snow if you have the
right equipment, such as snow chains,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But warmer weather will melt and freeze the snow several times
during the winter, replacing compacted snow with hazardous black
ice.
</P>
<P>
   Transport is one of the key sources of the carbon dioxide
emissions that are warming the world. The irony isn't lost on
Astbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate bites back,'' he observed. &QL;

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Roman Catholic Archbishop Patrick Flores wants the
man who held him hostage for nine hours earlier this week to get
some psychological help.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I saw yesterday, I saw a very sick man,'' Flores
said Thursday, a day after the ordeal at his chancery office.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop said he was not in a position to recommend
whether Nelson Antonio Escolero, 40, the man charged in the hostage
taking, should face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am suggesting very highly,'' Flores, 70, said, ``that the
man be given the blessing and privilege of psychological
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Escolero, a native of El Salvador who has been in the United
States for 25 years, was being held in Bexar County Jail in lieu of
$2 million bond in connection with the incident Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Flores recounted his ordeal during a news conference held at the
San Antonio chancery, two floors below the office where he was held
captive.
</P>
<P>
   Unharmed and in good spirits after an overnight stay at Christus
Santa Rosa Hospital, the Catholic leader recalled that he tried to
help Escolero with immigration problems, but that the man
threatened him with what he claimed was a grenade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never seen one,'' Flores said. ``I don't even carry a
pocketknife.''
</P>
<P>
   The weapon turned out to be a harmless military training
grenade, police bomb squad officer Rocky Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   Escolero told Flores he had been arrested twice for possession
of marijuana in 1984 and had paid the fines, but in 1999 he was
jailed and deported for his crimes 15 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted his immigration papers back so he could take his wife
and family to Cuba, ``the only place,'' he said, ``not infected by
capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the afternoon, they were busy with phone
conversations with police negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio police said that a sniper was positioned to take
action if negotiators failed to persuade Escolero to put down his
weapon and release Flores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at every option,'' police Lt. Dan Akeroyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Akeroyd, who heads the police department's special operations,
acknowledged his SWAT team includes snipers and that one of his
marksmen was in position to shoot if necessary in during the
nine-hour standoff that began at 10:22 a.m. Wednesday inside the
Catholic Chancery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the sniper had in his sights,'' Akeroyd
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that he believed the sniper could see inside
the third-floor office where Flores was being held.
</P>
<P>
   About 6 p.m., Flores decided to do his own negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make a pledge to you,'' he recalled telling
Escolero. ``If you do not kill yourself, I will look for a lawyer
or two to look into why you're being deported. I'll even pay for a
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores also told Escolero he would be happy to help his wife and
family with food vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will walk out of here with my hands raised and your hands
raised, too,'' Flores told Escolero. ``You have to leave the
grenade on top of my desk. In the name of God, in the name of
Jesus, in the name of your family, in the name of everybody else, I
ask you not to take life.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, he said OK. But he said, `You better keep
your promise.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two men walked out of the office holding onto each other. In
the hallway, they confronted police officers. They were told to put
their hands up and then turn around in a circle so they could check
for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Escolero asked to lie down on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the last time I saw him,'' Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said Escolero obviously has psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt that he was a very angry individual, and that
psychologically he was very shaky.''

SENATE PASSES BILL THAT INCLUDES FUNDS FOR KOSOVO PEACEKEEPING AND
COLOMBIA  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ala., Conn., Calif)  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress completed work Friday on an $11.2 billion
spending bill that includes more than $1 billion in emergency aid
to battle drug traffickers and their rebel allies in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the measure by voice vote with virtually no
debate just after noon EDT and sent it to President Clinton for his
signature as Congress was preparing to adjourn for the weeklong
July 4 recess.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approval followed passage in the House late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., complained that the measure contained
too many ``pork barrel'' elements of the kind common to legislation
pushed through in the waning hours of a session.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest controversy concerned the centerpiece of the
legislation, $1.3 billion in assistance to help train and equip
Colombian army and police forces. A crucial component is a fleet of
sophisticated transport and attack helicopters to ferry Colombian
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in both parties have warned that the aid to Colombia
would encourage a dangerous escalation in an unwinnable
Vietnam-style conflict that has already claimed thousands of lives
in the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters, including Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and
Clinton, have pushed hard to help an important Latin American ally
stem the tide of drugs flowing into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to do anything to combat drugs, we must be
responsive to the people who have pledged to fight this plague,''
said Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., who heads the House
Appropriations Panel, which oversees foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will also finance the military's peacekeeping mission
in Kosovo, provide disaster relief to flood and wildfire victims in
the United States and make a down payment on a new Second Avenue
subway in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate Republican leaders had bickered for months over
how to package the aid. The House passed a similar $12.7 billion
omnibus bill in late March, but Sen. Trent Lott, the majority
leader, balked at bundling such a wide range of aid, fearing it
would be a magnet for pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   As the months dragged on with no action, the Pentagon warned
that without prompt financing the armed services would have to
begin canceling training exercises. President Andres Pastrana of
Colombia cautioned that the delay was hurting his country's
anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators finally worked out a compromise
this week on the size and scope of the package and tacked it on to
a popular spending bill for military construction projects. The
final House vote was 306-110, with 171 Republicans and 135
Democrats in favor, and 44 Republicans, 64 Democrats and two
independents against.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans had also hoped to attach an amendment to
permit the limited sale of food and medicine to Cuba. But the
language agreed upon by House Republicans drew a filibuster threat
from Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who said the legislation would
do more harm than good.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Cuba amendment would bar public and private U.S. financing
for the sale of food and medicine, and it would turn into law
current regulations that restrict which groups _ including
relatives and educators _ can visit Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so wrong, so outrageous,'' said Dodd, who supports
lifting sanctions altogether. ``Only poor and innocent people
suffer when you bar food and medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Cuba leaves the amendment's future uncertain.
House Republicans said they hoped to attach it to an agriculture
spending bill after the holiday recess, but if Democratic
objections persist, the deal could be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package also includes $2 billion to pay for costs the
Pentagon has incurred this year as part of the NATO mission in
Kosovo. The bill provides the military with $1.6 billion to cover
rising fuel costs and $1.3 billion to supplement its health care
program.
</P>
<P>
   Aid was not confined to foreign emergencies. The package has
$661 million to pay reconstruction costs for the 400 families in
Los Alamos, N.M., who lost their homes after the devastating fire
there two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also tucked in were odds and ends like $17.5 million to improve
fire safety in the Capitol, $4.5 million to reimburse the District
of Columbia police department for costs related to protests at the
recent meetings of the International Monetary Fund and $3 million
toward a new Second Avenue subway in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But easily the most contentious part of the package focused on
the anti-narcotics aid to Colombia and other countries in the
region, including Ecuador and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   This assistance will lead to a much larger U.S. role in helping
Colombia crack down on a flourishing narcotics trade in
rebel-controlled territory in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes 18 Blackhawk helicopters and 42 Huey II
helicopters to ferry special Colombian army battalions and
Colombian National Police. The mix of aircraft represents a
compromise between the House, which favored the larger, more
expensive Blackhawks, and the Senate, which wanted only the less
costly Hueys.
</P>
<P>
   To help address the critics' concerns about the Colombian
military's poor human rights record, the bill included $122 million
for programs to promote human rights and justice in the region, $29
million more than the administration had requested.
</P>
<P>
   With fears of an open-ended military commitment hanging heavy
over many members, the bill has a provision that limits the number
of U.S. military personnel in support of the Colombia mission to
500 at any one time, unless more are needed for a rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying we want to help, but only if you assure us you do
not abuse human rights and prosecute any violators who do,'' said
Rep. Sam Farr, a California Democrat who lived in Colombia for two
years as a Peace Corps volunteer. ``If you are using this aid to
help the insurgents, you lose the helicopters.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid will support an antidrug plan that Pastrana
announced last year, after working closely with U.S. officials. The
strategy, called Plan Colombia, seeks $3.5 billion in international
aid in the next three years. Beside the enforcement components, the
plan envisions public investment to stimulate Colombia's
beleaguered economy.

56 GREAT RISK-TAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, July 3)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted 12-0 _ New York
abstained _ in favor of Richard Henry Lee's resolution ``that these
United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent
States.'' On July 4, the Declaration of Independence drafted by
Thomas Jefferson _ heavily edited by Congress _ was adopted without
dissent. On July 8, the Declaration was publicly proclaimed in
Philadelphia. On July 15, Congress learned that the New York
Legislature had decided to endorse the Declaration. On Aug. 2, a
parchment copy was presented to the Congress for signature. Most of
the 56 men who put their name to the document did so that day.
</P>
<P>
   And then?
</P>
<P>
   We tend to forget that to sign the Declaration of Independence
was to commit an act of treason _ and the punishment for treason
was death. To publicly accuse George III of ``repeated injuries and
usurpations,'' to announce that Americans were therefore ``Absolved
from all Allegiance to the British Crown,'' was a move fraught with
danger _ so much so that the names of the signers were kept secret
for six months.
</P>
<P>
   They were risking everything, and they knew it. That is the
meaning of the Declaration's soaring last sentence:
</P>
<P>
   ``And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance
on the Protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each
other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the signers survived the war; several went on to
illustrious careers. Two of them became presidents of the United
States, and among the others were future vice presidents, senators,
and governors. But not all were so fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 56 died during the Revolution, and never tasted
American independence.
</P>
<P>
   Five were captured by the British. Eighteen had their homes _
great estates, some of them _ looted or burned by the enemy. Some
lost everything they owned. Two were wounded in battle. Two others
were the fathers of sons killed or captured during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.'' It was not
just a rhetorical flourish.
</P>
<P>
   We all recognize John Hancock's signature, but who ever notices
the names beneath his? William Ellery, Thomas Nelson, Richard
Stockton, Button Gwinnett, Francis Lewis _ to most of us, these are
names without meaning. But each represents a real human being, some
of whom paid dearly ``for the support of this Declaration'' and
American independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Morris of New York, for example, must have known when he
signed the Declaration that he was signing away his fortune. Within
weeks, the British ravaged his estate, destroyed his vast
woodlands, butchered his cattle, and sent his family fleeing for
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Another New Yorker, William Floyd, was also forced to flee when
the British plundered his property. He and his family lived as
refugees for seven years without income. The strain told on his
wife; she died two years before the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   Carter Braxton of Virginia, an aristocratic planter who had
invested heavily in shipping, saw most of his vessels captured by
the British navy. His estates were largely ruined, and by the end
of his life he was a pauper.
</P>
<P>
   The home of William Ellery, a Rhode Island delegate, was burned
to the ground during the occupation of Newport.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Heyward Jr., Edward Rutledge, and Arthur Middleton, three
members of the South Carolina delegation, all suffered the
destruction or vandalizing of their homes at the hands of enemy
troops. All three were captured when Charleston fell in 1780, and
spent a year in a British prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Nelson Jr. of Virginia raised $2 million for the
patriots' cause on his own personal credit. The government never
reimbursed him, and repaying the loans wiped out his entire estate.
During the battle of Yorktown, his house, which had been seized by
the British, was occupied by General Cornwallis. Nelson quietly
urged the gunners to fire on his own home. They did so, destroying
it. He was never again a man of wealth. He died bankrupt and was
buried in an unmarked grave.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Stockton, a judge on New Jersey's supreme court, was
betrayed by loyalist neighbors. He was dragged from his bed and
thrown in prison, where he was brutally beaten and starved. His
lands were devastated, his horses stolen, his library burned. He
was freed in 1777, but his health had so deteriorated that he died
within five years. His family lived on charity for the rest of
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the British assault on New York, Francis Lewis's home and
property were pillaged. His wife was captured and imprisoned; so
harshly was she treated that she died soon after her release. Lewis
spent the remainder of his days in relative poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was John Hart. The speaker of the New Jersey
Assembly, he was forced to flee in the winter of 1776, at the age
of 65, from his dying wife's bedside. While he hid in forests and
caves, his home was demolished, his fields and mill laid waste, and
his 13 children put to flight. When it was finally safe for him to
return, he found his wife dead, his children missing, and his
property decimated. He never saw any of his family again and died,
a shattered man, in 1779.
</P>
<P>
   The men who signed that piece of parchment in 1776 were the
elite of their colonies. They were men of means and social
standing, but for the sake of liberty, they pledged it all _ their
lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. We are in their debt
to this day.

&HT;     AG INVESTIGATING FORMER CALIFORNIA INSURANCE OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is
investigating whether a former Insurance Department official
received kickbacks funneled through a football camp attended by the
children of Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. Quackenbush resigned
earlier this week for allegedly using insurance company fines to
help advance his own political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer's office is investigating allegations that former
department official George Grays pocketed up to $90,000 from the
Sacramento-based Skillz Athletics Foundation, sources said. Skillz,
in turn, had been given $263,000 by a foundation Grays created with
fines levied against insurance companies, documents and testimony
show.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer acknowledged for the first time Thursday that he was
conducting a criminal investigation into Grays' activities at the
Department of Insurance, one day after Quackenbush resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for Lockyer, would not comment on
the investigation, except to say: ``We have obtained documents that
have raised questions, and among the documents have been check
payments to George Grays.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations are the first that someone within the Department
of Insurance may have personally benefited from the $12.5 million
in fines Quackenbush imposed on several insurance companies
following the 1994 Northridge earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, a Republican, quit before the Assembly Insurance
Committee was prepared to question him and others about how the
settlement money was spent.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said they already had significant evidence Quackenbush
and his chief aides were using the money for a ``perpetual
political campaign'' instead of helping earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say it surprises me very much to also find out there
was a considerable amount of potential criminal activity
surrounding that as well,'' said Democratic Assemblyman Fred
Keeley, a member of the committee that investigated Quackenbush and
the department. ``Frankly, this was an operation that was wildly
out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Grays' lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. Grays has
repeatedly declined to answer questions posed by lawmakers and
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   No one has accused Quackenbush of diverting money into his bank
account. Quackenbush's political consultants were hired by the
earthquake foundations and money went to television and radio
commercials that prominently featured the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Shumate, a GOP political consultant to Quackenbush, was paid
$175,000 from the earthquake fund in connection with $3 million in
TV ads featuring Quackenbush and another $100,000 to develop ways
to sell insurance in minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush has said the earthquake foundation money donated to
Skillz Athletics and other nonprofit groups, such as $500,000 to
the Sacramento Urban League, was designed to reach out to minority
communities typically underserved by the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   Grays joined the Insurance Department in December 1998 as chief
deputy after serving as Quackenbush's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned in April 2000 and declined to testify before the
Assembly Insurance Committee, invoking his Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Brian T. Thompson, director of Skillz Athletics Foundation, has
not testified before the Legislature on his relationship to Grays
or on how his organization managed to receive $263,000 from a
nonprofit foundation supposedly set up to aid victims of the
Northridge earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Skillz foundation attorney Timothy Charshaf,
Thompson feels betrayed by Grays, who had been a friend for years.
</P>
<P>
   Charshaf acknowledged that Skillz had issued 11 checks to Grays
in recompense for his help in securing the $263,000 grant in 1999,
and to buy football equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it doesn't look right,'' he said. ``Let's just say that
my guy feels betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was originally scheduled to testify Monday at the
Assembly's investigative hearing, but did not show up.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented action, the Assembly ordered Thompson
arrested. But when Quackenbush resigned Wednesday, the committee
disbanded, and Thompson was released from his subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   The new information about Grays is just the latest on the
California Research and Assistance Fund, the nonprofit foundation
Grays helped set up with the insurance company fines.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was supposed to be wholly separate from the
Department of Insurance, but testimony showed Grays was deeply
involved in its activities even though he could not legally
represent its interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he had participation basically from soup to nuts,''
Keeley said. ``From beginning to end, he was the dominate figure in
all of that.''

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ They pushed and jostled in panic to board
the battered ferry, witnesses said, fleeing a massacre in which up
to 200 of their fellow villagers had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   They were the lucky ones, mostly women and children as well as
more than 30 wounded survivors, crammed aboard the old, wood-hulled
Cahaya Bahari, nearly doubling its licensed load to almost 500
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But only hours into their journey from the far eastern Maluku
islands of Indonesia to a haven on the island of Sulawesi, the ship
sent a distress signal, saying that its engines were dead and that
it was taking on water in heavy seas.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing more was heard from the ship, and Friday night, 30 hours
later, rescuers said they had found no trace of the Cahaya Bahari
or of its passengers or crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a miracle if we could find anyone still alive,''
Solaeman, the head of the search and rescue team, told the Reuters
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Antara news agency said that a life buoy had been
found, but it was not clear whether it came from the missing ship.
Searchers pulled two men from the stormy waters, but Solaeman said
they were fishermen from a separate capsized boat _ their lives
saved, perhaps, because of the loss of the Cahaya Bahari.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said strong currents might have swept the foundering
vessel or its passengers out toward the mouth of the Pacific Ocean
in stormy seas where the waves reached nine feet in height. They
said the waters are thick with sharks.
</P>
<P>
   At the small port of Manado, the vessel's destination, The
Associated Press reported that hundreds of relatives _ many of them
also refugees from a long-running religious conflict in Maluku _
clustered at the waterfront, sobbing and whispering.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do is pray and hope,'' said Ferry Potoboda, who
said he had 20 relatives on the missing vessel, including wounded
victims and children.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre on May 19 at the village of Duma on Halmahera
Island was one of the worst single incidents in a conflict between
Christians and Muslims that has taken the lives of more than 2,500
people since it erupted 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It involved an attack by Muslim gangs _ apparently including
fighters who had traveled to the region on inter-island ferries _
in what they described as revenge for a wave of killings by
Christians on the island last December.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people are
Muslim, but in the Maluku islands Muslims and Christians are evenly
divided. That has made the area fertile ground for agitators
seeking to create unrest in the hope of weakening the central
government in Jakarta.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The fighting first erupted in January 1999 in a marketplace
fight in Ambon that witnesses said appeared to be part of a planned
provocation to touch off a local war.
</P>
<P>
   In Ambon, the small, pretty city that is the center of the
Maluku islands, residents reported Friday that there was some
easing of violence four days after President Abdurrahman Wahid
declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear why that might be. The military is already
in control of Ambon but has lost much of its peacekeeping function
as soldiers have turned against each other according to their
religions, arming, aiding and sometimes apparently leading the
local fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers have broken ranks and joined the fighting as
partisans, and, as a result, Indonesian troops right now have
virtually no credibility in areas where a neutral force is most
desperately needed,'' said the New York-based monitoring group
Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   As the fighting has continued, ferries from Ambon and elsewhere
in the Maluku islands have carried away thousands of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Among other destinations, both Muslims and Christians have fled
to separate religious enclaves on Sulawesi island, where the
refugees aboard the Cahaya Bahari were headed.
</P>
<P>
   When the killings have flared, as they did last week in
Halmahera, small ports have become scenes of panic and anguish.
Crowds fight their way up narrow gangplanks, passing their
belongings and their children up above their heads. Some even
shinny up the ropes that moor the vessels.
</P>
<P>
   They are exchanging one danger for another. Indonesia's badly
maintained and overloaded ferries and the rough seas of the monsoon
season are deadly places to be. Disasters at sea are a way of life
in Indonesia's broad archipelago of thousands of islands.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of passengers have already died this year. Among them
were more than 40 people aboard the Masnait, a small ferry that
capsized and sank in May. They, too, were refugees fleeing the
fighting in Ambon.

 &HT;    CLINTON SIGNS LAW ALLOWING ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

   WASHINGTON _ Using a computer, President Clinton put his
electronic signature Friday on a bill allowing Americans to enter
into binding contracts on line.
</P>
<P>
   But he also had to use a pen to approve the ``Electronic
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.'' While the new law
gives Internet transactions legal status, it doesn't change the way
presidents have to sign bills.
</P>
<P>
   The law, effective Oct. 1, ``will open up new frontiers of
economic opportunity, while protecting the rights of private
citizens,'' Clinton said. ``With the swipe of a smart card and the
click of a mouse, (customers) will be able to finalize mortgages,
sign insurance contracts, or open brokerage accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony at Philadelphia's Congress Hall, near where
patriots once signed the Declaration of Independence, Clinton used
a computer to show off his e-signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, let's see if this works,'' he said, while inserting a
card encoded with his signature. He also entered the code name
``Buddy,'' which happens to be his dog's name. Then the
presidential signature popped up on the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it worked,'' he said to the audience, which included
about 100 business and college students. ``All of you young people
will someday look back on this day ... and marvel that it was
considered a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, supported in the House and Senate by
overwhelming margins, included most of the consumer protections
Clinton had sought. For example, the law requires that legal
notices that potentially affect health and safety be issued by
traditional means. Those exemptions include cancellation of
insurance, shut-off of electric service, court documents, eviction
notices and product recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those exemptions, industry welcomed the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Gould, executive vice president of iLumin Corp., a maker of
digital signature technology, said that by reducing paperwork,
eliminating couriers and speeding up transactions, online
signatures will result in ``tremendous cost savings'' for both
businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   E-signatures will become commonplace ``very, very quickly,''
Gouompanies that retain records in an electronic format.
</P>
<P>
   The e-signature law leaves open the choice of technology for
signing documents. For example, one method uses biometric
technology, which records fingerprints or scans eyes to verify a
person's identity.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology most likely to be used involves electronic
authentication for digital signatures. These methods involve giving
the parties entering a contract a secure set of mathematical
``keys'' that are virtually impossible to forge.

A CELEBRATION OF US CULTURE, FOR GOOD OR EVIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July   02)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While our blessed and beloved country is at the peak of its
power and wealth and cultural influence (for good or for ill) this
Fouth of July, there are some ways in which we are the poorer.
</P>
<P>
   And one of those is in the decline, and in some cases the
abandonment, of the spirit of comity and compromise in the US
Congress. Not even the searing conflicts of the Great Depression
split the Congress into such dysfunctional cleavage as we endure
today. Friday's Globe account about how Tip O'Neill convinced
Ronald Reagan to intercede 16 years ago with Margaret Thatcher to
foster a peace settlement in Northern Ireland shows how much
leaders of substance and grit can do to overcome the barbed wire
fences of ideology and partiswanship.
</P>
<P>
   It is the lack of such substantial leadership that we suffer
today. Timid and timorous politicians afraid to venture out from
their prepackaged positions can never make it to the statesman
level. There are many rungs on the ladder of leadership, but the
willingness to take on your own most partisan followers, and impose
on your own claque a deal that makes many of them howl, is the test
of statesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Globe reporter John Aloysius Farrell sifted through 10,000 pages
of Reagan White House papers relating to the Irish conflict, and
described how O'Neill and Reagan wove together a joint campaign to
foster Ulster peace while they were battling furiously and publicly
over tax cuts, retrenching of Great Society social programs, and
bitterly-divisive foreign policy issues such as US aid to the
Contra guerillas in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'80's, it was a Republican president battling a
Democratic-controlled House. That situtation is now reversed. But
the personal qualities of O'Neill and Reagan surmounted the snares
and temptations erected by foes of advancing the Irish peace
process. The State Department was, as ususal, tilting toward the
British position. Reagan acolytes trying to crowbar the Contra
money through Congress wanted Reagan to rebuff O'Neill's Irish
overture until the Speaker caved on funding the Latin American
dirty war.
</P>
<P>
   Once Reagan was won over by O'Neill, there was the matter of
Thatcher. The Iron Lady had narrowly escaped death when the
Provisional IRA _ ``terrorists,'' in O'Neill's private letter to
Reagan _ had bombed her seaside convention hotel in Brighton,
England. Some of her friends had been assassinated elsewhere by IRA
bombs. She had good reason to despise the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   But Reagan's undeniable affection for Thatcher thawed the Iron
Lady to the point where she acceded to his private entreaties. The
peace process lurched forward. O'Neill and Reagan advanced the
reputation and influence of the Irish moderates led by John Hume,
and the hard men of the IRA Provo units gradually lost ground as
diplomacy advanced.
</P>
<P>
   It culminated in the 1985 signing of the Anglo-Irish accord
granting the Republic of Ireland diplomatic standing to negotiate
directly with the British. And Thatcher's plumb was the invitation
from O'Neill to be the first of Britain's prime ministers since
Churchill to address a joint session of Congress. So with skill and
some schmoozing, some blarney and bluster, some backchannel
negotiation and some highlevel horsetrading, a worthy cause was
advanced by politicians willing to compromise and risk.
</P>
<P>
   Have we a similar stripe of leadership today? Fat chance. Every
House Speaker since O'Neill has fallen into the pit of
partisanship. Tom Foley got licked in the '94 uprising by a
Republican who brayed his support for term limits, only to weasel
out of his pledge once elected. Jim Wright got fanged by Newt
Gingrich, himself unhorsed by a revolt among his own conservative
horse soldiers. The current leader, Dennis Hastert, is widely if
not fairly regarded as a tool of his next-in-line supposed
subalterns, Texans Dick Armey and Tom DeLay, both practicioners of
the Bowie-knife approach to politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican Senate, it is no better. The failure of the
impeachment drive, and the inability of Republicans in Congress to
deal successfully with President Clinton, have poisoned the well.
Clinton's judicial nominations and legislative initiatives are
sidetracked. Lobbysists for guns, tobacco and oil reign supreme and
even sit in on secret sessions to help write legislation favorable
to the NRA, the tobacco lobby and polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are split on which side is more to blame, though Clinton
generally gets the better of the PR war. One key to that may be his
level of confidence, the optimism which he sprays about like a
six-year old with a new water pistol. A very readable new book by
Stephen Ambrose, ``The Victors: Eisenhower and His Boys, the Men of
World War II,'' (Simon &AMP; Shuster) describes Ike's discovery of the
necessity of optimism in a leader. What O'Neill, Reagan and
Thatcher all shared was a talent for projecting optimism that drew
people towards them and their views.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower, commanding his first combat operation, was holed up
in Gibraltar in 1942, but his invasion of North Africa was going
badly. In those gloomy caves of his command fortress, he wrote, ``I
first realized how inexorably and inescapably strain and tension
wear away at the leader's endurance, his judgement and his
confidence. The pressure becomes more acute because of the duty of
a staff constantly to present to the commander the worst side of an
eventuality.''
</P>
<P>
   In those caves, Ike discovered, ``optimism and pessimism are
infectious, and they spread more rapidly from the head downward
than in any other direction.'' The chief had to be optimistic above
all. ``. . . I firmly determined that my mannerisms and speech in
public would always reflect the cheerful certainty of victory _
that any pessimism and discouragement I might ever feel would be
reserved for my pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that kind of optimism which O'Neill, Reagan and Thatcher
conveyed, and which is so glaringly absent in the leaders of
Congress today.

DOWNSPOUT WOES SOMETIMES FIXABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July   02, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My downspouts go into the ground, and one got plugged and
made a mess of overflowing water; I dug down and discovered the
pipe goes horizontal a few inches deep under ground, and continues
under the driveway. Things did not improve much when I cleared the
blockage. Now what can I do? The pipe seams clear, but the clay
pipe is cracked where it connects to the downspout.RICHARD COHEN,
Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The underground pipe is a nuisance, mainly because it is
under the driveway and inaccessible. It may still go into a dry
well, but if that dry well is under the driveway and is plugged,
you really have a problem. You could try sticking a snake (they are
normally used for sewer drains) into the pipe and see what you can
pull out. To get to the pipe under the driveway, you could expose
the pipe along one side of the driveway and insert the snake from
there.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, you may have to build a new dry well at least
10 feet from the house.
</P>
<P>
   The cracked pipe at the downspout connection may not be a
problem. There may be some draining into the ground; if the
basement is dry, there is no need to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is always a controversy around using bleach to defeat mold
and algae, those black and green growths that appear often in shady
areas around _ and on _ the house. The same goes for moss, those
beautiful tufts of greenery that grow so many places, including
roofs. While the bleach (and water) will kill these growths, the
bleach is hard on virtually everything it touches.
</P>
<P>
   Fred from Maine called to offer another idea for moss. ``When we
have moss on the lawn, we throw lime on it. So why not throw lime
on moss on the roof? It changes the pH of the soil, and is an easy
way to get rid of it, making it easy to scrape off when
necessary.'' The lime referred to is ground limestone.
</P>
<P>
   Good point, Fred, and it will go in the handyman's vast file of
information.
</P>
<P>
   But be aware that the lime takes a year to be effective. But
heck, in the big picture, we can tolerate the wait.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to get rid of moss where it is not wanted is to
drench it with vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   One more comment: If you have moss on the roof, you really want
to get rid of it because it can eventually decay the shingles. But
if it is in the lawn, leave it; it is probably growing in shade
where nothing else will grow anyway, and it is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wood floors were varnished a month ago with two coats of
polyurethane varnish. I plan to install carpeting, but a handyman
neighbor said don't put down the carpet for six months. Do I have
to wait that long?
</P>
<P>
   HELEN McCREEVAN, Charlestown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. This handyman does not think so. I think a month is more than
enough time. The fear, of course, is that the carpet will bond
itself onto the finish, making it difficult to remove in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The polyurethane will cure completely in about three to seven
days hours. If you are in doubt, call the polyurethane people for
an opinion. The phone number is probably on the can.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman's floors have been varnished, and while it was a
long time ago I think I put the rugs down after a few days, and
there have been no cases of the rugs or pads sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you can wait forever before putting carpet down and,
once you do, you get sticking anyway. It's a crap shoot.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My new wood stoop was sealed with Thompson's Water Seal two
months ago. Can I put a stain over the water seal?
</P>
<P>
   FRED CLANNAGAN, Newton Highlands, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No. The sealer by its very nature seals the wood, preventing
any paint or stain from working. (Do not use paint in any case.) To
stain, you have two options: 1. Wait at least a full year to let
the sealer wear off. Or, 2. Sand off the sealer to the bare wood,
and restain. If you do stain, use a semitransparent oil stain. Only
one coat is neeeded, and you can do it again, with one coat, in
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

LOOKING OVER THE LESSONS OF THE KOREAN CONFLICT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For my generation, the 50th anniversary of the stormy attack
that began the Korean War brings uncomfortable reminders.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, news photographs of North and South Korean
leaders talking and actually embracing in Pyongyang after half a
century of estrangement bring fresh breezes of hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean conflict, for us, came too soon after World War II.
It rudely interrupted America's postwar idyll. And it tarnished our
new self-image of unquestioned military supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   But that war also taught us some useful lessons about the need,
use and limits of American power.
</P>
<P>
   World War II had already robbed Americans of any illusion that
we could live peacefully to ourselves while ravenous tyrants
subdued other countries beneath their tread.
</P>
<P>
   Adolf Hitler's quick and ruthless subjugation of Germany's
weaker neighbors, spreading to include France and large parts of
Russia, and Japan's path of marauding territorial expansion had
given the Western world a new consensus. We now held it to be
axiomatic that aggression permitted is aggression encouraged, and
that none of us can be completely safe while aggression stalks the
planet unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   It was this same rationale, ever so slightly modified by our
less-than-satisfactory experience in Korea, that led us step by
tentative step into the quagmire of Vietnam. But that's another
part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughtful observers, looking back from the past half-century's
perspective, agree today that our leadership in the multilateral
effort that finally stalemated the North Korean aggression was both
right and necessary. It served as a brake against a devastating
contagion of arms that could have spread across Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran New York Times foreign correspondent Max Frankel, in his
current memoir, ``The Times of My Life and My Life with The
Times,'' reminds us how our compulsion to resist communist advances
was heated to a fervent intensity after communist forces took over
all of China by vanquishing Chiang Kai Shek in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   But we also discovered one peculiarity of American character.
Our armed forces and American industry can mobilize quickly and
wage lightning-like, sophisticated warfare. The American public,
however, while possessing strong patriotic instincts to rally
behind our national leadership and pull together when the gauntlet
is thrown down, lacks the inclination to sustain that support over
a protracted period of years.
</P>
<P>
   We've been conditioned to expect instant results. We're not
prepared by temperament, training or patience for any long,
twilight struggle.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that public opinion, at first strongly supportive of
our national commitment in both Korea and Vietnam, lost interest
and conviction as the two conflicts smoldered on past two years.
Polls clocked a pronounced decline in public support long before
either struggle ended.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of this essentially American characteristic, recent
presidents have avoided committing U.S. forces to any but quick and
decisive exercises of power. In Grenada and Libya, President
Reagan's armed forces swept in swiftly and overpoweringly, did
their work and left.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush, similarly, sent airborne troops to Panama for
swift, well-planned maneuvers that performed their mission and left
in short days with their quarry, Manuel Noriega, in tow.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has exercised care not to get American troops
bogged down in ground wars, opting for airstrikes in places like
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The most masterful exercise of all was Bush's use of such
overwhelming force to subdue and route Saddam Hussein's
ill-prepared legions from Kuwait. In only five weeks, we dropped
more tons of explosives on that one tiny nation than the entire
combatant forces dropped on all hostile targets in all the years of
World War II! And Bush was careful to organize international
support in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The only unpopular military undertaking since Vietnam was the
clandestine effort in Reagan's administration to raise and support
a proxy force (the contras) to overthrow the elected government of
Nicaragua. That violated both international law and U.S. laws, and
the public did not support it.
</P>
<P>
   This points up a final lesson of the Korean and Vietnamese
conflicts. There is a limit to the effectiveness of U.S. power.
It's called nationalism. People want to determine their own
destinies.
</P>
<P>
   They probably feel, in fact, much as our ancestors did on July
4, 1776. Should we ever encroach upon their sovereign rights, in
their countries, or act as though anti-aggression rules did not
apply to us, we'd be out of character.
</P>
<P>
   World leadership requires not only decisiveness but restraint as
well.
</P>

from the Style section for use Sunday, July 2, and thereafter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-COOKIES (Washington) _ Most of this year's presidential
campaign has dealt with the candidates' positions on campaign
financing, Social Security and helping the uninsured. Now it is
time to deal with what really matters _ whose wife bakes the best
cookies. You know, family values. And the 2000 presidential cookie
contest pits chocolate chips, pecans and coconut against ginger and
molasses. The odds favor the ones with the chocolate chips; with
recipes. By Marian Burros.
</P>
<P>
   PUSH-UP-BRAS (Undated) _ Six years ago, when the British-made
Wonderbra was introduced in this country, push-up bras accounted
for about 3 percent of the $4.6 billion bra business; today that
figure is closer to 10 percent. Underwear makers are rolling out
push-up bras with the sort of hoo-ha usually reserved for movie
openings, and their arrivals in department stores are being
attended with the frenzy of a Meet-The-Beatles tour. By Penelope
Green.
</P>
<P>
   DOCTORS-MARKETING (Undated) _ Like hair colorists, fashion
designers and chefs, more and more doctors are seeking publicity to
build their businesses. Freed of legal constraints that prohibited
them from advertising and faced with shrinking incomes in the age
of managed care, they are aggressively marketing themselves as
experts on beauty and health in magazines like Vogue, Harper's
Bazaar, Elle, Self and Good Housekeeping and on television shows
like ``Today,'' where they reach millions who are willing to pay
for elective medical treatments. By Anne Jarrell.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Maybe there's an up side to the
climate change that spells warmer, drier weather for the East
Coast: lavender. By Anne Raver.
</P>
<P>
   DUMMY-FILMING (New York) _ The tale of Steven Schoichet, a
maladroit suburbanite whose life is transformed when he comes into
possession of a ventriloquist's prop, ``Dummy'' is the kind of
movie Charlie McCarthy might have starred in if Michael Ovitz had
been his agent. Nearly everyone else in the film is a client of
Ovitz's firm, Artists Management Group, a noncoincidence that helps
explain how a script by an obscure writer with a budget that
wouldn't buy a two-bedroom in Manhattan happened to get this far.
By Guy Trebay.
</P>
<P>
   NY-APARTMENT (New York) _ The sight of the couple draped across
the bed engaged in cozy pillow talk was more than a little
discomfitting. Stumbling on the scene, one wasn't sure whether to
eavesdrop, look the other way or join the lovebirds on the sheets.
Convincing as it was, this slice of life was in fact a performance,
enacted by models and staged at a party at the Apartment, a
strenuously hip fashion and home furnishings store masquerading as
a private residence. By Ruth La Ferla.

FROM MALONE TO MILES, NBA GETS YOUNGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The day before Darius Miles made draft history,
the 18-year-old basketball prodigy from East St. Louis High School
(Ill.) was asked how he decided he was ready for the National
Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the high school all-star games, a lot of people just
started talking and that's when it got it in my head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Los Angeles Clippers chose Miles with the third pick
in the draft on Wednesday night _ a distinction that made the
sinewy 6-foot-9-inch forward the highest high school player ever
selected _ Miles was a prodigy at 14, traveling around the country
to audition in front of hundreds of scouts at the most prestigious
camps.
</P>
<P>
   This is how kids are indoctrinated to the business of
professional sports. We've come a long way since Moses Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a young kid came to me and asked me if I thought he was
ready, well, I'd look him in the eye,'' said Malone, the second
player in the modern era to jump straight from high school to the
pros. ``You can always look at a kid, talk to him, see his inner
self and find out if he's ready for the pro game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know if I was.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Malone was attending summer school at the University of
Maryland. Fresh out of Petersburg High School (Va.), he was taken
in the third round of the American Basketball Association draft by
the Utah Stars.
</P>
<P>
   He had been to only two basketball camps, including Dave Bing's.
The only footage scouts could rely on was a grainy reel that
appeared on ABC's Wide World of Sports. Malone was not escorted
directly to a TNT interview after he was drafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did I find out?'' Malone said during a telephone interview
this past week. ``John Lucas came by the dorm and told me. I said,
`Ah, man, you joking, right?' He said, `For real, you been picked
by Utah.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We rode around in his car. He was my chauffeur. Back then, I
was living off $15 a month. I was playing for orange juice. I had
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone went on to have a Hall of Fame career. He went to a
mature team that featured Roger Brown and Ron Boone, veterans who,
``gave me a lot of knowledge and kept me in my place.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if he regretted turning pro so young.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only regret I have is that I should have waited 20 more
years, so I could get paid the big bucks,'' he said, laughing. He
also does not think an NBA-sponsored developmental league will curb
the onslaught of teen-agers wishing to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   Miles and DeShawn Stevenson from Washington Union High in
Fresno, Calif., were the 14th and 15th players in the modern era to
make the jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine home, big car, they want to live the life,'' Malone said.
``These young athletes watch these pro ballplayers. That's how it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   A record 18 underclassmen were taken in the first round on
Wednesday night. Seven first-round picks were traded within minutes
or hours after they were drafted. Two of those players, Keyon
Dooling and Courtney Alexander, were moved for future first-round
picks. Orlando did not even ask for a player in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bulls sent Chris Mihm at No. 7 to Cleveland for Jamal
Crawford, the No. 8 pick, it was not a draft-day swap along the
lines of Chris Webber-for-Anfernee Hardaway in 1993 or Stephon
Marbury-for-Ray Allen in 1996. This was the Cavaliers taking a
player the Bulls genuinely did not want off their hands.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if team executives were saying to the class of 2000:
``Thanks for coming in for the workout. You looked great. But we
have to fill our buildings and coffers today, not in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was that more prevalent than in Orlando, which dumped
its 10th and 13th picks and the contracts of Corey Maggette and
Derek Strong in hopes of clearing more salary-cap room to lure a
free-agent prize to the Magic Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers were unafraid to take youthful, impetuous gambles.
Forever a mess and consistently at the bottom of the standing, they
essentially recast their team.
</P>
<P>
   Dooling and Miles from the draft. Maggette and Strong from
Orlando. Who knows? With this kind of entertaining crew going up
and down the Staples Center floor, Lamar Odom just might stay a
while.
</P>
<P>
   The enduring image on Wednesday night was of Miles taking
arranged portraits with a group of family and friends that numbered
close to 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave basketball out of it for a second,'' Alexander, one of
the few college seniors taken in the first round, said. ``I think
there is a maturation process that we all need to take. Now, Darius
Miles may be the exception to the rule. Kevin Garnett was an
exception to the rule. Kevin was abnormally mature for his age;
he's very, very mature. People need to understand that this is now
a business. There's no room for boys on this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Darius Miles can't go back. He was headed for St. John's a
couple of months ago, the most prized recruit of the Mike Jarvis
era. But the whispers started. Soon, he was deemed good enough to
make the move, from homeroom to the Ritz-Carlton in a single bound,
with nary a lecture hall in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big jump, from a boy to a man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From Moses to Miles, they keep coming, these kids, with Kobe and
KG plastered to their walls. Busts or All-Stars, for better or
worse. And the migration won't stop as long as they can play. As
Marty Blake, the long-time NBA director of scouting, explained
candidly:
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody don't like school.''

&HT;     IN NEW ERA FOR MEXICO, OLD ELECTION HABITS PERSIST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Arms outreached in eagerness, thousands of
peasants, Indians and blue-collar workers lunged for the
sandwiches, potato chips and soft-drinks tossed in plastic bags
from open trucks.
</P>
<P>
   These were not victims of a flood, hurricane or earthquake. They
were voters hauled in from all over Mexico by the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to attend a rally in Mexico
City's colonial Zocalo plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar scene occurred recently when PRI candidate
Francisco Labastida Ochoa staged one of his last campaign rallies
at the main plaza. More than 100,000 followers came, many of them
brought in some 2,000 buses paid for by the party that has governed
Mexico for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, leading opponent Vicente Fox Quesada of the
center-right National Action Party had his own rally at the Zocalo,
and more than 150,000 came. The event included dancers in Aztec
costumes, light shows and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't bused in! We came on our own!'' people in the crowd
chanted.
</P>
<P>
   If voters are the quarry, Mexico's governing party is the expert
hunter in a country where new election laws are trapped by old
political traditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Sunday, when the nation's most
contested presidential election will be held, the PRI used its vast
organization to beat the bushes for votes throughout this country
of 100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Handing out food, cash, appliances and making workers sign lists
promising their vote for the PRI is what has always worked for the
party.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of poor and rural workers, an estimated 40 million
who earn a minimum wage of about $4 a day, they need whatever they
can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an unequal country, there is always the temptation of
abuse, to trade gifts for a vote,'' said Jose Woldenberg, president
of the Federal Electoral Institute, or IFE, in charge of overseeing
the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many in this country, a kilo of rice or a tin roof is more
important than their vote,'' he added. ``It's a structural fault of
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of a new century, the PRI is employing some of the
hoary old tricks that enabled it to win the presidency and most
other electoral posts for the past 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI denies there is any wrongdoing, and gifts at election
time are not illegal, but vote buying and obtaining people's name
for non-IFE lists are.
</P>
<P>
   As a new generation of voters clamors for greater democracy from
what many pundits say was a de facto party dictatorship during most
of the 20th century, the ancient PRI ploys to get votes is becoming
more questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an image of vote buying,'' said Javier Trevino,
Labastida's senior political adviser. ``You are violating the law
if you are using public funds, and should be punished. But you are
not violating the law if you are just using the time of our
bureaucrats'' to promote the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A thin line, and the PRI is being watched. Today, women, the
young and the Roman Catholic Church are playing bigger roles and
are forming activist organizations as Mexico's demographics and
political landscape change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need change, change in the system of government; we need a
government which stops blaming others and starts taking serious and
honest steps to make the country work,'' said Jail Ixel Garcia, an
18-year-old student.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 11 million voters in ages ranging from 18 to 24 are
eligible to cast ballots, many for the first time, according to IFE
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 70 million eligible voters, out of a population of
100 million, 52 percent are women.
</P>
<P>
   Parties have wooed the female vote with unprecedented ardor,
vowing to create a national institute to take care of women's
needs, including pre-natal care.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI is believed by many observers to have a majority of
women's votes. But women's groups aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   The National Civic Association for Women, an nonpartisan
organization that is urging women to vote, is forming brigades and
giving pamphlets explaining the political platforms of the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are promoting the vote, but we are also telling women to
not be afraid, not let themselves be fooled,'' said Gabriela
Romero, vice president of the association, who is sending out 1,200
observers to monitor the vote in rural states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women are by no means leaning more toward the PRI or the
PAN,'' she said. ``They are concerned about crime, education and
the economy. They will make up their own minds who offers the best
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ana Maria Cervantes, a church volunteer, said the poor aren't as
easily fooled with gifts anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them, `Take the flour, the beans, the pastas, but
don't sell yourself,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In this devoutly Catholic nation, the Roman Catholic Church,
meanwhile, is also playing an unprecedented electoral role.
</P>
<P>
   Shut out from public life since 1857 constitutional reforms, it
has been taking bolder steps since 1992 when these restrictions
were eased.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Mexican Bishops Conference warned parties not to
coerce voters or buy votes, saying electoral fraud was a ``grave
moral error'' and that a political system in which parties
alternate power represents a ``fuller democratic culture.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, was taken to mean a change of power from the
PRI and a vote of confidence for Fox, a conservative, devout
Catholic who is against abortion, now illegal in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But the church denies it. The spokesman for the Archdiocese in
Mexico City said 80 dioceses in the country are offering workshops
for the faithful on the meaning of democracy and explaining
different political platforms of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the priests are not telling people how to vote or who the
best candidate is,'' said Mexico City Archdiocese spokesman Gerardo
Lopez. ``The priests are within the legal framework of the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say the church's stumping for democracy in the
countryside could begin to erode the PRI's strongest base of
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has weighed in with Fox,'' said political analyst
George Grayson, of William and Mary College in Williamsburg, Va.
``It is unprecedented. The church has not been active in this
century or in the late 19th century.''

   As election day approaches, it looms as a historic event in
which the PRI could lose the government for the first time since
1929.
</P>
<P>
   Independent polls have consistently shown Labastida, an
economist, former governor and minister of the interior, in a
statistical dead heat with the fiery Fox, a former governor of
Guanajuato and Coca-Cola executive.
</P>
<P>
   A third, but distant, candidate is Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of the
leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, who is making his third run
at the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The closeness in the polls and Fox's energetic campaign are
giving many Mexicans reasons to hope for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time we have the illusion of democracy in
Mexico,'' said Gloria Hyverr, 70, one of more than 150,000 who
attended last Sunday's rally for Fox in the Zocalo.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many undecided voters _ 19 percent by some
estimates _ who could also swing the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox speaks with enthusiasm and energy but not with solid
numbers. Labastida is more measured and has a better handling of
statistics, but he lacks internal conviction,'' said Miguel Garcia,
an engineer and management consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being part of the system, Labastida doesn't have the moral
force,'' Garcia added. ``In our country the worst problem is
corruption.''

LAVENDER GROWS IN POPULARITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By ANNE RAVER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe there's an up side to the climate change that
spells warmer, drier weather for the East Coast: Lavender.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants to grow sweeps of it in front of the beach
house, the roses, the pool, the old chicken house. Even people with
clay are growing it _ in sandy raised beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always think of lavender as a Mediterranean plant, or
something that would thrive in the California desert,'' said
Fabienne Audette, the assistant director of horticulture at the New
York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. ``New York used to be too cold
and cloudy to sustain subtropical plants, but now, if we provide a
little protection, the climate change is allowing us to grow
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She did her master's thesis on the effects of water and pH on
lavender, in greenhouse conditions and clay fields. ``Sandy soil
and good drainage are key to growing lavender,'' said Audette, who
was born in Switzerland, lived in southern France (where lavender
grows in fields) and now gardens in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest difference between Mediterranean and American soil
is that the Mediterranean has been cultivated for thousands of
years,'' she said. ``The soil structure is very loose and tends to
be more alkaline or neutral, and the nutrients have been leached
out.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you have clay soil, grow lavender in raised beds, with
plenty of organic matter. Plant in full sun, on high ground, on a
south-facing slope. Some growers use mushroom compost to help
protect plants from root rot. And if you live in a humid area,
growing lavender in pots will improve air circulation. Go easy on
nitrogen fertilizer, which will promote soft green growth, not
flowers. Audette suggests mulching with a one-inch layer of white
or light-colored sand, grit or gravel.
</P>
<P>
   The blooms range in color from white and pink to green to all
shades of blue. The foliage can be from very silvery to gray blue
or green.
</P>
<P>
   Audette found that lavender, like most desert plants, responds
quickly to water. ``They are very tomentose or leathery, with
little water,'' she said. ``Once they get it, the cells elongate
and divide. The leaves are larger, the stems extended, with seven
or eight whorls of flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Mediterranean, plants may go three months without water,
but as soon as there's a storm, they quickly take up as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Lavenders belong to the Labiatae family, which has
square-stemmed plants like thyme and mint. The genus, Lavandula,
contains 28 species, including L. angustifolia, commonly known as
English lavender.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest description dates to A.D. 46, when Dioscorides
described a plant called stoechas, used as a wine and medicinal
herb. ``He found it on Stochade Island, which is now called Ile
d'Hyeres on the Cote d'Azur,'' Audette said.
</P>
<P>
   In A.D. 76, Pliny described a plant called nard, which sounded
like stoechas, but it came from India. ``The plant had a wonderful
fragrance, and the Romans were so crazy about it for their baths,
they depleted it,'' Audette said. ``So they went to stoechas and
called it false nard.''
</P>
<P>
   Two species of lavender _ angustifoloia and latifolia _ have
long been grown in southern Europe for perfume. And bees or other
pollinators crossed these two species, producing a hybrid called
lavandin, first discovered around 1850.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because L. angustifolia and latifolia were so highly
cultivated, a fungus came through Europe in the 1930's and wiped
out the monocultures,'' Audette said. Then a farmer noticed one
survivor: Lavandin, which he started propagating.
</P>
<P>
   Lavandin is more disease-resistant than lavandula and produces
300 percent more essential oil, Audette said, but it has a high
camphor content. ``About 85 percent of the lavender grown in France
is lavandin,'' she said. And it's probably lavandin in soaps,
sprays and toilet water. ``But for the true perfume _ much sweeter
and mellow _ the essential oil should be angustifolia.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most popular English lavenders are Hidcote, Munstead,
Sharon Roberts and Twickle Purple.
</P>
<P>
   L. stoechas, also called Spanish, French or Italian lavender, is
the adorable fat flower with the purple rabbit ear. L. viridis,
also called green or yellow lavender, has yellow-cream flowers on
two-foot stems. And don't forget lavandin, 30 inches tall, with
narrow spikes ranging from lavender and pink to blue and deep
violet. And its fragrance is strong, from that camphor.
</P>
<P>
   Like other lavender experts, Audette advises buying cuttings.
Seed-grown lavender is highly variable, which can be interesting
for adventurous types, but you will have a hodge-podge of plants
with different growth habits, shapes and colors.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many different kinds of lavenders, and two recent
books go into explanations: ``Lavender, the Grower's Guide''
(Timber Press, 2000; $30) by Virginia McNaughton and ``The Lavender
Garden, Beautiful Varieties to Grow and Gather'' (Chronicle, 1998;
$19) by Robert Kourik.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for lavender include: Digging Dog Nursery, Albion,
Calif., (707) 937-1130, free catalog; Sandy Mush Herb Nursery,
Leicester, N.C., (828) 683-2014, catalog $4; and Well-Sweep Herb
Farm, Port Murray, N.J., (908) 852-5390; catalog, $2.

ON STAGE, A LESSON IN LONGEVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLYDE HABERMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's an old Jewish joke (it's written somewhere
that you must never begin: There's a new Jewish joke) about a poor
man in Poland who goes to his rabbi saying he desperately needs a
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell you what,'' the rabbi says. ``We'll give you work
standing outside the town gates, watching for the Messiah. You're
to alert us when you see him coming. And for that, we'll pay you
two zlotys a month.''
</P>
<P>
   This, the poor man complains, is a pittance.
</P>
<P>
   ``True,'' the rabbi replies. ``But think of the job security.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiddle with a few words, and you could tell pretty much the same
joke about New York actors. Many of them would give up a lot,
including a fat paycheck, for steady work, especially for a role
deemed worthwhile. Those lucky souls tend to be in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to Bryan Hull, one of those souls, who came to
mind because this was supposed to be the week that we were rid of
``Cats'' once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   The longest-running musical in Broadway history was scheduled to
close last Sunday. But it seems it's true about cats having
multiple lives. The play's run at the Winter Garden, which began in
1982, has been extended to September because of a surge in demand
for tickets. These, the theater marquee promises, are the ``final
weeks!'' The exclamation point is presumably the producers' way of
saying that they mean it, that this isn't one of those ``going out
of business'' sales that manage to drag on for years.
</P>
<P>
   But even if ``Cats'' does purr on, it will remain an arriviste
compared with Hull and his fellow performers, who have kept quite a
different musical going, far from Broadway, for an extraordinary
four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fantasticks,'' at the Sullivan Street Playhouse in
Greenwich Village, opened on May 3, 1960, and has been there ever
since. Try to remember a time when it wasn't around. It is such a
New York institution that most New Yorkers overlook it, much the
way they give the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty a
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the show sets a record for endurance with every performance.
Thursday night's was No. 16,627. Hull, 62, has been around for
nearly half the play's life, making him the longest-running
performer in the modern history of New York theater.
</P>
<P>
   For the 7,895th time, he stepped onto the tiny stage Thursday
night, playing an over-the-hill actor, a wig of wispy white hair
covering his own thick graying hair. ``Sir, the players have
arrived,'' the character announced. With that, Hull was off and
running, as he has been since May 20, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Through that long stretch, he has not missed a show, aside from
his allotted two weeks of vacation each year and a three-month
absence in 1998 because of a broken leg. He has never missed a
performance because of a cold or other routine illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, people ask me, `Why are you doing this for 20
years?''' Hull said, his voice radio announcer deep. `` `Well,' I
say, `I have a job.'''
</P>
<P>
   As every actor in this city knows, there may be no more magical
words than those: I have a job. For Hull, who auditioned for the
part six times before getting it, a steady paycheck for 18 minutes
of work a night is ample reward.
</P>
<P>
   If you are unfamiliar with the play, it is an uncomplicated tale
of a boy and a girl, of fathers who scheme to bring the young
lovers together, of lost innocence and faded dreams, of learning
that ``without a hurt, the heart is hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the sort of show that draws disdainful sniffs from New
York sophisticates (the sort of people who would also probably
never be caught dead at the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State
Building). The writer Vivian Gornick once nuked the play in this
newspaper. Sometimes, Hull said, you can see the audience sitting
there stone-faced, as if to say, ``OK, show us why you've been here
40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But enough people turn up each night to keep the play going,
though they typically are student groups and Japanese tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there is a lesson in that. Maybe some of us in this city
are too sophisticated for our own good. Maybe an unadorned fantasy
about love is a necessary antidote to the graphic sex, crude
language and overdone pyrotechnics that usually pass for
entertainment these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charm and the pleasure of it,'' Hull said, ``is that it is
what it is: a simple show.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may be why it has outlasted the likes of ``Cats'' to
become a New York fixture that, for all anyone knows, will still be
around whenever the Messiah does show up.

NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT WEATHER, DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   By KIRK JOHNSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEHAMPTON, N.Y. _ Some people might scratch their heads at
what Richard G. Hendrickson has been up to for the last 70 years.
Even he seems a little mystified, trying to explain it.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1930, when he was an 18-year-old rawboned kid growing up
on a small poultry and dairy farm on the eastern tip of Long
Island, he has gone out into his yard at least twice a day, in
every sort of weather, to record the temperature and precipitation
and wind velocity as a volunteer for the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson is the longest-serving volunteer east of the
Mississippi, and on July 1, when he formally crosses the 70-year
threshold, Hendrickson will join an elite, if obscure, fraternity
of only six people in the 110-year history of the Cooperative
Weather Observer Program who have served the Weather Service into
an eighth decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farming is drudgery, seven days a week,'' said Hendrickson,
who sold his farm only last year at the age of 87. ``You've got to
do things that are different, to stay you from going nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a bit more to the story than that, of course. Behind
Hendrickson's meticulous weather monitoring was a rapturous love
affair _ with the sky and with nature. Also playing a part was an
eccentric writer with a passion for meteorology who moved in near
the farm when Hendrickson was an impressionable teen-ager in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   And last, there is a certain harder-to-define essence that has
informed Hendrickson's life, a spirit that seems almost jarring
today in its tough-minded, Old World code: Duty. Hendrickson
measured the weather as a way of serving his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an extremely 19th-century man, and I mean that as a
compliment,'' said his son, Richard H. Hendrickson. ``He was raised
in a farming environment in the teens and '20s, being responsible 7
days a week, 24 hours a day, for the animals and crops. Built into
his very nature is the concept of responsibility; it's the fiber of
his being.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a dedication to consistency, like perfect
attendance at school,'' Hendrickson added. ``It's strange, but it's
worthy of great respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cooperative Weather Observer Program was inspired by the
writings of Thomas Jefferson, who was something of a weather nut
himself. Jefferson envisioned a republic of yeoman farmers, all
gathering and sharing agricultural data about storms and the dates
of the first and last frosts, all for the good of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But that mix of weather and patriotism, not to mention family
farming, has faded. People want to get paid these days, or they do
not stay in one place long enough to allow for a continuity of
data, say weather officials who are struggling in many parts of the
country to keep the old stations afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the number of observers has declined from its peak
in 1970, when there were 13,500, to only 11,700 today, and many of
the stations are becoming automated.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also many holdouts like Hendrickson who refuse to
come in from the cold. A volunteer in Wyoming, the reigning
longevity champion, has taken readings for just over 70 years. A
weather observer in Brooklyn, Frank Martino, recently passed his
50-year anniversary. The national record is held by Earl Stewart of
Cottage Grove, Ore., who took weather observations every day for 77
years, from 1917 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks just love serving their country, and thank God
there's still people like that around,'' said Robert J. Leffler,
the manager of the cooperative observer program at the National
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson, who still chops his own firewood and still finds
the time to lie outside on the grass most evenings with his wife,
Lillian, to look at the sky, says he never missed a day's weather
reading in all his decades. Whenever he could not be there
personally _ a cumulative total of only a couple of hundred times
over the more than 25,500 days of his observation career _ he found
a substitute, usually his father, or later his son, to ``take the
weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Hendrickson, who is 60, lives nearby. He has agreed
to take over the station permanently whenever his father should lay
the duty aside.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Hendrickson agrees with his son that the unyielding
rhythms of a poultry farm are probably a big part of what shaped
him. Back during the Great Depression and before, the farm was
producing 2,500 white leghorns a week, he said, mainly for sale as
breeding stock. Every night, Hendrickson had to visit all 12 of the
large laying houses to make sure the birds had water and heat, and
in winter, to check the kerosene heaters that kept their drinking
water from freezing. Those nights became his classroom for the
natural world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd come out at night and hear an owl hoot, I'd hear a fox
bark, I'd hear a farmer's dog bark because maybe a rabbit hopped
too close to him,'' he said. ``I'd look up and see the stars, and
I'd see rings around the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the mid-1920s, the decidedly odd figure of Ernest S.
Clowes entered Hendrickson's deep rural fastness. Clowes (rhymes
with cows) was in his 50s when he moved just down Lumber Lane from
the Hendrickson farm. He was a sometime writer who penned nature
dispatches for the local Bridgehampton newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would write about what the possum said when he came out in
the spring, and what he said to the raccoon, or what the turtle
said,'' Hendrickson recalled of Clowes' nature columns.
</P>
<P>
   Clowes never drove a car, never married, and was so often lost
in his reveries that he would walk right by people as though they
were not even there. For a kid who was facing a hard and
circumscribed life of farming, and who would soon be forced to drop
out of high school to help his father, Clowes' air of education and
higher thought was like a breeze from the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best teacher a young fellow like myself could have
had,'' Hendrickson said.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1929, Clowes asked young Richard if he had ever
thought of becoming a volunteer weather observer, and so it began.
The full weather station arrived the next summer, and together the
farmer and the writer drove into town to pick up the equipment and
take it back to the farm.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Hendrickson was meticulous. April 7, 1931,
to site one of Hendrickson's early dispatches, was a raw and windy
day with a high of 44 and a low of 38 at Bridgehampton station.
Rain began falling at 8:10 a.m. and ended at precisely 10:55 a.m.,
the 19-year-old wrote _ not a minute sooner or later. The
handwritten sheet for that month, framed under glass, was presented
to Hendrickson by the Weather Service several years ago as a
memento _ the oldest of his dispatches that could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually over the years, taking the weather took on a life of
its own. Hendrickson began keeping a notebook in the pocket of his
work shirt, and his observations about wind and sky and the
northeasters that periodically raked the land eventually evolved
into a book about the weather of eastern Long Island, called
``Winds of the Fish's Tail,'' which he published in 1996 (available
from the author: (631) 537-0893). The title refers to a line by
Walt Whitman, who described Long Island as a fish with its mouth at
New York City and tail at the north and south forks in Suffolk
County.
</P>
<P>
   He also learned to read the weather in ways that went beyond its
mere measurement: How every change in wind direction was a signal
of an altered pattern, and how to read the speed and turbulence of
the jet stream by studying the vapor trails of high-flying
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dry northwest wind gives us our hottest summer days, and
we also get our windiest weather, usually in winter, from the
northwest,'' he said, staring up at the sky on a brilliant sunny
day that was fairly dry, temperature in the low 80s with a light
breeze blowing from the west-northwest. ``We get our heavy rains
from the east and northeast.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most notable weather day of Hendrickson's life,
Sept. 21, 1938, came with no warning at all. He was working in the
chicken houses that afternoon with a professor from Cornell
University's agricultural extension program and a veterinarian,
testing the chickens so that they could be certified for sale as
breeders, when suddenly the building they were in began to shake
from wind and rain. The three men bolted for the farmhouse, and by
the time they looked back, 26 of the farm's outbuildings, including
2 of the large laying houses, were gone.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane of 1938 had arrived. It ripped off the farmhouse
roof as the men cowered below, throwing 40-pound asbestos shingles
400 feet and then driving them into the ground like meteors. Of
Hendrickson's 4,500 young hens, 4,000 were killed by being blown
against a fence and drowned by the downpour.
</P>
<P>
   The 1938 hurricane also marked the end of the Great Depression
on Long Island's East End, Hendrickson said. Houses and barns had
to be repaired, cars and trucks replaced. The great surge of
spending that began in rebuilding from the storm carried on right
through World War II and then through the explosion of wealth that
continues.
</P>
<P>
   But the weather remains, and Hendrickson says it is only a
matter of time before people are reminded of it. He shakes his head
thinking about the newcomers who in their innocence or arrogance
have built homes on Long Island's beachfront dunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how much money they've got,'' Hendrickson said.
``Are we intelligent? Have we learned anything from history?''  &QL;

IT'S GINGER VS. CHOCOLATE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL COOKIE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By MARIAN BURROS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most of this year's presidential campaign has dealt
with the candidates' positions on campaign financing, Social
Security and helping the uninsured. Now, it's time to deal with
what really matters _ whose wife bakes the best cookies. You know,
family values. And the 2000 presidential cookie contest pits
chocolate chips, pecans and coconut against ginger and molasses.
The odds favor the ones with the chocolate chips.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, presidential campaigns have been forced to offer
family recipes. Postcards from the past, when wives stayed home and
cooked, they're served up as a window on the family life of the
candidates _ if somewhat artificially flavored. When Walter Mondale
ran, his campaign provided an entire cookbook of family recipes.
</P>
<P>
   But contests pitting the baking ability of potential first
ladies against each other are relatively new. They began in 1992
when Hillary Rodham Clinton got everyone shaking and baking with
her infamous cookie comment, discussing working as a lawyer while
her husband was governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had
teas,'' she said. ``But what I decided to do was pursue my
profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   She may have been trying to say that in 1992, women had other
options. Instead, her remark created a reactionary cookie contest,
the brainchild of Family Circle magazine, which published her
chocolate chip recipe and one from Barbara Bush. Readers were asked
to vote; the results proved to be a forecast of what would happen
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Elizabeth Dole's pecan roll sugar cookies
didn't stand a chance against a reprise of Clinton's chocolate chip
recipe. And this electoral season, Tipper Gore's Ginger Snaps,
plain-Jane ginger and molasses cookies, probably won't hold up
against Laura Bush's flashy Texas Governor's Mansion Cowboy
Cookies. The Bush cookies are expected to win because they contain
that magic ingredient _ chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise is how such rich cookies can be so boring. The
sweetness of the Bush cookies overwhelms any other flavor except an
occasional bite of chocolate. Gore's ginger snap cookies look
boring, but they are marginally better. They need more ginger,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Bland cookies seem appropriate for the current presidential
campaign. And it seems fitting, too, that the magazine's recipe for
the Bush cookies turns out tough cookies. The recipe Bush's office
submitted suggested that her cookies be baked for 10 to 12 minutes.
Family Circle changed it to 17 to 20. A friend who baked the
cookies following the magazine's directions turned out unattractive
jawbreakers; the cookies should have soft centers. At 17 minutes in
my oven the cowboy cookies were also overdone.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, anyone who followed the Bush recipe as it first
appeared on the magazine's Web site may have found their cookies
turn to ashes, possibly a small fire. The site's suggested baking
time of 17 to 29 minutes has since been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   An expert in the tastes of Middle America, Peggy Katalinich, the
Family Circle food director, says, ``If you have chocolate chips in
your cookies, you're ahead of the game.'' Who wins the cookie
contest, she says, ``depends on whether you vote your politics or
your taste buds.''
</P>
<P>
   But if recipe contests are important in telling voters something
to help them decide which candidate to choose, isn't it time for a
cook-off between the vice president and the governor? Tennessee
barbecue versus Texas barbecue. And that's something you can really
sink your teeth into.

IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT CLEAVAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By PENELOPE GREEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In May an old friend came to town on business. We had lunch at
the sort of late-'80s restaurant that, with its Bisquick biscuits
and corn bread and homemade lime soda, used to be called new
American, and filled in the narrative blanks of our recent
histories; it had been 15 years since we'd seen one another.
Afterward, we picked our way through the rubble on North Moore
Street, decorous in our polymide rainwear and neat black boots, and
_ this being a contemporary story _ repaired to my friend's
tastefully beige room at the SoHo Grand Hotel to examine her
week-old fake breasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls,'' as she called them, were high and hard and
absolutely perfect. They were also absolutely riveting, or in any
case I was riveted by them: I felt they were giving me the hairy
eyeball, like Louise Bourgeois' nipply ``Eyes'' sculpture on the
esplanade just below Battery Park City. I went home in a daze,
unable to shake the feeling that I'd been stared down by a pair of
breasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuts to you,'' I thought a few days later, strapping on a
couple of ounces of silicone and Lycra, the Ultimo bra with
``outplants,'' _ just one of many new bras designed to give you a
competitive edge, or at least make you feel like the heroine of a
Barbara Cartland novel. Implants, who needs 'em?
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, when the British-made Wonderbra was introduced in
this country, push-up bras accounted for about 3 percent of the
$4.6 billion bra business; today that figure is closer to 10
percent. Underwear makers are rolling out push-up bras with the
sort of hoo-ha usually reserved for movie openings, and their
arrivals in department stores are being attended with the frenzy of
a Meet the Beatles tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Ultimo, $58, sold out on its first day at Saks Fifth Avenue
not long ago, thanks to a waiting list with 2,500 names on it.
Similar scrambles have attended the debuts of Lily of France's
X-Bra, $25, out since February, and Victoria's Secret's Natural
Liquid Miracle Bra, also known as the Natural, $48, out since
April.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Warnaco's Nothing But Curves bra, for which the
company will be spending $3 million to $4 million on advertising
and marketing, went on sale at Macy's for $29. July 3, you will be
able to find it at department stores across the country. Its
appearance completes a six-month barrage of new push-up bras, each
more intricately engineered than the last and sporting more options
than a fully loaded Range Rover. Eager to add heft to my own
shadow, I took a few out for a test drive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   THE X-BRA. The arcs, nay, the swoops of the molded foam X-Bra
are nothing short of aerodynamic. Running a finger lightly over one
particularly graceful angle _ an ``assist'' in underwear parlance _
I thought of hull speed and the famous winged keel employed by the
Australians to wrest the America's Cup away from this country so
many years ago. This is the bra that delivers ``a range of
cleavage,'' thanks to a clasp thingummy at your sternum. ``Start
loose, and then ramp it up during the day,'' suggested a publicist
for Lily of France. ``Empowering, fun, playful, those are the
buzzwords for this product.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwear makers like to borrow language from other arenas, and
so there's a lot of talk of ``empowerment,'' along with ``choice''
and ``flexibility'' in answer to questions about why push-up bras
are enjoying so much success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to sell a million X-Bras this year,'' said Eric
Wiseman, president of Bestform Intimates, the company that owns
Lily of France. ``That's a phenomenal number. Why is it so
successful? It puts a woman in control _ it allows her control over
the amount of enhancement she gives herself.''
</P>
<P>
   I fumbled with the tiny plastic flower tab and went straight to
``ramped'' _ a setting that gently eased as the day waned, like an
oh-so-slowly deflating balloon. You could almost hear the faint
wheeze of escaping air, and the sound of diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   THE ULTIMO. ``Wear it with a blazer and no shirt, or a
sweater,'' encouraged Barbara Lipton, vice president and division
merchandising manager of intimate apparel at Saks, ``and let me
know how it makes you feel.'' Very breast-heaving, was the answer.
I wore a slightly too-small button-down shirt, for optimal
button-straining, and that romance-novel effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Ultimo's silicone innards are eerily fleshy. They're
supposed to ``settle'' and ``warm'' to your body, an action which,
if it occurred, was too subtle for me to discern. The Ultimo was
comfy, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear it's a bit cold,'' was the disingenuous suggestion of
more than a few of the Ultimo's competitors. It's not. I wore the
Ultimo on random errands, panting like a Pekingese, enjoying the
rise and fall beneath my chin, but I didn't have the stomach to
sport it in more familiar surroundings. I worried that someone
might think I'd had a little work done.
</P>
<P>
   Why do women want ``a larger breast effect,'' to use the
industry phrase?
</P>
<P>
   My friend Stephen is fond of saying that all genders aspire to
being Jayne Mansfield. An evolutionary psychologist would say
simply that an exaggeration of secondary sex characteristics like
breasts is rudimentary mate attraction; a Freudian might diagnose
such a bosom-focused culture as being hopelessly mired in its oral
stage. Lipton's analysis was succinct: ``Why do women want
cleavage? Because they can have it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   THE NATURAL. With annual sales of $2.9 billion, Vickie's Secret
(an industry executive referred to Victoria's Secret this way, and
I couldn't resist repeating it) is a company built on cleavage:
Twenty percent of its sales are in push-up bras.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the company sells more than 50 percent of all
padded and push-up bras in this country. You could argue that the
rock star status now afforded to breasts is thanks to that
company's marketing efforts. ``We were the first to use
supermodels,'' said Monica Mitro, vice president of public
relations. ``We even created supermodels, like Heidi Klum.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, its Miracle Bra, the American answer to the
Wonderbra, has until this year been a category killer. Which brings
us to the Natural Liquid Miracle Bra, now selling out by word of
mouth only. It's a doppelgaenger to the Ultimo, with outplants that
are a tad less obvious. But the overall effect is still like
wearing someone else's breasts, which is a good thing or a bad
thing, depending on your temperament.
</P>
<P>
   Is there such a thing as too many cleavage options?
Disentangling the Natural from its sisters the other day, I thought
there might be. I was beginning to feel like Mary Smiling, a minor
character in ``Cold Comfort Farm,'' Stella Gibbons' 1932 satire of
the novels of D.H. Lawrence, whose ``second interest was her
collection of brassieres, and her search for the perfect one,''
Gibbons wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hoped that on her death it would be left to the
nation,'' she continued. ``She was an authority on the cut, fit,
colour, construction and proper functioning of brassieres; and her
friends had learned that her interest, even in moments of extreme
emotional or physical distress, could be aroused and her composure
restored by the hasty utterance of the phrase: ``I saw a brassiere
today, Mary, that would have interested you ... ''
</P>
<P>
   NOTHING BUT CURVES. At one end of a vast table in Warnaco's
sky-high Park Avenue boardroom, recent push-up bra history was
being detailed by company executives. Frank Wolfson, designer for
the Warner line, and Gwendolyn Widell, senior vice president of
merchandise development, played Will and Ariel Durant. ``We'll look
at these in the hand first,'' said Widell, and led me from the
Model T, the Wonderbra with its removable pads, to the X-Bra, to
the liquid pockets of the Ultimo and the Natural. It was a foggy
June morning, and Manhattan looked particularly delicious through
the picture windows _ windows whose sheer enormity underscored the
fact that underwear is extremely big business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catch,'' said Wolfson, suddenly flicking a delicate, black
winged carapace at me. Nothing But Curves!
</P>
<P>
   Then two veteran underwear models profiled the bra for me in red
python and Caribbean blue, in khaki and a computer-generated rose
print. I was so taken I followed the models back into a dressing
room, where we had a long and satisfying discussion about
shrinkage, gravity and other matters relating to les belle
poitrines, as Aileen Mehle might say.
</P>
<P>
   I took the bra home and wore it for more than a week. It weighs
nothing, and affixes, oddly, somewhere between your heart and your
clavicle. I liked it, though, for being not too hooter-y, but
rather more organizing, like some sort of Kevlar armor, like a
breastplate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women don't want a lot of encumbrances in their lives,''
Widell had told me.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ The Boy Scouts have a
constitutional right, according to a narrow 5-4 Supreme Court vote,
to give the boot to homosexual scoutmasters. The next president's
Supreme Court appointments could overturn Wednesday's decision. I
don't know if George W. Bush or Al Gore were Boy Scouts or if they
would use a ``Gay Scout'' litmus test for their Supreme Court
appointments. I do know that I was a Boy Scout and that I had a
homosexual scoutmaster. (Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the

ATLANTA _ We gathered at the little Inman Methodist Church as we

who would have celebrated her 93rd birthday on Dec. 1. We are
fortunate in funerals. Our cousin, Don Harp, is a preacher. He
knows exactly what to say when a family member crosses the Jordan.
One of the things he pointed out at Aunt Ida Mae's funeral was that
we are running out of what Tom Brokaw and a lot of us think of as
The Greatest Generation. ``Who among us is going to take their
place?'' Don asked. It is a worrisome question. (Jim Minter is a

 &HT;    Strong field for this year's Tour de France
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ The 1999 Tour de France field wasn't
considered strong, given that for the first time in 43 years there
was no defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   A broken arm left 1996 Tour champion Bjarne Riis on the
sidelines. A knee injury wiped out Jan Ullrich, the 1997 champion
and 1998 runner-up. An embarrassing drug controversy knocked out
1998 winner Marco Pantani.
</P>
<P>
   Of the field of 180 riders, only Alex Zulle and Bobby Julich, a
Corpus Christi native, had ever finished on the Tour podium. And
Julich was knocked out of the three-week-long race after he crashed
in the eighth stage, a time trial in Metz in Northen France. His
arm and chest injuries were too severe for him to finish the
remaining 13 stages.
</P>
<P>
   This year's field, however, is strong and will include three
Tour champions, with Ullrich and Pantani joining Austin's Lance
Armstrong, the 1999 victor.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong still is clearly the favorite, but he should be
pressed more than last year when he finished with a 7-minute,
37-second cushion over runner-up Alex Zulle. Armstrong's margin of
victory was the fourth largest posted in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Count on the charasmatic Pantani to yank some of the limelight
from Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian, known as ``Il Pirata'' for his shaven head and
penchant for wearing colorful bandanas, is his country's most
popular athlete, edging Olympic skiing hero Alberto Tomba, and one
of the biggest names in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Pantani also is his country's most controversial athletic
figure.
</P>
<P>
   The problems for the slight 30-year-old came to a climax last
summer, during the Giro d' Italia, the second most glamorous
cycling event after the Tour. Pantani, wearing the race's pink
leader's jersey, held an overwhelming advantage on the next-to-last
day of the Giro. Only something unforeseen could keep him from
repeating as champion.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six hours before the scheduled end of the three-week-long
race, he was suspended after a drug test detected an abnormal level
of red blood cells in his system, indicating the use of the hormone
erythropoiten (EPO), a banned performance enhancing substance.
</P>
<P>
   He then announced he would not defend his 1998 Tour title,
claiming that the route was too flat and not conducive to his
riding style. Pantani's subsequent exile from cycling was a long
and emotionally torturous. During his time away, Pantani crashed
his car three times, broke up with his girlfriend of five years and
had a falling out with his family. He went into hiding in March,
saying that he was suffering from depression.
</P>
<P>
   But he also was secretly training for his sport's big races this
year, although he did not return to competition until the Giro.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly wasn't truly excited about competing until he had
an audience with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican City the day
before the Giro started. Pantani didn't win the Giro, but he did
well in the mountain stages to indicate he would be in excellent
form for France.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've regained Pantani the man. As for Pantani the champion,
we'll see,'' said Felice Gimondi, president of Mercatone, Pantani's
team.
</P>
<P>
   But trouble still is tagging after Pantani.
</P>
<P>
   He faces trial in Italy after being charged with ``sporting
fraud'' in April. Italian judicial officials allege that Pantani,
in at least two instances, used EPO to boost his performance. He
denies the charge. The allegations go back five years, when doctors
discovered that he had an abnormally high level of red blood cells
in his system while he was treated for a broken leg at a hospital
in Turin, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich, the German cycling star, has been plagued by injuries
and weight problems. But he also has been brilliant in the Tour,
sandwiching his victory 1997 at age 23 with runnerup finishes in
1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich, who says he can't resist cream cakes, has been nine
pounds overweight this season, which is not much for the average
person. But the wN0701-COX 06-30  &UR; BC-MCCARTY-COLUMN0701-COX

   Another mother loses a son

delivered her into the waiting arms of her family.
</P>
<P>
   Another mother, a neighbor, looked on in anguish. ``When it
happened to my son, it was the same way. It was another hot day. A
13-year-old killed my son over cards. Over $5.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked for her name, the mother turned her head away.
After six years, it is still too painful to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she watched as the grieving mother disappeared into the
alley, now part of her sorrowful sorority. ``It happens every
summer,'' she said. ``The temperature goes up, and the tempers
flare.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime scene was swarming with TV and newspaper reporters.
Over the static of the police scanner, several newsrooms heard the
report of a possible quadruple homicide. At first, there was the
scent of the Big Story.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out, it was more routine. Just one man _ father, brother,
son.
</P>
<P>
   A brother knelt on the ground and rocked his body, keening in an
ancient ritual of grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gonna get up,'' cried several onlookers, as if trying to
wake Lazarus. They seemed to implore the body, still only partially
hidden behind bushes between two Cape Cod style houses, to rise up.
</P>
<P>
   An old school friend sobbed, ``He's gotta get up. He's got
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   As you watched the grief-stricken friends and relatives arrive,
mourners at an impromptu public wake, the realization dawned that
this is the big story. Not the multiple murders, not the
sensational cases, but the day-to-day violence that has now claimed
18 lives in Dayton this year.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood vigil was a solemn scene that drove home the
reality of violence. Yet within 13 hours, arguments over the first
shooting led to a second shooting and an assault, sending two men
to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Freeman, chairman of the Concerned Christian Men, knew
Keith Watson when he was a kid in Little League, and his dad was a
coach. For 13 years, the organization has worked to prevent the
kind of tragedy that claimed Watson's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it's not an isolated incident,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   It will happen again, and again, and again, Freeman said,
``until young people come to grips with ownership of their
community, until they become more thoughtful and visionary of the
future, instead of just the present.''
</P>
<P>
   The Concerned Christian Men go to schools to perform mediations
among parents, students and staff, trying to defuse the simmering
conflicts that can lead to violence. It's powerful, he said,
``because we're not doing it because it's our jobs, because we're
making any money, but simply because we care.''
</P>
<P>
   The Concerned Christian Men could use more adults to encourage
youth to understand how vital they are to their communities. ``It
is time for the community to stand up and strengthen each other,''
Freeman said. ``I want young people to understand there are
ramifications for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   A split second of rage, an eternity of ramifications: Three
children will grow up without a father. Another mother will hug her
grief for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you look at it, it's a big story.

 &HT;    Searching for logic in ruling barring homosexual scoutmasters
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Boy Scouts have a constitutional right,
according to a narrow 5-4 Supreme Court vote, to give the boot to
homosexual scoutmasters.
</P>
<P>
   The next president's Supreme Court appointments could overturn
Wednesday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if George W. Bush or Al Gore were Boy Scouts or if
they would use a ``Gay Scout'' litmus test for their Supreme Court
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   I do know that I was a Boy Scout and that I had a homosexual
scoutmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I don't know if our scoutmaster was homosexual. I just
know that all my fellow brave, clean and reverent Troop 210 Scouts
thought he was homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, I don't know if my scouting buddies really believed
our scoutmaster was homosexual or if they simply enjoyed spreading
malicious gossip. Boy Scouts will do that even if it is not
helpful, friendly, courteous or kind.
</P>
<P>
   The man never did anything that we knew of that was out of line
except that he had never been married.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, back in the late 1940s and early 1950s, we assumed
that some adult law required all men to get married. I believed
that for a good 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Our scoutmaster also spent his spare time hanging around with
boys. Most of the men in our small, rural town were the strong,
silent type who barely tolerated children. Generally speaking, that
included our fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ARRESTED ADOLESCENCE
</P>
<P>
   Maybe our scoutmaster simply had a case of arrested adolescence.
Who knows? We didn't.
</P>
<P>
   None of us ever spread our gossip to our parents. Spreading
groundless rumors could result in a whipping. A lot of things back
then could result in a whipping.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, our scoutmaster was good. We didn't want to
lose him. Without him, the troop would have either folded or we
would have gotten a scoutmaster who would have made us toe the
line, which was another adult law.
</P>
<P>
   The issue before the Supreme Court involved James Dale, an
assistant scoutmaster who had been an Eagle Scout and had remained
active in the Scouts since the age of 8. When Scout officials
learned Dale was gay from a newspaper article brought to their
attention, they fired the man.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court majority reasoned that Boy Scouts of America
has the freedom to associate with people who accept the group's
stated values just as it has the freedom to not associate with
people who reject its values.
</P>
<P>
   I was far from a model Boy Scout, but I don't recall anything in
the Scout oath, law, motto or slogan that states any values
regarding homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The last part of the Scout oath, where Scouts promise ``To keep
myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight,''
is most often used to show that the organization opposes
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``gay'' and ``straight'' had nothing to do with sexual
orientation back when the Scout oath was written. The question then
is morality.
</P>
<P>
   Morality, however, would imply a decision based on some action
or conduct. There was no evidence that Dale ever participated in
any actions or conduct inconsistent with the stated values of the
Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   If the Boy Scouts had clear, established values that opposed the
condition of homosexuality _ not merely an implied opposition of
homosexual conduct _ then the Supreme Court's decision would not
have been so tortured.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist, writing for the majority, said
the Boy Scouts could kick Dale out because his presence would send
a message the organization ``accepts homosexual conduct as a
legitimate form of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Dale's case, there was no evidence of homosexual conduct.
From his actions, Dale was a model of Boy Scout values. There must
be a constitutional nuance here that I don't understand.

don't know if George W. Bush or Al Gore were Boy Scouts or if they

Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _
ATLANTA _ We gathered at the little Inman Methodist Church as we
have too often in recent years, to say goodbye to our Aunt Ida Mae,
who would have celebrated her 93rd birthday on Dec. 1. We are
fortunate in funerals. Our cousin, Don Harp, is a preacher. He
knows exactly what to say when a family member crosses the Jordan.
One of the things he pointed out at Aunt Ida Mae's funeral was that
we are running out of what Tom Brokaw and a lot of us think of as
The Greatest Generation. ``Who among us is going to take their
place?'' Don asked. It is a worrisome question. (Jim Minter is a
former editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The mother of the victim arrived
on the crime scene at the same moment I did. Supported on either
side by friends, Keith Watson's mother approached the yellow tape,
shaking and sobbing, ``I want to see my baby. I want to see my
baby.'' ``You can't come this way, ma'am,'' an officer directed
her, then became silent, as understanding dawned: This is the
mother. Hugging herself, she cried, ``No! No! No!'' as her friends
delivered her into the waiting arms of her family. (McCarty, Dayton

much one and the same _ a thing or two. (Tom Teepen is national

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ MIAMI _ Every once in a while, the
Cuban-American community here is smitten by erroneous reports that
Fidel Castro has died. No such thing. After 40 years of total
control of Cuba, he is as alive as ever. He's got his Elian back,
he's got the Republican-led U.S. Congress pushing through
legislation to ease segments of the embargo, he's got the Miami
exile community in the most depressed (and foul) mood it's even
been in.(Kleinberg, Cox News Service.) MOVED THURSDAY.

   GLASS-COLUMN _ REDMOND, Wash. _ Bill Gates, the squire of
Redmond, where Microsoft Corp. makes its home, has no use for
computer manuals. Gates says that the software programs that have
made him a rich man since he co-founded the company 25 years ago
are much too complex. The stuff that follows in the wake of
Windows, he vows, will be a lot more simple to use and respond to
intuitive voice commands, making all manuals superfluous. Until
that day, Microsoft will beef up its digital help materials, making
them accessible both within individual programs and online. (Glass,

snakes. In his latest travelogue, the tweedy, bearded Bryson visits
a secondhand bookstore and picks up a volume about crocodile
attacks and tells us the horrifying tale of an American model who
was standing under a waterfall in western Australia when she
noticed a half-submerged snout swimming toward her. She was last
seen being dragged beneath the surface, a startled look on her
face. (Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)EMBARGOED FOR

Hughes' ``The Negro Speaks of Rivers''? We struggle for tradition,
convinced that it has something to do with time. Some countries, we
tell ourselves, have thousands of years of tradition. But, in fact,
tradition starts from zero, and what many of us miss is that we're
in the process of creating a uniquely American voice. (Martinez,

seating in the rear that's generous enough for full-size adults.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches include the swinging center-dash vents that Mazda
has used for years, just enough chrome inside and out to give the
626 some character without making it garish, and stereo controls
that don't require technical expertise or awkward contortions to
reach and operate.
</P>
<P>
   The ease of operation extends to the major controls, with good
steering and brake feel for a car in the 626's class _ think
Passat, Galant, Alero and Altima. As other reviewers have pointed
out, the 626 is not an attention-grabber, but it does deserve a
second look by family-car shoppers.

   But Liverpool, England, native Issacs couldn't be more pleased
with his home turf's ruffled feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's thrilling obviously that we are garnering even more
column inches than the reviews would get us,'' Isaacs says. ``But
there's no controversy in my mind or in the filmmakers' minds. Most
of the people writing this stuff haven't seen the film.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute, however, that Isaacs is one rotten apple _
in the film, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a slightly amoral British officer who just wants to win
the war and get the job done and earn himself some huge land
grant,'' Isaacs says of Tavington. ``My superiors are very unhappy
with the way I'm behaving and my men balk at carrying out the
orders I give them. So the notion that the British are represented
badly is nonsense. `I' am the bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you have a bad guy in a giant genre war movie like this
who's taking a vote and abiding by the Geneva Convention, you
haven't got much of a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, ``The Patriot'' isn't the first recent flick to
get the Brits in a snit. Earlier this year, ``U-571'' raised
English ire when the heroes of a historic World War II submarine
mission where changed from British to American for the film. Gibson
himself has been at war with the Brits since his kilt-wearing turn
in ``Braveheart.'' But Isaacs says a little honest criticism never
hurt anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm pointing fingers from across the Atlantic.
We all know perfectly well that the British empire has civilized
certain places _ we brought them cricket and warm beer and taxes,''
he says, ``and at some point almost everywhere we've occupied has
ended up with us getting kicked out in circumstances of great
acrimony, and this is just one more in a long line for England. And
I can say that because I'm English.''

NATIONWIDE CONCERT TOUR BY DIANA ROSS IS BECOMING A SUPREME FLOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Jan. 14, 1970, Diana Ross and the Supremes did their final
show.
</P>
<P>
   Anything in a pop star's career _ drug use, marriage, giving
birth, dying _ can be milked to death, but as breakups go, this one
was orchestrated and packaged to the hilt: After 10 years and 12
No. 1 singles, and less than three years after Ross began to get
top billing, the group bid adieu, with Ross introducing her
replacement, Jean Terrell, onstage. Everyone, we were led to
believe, was OK with this and would go on to further success.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the choreographed breakup was the Supremes' last single
together _ ``Someday We'll Be Together.'' It was obvious that
``Someday'' was not simply a hopeful tune about two lovers being
reunited _ this was a tease, a promise that just maybe, down the
road, Diana Ross and her Supremes, the most popular female vocal
group of the '60s, would reunite and return to glory.
</P>
<P>
   Now cut to earlier this month and the Palace of Auburn Hills, a
cavernous arena outside Detroit, and one of the first stops of the
Diana Ross and the Supremes' Return to Love tour. The promise made
implicit 30 years ago in ``Someday We'll Be Together,'' was coming
to fruition. Or was it?
</P>
<P>
   It is Diana Ross and two Supremes onstage, but not the Supremes
that backed her when the group was in its heyday: For up to an
exorbitant $250 per seat, fans would not see Mary Wilson or Cindy
Birdsong, but Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence, who were Supremes
only after Ross went solo.
</P>
<P>
   They were recruited, in fact, by Wilson, who kept the Supremes'
name alive for three decades but declined to participate in the
Return to Love tour because, she was quoted as saying, she was
offered only $3 million _ virtual pennies compared with the
reported $15 million-$20 million Ross is making for less than two
months' work.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reports about what Birdsong was offered. She
replaced founding member Florence Ballard in 1967; Ballard died of
a heart attack in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, what could have been the triumphant return by a
legendary group has turned into the summer concert season's biggest
bomb: The Palace was only half full, as was Atlanta's Philips Arena
a few nights later; fewer than 3,000 people showed up for another
early show in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are speaking, and they're not interested,'' says
John Scher, president and CEO of New York's Metropolitan
Entertainment Group, and one of the country's most well-known
concert promoters. ``Ms. Ross is a legendary artist and people
would pay top dollar to see her in an intimate setting. But in
arenas and it not being a true reunion, no.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour, say people in the concert industry, is testimony to
how out of touch a superstar and her handlers can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're marketing to an educated audience, and if they feel
they're being sold a bill of goods they won't pay it,'' says Jerry
Thompson, president of Fort Worth's Caravan of Dreams and
Promoterline. ``With service charges, you take your wife and it's
$550 before you walk out the door. Diana Ross has no new product,
and nobody cares that much.''
</P>
<P>
   And why should they? There is no new CD; no greatest hits boxed
set. And audiences have examples in recent years of how successful
reunion tours can be _ provided they're the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' Hell Freezes Over tour hit the road in the mid-'90s
and sold out stadiums and arenas for months _ despite ticket prices
in excess of $100. But there was a CD _ a compilation of several
new cuts and Eagles favorites such as ``Hotel California.''
</P>
<P>
   The four original members of Kiss did just as well when they
came back in 1996 with a show (makeup, explosions, etc. included)
that harkened to their '70s heyday.

A VERY FOCUSED CORVETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By CHERYL JENSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DULL, Ohio _ Here we are in Dullsville, having a thrill a
minute. Not because of the nightlife, or even the wildlife, but
because we roared into this western Ohio hamlet in Chevrolet's
fastest, most secret, most exciting production Corvette yet.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Z06, it has 385 horsepower _ 35 more than a standard
'01 'Vette _ and it is aimed head-on at weekend racers whose
priorities are speed, speed and speed _ in that order. The car,
with a price of $47,500, reaches dealerships this month and is
likely to show up immediately in autocross competitions or at
Corvette Club track events. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What Chevrolet has done is to rework its fixed-roof hardtop
model, which arrived as a 1999 model. Although the hardtop was
already the stiffest, lightest and fastest Corvette, Chevy reached
into its bag of tricks to create the Z06: The 5.7-liter V-8 engine
was reworked to produce 385 horsepower; the suspension was revised;
and the unloaded weight was cut to 3,115 pounds _ almost 100 pounds
lighter than the 2001 coupe and convertible and 38 pounds lighter
than the previous hardtop. That model will no longer exist other
than as the Z06.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy engineers say the Z06 easily outperforms its coupe and
convertible siblings, which will not be available with the new
engine. It also handles better and will circle a track faster than
the ``King of the Hill'' Corvette ZR1 of 1990-95, said Dave Hill,
chief Corvette engineer. Hill says the new car is capable of
zero-to-60 sprints in 4 seconds and a quarter mile run in 12.6
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Hill says engineers found the Z06 would do laps at their test
track 3 to 4 seconds faster than the 350-horsepower coupe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All that track talk is well and good, but how does the Z06
perform on the open road? Heading out of Cleveland, the driver's
first impression is that this is definitely a harder-edged car.
It's not a Corvette for everybody. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is stiffer, with a larger, stronger front
stabilizer bar. You feel everything the vehicle encounters on the
road _ a tradeoff for the improved handling.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the gain in handling comes from wheels that are an inch
wider than those on the standard Corvette, and although the tires
are bigger, they are a total of 23.4 pounds lighter. That's because
the Z06 does not use the run-flat tires found on other Corvettes.
In case of a flat, the driver has Chevrolet's best wishes, a
miniature air compressor and a repair kit that includes a squeeze
bottle of sealant.
</P>
<P>
   The car is also noisier, partly due to a hatchback configuration
that amplifies sound, and partly because its weight-loss regimen
included thinner glass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On lightly traveled rural roads, the Z06s special nature is
appreciated. The car changes direction quickly, and taking turn
after turn at increasingly higher speeds can make the driver feel
inadequate _ incapable of fully exploiting its grip. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there is the revised V-8, called the LS6. Exclusive to the
Z06, it is based on the regular 5.7-liter LS1 in regular Corvettes.
Changes include improved breathing, thanks to a new titanium
exhaust; unique to the Z06, it weighs almost 18 pounds less than a
conventional exhaust system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new engine reaches peak horsepower at 6,000 r.p.m. and peak
torque (385 foot-pounds) at 4,800 rpm. That compares with 350
horsepower at 5,600 rpm and 375 foot-pounds at 4,400 rpm for the
LS1.
</P>
<P>
   The LS6 is amazingly flexible, providing strong acceleration in
almost any gear of the new six-speed manual transmission. Just pick
a gear and let the engine do the rest. Shift if it pleases you.
Don't if you feel lazy. This engine can be a ridiculously relaxed
cruiser. In sixth gear, at 90 mph, it turns over only 2,300 times a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Subtle touches set the car apart from lesser 'Vettes: Z06
emblems on front fenders, light-gray wheels over red brake
calipers, scoops that funnel air to the brakes, racier-looking
instruments, a red engine cover. On a Saturday afteroon in Dull,
about 100 miles southwest of Toledo, it didn't take the Z06 long to
catch the eye of Bobbie Clark, who'd been mowing his lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a retired corrections officer, is responsible for signs
around the hamlet, also known as Dull Station, like ``6 Houses
Makes 1 Dull Town'' and ``Dull Station. Population 22, 6 Dogs and
10 Cats.'' He puts up the signs and spruces up the area, he said,
because he appreciates its history.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy, likewise, has honored the Corvette's history by invoking
the car's legendary first chief engineer, Zora Arkus-Duntov. In
1963, he created the first Z06 package, aimed at purists who wanted
a 'Vette they could pick up at the dealership and take directly to
the racetrack. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few other places where a driver can judiciously
put the car's capabilities to good use. The Z06 forces the driver
to become a sneak thief _ grabbing some extra speed on an entrance
or exit ramp or on an open stretch of road when no one's around _
and passing becomes an opportunity instead of an annoyance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Should enthusiasm overcome common sense, help is available. All
2001 Corvettes come with Chevrolet's second-generation
active-handling system, which senses oversteer or understeer and
makes adjustments to help bring the car back into balance. But the
system has been reworked to be even less intrusive to an enthusiast
driver, briefly reducing wheel spin without cutting engine power so
much that the car bogs down.
</P>
<P>
   The system can even detect the difference between a skilled
driver who is visually anticipating a slide and countersteering
correctly, and a driver who is playing catchup, said Hill, the
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   This Corvette certainly doesn't suffer from attention-deficit
disorder, it is very focused _ aimed at the most serious Corvette
enthusiasts, those who want the most when it comes to performance
on the track or simple bragging rights. &QL;

A BITTER END TO A WOMAN'S SWEET LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The house where Terisa Mae Anderson used to live reminds me of
Anderson herself, a jewel in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The green and white paint is peeling, the flower boxes are empty
and the magnolia and weeping willow trees could use trimming.
</P>
<P>
   The old rusty Chevrolet Impala, still parked in the driveway
after all these years, has seen better days.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   She used to be spry, working hard every day, voting in every
election, enjoying life. Then she lost her sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all happened after I had surgery in my mouth,'' she says.
``I walked in the house, and all of a sudden I went blank.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed for Anderson. With her sight gone, she found
it hard to care for herself, let alone keep up her home.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the plumbing went bad, the roof began to cave in.
Men came and took her money, up to $1,600 once, to fix things. They
left only broken promises and Anderson seated in her kitchen, the
only place in the house where the rain couldn't get in.
</P>
<P>
   Now she sits miles away on the other side of town, cowering
under a brown blanket.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the darkness and the deceit and the drenching rain
have wrought for Anderson. But her story is familiar; it happens
thousands of times each year across the country. Rather than
shining as beacons of longevity and perseverance, the nation's
elderly are often cast into the darkness of abuse, neglect and
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services says
that more than 36,000 cases of elder abuse and neglect were
confirmed in the state last year alone. Many victims, like
Anderson, live in unsanitary conditions or without heat or running
water until someone reaches out to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three out of four cases that we see involve neglect,'' says
Stacey Ladd, spokeswoman for the department. ``Some simply need
assistance with meals and other activities of daily living.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 90, came to the department's attention nearly four
months ago. The home where she lived alone had been in disrepair
for years. A radio, tuned to a Christian radio station, was her
only companion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just in bad shape,'' Anderson says. ``Everything I had
is practically ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   She says things are much better now at the adult foster home
where social workers took her to live. She appreciates each gesture
of kindness. But there is a sadness in her voice, a longing for
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just don't make you feel good at all,'' she says. ``You
just don't know it till you go through it. I still hold on, 'cause
you ain't going to take nothing with you.''
</P>
<P>
   As Anderson nears the end of her days, the measure of her
earthly goods is unimportant. The important thing is that she
leaves knowing that someone cared.
</P>

   DOCTORS-UNIONS (Washington) _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
says he will block action on a House-passed bill sponsored by Rep.
Tom Campbell, R-Calif., that would allow doctors to bargain

House early Friday, would give physicians a limited antitrust
exemption so they could band together to negotiate with health

of church and state. By MARK HELM.

will roar out of a central California silo next Friday heading west
over the Pacific in a $100 million test of a new weapon that will
try to knock the missile down. The test of a scaled-back successor
to a weapon in President Ronald Reagan's Star Wars plan, could have

THE NINE BEST CABLE SHOWS YOU'VE PROBABLY NEVER HEARD OF, BUT
SHOULDN'T MISS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Network reruns running you down? We feel your pain. So what
better time to explore cable's netherworld of hidden treasures,
those underappreciated morsels you usually channel-surf right by on
your mad dash to catch ``Friends,'' ``ER'' and ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire''? These easy-to-miss specialty delights run the gamut,
from bizarre to bold, smart to silly, sexy to salacious.
</P>
<P>
   So go forth with this list of off-the-beaten-path shows. View it
as a starter kit to a bolder, more adventurous existence in front
of the tube.
</P>
<P>
   1. He's been gored, clawed, chomped, bitten, savaged, jumped on,
whacked and groped by a variety of creatures, big and small, yet
Australian Steve Irwin keeps coming back for more on the wildlife
series ``Crocodile Hunter'' (7, 8, 10 and 11 p.m. weekdays, Animal
Planet). You should, too. Every episode of this immensely
entertaining and often nail-biting series features Irwin in
seemingly imminent danger of being eaten alive by everything from
lions to tigers to bears _ not to mention pythons and those
ever-elusive crocodiles. What possesses Irwin to go eye-to-eye with
crocodiles in a muddy swamp? Bravery? Dedication? Insanity? Being
the son of naturalists and growing up studying, living and working
with animals explains Irwin's comfort level working with them. What
makes ``Crocodile Hunter'' so addictive is Irwin's factual tirades
and kid-in-a-candy store way of looking ``for crocs.'' How popular
is Irwin? Expect toys, games, a theme park and Croc Hunter action
figures with built-in audio of Irwin saying ``G'day, mate'' and
``What a ripper.'' Can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   2. Admit it. You've strolled into a room in your neighbors' home
and uttered, ``What a piece of. ...'' ``Changing Rooms'' (BBC
America, 4 and 4:30 p.m. Monday, Wednesday and Friday; 8 and 8:30
a.m., Saturday) allows you to ``act'' on such thoughts. In this
unique show, you get to strip, rip and paint the neighbor's room
that most annoys you. The catch: The neighbors get to redecorate a
room in your house. With only two days and a set budget, neighbors
go at it with a team of interior designers and carpenters. The only
condition is that the participants aren't allowed back into their
own homes until the work is done. Will neighbors like the finished
product and remain friends? Or will they hate the results and
strangle one another? ``Changing Rooms'' is hosted by Carol
Smillie, a former fashion model who broke into TV as an assistant
in the British ``Wheel of Fortune.'' Have there ever been any
fisticuffs? ``Not that,'' Smillie says, ``but there have been
neighbors never speaking to one another again. But usually, we all
do a pretty good job. And it's free. So how can you complain?''
</P>
<P>
   3. It's early morning and you're standing in a junkyard,
surrounded by acres of scrap and about as many tools. Here's the
challenge behind ``Junkyard Wars'' (8 p.m., weeknights starting
Wednesday, TLC): Two teams, all dressed up like extras from a ``Mad
Max'' sequel, have 10 hours to create the biggest, fastest,
strongest machine with parts they scrounge out of that junkyard.
Next week, for example, a team of psychologists called ``The Brainy
Bunch'' takes on a team of washing-machine repairmen in a
competition to build a better flying machine. The Brainy Bunch gets
ambitious and builds a full-sized glider using old airplane wings.
Viewers are entertained by the participants and even learn a thing
or two about airplane design. (You'll learn why anyone would put a
``canard,'' or tail, on the front of a plane instead of in the
back. Surely this question keeps you up nights.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Yeah, ``Wedding Story'' (various times weekdays, TLC) is as
sappy as it sounds. Not only are real-life weddings caught on tape,
but cameras follow the bride and groom through dress and tux
fittings to rehearsal dinners to in-laws jockeying for power.
Through all of this, the two lovebirds talk about what they're
getting into and how much they mean to one another. The best
``Wedding Story'' episodes are those of interfaith marriages (lots
of compromises, lots of friction) or when the bride and groom are
so different you wonder just how soon we'll catch them on ``Divorce
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   As one groom said, with a shot of his red-faced bride: ``Boy, I
don't know if I can get through this.'' She thought he said, ``Boy,
I don't know if I want to do this.'' Boy, we almost didn't have a
wedding on that episode. Clarifications brought the two back
together, and their big wedding went off without a hitch, except
for the uncle who had too much to drink. In another episode, the
mother of the bride accidentally smears lipstick on the white dress
an hour before the wedding. No need to fear. A dry cleaner in the
family gets it out in time, prompting someone to ask Mom when
handing her the dress, ``Can we trust you with this?'' She looked
like she was about to deck the guy.

   5. Brian Lamb has been called the Charlie Rose of books, but the
better-known Rose doesn't come close to Lamb in the astute
interrogator category. Lamb chairs the surprisingly spirited
``Booknotes'' (7 p.m. Sundays, C-SPAN) with the authority of a
grade-school teacher taking no mess. This isn't Stephen King or
some other pop-culture writer cruising through an interview with
``Today's'' Matt Lauer. Lamb sits face-to-face with authors to pick
apart their literature and their brains, and usually in a
just-the-facts-ma'am style that's so entertaining and illuminating
you'd think he wrote the book. Lamb can be so deadpan you often
think he hates absolutely everything. But it's fun to see authors
sweat, wondering if they are passing the Lamb smell test.
</P>
<P>
   6. As a TV personality, Tavis Smiley is as stiff as a board. He
once interviewed the comedian George Wallace, one of the
quickest-thinking comics alive today, and Smiley was so
straightforward and, well, ``serious,'' that Wallace nearly got up
and left. But as anchor of the hour-long chat fest ``BET Tonight''
(10 p.m. weeknights, Black Entertainment Television), Smiley
manages to get down to the point at hand with few biases and a lot
of courage, whether it's a discussion about sexuality in the black
church, a one-on-one with Islam leader Louis Farrakhan or rap star
and activist Chuck D. In terms of news and information, he's as
good as BET gets.
</P>
<P>
   7. What makes ``3's a Crowd'' (8:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.,
weeknights, The Game Show Network) so addictive is its potential
for complete and utter disaster. Think of ``Newlywed Game'' with an
ex-girlfriend tagging along. Couples invite former loves to the
party to see who knows the guy or girl best. Most of the questions
are of the intimate variety, and more times than not, the former
flames do quite well, which makes the current loves visibly
insecure. ``If she knows you that well,'' a woman says to a
boyfriend who seemed quite happy with the string of right answers
coming from his ex, ``then get a ride home with her tonight.'' This
would get totally out of hand if it weren't for host Alan Thicke, a
most effective mediator.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``The Simpsons'' aside, the networks have had their troubles
with animated projects, giving us ``God, the Devil and Bob'' and
other duds. MTV has been airing ``Daria'' (at various times) for a
few seasons now, and though no one seems to have noticed, it's
turning into one of the best programs on the air. (Yes, you read
that right.)
</P>
<P>
   Daria is a cynical young woman with oversize eyeglasses and a
strong sense of irony as her dominant personality trait. ``Good,''
she says when it begins to rain at a particularly bad time, ``I was
feeling too dry.'' Daria has friends but rarely cracks a smile,
maintaining the same facial expression, deadpan voice and serenely
negative attitude in nearly every situation. Her parents are idiots
and her friends are slackers, but Daria keeps moving through life
as though she's right and we're all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   9. Amario Kreutzberger (aka Don Francisco) has been doing this
for nearly 40 years, which is why ``Sabado Gigante'' (7 p.m.
Saturdays on Univision, KUVN/23) is perfect organized chaos. Part
``Oprah,'' part mess, it's a three-hour Spanish-language variety
show that takes the word ``variety'' to heart. It has some of
everything _ skits, game shows, singing, dancing, even ``serious''
subjects where audiences leave in tears. My Spanish may be limited,
but I'd rather watch one hour of ``Sabado Gigante'' than two hours
of that stilted comedy you get on ``The Tonight Show With Jay
Leno.''

UNDATED: '70s heyday. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And despite a top ticket price of $201, this spring's Crosby,
Stills, Nash &AMP; Young reunion _ the first time the four had hit the
road in 25 years _ did solid if not sell-out business. They also
released a new CD, though it didn't sell well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something really special,'' says Pollstar editor Gary
Bongiovani of the Eagles' long stadium tour. ``The public deemed it
special and they were willing to pay premium prices for it. The
public will pay for a special event _ but if it's not a really
special event and price it as one you can risk a sea of empty
seats.''
</P>
<P>
   The Return to Love tour also seems somewhat insulting, as if
Ross or her people thought fans would pay through the nose for any
group marketed as Diana Ross and the Supremes.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, for most of their time together, the group was
marketed as ``the Supremes''; it wasn't until mid-1967, after they
already had scored 10 No. 1 U.S. singles, that Diana Ross got
feature billing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ross certainly went on to great success as a recording
diva, the sweet, sure records she made as part of the Supremes
still stand as some of the best music of the '60s and are every bit
as important to the legend of the Motown sound as Smokey Robinson
and the Miracles or the Temptations.
</P>
<P>
   These groups ``were'' Motown, their softly insistent songs and
sense of style (plus that gentle, effortless choreography)
combining to form a template that has been revamped over and over
again _ as has, of course, Ross' stance as a diva's diva.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant but funky, the Supremes' rise from an inner-city
neighborhood to pop superstars in the United States and in Europe
was a remarkable rags-to-riches story, one accomplished with
elegance and taste. These days, though, a diva seems to be any
woman who has a number of hit singles and can get on a cable
special about divas; the word has been devalued.
</P>
<P>
   How wonderful it would have been, then, to hear Ross, Wilson and
Birdsong together, doing it up right, one last time. How many
dreams they could have made come true.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the tour stumbles on. Some of the reviews have been
fairly good, but others have not. Sonia Murray, writing in The
Atlanta Constitution, said that ``the trio cranked out all the hits
in the efficient and mechanical manner of a jukebox'' and that the
40-piece orchestra ``too often overpowered Ross' still-recognizable
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviews such as this may make it hard for the tour to gain
momentum, which is exactly what its promoters, TNA International,
are hoping for at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to comment about ticket sales _ it is what it
is,'' says TNA marketing director Susan Rosenberg. ``The shows are
fabulous, and hopefully when people read the reviews they'll get
off the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg said that the ``majority'' of tickets are $85; she
would not confirm how much Ross was paid for the tour.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Ross may be the one paying. Tours by superstars
don't usually fare as poorly as this, and there is a feeling among
some that the bad publicity generated will not soon be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can't be good for Diana's career,'' Bongiovani says.
``Any time you go to a show and look around and there are a lot of
empty seats, you don't feel as good about being there and paying
your money. The psychological impact on people is not a positive
one. It's always better to have a venue sell out, even if it's
smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``small'' was never a word associated with Diana Ross: She
has been a worldwide superstar for 35 years now, a woman synonymous
with success and money and fame.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, this is a very public low point _ and a
curious one _ because, with some smart thinking and a realization
of just how long the fans have waited for one more chance to see
the trio, it had all the potential to be a genuine event.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``did'' our love go, anyway?

 &HT;    A whole new twist on `Just Say No'
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ True love may wait, but Bill Hayes couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he promised back in 1993 to postpone having sex until he
was married. And yes, he held hands with hundreds of other young
Christians at The King's Academy in West Palm Beach and pledged to
stay pure. He even signed a True Love Waits card with the sincerest
of intentions.
</P>
<P>
   But that was when he was just 16, before he fell in love for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't plan it or anything,'' said Hayes, now 23. ``We were
dating for nine months. I really cared about her.''
</P>
<P>
   The moral of this story, supporters of abstinence programs will
tell you, is not that Hayes failed to live up to his commitment _
though they condemn his failure. It's that abstinence until
marriage has become a socially acceptable standard that Hayes and
other teenagers have set for themselves since they began their
campaign, a movement that has found its way into public school sex
education curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies their victory. And the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Since the True Love Waits campaign was launched by the Southern
Baptist Convention in Nashville in 1993, more than a million
teenagers have committed to virginity by signing True Love Waits
cards and pledging to ``respect'' themselves and their sexuality
enough to remain chaste, the SBC says. Hundreds of thousands of
others have promised the same thing through dozens of smaller
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a decade after those first rallies and pledge drives
began, all that chastity is beginning to show up in the wedding
aisles. This summer, pastors around the country are marrying brides
and grooms who are incorporating the commitment they made to
abstinence into their vows. During their ceremonies, they are
replacing the ``purity rings'' their parents gave them in high
school with wedding bands from their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   For those who didn't make it? ``It's not something I talk about
with other people,'' said Hayes, a King's Academy graduate who
asked that his real name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   But for Hayes and those like him, opponents of ``abstinence
only'' programs want to keep a full range of sex education classes
in public schools. To teach only one part of sex education, critics
say, is to champion idealism, not reality.
</P>
<P>
   IDEA TOUTED IN EARLY '90S
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, before the True Love Waits program became
mainstream, abstinence was more likely to be the punch line at the
end of a joke in a high school locker room than an option earnestly
discussed by typical 16-year-olds. But since the early 1990s, the
ideal has been touted by public figures and morphed into a part of
the federal government's curriculum for sex education in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996 more than 1,000 ``abstinence only'' educational
programs have sprung up in school districts across the country, and
in that time, sex among teens has decreased. According to a Centers
For Disease Control and Prevention study, the percentage of teens
who had sex by the time they graduated from high school dropped
from 72 percent in 1990 to 64 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to abstain ``is determined by a whole variety of
things,'' said JoAnne Grunbaum, a health scientist with the CDC.
``It's hard to know what influenced it: Environment, peer norms,
education, adult practices. Change is complex and there's not just
one good answer.''
</P>
<P>
   True Love Waits and the dozens of other church-based abstinence
programs that have sprung up in the past few years are quick to
take some of the credit. They deserve it, they say, because they
have built a very public social support system for virginity and
brought chastity out of the closet. True Love Waits participants
have held dozens of rallies and concerts and stacked hundreds of
thousands of cards end to end on the Mall in Washington, across the
Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and to the roof of the Georgia
Dome. The message: Virginity is safe, smart and cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is about being a man of character and integrity,''
says Scott Mawdesley, a 27-year-old virgin who says his pledge to
abstinence has been kept strong by the support of three roommates
from college who are also virgins and with whom he talks regularly.
Of his girlfriend of seven months, he says: ``I respect her, and I
don't want to use her, and the way I respect her is by respecting
God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach County School District _ which began offering
``abstinence only'' seminars for middle and high school students in
1998 _ incorporates the character and integrity part but has tried
to leave the God part out of it. (Traditional sex education is
still taught in health courses.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not allowed to mention anything about God,'' says Kathy
Seppia, program director for ``Be The One,'' an abstinence program
taught in 32 district schools last year. ``We don't take a moral
stand on anything.'' (Neither the Martin nor St. Lucie County
school districts have applied for the federal government
abstinence-only grants).
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, statewide about half of the abstinence only
programs have their roots in church-financed organizations.
</P>
<P>
   What these federally financed programs teach is that abstinence
is the ``expected standard'' until marriage and that sex outside of
marriage ``is likely to have harmful psychological and physical
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like the conservative Christian party line that's
because it is, says Rob Boston, a spokesman for Americans United
for the Separation of Church and State.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, the Christian Coalition tried to take sex education
out of schools altogether. When that failed, they regrouped and
began pushing in Washington for an ``abstinence only'' curriculum.
In 1996, they successfully lobbied Congress to attach $250 million
in federal money to abstinence-only curriculums with the mandate
that no information on other forms of birth control be added.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a one-sided look at human sexuality, critics
claim. The danger: While students may get traditional sex education
in health class, those who are receiving only abstinence education
are missing crucial information. And, liberals say, it's naive to
think that pushing abstinence will keep teens from having sex.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush brothers, among a cadre of influential conservative
politicians, would disagree. And they're putting their money where
their beliefs are. Florida will dedicate a record $10 million to
``abstinence only'' education this year, and, if elected, George W.
Bush _ who has called up teens to forgo sex until they are in a
biblical marriage relationship _ has promised to nearly triple
federal money for abstinence only education.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thinks abstinence for teens is a bad idea,'' says
Boston. ``But there's a hidden agenda going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   A RELIGIOUS DEBATE BREWING
</P>
<P>
   Just beneath the surface of this debate, a battle over the best
way to teach sex education is brewing between the secular left and
the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Explains Amy Stephens, a spokesperson for Focus on the Family, a
Christian organization in Colorado Springs, Colorado: ``Liberal
atheists'' fear losing the control they gained in the '60s and '70s
over the country's sex education programs. And Planned Parenthood
is worried about losing government money to ``abstinence only''
programs. Lillian Tamayo, the CEO for Planned Parenthood of Palm
Beach and the Treasure Coast, views the battle from the other side:
``I think we're watching political and religious extremists shaping
social policy.'' From both sides statistical bombs are hurled. This
from Planned Parenthood: In 1999 a Planned Parenthood survey found
that 84 percent of Americans believe that the full range of sexual
education should be available to students. ``Which makes you ask,
who are these people (in the religious right) and who are they
representing?'' Tamayo says.
</P>
<P>
   PLEDGES SAID TO DELAY SEX
</P>
<P>
   From Focus on the Family: Even when pledges of virginity are
broken, they delay the beginning of sexual relations by years,
saving taxpayers millions of dollars in health-care costs from
abortions and sexually transmitted diseases. Leading Stephens to
ask, ``What, exactly, (are groups like Planned Parenthood) so
scared of?''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Oates, an astute 25-year-old youth-minister at Christ
Fellowship Church in Palm Beach Gardens, knows both sides of this
debate and has both feet clearly on the side of abstinence. The
debate has stirred up the church and forced pastors to deal much
more aggressively with the issue of sexuality _ and to deal with it
more realistically.
</P>
<P>
   He regularly divides the men and women into groups and asks the
kids to anonymously write down any questions they have about sex
and pass them forward. ``Those nights are always well-attended,''
says Oates, a virgin who's getting married next month. And he deals
with the subject frankly in his sermons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 14, I used to pray that Jesus wouldn't return yet
because I wanted to have sex,'' Oates tells about 100 18- to
30-year-olds at a recent Monday night singles service. ``But I'll
tell you this, heaven will be better than any sex you have down
here.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude typifies the religious right's naive approach to
sexuality, Tamayo says. Promises of spiritual ecstasy may work for
the faithful Christian teens from the solid, two-parent homes, but
it's not going to work for everyone. For those who don't abstain or
believe, she says, ``we need to arm them for real life so they can
make real-life decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Mawdesley has a retort to this that doesn't invite a
rejoinder. Believing that kids are going to have sex regardless of
the risk or the warnings is to believe that God doesn't exist, he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   If the Darwinists are right, and humans evolved from animals,
then, like animals, ``our sexuality will always dominate us.''
</P>
<P>
   But if people were put here by God, fully formed, as
creationists like Mawdesley believe, then they can and should
control their sexual urges. ``And I'm here to tell you we can
control it,'' Mawdesley says. ``I'm proof.''

&HT;     ENDANGERED OWL'S HABITAT EXTENDS TO SAN FRANCISCO BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The northern spotted owl, poster bird for the
campaign against logging in national forests, is thriving in its
most southerly range.
</P>
<P>
   National Park Service biologists have found 50 pairs nesting on
public land in Marin County, including the Golden Gate National
Recreation Area, Muir Woods National Monument and Point Reyes
National Seashore.
</P>
<P>
   The news is significant because this is the first census
undertaken by the federal scientists in Marin County, the southern
edge of the California, Oregon and Washington range. They were
surprised to find so many healthy birds producing young here in a
wide array of habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rare owl, listed as threatened under the Endangered
Species Act, is more at risk from development than from timber
cutting, say the scientists who seriously started tracking its
whereabouts three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nesting in Douglas firs, bishop pines, coastal redwoods, remnant
old-growth stands and even California bay trees, they have a more
ready food supply than their Pacific Northwest counterparts. But in
crowded Marin County, just north of San Francisco, they have less
space to live, the scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appear to be occupying all of the evergreen forested
habitat that there is whether it's conifer or hardwood. We looked
in places we didn't expect to find them, and we found them,'' said
Daphne Hatch, Golden Gate National Recreation Area wildlife
biologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kinds of threats that they're subject to in Marin are
quite different than in the Pacific Northwest. But they're as
real,'' Hatch said. ``It could be development along the urban
boundaries of public lands or disturbance from the incredible
amount of people using their habitat every day for recreation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch is heading the study with Sarah Allen, the science adviser
at the Point Reyes National Seashore.
</P>
<P>
   Muir Woods park ranger Mia Monroe, who is assisting with the
study, started tracking the northern spotted owls in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, the National Park Service had found more than 85 sites
used by the owl on public lands in Marin County, and began
long-term monitoring at about half of them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the National Park Service started banding owls on the
three Marin County national parklands.
</P>
<P>
   This year, preliminary analysis showed 37 pairs, two single
owls, five unoccupied sites and two sites of undermined occupancy.
In three years, 50 pairs have been found.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are pleased with the number they have found. Yet they
wonder how the apparently isolated Marin County population can
survive without recruits from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to be very isolated from owls to the north in the
Russian River area. Maybe this is a remnant population left from
when there was more habitat in the past,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the spotted owls don't have land on which to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``What public land we have is the habitat they're going to have.
Whether this population can be sustained over time is what we're
interested in,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people think of the northern spotted owl as a
resident of the remote old forests in Northern California, Oregon
and Washington, scientists have long identified their natural
southern boundary as the Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to see more work done down there because it will
fill in a big gap in our knowledge,'' said Eric Forsman, research
wildlife biologist with the U.S. Forest Service's Pacific Northwest
Forest Experimental Station in Corvallis, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Forsman, who has been studying the threatened bird since 1968
and is a member of a prestigious national research team, said the
northern spotted owls can live very well in the smaller forests of
Marin County.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for the structure of a forest not for the size
of a tree. They like forests when they can get into the shade when
it's real hot, find shelter from rain and go to cavities in trees
or on platforms for nesting,'' Forsman said.

ISRAELI AIRCRAFT MAKER RUNS AFOUL OF U.S. WITH CHINA RADAR
CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOD, Israel _ Behind a tarpaulin-covered fence at the far edge
of the Israel Aircraft Industries complex at Ben-Gurion
International Airport here sits a refurbished Russian transport,
its saucer-like radar pod temporarily removed for fine-tuning.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, company officials say, the pod will be back, the
radar switched on, and the distinctive droop-winged jet ready for
its final test flights. The plane, a transformed Ilyushin-76, will
be able to monitor air and telecommunications traffic more than 200
miles away _ the specifications ordered by the plane's owner, the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel Aircraft Industries' president, Moshe Keret, who over
the last 15 years has built a virtually bankrupt military
contractor into Israel's biggest exporter, the sale was to have
been one his greatest achievements. The Phalcon early-warning radar
system installed on the Chinese plane showcased all the strengths
of IAI _ as the state-owned company is known _ its technological
prowess and its success in developing new markets abroad to help
pay for Israel's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Pentagon has its way _ and the betting here is that
it will _ the converted Ilyushin will never reach China, which long
ago gave Israel Aircraft the down payment on the $250 million spy
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, President Clinton reiterated Washington's concern that
China could use the radar system against U.S. forces in the Taiwan
Strait. Earlier in the week, the House Appropriations Committee
called on Israel to terminate the deal, with many members pledging
to cut Israel's aid if it does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We signed a contract,'' a top official of Israel Aircraft
said. ``We have their money. Now we say, `No, sorry?'''
</P>
<P>
   To foreign policy analysts, the Phalcon dispute is an
illustration of how Israeli-U.S. strategic ties are still often
frayed by miscommunication and mistrust on both sides _ as well as
by rare but deep divergences in each country's conception of its
national interest. The China contract has opened the first
significant rift between the Clinton administration and the
government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak, just as both governments
are trying to persuade the Palestinians to join them in Washington
for a conclusive round of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   But to Keret, 65, who has worked at Israel Aircraft his entire
adult life, the conflict is also a potential business catastrophe,
one that he thinks directly threatens his company's prospects for
survival in an increasingly competitive and consolidated global
arms industry.
</P>
<P>
   A threat to Israel Aircraft's future is seen by many Israeli
leaders as a threat to the nation, both militarily and
economically. The company, founded in 1953, is the centerpiece of a
domestic arms and aeronautics industry that Israel considers the
key to its defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about the Phalcon per se,'' said Keret,
who has been asked by the government not to comment on the deal, at
IAI headquarters here. ``But what is the environment in which we
are operating? It is very competitive. Although we are a
state-owned company, we get no subsidy, and no favoritism from the
defense ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Boeing and other behemoths of the global defense
trade, Israel Aircraft is no giant: Its $1 billion in foreign
military sales puts it about 30th among major arms sellers abroad,
according to independent assessments. Overall sales reached $2
billion last year, two-thirds from military contracts and the rest
from commercial aircraft production and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to overstate the company's importance to
Israel. With 14,000 skilled workers, Israel Aircraft is by far the
country's biggest industrial employer, comparable in U.S. terms to
General Motors and General Electric combined. A further 15,000
Israeli jobs are indirectly dependent on the company. And its $1.6
billion in military and commercial sales abroad make it the biggest
exporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a disaster in IAI for one reason or another,''
Keret said, ``its effects would be felt throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   A certain disaster for the company would be any significant
erosion of U.S. aid. IAI has been the biggest beneficiary of U.S.
rules permitting a quarter of military assistance to be spent in
Israel _ for purchases of arms produced in this country. Yet Moshe
Arens, a three-time former defense minister, whose views are widely
shared here, said this week that $2 billion in annual military aid
is ``not sufficient to make us start accepting U.S. control over
defense industry exports.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials seem mystified that Israel would jeopardize its
critical international alliance by pursuing what appears to be a
marginal weapons deal. Last fall, as the China controversy broke
into the open, the same Israeli officials who were defending the
Phalcon sale were presenting Washington with a $17 billion wish
list of arms they said the country needed to compensate for the
then-expected turnover of the Golan Heights to Syria. Now the
Israelis are discussing a similar military aid package to safeguard
a peace pact with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to explain to Israelis that Americans cannot
understand why Israel was refusing to give up $250 million when it
was asking the United States for $17 billion,'' said David
Makovsky, who has been an Israeli analyst at the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy.
</P>
<P>
   But far more than $250 million is at stake, say Israeli leaders.
``We'll do our utmost to act sensitively and to be attentive to
U.S. interests,'' Barak, who appoints Israel Aircraft's board,
said. ``At the same time, there's a contract with China, signed
during the incumbency of the previous government. The state doesn't
call off contracts to which it is a signatory just like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even seen narrowly, the contract with China is potentially a $2
billion deal, huge by Israel Aircraft standards. Under terms
negotiated three years ago, Beijing has options to buy seven more
Phalcon-equipped Ilyushins. Fulfilling such a contract would
catapult the company into an elite fraternity of major contractors
in bidding for such systems _ and it would subsidize further
technological advances at home. Though Israel Aircraft lost to
Boeing in a recent bid to supply early-warning planes to Australia,
it is competing for a $2 billion contract in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-ISRAEL-AIRCRAFT-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; LOD: in Turkey. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worse, executives say, the cancellation of the contract would be
a signal to potential customers that no deal with Israel Aircraft
is final, as the United States could effectively veto a promised
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to buy from the Europeans,'' a gloomy executive said.
Or perhaps from the Russians, who supplied destroyers, cruise
missiles and other heavy weaponry to the Chinese over the last
decade with few protests from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as others here cynically suggest, from the Americans
themselves. Israelis point to the continuing export of advanced
military technology to China by the United States in the last
decade: Since the ban by Congress in 1989 on military sales to
Beijing, after the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen
Square, the White House has issued waivers for some $300 million in
exports of satellite and encryption equipment to the country.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the United States did not renege on its own deals,
Israelis note, fulfilling $36 million in orders placed by China
before the ban, including anti-artillery radar systems.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial last week, the newspaper Maariv decried what it
called ``Washington's attempts to torpedo the deal and sabotage
Israel's defense exports, perhaps out of the desire to protect the
interests of giant U.S. corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Maariv, like other leading media voices here, concluded that
Israel would have little choice but to renege on the contract.
Until the dispute is resolved, another daily, Haaretz, said, ``The
Phalcon will continue to be a sword of Damocles hanging over
Israel's head.''
</P>
<P>
   Keret seems surprised by the furor in Washington over the
Phalcon deal. Until newspapers here published photos of the plane
late last year, setting off the American outcry, company executives
say they considered the contract old news.
</P>
<P>
   When the company bid for the contract in 1996, Israel officially
notified the United States that the Phalcon system did not
incorporate protected U.S. technology, a contention the Pentagon
has never challenged. Though Washington officials say they objected
to the sale on strategic and human rights grounds, there were no
public complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, calling for delivery beginning in 2000, was concluded
in highly publicized trips to Moscow and Beijing by then-Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
In April 1998, the Phalcon sale was reported to Congress in a
General Accounting Office review of recent Chinese arms purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Again, there were no public U.S. protests, though officials say
they tried to dissuade Israel from signing. ``As the deal went
forward, they weren't hearing us anymore,'' a senior State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Though U.S. companies were prohibited from selling radar planes
to China after the events there in June 1989, Israel Aircraft
considered this a commercial opportunity. In the first foreign sale
of its airborne radar, it sent a Phalcon-equipped Boeing 767 to
Chile, which was then prohibited by Congressional strictures from
buying Boeing Awacs surveillance planes. Washington raised no
objections, Keret said.
</P>
<P>
   From Central America in the 1980s to Turkey in the 1990s, the
company provided other military equipment to countries where U.S.
exports were constrained by human rights considerations.
</P>
<P>
   And in China, Israel Aircraft was hardly alone. Competitors in
Italy and Britain were both offering advanced airborne radar
systems to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States has since become more worried by Beijing's
conflict with Taiwan, and officials are telling the Israeli
contractor that no company so dependent on U.S. trade and aid can
consider itself geopolitically autonomous.
</P>
<P>
   By design, Keret has made Israel Aircraft increasingly reliant
on the United States as a market, supplier and business partner,
creating joint ventures with all the major aerospace companies. And
through its own U.S. subsidiaries _ including its Galaxy corporate
jet business, based in Fort Worth _ the company says it spends
about $400 million yearly in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With such partners, the company specializes in upgrading U.S.
aircraft for foreign air forces _ and even for the United States
Air Force, which recently awarded Israel Aircraft and Boeing a $400
million contract to revamp 450 of its T-38 Talon trainers. The
small unmanned planes, an IAI specialty, proved a key
reconnaissance weapon for the U.S. Army in Kosovo, prompting other
NATO orders.
</P>
<P>
   In its most ambitious U.S. joint venture, Israel Aircraft is the
principal contractor on the Arrow, a $2 billion
anti-ballistic-missile system deployed here this year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. support has been critical to the company's turnaround.
After weathering a worldwide plunge in military sales in the
mid-1990s, it has stayed in the black for 14 consecutive quarters.
Net profit last year rose to $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Boeing and Lockheed Martin heed the Pentagon before
pursuing foreign arms deals, so now must Israel Aircraft, many
officials of this country reluctantly conclude.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Israel Aircraft tried to buck the Pentagon and its
military contractors, Keret painfully recalls, it almost destroyed
the company. The project was his baby: IAI's own jet fighter, the
Lavi, envisioned as a successor _ and competitor _ to the Air
Force's F-16. The increasingly expensive project was canceled under
pressure from Washington in 1987, just a year after the Lavi's
maiden flight. The move wiped out 5,000 jobs and nearly propelled
Israel Aircraft into receivership.
</P>
<P>
   Keret is credited with rescuing the company from the Lavi
debacle. The radar and navigation and missile-guidance systems
developed for the Lavi were refined into independent products, many
of them now installed on IAI-refurbished F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   But as he sits in his corporate offices in Lod, which are still
decorated with models and photographs of the extinct Israeli
fighter, Keret says he regrets the loss of corporate and national
independence that the Lavi symbolized. ``It was a good plane,'' he
said. ``I'm sure we could have sold a lot of them.''

   HOUSTON _ In life, Gary Graham was known as a convicted
murderer. In death, he was hailed as a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 people turned out Thursday for the funeral of
36-year-old Graham, who preferred to go by the African name Shaka
Sankofa. He was executed last week for the 1981 murder of a man
outside a Houston market.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was convicted based in the testimony of one witness. He
had pleaded with courts and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential hopeful, to halt the execution.
</P>
<P>
   The burial service lasted more than three hours, with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson preaching for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In his sermon, Jackson called on more blacks to register to vote
and urged other governors to join Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a
Republican, in placing a moratorium on executions. Voter
registration cards were distributed during the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must pick up the baton where Shaka left it,'' Jackson said,
then echoed a sentiment from Graham's final statement: ``We've lost
this battle, but we haven't lost the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who spoke portrayed capital punishment as the
product of a racist system.

   ``This death penalty is anti-poor and anti-people-of-color and
we must stand up to that,'' said Robert Muhammad, a Nation of Islam

   The funeral was boisterous as often as it was somber. A gospel
choir was on hand, and the service opened with African rituals that
included chants and drums.

HONG KONG HOMEOWNERS PROTEST DROP IN PROPERTY PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ With a solemn raising of the Chinese flag and the
dulcet tones of Hong Kong schoolchildren singing the Chinese
national anthem, this former British colony on Saturday morning
marked the third anniversary of its reversion to Chinese
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong may seem more like China with each passing year, but
it is still wrestling with the legacy of 156 years of colonial
rule. Last week this prosperous city was treated to the spectacle
of 2,000 well-dressed homeowners taking to the streets to protest
the plunge in property prices.
</P>
<P>
   Brandishing signs with such unproletarian messages as ``Negative
Equity Is Eroding Our Society,'' the crowd demanded that the
government prop up the real estate market. The commentators poked
fun, but the rally has sparked a genuine debate about one of Hong
Kong's most durable colonial-era practices.
</P>
<P>
   Property prices here are effectively set by the government
through a system of land auctions that dates from when the British
crown owned all the land in Hong Kong and parceled it out through
99-year leases. That arrangement worked nicely as long as asset
values in Asia rose year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, residential property prices have dropped 50 percent
_ a lingering effect of the Asian financial crisis. Hong Kong's
real estate market, unlike that of other parts of Asia, shows
little sign of recovery. And the government, as the regulator of
prices, is getting the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of middle-class people who are under financial
strain, and they're angry,'' said David Dodwell, the author of a
book, ``The Hong Kong Advantage,'' about the local economy. ``A lot
of them paid very high prices for apartments because they assumed
the price would continue to go up.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those people is Thomas Lo, the sales director of a
health-care company here. Lo bought his two-bedroom apartment in
April 1997, near the peak of the market, for $610,000. Two months
later, on the eve of the handover to China, a real estate agent
offered him $650,000. Lo decided to hold onto it. Today he figures
the apartment is worth no more than $320,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my kind of income, I should be able to live a
comfortable, relaxed life,'' Lo said. ``But now I'm looking at
buying a used car. Before, I would always buy the latest model of a
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Lo, 38, said he does not feel sorry for himself. He can still
afford to make his mortgage payments. But he said he cannot imagine
selling the apartment at a big loss. So rather than trading up to a
bigger place in a few years, he fears he will be stuck in this one
until retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Churchouse, a property analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, estimated that roughly 20 percent of Hong Kong residents
are in Lo's situation _ that is, the current market value of their
apartments is less than the amount of the mortgage outstanding on
the properties.
</P>
<P>
   But far more people have suffered a dramatic loss of wealth,
which has led to bitterness toward Hong Kong's postcolonial
government. The organizers of the homeowners' rally, leaders of the
pro-government Liberal Party, were nonplused when demonstrators
shouted ``Down with Tung,'' a reference to the city's
Beijing-appointed chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse in property prices is also rippling through the
economy in the form of weak consumer spending. Although Hong Kong
is enjoying a robust economic recovery, it is driven largely by
exports. A decline in export markets, particularly the United
States, could derail the recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a cliff here; there is the potential to fall off that
cliff, either by inactivity or intervention,'' said Nicholas
Brooke, chairman of Brooke International, a real estate agency.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's land policy has also widened the gap between rich
and poor. Because the government doles out new land sparingly, it
commands high premiums. Private developers recoup their huge
investment by charging astronomical rents. The result is that more
than 70 percent of residents cannot afford to own homes.
</P>
<P>
   About half of Hong Kong's 7 million people live in public
housing. Another 25 percent buy private housing subsidized by the
government. With their salaries frozen in the wake of the Asian
crisis, these middle-income people have little hope of moving to
better apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Hong Kong becomes gradually more democratic, the divisions
between the rich and poor are no longer tenable,'' Dodwell said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He and other experts said Hong Kong needs to overhaul its land
policy. During the Asian crisis, the government suspended land
sales to stabilize prices. In mid-June, under pressure from
property tycoons, it took a more modest step _ pulling off the
market 16,000 subsidized apartments that it had planned to sell.
</P>
<P>
   A few commentators have called on Hong Kong to get out of the
property business altogether. They say that as long as the
government controls the land, the territory will be doomed to
cycles of boom and bust. But even they concede that it would be
extraordinarily difficult to unravel a system of land ownership so
deeply rooted in Hong Kong's colonial past.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any pressure from Beijing to take radical steps.
Whatever its views about Hong Kong's other colonial relics, it
seems content to stay out of the property market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can change the ownership of the land,''
said Ian K. Perkin, chief economist of the Hong Kong General
Chamber of Commerce. ``The only question you can ask is `How can
you deliver the right amount of land to guarantee stable, or
gradually increasing, land prices?'''

A REPORTER'S CHILDHOOD IS INDELIBLY BRANDED BY A TERRIBLE
SEVEN-YEAR DROUGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARY ROGERS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was 5 _ almost 6 _ the first time I saw rain. Surely it had
rained in San Angelo before that afternoon in 1952, but I can't
recall it. I don't know why I should remember this brief episode so
clearly. I can't remember the first time I saw snow. Maybe the rain
lifted Momma's spirits so that I thought all our disappointments
were behind us. I didn't know then that I would be 10 years old
before the savage drought that held West Texas in a suffocating
grip was broken.
</P>
<P>
   In a drought there's always some rain _ just never enough. A
drought is a thief who sneaks into the land to lap up the water and
the commerce while occasionally taunting the earth with stingy
rains here and there.
</P>
<P>
   It never begins with one great catastrophe as a tornado or a
flood might. There is no definite point of time that looking back
you can point to and say,
</P>
<P>
   ``There, that is the moment it began,'' or, ``That is when it
ended.'' Drought is like the sudden realization that life has
changed and you with it, but you cannot say how this happened _ or
when.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   All my memories of the Texas drought of the 1950s are like faded
watercolors that I see through a lens stained the color of the
arroyo sand. I remember the dust, the heat, the swarms of
grasshoppers that rippled out before you like waves on the water as
you walked across the brittle grass, their wings making a whirring,
clicking sound.
</P>
<P>
   The drought was young the afternoon of my remembered rain. My
teen-age brother said the shower was like a girl in tight, red
shorts _ only a tease, but now I see it as a promise of things to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Momma and I stretched out on the bed on that summer afternoon in
1952 and she read to me, probably from ``Aesop's Fables,'' tales
that always had a moral, or maybe it was ``Arabian Nights,'' one of
my favorites. I loved this story of a clever woman who saved her
own life by telling such fascinating tales that her cruel husband,
who had already killed many other wives, let her live so she could
finish the stories of Sinbad, Ali Baba, and Aladdin and his magic
lamp. I'm sure that's where I first got the notion that a
storyteller is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The abelia bush outside the open window was in bloom, but there
was a new smell in the wind, something sweeter than the perfume of
the hardy white blossoms. Momma closed the book and turned onto her
stomach, propping her chin in her cupped hands. She was sad again I
knew. I can see her still in my mind's eye, her dark eyes
bewildered and clouded with grief. She seemed tired and somehow
lonely. Even as a child, I knew she was just going through the
motions of reading to me, finding little joy in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   In November of 1951, my baby sister, Martha, had died. ``She's a
little angel now,'' Daddy said. I couldn't imagine that tiny baby,
all red and shriveled, with wings, but I didn't argue.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been with them when they picked out the miniature casket.
Outside on the sidewalk, Momma had leaned against the buff-colored
bricks of the funeral home and cried. There hadn't been much sound,
only a small whimpering noise _ and tears. Lots of tears.
</P>
<P>
   I held her hand tightly, and jumped up and down to get her
attention but she seemed not to notice. Daddy put his arms around
her, their shadow fell against the funeral home wall, melding into
one image. My shadow stood alone. I made it dance and jiggle in the
bright sun.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I was relieved that Martha had not survived. I was
glad she was an angel. I'd been terrified that my mother would die
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Momma had been cross and sick throughout the pregnancy. One
night, as the family listened to the radio in the living room and
Mother fried potatoes in the kitchen, a man came to the door. I
remember very well that he was selling cemetery plots. My brother,
who was then about 17, opened the door and my father got up from
the brown armchair as if to talk with the man, but Daddy never even
turned down the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look here, I'm a young man. I have a young family,'' Daddy
said and his wave encompassed me and my older brother and sister.
``I don't have any use for a cemetery plot.''
</P>
<P>
   The man turned to go, but he hadn't reached the street before
Momma came to the kitchen door. She leaned against the doorjamb, a
big spoon in her hand, an apron stretched tight across her pregnant
belly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call him back,'' she said. Her voice was hard, commanding.
``You do need a cemetery plot.'' Then her voice became softer,
darker. ``One of us isn't going to make it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They stood very still, their eyes locked on each other, and then
Daddy moved slowly to the door to call the man back.
</P>
<P>
   A prickly shiver shot down my spine and exploded into my
stomach. My mother was going to die? I knew about death. I'd seen
our neighbor slaughter goats. My cat, Freckles, had been hit by a
car and was buried under the mesquite tree at the corner of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   We had a dog once that left for a while and then came home, but
I knew dead things never came back. I knew I didn't want my mother
to die and leave me forever. I wanted to be with her always.
</P>
<P>
   My ears buzzed and my stomach flip-flopped like a fish on a line
_ a fish that was dying, but not dead yet. The buzzing was like a
swarm of flies that had found the goat's bloody and discarded skin.
The sound grew louder as Daddy called the man back.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Momma was right, of course. The baby, born with many
complications, did not survive, but in a way neither did my mother.
For months, maybe years, she was given to ferocious fits of temper
and dark hours filled with brooding, followed by crying jags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walk on eggs, Mother is nervous today,'' my older sister would
warn as she boarded the city bus headed for the high school across
town.
</P>
<P>
   A family in the next block had a new baby as it did almost every
year and my mother attached herself to it. She cradled it in her
arms and sang to it. I'd try to climb into her lap only to be
gently pushed away. She loved me, I knew, but I was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving and Christmas came and went. Spring turned into a
hot summer. Oscillating fans stirred the stifling air, but at
night, it often grew too hot to sleep inside. Like so many other
families, my family sometimes took blankets into the yard and laid
them on the brittle grass, hoping for some breath of cooler air.
There was usually a radio propped in the window.
</P>
<P>
   I always woke in my bed, so someone must have carried me into
the house in the small hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone talked of rain, but no rain came. A drought that spread
across the Southwest grew worse. West Texas baked under an
unrelenting sun. The old-timers who said they'd seen it this bad
before didn't sound so sure anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Preachers took up the cause. Every church had multiple prayer
meetings to beg God for rain. I remember very well sitting near the
front of the sanctuary at First Baptist Church at more than one of
these meetings.
</P>
<P>
   My mother always carried paper and crayons in hopes I'd amuse
myself through the sermon. I, like most children of that day,
always chose brown when coloring pasture scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Green pastures weren't part of my experience; neither were blue
skies. Stirred by the wind, the sand was a constant curtain between
the heaven and the earth. The sky of my childhood was always tinged
red with dust. I had no idea that clouds cast shadows.
</P>
<P>
   I had little experience with clouds, but even at 5 or 6 I was a
veteran of the wind. It never stopped. It pushed giant tumbleweeds
into town to be caught in hedges and fences. It blew a hot breath
on the dry land stirring dust devils that twirled across the
withered pastures where ranchers burned the thorns off prickly pear
cactus to use as cattle feed.
</P>
<P>
   The dust storms were so fierce, the sun was sometimes only a
faint orange glow behind the heavy veil of sand. Sometimes it would
be snuffed out entirely, dropping the entire town into an eerie and
unbelievable darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Nashworthy, the city's water reservoir, became little more
than a muddy puddle in places, bone dry in others. The lake bed
split open in wide, dry cracks. I remember sitting down in one of
these fractures, the dust caking my knobby knees. My legs stretched
out straight in front of me. I can still see my brown sandals. My
whole world was brown.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   On that summer afternoon when I lay with my mother on the bed, I
remember the loud splat of fat raindrops against the dusty walk.
Mother became suddenly alert. She went to the window. I was
frightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. ``It's rain. It's rain,'' she'd said. Together we
went out on the front porch. The rain was coming faster then, not
washing the sidewalk clean, but promising to.
</P>
<P>
   It came harder, blowing sideways across the withered grass,
turning the dirty sidewalk into a shimmering ribbon. The thunder
rumbled above our heads and the wind whipped the rain onto the
porch across my bare legs. As it slowed, Mother walked out into the
shower, the fat drops spotting her blue dress.
</P>
<P>
   I walked with her and when we reached the curb, it was almost
over. A narrow stream of muddy water filled the gutter. We sat on
the curb and let the rivulet run over our toes.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the rain had for a brief moment washed away some
dark presence. Mother went into the house and baked a chocolate
cake. For years after that, Mother always baked a chocolate cake
when it rained.
</P>
<P>
   That rain was not enough to break the drought. Many dry years
followed. It certainly was not the end of my mother's depression,
but it was in some small way a start. By the time the drought
ended, she would have a new baby to hold, a little girl born in the
summer of 1953.
</P>
<P>
   My older sister and brother would move away and start their own
lives. I would begin school and learn right from the start that
storytelling was indeed a very good thing. When my first-grade
teacher ran out of things for the squirming class to do, she'd let
me stand near her desk and spin a yarn.
</P>
<P>
   I'm embarrassed and amused to remember that I sometimes
illustrated these on the chalkboard. I'm pleased to recall that my
classmates listened.
</P>
<P>
   Storytelling is like having a magic carpet, I remember thinking.
It carries you away to the land of make-believe where it might rain
every morning, if you choose, and there's always enough love to go
around.
</P>
<P>
   The drought broke in 1956 or 1957. The lakes and the stockmen's
tanks filled again _ and then came the floods. Gushing torrents of
muddy water swelled the rivers and careened through the country,
destroying property in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   The townspeople drove out to see the ruined places and marvel at
the flood's power. My family looked, too, but I was never afraid of
this abundance of water. I was never troubled by the thunder or the
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   I feared the dry times. I still do.

<P>
   Suppose you want a renowned author to write your life story, but
you don't happen to be famous _ or dead.
</P>
<P>
   Don't despair. Now a new Internet service allows ordinary
citizens with somewhat deeper than ordinary pockets to commission
custom portraits from eminent biographers like Judith Thurman,
Francine du Plessix Gray and Diane Wood Middle-brook.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, called the BioRegistry (www.bioregistry.com), was
created by Phyllis Rose, a biographer whose most recent book is
``The Year of Reading Proust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has surfaced periodically in the history of biography an
interest in what Virginia Woolf called `the lives of the
obscure,''' Rose explained. ``Anybody who thinks seriously about
biography wants to write about `ordinary' people, but there's no
market for it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, armed with her Rolodex, Rose, the author of lives of Woolf
and Josephine Baker, set out to create one. She conceived of the
site last spring after her mother died and a friend helped her
build a memorial Web page. Rose, who said she had found the
experience ``incredibly satisfying,'' realized she could offer a
similar service to others. The Bio-Registry, which offers memorial
portraits as well as profiles of the living, made its debut last
November.
</P>
<P>
   The price of a 2,000-word biography starts at $4,000. (Fees are
lower for what the site calls ``well-trained but unpublished''
writers.) The finished pieces can be posted on the Bio-Registry
site or on the client's own Web site, or they can be privately
printed.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, Rose said, there have been no takers, so the future
success of the site is unclear. But the Bio-Registry's real
significance may be to expand traditional notions of biography, its
authors and their subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed historically, the site is a natural outgrowth of the
time-honored tradition of biography for hire. ``In essence, it's a
continuation of what was going on all through the 19th century,
where you would have almost vanity-published books of notable
citizens,'' said Justin Kaplan, who received a Pulitzer Prize in
1967 for ``Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain.'' ( Kaplan is not in the
Bio-Registry's stable, though he confessed to fantasies of riding
horses out West for months on end while faithfully taking down the
life of his tycoon host.)
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, for instance, Col. William d'Alton Mann,
self-styled New York dandy and noted scoundrel, published ``Fads
and Fancies of Representative Americans at the Beginning of the
20th Century, Being a Portrayal of Their Tastes, Diversions and
Achievements.'' Expensively bound in gold-stamped leather, the book
comprised glowing biographical sketches of scores of prominent
people, including President Theodore Roosevelt. The cost of
inclusion ranged from $1,500 to $9,000, princely sums at the time.
(There was a reason Mann could command such prices: those who
didn't shell out for a biography would see their peccadilloes
reported in unsparing detail in Town Topics, a weekly scandal sheet
he also published.)
</P>
<P>
   But where the BioRegistry breaks with tradition _ besides
eschewing blackmail _ is in its ecumenicalism. Much as the advent
of photography democratized artistic portraiture (oil paintings for
Astors, Kodak moments for you and me), the new electronic
technology, Rose hopes, will broaden the definition of who is
considered a fit subject for a written portrait.
</P>
<P>
   It also broadens opportunities for the biographer. ``Biography
is absolutely the worst-paid endeavor in the world per hour of
work,'' said Thurman, who received a National Book Award in 1983
for a life of Isak Dinesen and whose biography of Colette,
``Secrets of the Flesh,'' was a National Book Award finalist last
year. ``This is an idea also for letting very skilled biographers
use their talents in a way that would not be arduous and make some
money, to be honest.''
</P>
<P>
   For each prospective project that interests them, Rose
explained, BioRegistry authors will submit fee requirements _ say,
$2 or $5 a word. The client will be charged twice that amount, with
half going to the writer and half to the BioRegistry.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, the author of ``At Home With the Marquis de Sade,'' said
she had signed on because she saw the Internet as a refreshing
alternative to the impersonal, conglomeratized world of book
publishing. ``Many of us are just fed up by all the traditional
channels,'' she explained. ``It seems to me that working in a small
community like this, there might be a new release, a new way out.''
</P>
<P>
   For Middlebrook, the author of lives of the poet Anne Sexton and
the cross-dressing jazz musician Billy Tipton, the site is an
acknowledgment of the singular demands of her craft. ``I was quite
fascinated that she had hit upon this idea for expressing the
occupation of the biographer as an occupation,'' she said of Rose.
``It's not that I see it as a source of work so much as a source of
professional identity.''
</P>
<P>
   On its face, however, writing a BioRegistry portrait might seem
closer to the work of a press agent than to biography. Since
background materials are furnished by the client (warts included at
the client's discretion), the writers are freed from the burden of
doing original research _ and of providing journalistic balance.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's authors say they're not troubled. ``I do lots of
journalism, some of it serious and some of it not,'' Thurman said.
``I feel no shame or problem with navigating back and forth into
deep and shallow waters.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether Thurman's next project will be the life story of a
21-year-old dot-com millionaire remains to be seen. ``This appeals
to me abstractly,'' she said. ``I'm not sure, when it comes down to
the crunch, that if I'm writing something else I'll be willing to
tear myself away and go do a private commission.''

 &HT;    An all around good guy
 &HT;    By Khalid Moss

<TEXT>
<P>
   KETTERING, Ohio _ When he played professional football, Anthony
Munoz had the reputation of standing tall on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the sport, the Bengals' Hall-of-Famer often seizes
the opportunity to stand tall in the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, that's where you'll find him.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz will be guest speaker at the ninth annual ``God and
Country Celebration'' sponsored by Far Hills Baptist Church. The
religious/patriotic series has welcomed many prominent speakers to
the dais throughout its run but Munoz is, no doubt, the only one
who has thrown a pancake block on Reggie White.
</P>
<P>
   At two services beginning at 9 a.m. and 11 a.m., the hulking
gridiron legend will share his thoughts about life between the hash
marks and how it relates to family and faith. After the programs, a
luncheon is planned for local coaches and athletes at which Munoz
will host a question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his ferocious on-field persona, Munoz has always been
considered one of the good guys of the sports world. After a
standout college career, he graduated from the University of
Southern California and was drafted in the first round by the
Cincinnati Bengals in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In the pros, Munoz's solid technique and attention to detail
made him the blueprint for athletes at his position. He played in
two Super Bowls, was selected to the Pro Bowl 11 straight times and
made a member of the 1980s All-Decade Team. Munoz was named AFC
Offensive Lineman of the Year six times and in 1991 was voted NFL
Man of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his accomplishments on the football field, Munoz has been
a role model for scores of youngsters. As the father of two
college-bound athletes, he is a dedicated family man and a
concerned citizen who has received a slew community awards.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when he's not working as a football analyst on TV
and radio, Munoz lectures for Athletes in Action, co-chairs a
cystic fibrosis golf tournament and is on the advisory board of
Citizens for Community Values. He takes part in numerous football
camps but still finds time to address military personnel around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Lyle, program director at Far Hills Church, explained
that the ``God and Country Celebration'' is not only a program of
praise but also one of patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance for us to honor our God-given rights of freedom
and freedom of religious expression,'' she said. ``Secondarily, its
also an opportunity to get people into our church to see what we're
all about.''

ITALY DEBATES ISSUE OF LENIENCY FOR PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ John Paul II issued a worldwide call on Friday for
leniency for prisoners during the Holy Year, adding his moral
authority to a roiling political debate in Italy about justice and
overcrowded prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, which has about 53,000 people in a prison system built
for less than 43,000, currently has its largest prison population
since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since members of the ruling center-left coalition began
gingerly discussing the possibility of freeing thousands of
prisoners through a general pardon or amnesty, prisons across Italy
have erupted in disturbances and protests, with prisoners _ and
sometimes their guards _ holding strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who in his message told governments that ``a
reduction, even a modest one, of the term of punishment would be
for prisoners a clear sign of sensitivity to their condition,''
plans to visit inmates at a prison in Rome next week, part of a
Holy Year day devoted to inmates. The Vatican has helped raise the
expectations of Italian inmates, and put pressure on politicians to
grant clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the president of Italy pardoned Mehmet Ali
Agca, the Turkish gunman who tried to kill the pope in 1981. The
pardon was made mainly at the urging of the pope, who had
campaigned for Agca's release while making forgiveness a theme of
the Holy Year.
</P>
<P>
   In the current debate over prisoners, the center-right
opposition, led by media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, leader of Forza
Italia, has so far rejected suggestions that parliament approve a
general pardon to ease prison conditions. The opposition has argued
that the entire penitentiary system needs an overhaul, but that
dangerous criminals, AIDS patients and drug addicts could be set
loose in a general pardon. Italians generally have little faith in
their judicial system, but they are also increasingly concerned
about crime. Polls suggest that most Italians oppose an amnesty or
pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are 20 different proposals on a pardon or
amnesty in parliament, but the government of Giuliano Amato has not
yet issued its own draft bill. Instead, various proposals have been
floated as trial balloons by various politicians, filling frontpage
headlines in Italian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, where elections are expected to take place within a
year, the battle has many layers beneath the pros and cons raised
in public debate. On Thursday, Berlusconi had a private meeting
with Justice Minister Piero Fassino to discuss the issue.
Afterward, the opposition leader rejected the notion of a general
pardon, which in Italy could release prisoners who have less than
two years of their sentence to serve.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not rule out an amnesty, which, in Italy, would
release prisoners under similar conditions; but it would also
expunge their criminal records, and clear the books on ongoing
trials. ``Let us wait until they make more serious proposals and we
will give them the required attention,'' Berlusconi told reporters
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts argue that an amnesty would help unclog
Italy's backlog of court cases, and be more effective than a
general pardon. But Berlusconi, who has been acquitted on appeal of
several convictions of accounting fraud and bribery, but still
faces trials on other false accounting charges, could benefit
personally _ and politically _ from an amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   And that has led center-left politicians to make sarcastic
remarks about Berlusconi's personal motives and pious remarks about
the opposition's failure to heed the pleas of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime minister Giuliano Amato's center-left coalition is
deeply divided and in disarray. Many political analysts, and even
members of his coalition, suspect that the Amato government could
end up reaching an agreement with the opposition to grant an
amnesty, hoping to avert a confidence vote that could force early
elections, which the center-left fears it would lose in its present
frazzled state.

AMERICAN CITRUS FRUITS MAKE THEIR DEBUT IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ At the Sidaokou wholesale market they have been
snapped up, these strange golden orbs bedecked with American-flag
stickers and the name Ocean Spray.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have driven two hours to buy them. But most just
regard these fruits with curiosity _ are they oversized oranges? _
and read the poster that explains: ``Grapefruits from Florida ...
Famous Brand Name ... Healthy and Tasty ... Good for Your Blood and
for Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my first imported product and sales are very very good,''
said Rong Zhifang, a saleswoman, hovering behind her cartons.
</P>
<P>
   When China joins the World Trade Organization, probably later
this year, it will be forced to allow a huge range of foreign goods
greater access to its vast markets. But a few American agricultural
items _ including citrus fruit and pork _ have already gained
dramatically improved entry in the last few months, under a recent
U.S.-China agricultural agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And in Beijing the fate of the invading oranges and grapefruits
is seen as a glimpse of China's future, presaging the sudden new
opportunities and problems that free trade will bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arrival of American agricultural products is just a
start,'' said the Beijing Morning News in one of many articles that
have appeared recently about the American fruit. ``Once China joins
the WTO, the story about the boy crying wolf will soon become a
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Western companies are drooling at the prospect of
China's potentially huge market, aggressively promoting their
products.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual Food China 2000 Exhibition last week in Beijing,
U.S. producers of chicken, ice cream and fruit juice _ to name a
few _ turned out in stands decorated with red, white and blue
bunting to give buyers from Chinese restaurants, supermarkets and
hotels a taste of the future. There was even a booth promoting
American pork, to a country where a surplus of pigs has driven down
pork prices to near-record lows this year.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the citrus booth _ with its free fruit slices and
drinks _ that commanded the longest lines. ``This will certainly
open up new business opportunities for me,'' said Ding Yong, a food
distributor for cafeterias. ``The juices are great.''
</P>
<P>
   Price, of course, is something of an issue. Imported oranges are
about three times the price of Chinese products. Grapefruits here
cost about $1.50 each, compared with about 10 cents for somewhat
similar Chinese fruits called youzi (pronounced yo-zuh) and huyou
(pronounced hoo-yo).
</P>
<P>
   These price differentials will narrow somewhat when China enters
the WTO, since the fruits now carry an average import tariff of 40
percent. But even as tariffs are cut, imported fruit is likely to
remain quite a bit more expensive than domestic varieties.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And other hurdles are likely to remain for a long time, as
China's slow-moving bureaucracy adjusts to the realities of more
imports. The Florida grapefruits that arrived in China on April 20,
for example, were stuck in quarantine for the next four weeks,
their release blocked by a series of logistical problems.
</P>
<P>
   First, the inspection documents provided by the Florida
producers were considered invalid by Chinese customs authorities.
Then the quarantine inspectors sealed the warehouse after noticing
that some cases contained dead insects. The inspectors ultimately
cleared the fruits, but not before Chinese distributors had paid
them thousands of dollars in storage fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have met with so many troubles from these fruits, and I
still have many grapefruits in the ports waiting to be inspected,''
said Zhang Zhimin, the sales manager for China Cereal Import and
Export Co., which is handling the citrus imports. ``Although sales
are good now and I am quite optimistic, there are still many
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The citrus fruits are coming in under the U.S.-China
Agricultural Cooperation Agreement signed late last year. Under the
accord, China said it would drop barriers that had previously
prevented the import of some American agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   China agreed to recognize the U.S. pork inspection system, for
example, which it had called inadequate. It also dropped what had
previously been a near-blanket ban on citrus imports, put in place
to protect against infestation by the Mediterranean fruit fly, or
medfly.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new agreement, the United States promised not to send
fruits to China from local counties experiencing medfly
infestations.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 20, more than six huge shipments of fruit have
arrived here, including 16 tons of Sunkist oranges in the
northeastern part of Dalian and 60 tons of grapefruits in the
coastal city of Tianjin. By the end of May, they could be found in
upscale markets in Beijing, where the press has provided detailed
analyses of their flavor, appearance, breeding and value.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, the 1,800 cartons of oranges that arrived on May 11
sold out within two hours. In Dalian, they lasted just three days.
Tens of thousands of grapefruits have sold in Beijing since they
arrived on May 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the high prices affect sales in China?'' asked the
Beijing Morning News. ``It seems not. The Chinese people have shown
unexpected enthusiasm for these fine-quality oranges.'' Chinese
experts urged their compatriots to carefully observe the invasion
and learn from American farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the initial burst of enthusiasm for the fruit may not
be surprising in a country where consumers worship all things
American. U.S. fruit growers and distributors are determined to
maintain the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Calling grapefruit the ``No. 1 Fruit in the U.S.,'' material
from Beijing Shiyi Futai Trade Co. says its grapefruits help
``protect your heart, blood vessels and kidneys.'' The fruit ``has
the natural anti-cancer element of folic acid, and natural fruit
colloid, which can lower cholesterol.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of flashy television ads, featuring a popular music TV
host named Ke Lan, is planned to promote American oranges.
</P>
<P>
   There is still much work to be done. At the China Food 2000
Exhibition, Sunny Chen, an executive chef from a hotel in Xian,
declared that consumers there were ``not ready'' for the flavor of
grapefruit, as he threw a rind into the trash can _ even though he
personally liked the fruit and predicted success with the more
worldly palates of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But at the huge Xidan Market in the capital, six flag-festooned
grapefruits sat forlornly on the shelves on one recent day _ more
museum pieces than comestibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look! Fruit from America,'' said Gui Shufeng, a retiree who
was strolling in the market with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them _ a little tart and a little sweet,'' said Gui,
who had tasted grapefruit while visiting his daughter in New York.
``But I'm not sure if Chinese will buy them. They're expensive.''

CLINTON SIGNS BILL GIVING LEGAL WEIGHT TO E-SIGNATURES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Not far from where the Founding Fathers used
quill pens to sign the Declaration of Independence, President
Clinton inserted a signature card into a computer Friday to affirm
his support to legislation giving legal weight to electronic
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Congress endorsed the e-signature legislation this year after
months of back-and-forth with the White House. The law, intended to
foster business transactions over the Internet, allows electronic
contracts to be sealed online. Clinton did sign the bill into law
officially the traditional way, with a felt-tip pen. But to show
what the legislation may mean in the future, Clinton also slipped a
signature card through a scanner, typed in a not-so-secret password
_ ``Buddy,'' for his Labrador retriever _ and marveled as a replica
of his signature appeared on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to think that Americans will soon be using cards
like this one for everything from hiring a lawyer to closing a
mortgage,'' Clinton said. ``Just imagine, if this had existed 224
years ago, the Founding Fathers wouldn't have had to come all the
way to Philadelphia on July 4th for the Declaration of
Independence. They could have e-mailed their John Hancocks in.''
</P>
<P>
   By giving electronic signatures legal standing, the new law will
enable consumers to sign contracts for bank loans, new cars and
other business deals from home. Many transactions are already
conducted over the Internet, including the filing of tax returns
with the Internal Revenue Service, but paper signatures are
necessary for final approval. That requirement will disappear once
the law takes effect Oct. 1. The law does not specify the type of
technology to be used, but other options include hardware like
thumbprint-scanning devices or third-party services that use
encrypted keys _ essentially personalized scrambled code _ that can
be attached to e-mail or electronic documents.
</P>
<P>
   As for presidential signatures, the legislation does not apply.
White House lawyers are still researching the question, but Clinton
said the Constitution may require presidents to actually put pen to
paper to approve legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The law's backers maintain that businesses will save billions of
dollars a year by using phones lines instead of paper to conduct
routine transactions. Computer records will also do away with the
need to store tons of paper files.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, vast warehouses of paper will be replaced by
servers about the size of VCRs,'' the president said. ``Customers
will soon enjoy a whole new universe of online services. With the
swipe of a smart card and the click of a mouse, they will be able
to finalize mortgages, sign insurance contracts, or open brokerage
accounts.''

ENCYCLOPEDIA RAISES VEIL ON ANCIENT SAUDI CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a culture of silence, words can be weapons. In perhaps no
contemporary state has the written word proved more threatening
than in Saudi Arabia, where sins, sources of shame and sometimes
even accomplishments tend to be hidden away.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with a determined lack of fanfare nearly a decade ago
that Prince Khaled bin Sultan, the Saudi media baron and former
co-commander of the military coalition against Iraq in the Persian
Gulf war, opened a front in the cultural war against silence in his
country, even as he prepared to lead the multinational forces into
battle to free Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1990, the prince quietly agreed to finance an
ambitious project by a group of Saudi scholars to document the
country's rich cultural heritage and traditions before they
disappeared. Ten years and several million dollars later, the
Encyclopedia of Folklore of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a
12-volume, Arabic-language compendium of a vanishing way of life,
has just been printed in Belgium. Its authors say that the series,
which includes 5,000 drawings, illustrations and graphs, is the
largest body of secular scholarship ever produced in Saudi Arabia.
It includes separate volumes on topics like historical and
archaeological sites, traditional medicine, geography, even
children's games. And there is an entire volume devoted to the
camel.
</P>
<P>
   While the prince said he had contemplated such a project for two
years before the gulf war, the conflict was the project's main
catalyst. ``The widespread ignorance of Saudi Arabia and its
cultural heritage, not just among foreigners but among younger
Saudis made me determined to try and document and preserve our
traditions before it was too late,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to oil wealth, life styles have changed faster and more
dramatically in Saudi Arabia than in almost any other country.
Fifty-year-old Saudis can recall baked-mud hovels, with neither
electricity nor running water, in which most of them were raised,
but young Saudis today can barely imagine life without the
Internet, cellular telephones, vacations abroad, air-conditioned
suburban homes, sport utility vehicles and fancy shopping malls.
Few have ever even ridden a camel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Saudi contributors to the volumes say that a work of this
nature could probably not have been undertaken as long as tribal
and regional divisions continued to plague the kingdom.Oil wealth
has helped unify Saudis politically and culturally, said Sa'ad
al-Sowayan, an anthropologist with a doctorate from the University
of California at Berkeley and the encyclopedia's chief editor.
Until Saudis spoke the same Arabic dialect and tribal and regional
cultural differences diminished, a project examining the country's
heritage would have been too contentious to be approved by the
censors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he observed, until recently many Saudi scholars
viewed folk culture as academically dubious. They believed that
attention to traditional ways of life emphasized backwardness. But
after the gulf war, Sowayan said, ``people realized that our old
civilization was dying out, and that we had a limited window to
capture what was being lost, mostly through memory. It gave us a
renewed sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 75 leading Saudi scholars and writers contributed to the
encyclopedia. Their texts were then vetted by older, often
uneducated Saudis who still remembered many of the nearly extinct
customs.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the 547-page volume on the camel. The volume notes that
it was the domestication of this amazingly adaptive, aggressive,
often crotchety creature that made Bedouin nomadic life possible.
Saudis rarely tired of extolling the camel's endurance,
forbearance, fortitude and other virtues in chants, conversation,
lore and song. Bedouin poetry likens the swishing of the camel's
tail to the swaying of the unbraided plaits of a beautiful young
woman dancing on her wedding night. Without the camel, Sowayan
said, nearly a third of the Arabic language would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that the Arabs stole camels from the Jews. Because
in Saudi lore the Jews are said to be still longing for their
animals, the Bedouins describe any false hope by likening it to the
hope of the Jews for the camels' return.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the volume asserts, the camel was superseded as the
major symbol of Arabia by the palm tree, the emblem of the
sedentary farmers, merchants and traders who were the Muslim
prophet Muhammad's first and most enduring followers. This
community, which loathed and feared the warring Bedouins, imposed
its written, settled culture on nomadic culture, said Abdulaziz
Fahad, a lawyer and an early champion of the project. As a result,
Saudi society remains deeply ambivalent about the desert and the
traditional Bedouin life.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that traditional culture has vanished beyond memory and
retrieval. The encyclopedia, for instance, includes no volumes on
folk songs or traditional dancing because Sowayan could not find
qualified authorities to write them. Nor is there a volume on Islam
or any of Arabia's pre-Islamic religions.Religion is not folk
culture, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the volumes may stir controversy among some of the
kingdom's more rigid, literal-minded clerics. As one contributor
said, conservatives won't like the discussions of ``un-Islamic''
traditions and beliefs, or the books' many representational
photographs and drawings, which they say are prohibited by Islam.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the encyclopedia has had no problem winning official
blessing. Because the Saudi government decided some two decades ago
that any genuine encyclopedia would not be censored, the Ministry
of Information, which routinely blacks out with felt-tipped pens
magazine photographs considered too licentious, approved the
encyclopedia with its pictures and drawings in less than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This work will not only help us preserve our vanishing past,
but by examining the past, will emphasize our new cultural and
political unity,'' Sowayan said.``In that sense, it is a truly
nationalist project.''

 &HT;    ANTI-REFORM STORM BREWS IN SCHOOLS, TEACHER UNION HEAD SAYS
 &HT;    400&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A rebellion is brewing among worried teachers and
parents that is threatening public school reforms, Bob Chase,
president of the National Education Association, warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our teacher members have big concerns, big fears and big
questions about the way standards and testing are being used, and,
unfortunately, all too often abused,'' Chase told educators at a
conference held to prepare for the annual convention of the
nation's largest teachers union, which opens Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a number of states, parents have become radicalized,'' he
said. ``They're saying, 'Too many kids are failing, so let's
abandon standards and accountability.' That's the exact wrong
reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase is a former Connecticut teacher who comes from the
dominant pro-reform wing of the 2.5-million-member NEA. He stressed
that he considers himself to be ``a consistent, strong and even
passionate advocate for standards-based reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   That approach grew out of three summits in which state governors
and business leaders met with reform advocates. It urges states to
adopt educational standards, districts to redesign courses to
prepare students to meet those standards, and states to then test
the students to see if they meet the standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I regret to report that in all too many states,
standards-based reform is being very poorly implemented ... in a
haphazard manner with poor alignment of curriculum, standards and
testing,'' Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, whose organization includes more than half of the
nation's public school teachers, said reformers in many states have
``botched'' several changes. He emphasized these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Students ``are being tested on subjects they are not being
taught.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tests ``are being designed that have little to do with the
standards that have been created by, in all too many instances, God
knows who.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Standards are being imposed without ``adequate preparation''
of teachers, additional money for new course materials and
equipment, or extra help for the students with the biggest learning
problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Test scores are being used ``to stigmatize and punish
high-poverty schools, `` instead of being used ``as diagnostic
tools to guide positive intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been truly egregious problems in Virginia,
California, Texas, Massachusetts and many other states,'' Chase
said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Chase cited examples of ``mind-boggling'' mistakes in Ohio, even
as he praised Gov. Bob Taft's ``common-sense decision'' to form a
state commission to figure out how to reform the state's reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said, ``In a nutshell, what the state had done was take
existing Ohio proficiency tests _ tests which were originally
designed for use as diagnostic instruments to identify areas where
students need help _ and by fiat declare that these tests would be
used as high-stakes tests (to evaluate a school's performance) and,
worst of all, eventually as exit tests'' that students must pass in
order to earn a high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   The tests weren't aligned to state standards, because Ohio has
no state standards. That meant that a student could be denied a
high school diploma because the courses in that student's high
school didn't cover the same topics as the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said, ``Our challenge is to rescue standards-based reform,
and do whatever we can do to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a few states ``did it right'' as they
introduced reforms, said Stanford University professor Linda
Darling-Hammond, who is executive director of the National Council
on Teaching and America's Future.
</P>
<P>
   She said the reforms are working best in Connecticut, Kentucky,
Maine and Virginia, which was one of the states that Chase said has
made big mistakes.

&HT;     UPCOMING TEST IS `SHOW TIME' FOR MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, July 2)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Minuteman II missile will blast off from the
central California coast this Friday and head west over the Pacific
in a $100 million test of a new weapon that could have huge
ramifications for U.S. defense strategy and international
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the July 7 launch will determine the future of
National Missile Defense, a scaled-back successor to President
Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) _ also known as
``Star Wars'' _ which envisioned a space-based laser shield against
waves of attacking Soviet missiles.
</P>
<P>
   If the test succeeds, the Pentagon is expected to recommend to
President Clinton that he approve the construction of an initial
force of 20 rocket interceptors designed to shoot down about two
dozen incoming enemy missiles from so-called ``rogue states,'' such
as North Korea or Iran, by ramming them in outer space. Clinton has
set up a timetable that would require him to make a decision by
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with SDI, the NMD is far less ambitious but has proven
to be technically challenging.
</P>
<P>
   In the Friday test, the Minuteman blasting from Vandenberg Air
Force Base is the target for another missile, a so-called Ground
Based Interceptor, being launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the
Marshall Islands about 5,000 miles away. The interceptor is a
two-stage rocket that carries as much as 42,500 pounds of solid
propellant.
</P>
<P>
   If the test works, the interceptor will crash into the
Minuteman's dummy warhead 144 miles above the Pacific, about 30
minutes after the attacking missile leaves California and about 10
minutes after the interceptor is launched from Kawajalein.
</P>
<P>
   The test will be monitored from U.S. military facilities in
Colorado Springs, Colo., and radar stations in Hawaii. An optical
radar telescope at Kwajalein will allow officials to witness the
planned collision.
</P>
<P>
   NMD _ a network of computers, satellites, sensors and radars all
cued to help guide an interceptor rocket to the Minuteman target
far about the Earth's atmosphere _ faces intense opposition on both
technical and political grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the scientific community such as MIT scientist
Theodore Postol claim the weapon won't work because it can't
distinguish between a real warhead and multiple decoy warheads.
</P>
<P>
   NMD also has drawn fire from some leaders in the foreign policy
arena, including former Defense Secretary Harold Brown and former
CIA chief John Deutch. They argue that a decision to go ahead could
severely damage U.S. relations with China and Russia by chipping
away at the 1972 ABM Treaty, which prohibits the United States and
Russia from developing a weapon to shoot down intercontinental
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States were to move forward with NMD, it would be
required to either renegotiate the treaty with Moscow or abrogate
it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 45 China experts wrote Clinton urging him to delay
his decision on building NMD. They said that a ``precipitous
decision'' to go ahead with the project would cause China to
accelerate the modernization of its small nuclear arsenal of about
20 missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Several other critics, including former Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman John Shalikashvili, former Defense Secretary William Perry
and ex-CIA director R. James Woolsey are urging Clinton not rush a
decision that could have serious ripple effects throughout the
world. Instead, they say Clinton should defer a decision to the
next administration.
</P>
<P>
   If the test is a success _ if the Minuteman is shot from the sky
by the interceptor, the Pentagon is likely to recommend to Clinton
that he proceed with the project.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials had imposed a requirement of two successful
test intercepts in order to be assured that the technical hurdles
associated with knocking a speeding intercontinental ballistic
missile out of the sky with another missile can be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   In one test, last October, the system scored a bullseye but then
missed in a January test. Thus, the urgency associated with the
July 7 launch.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of how important the weapon is to the Pentagon
and its congressional supporters: Military officials recently
announced that even if the test isn't a 100 percent success, they
might still urge that Clinton give the go-ahead for the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the upcoming test won't be anything like real life.
The Minuteman is carrying a dummy warhead, nothing nuclear; the
``enemy'' missile is traveling east-to-west, not a likely
trajectory given that the Pentagon says the system is being
designed mainly to thwart west-to-east traveling missiles launched
by North Korea; and there is no element of surprise because all
U.S. personnel associated with the test know when the Minuteman is
to be launched _ and they know where it is coming from and where it
is going.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the program's backers say the test can demonstrate that
the concept works and that last October's successful test was not a
freak accident.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as the Pentagon hopes on July 7, the Minuteman II
missile will rapidly ascend from Vandenberg, arcing towards the
South Pacific. In addition to carrying a mock warhead, the missile
will carry a single balloon decoy to try and trick the NMD system
into attacking the wrong target.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, a satellite overhead will detect the exhaust
plume created by the missile's engine and then send the detection
information to an Air Force command center in Colorado Springs,
Colo., which in turn will plot a preliminary trajectory and in
seconds dispatch the information over satellites to another command
center at Kwajalein.
</P>
<P>
   Military officers in the Colorado center will then authorize the
launch of the interceptor rocket, which is carrying a ``kill
vehicle,'' essentially a 130-pound battering ram with state-of the
art navigational gear. The same officers will alert a powerful
radar at Kwajalein to scour the skies for the incoming target. In a
matter of minutes, the radar will lock onto the target and tell the
speeding interceptor in which general direction to travel.
</P>
<P>
   As the kill vehicle ascends and separates from the rocket, it
will turn on its navigational system, examine the stars with a
telescope sensor to become properly oriented and point its antenna
earthward. A network of radars below will send it two bursts of
electronic data to help guide it to the missile warhead.
</P>
<P>
   At that point in the test, for about the last 100 seconds, the
kill vehicle will be on its own, relying solely on onboard
electronic sensors to search the cold reaches of space for the
five-foot long warhead.
</P>
<P>
   According to Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, the chief of the
NMD project, this part of the test is fraught with challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The kill vehicle relies on its super-cooled sensors to detect
heat from the incoming warhead and on an optical sensor to help
distinguish the warhead from the decoy. The surface of the warhead
is relatively warm because of the friction created by traveling up
through the atmosphere at 15,000 miles per hour. This heat serves
as a beacon for the battering ram and allows NMD to avoid homing in
on the balloon decoy.
</P>
<P>
   A leak of coolant that was supposed to cool a pair of infrared
sensors likely blinded the kill vehicle in the January test in the
final seconds of flight, according to Kadish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we will have the balloon pass by and other debris,
and it will lock on to the warhead and collide at a closing
velocity of 4.6 miles per second (16,560 miles per hour). And at
that speed there won't be anything left of that target reentry
vehicle, if everything goes right,'' Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   According to current Pentagon plans, if Clinton gives the green
light, the $36 billion-plus program will be constructed in several
phases. At first, the anti-missile system will use 20 interceptors
based in Alaska. But by 2007, the Pentagon plans to add another 80
interceptor missiles. The cost could grow substantially if the
military adds additional interceptors and another launch site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to protecting U.S. cities against a ballistic
missile attack from so-called ``rogue'' countries, the system is
being designed to provide protection against an accidental nuclear
missile launch in Russia, sparked by decaying Soviet-era equipment
or a weapon that falls into the hands of a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-based Boeing Co. is the prime contractor for the missile
defense program. The initial development phase is being run by
Boeing's space and communications group in Southern California.

<P>
   Norman Podhoretz is the editor at large of Commentary magazine,
a senior fellow of the Hudson Institute and the author of the
forthcoming ``My Love Affair With America,'' to be published on
Tuesday. Victor Navasky is the publisher and editorial director of
The Nation, the Delacorte professor of magazine journalism at
Columbia University and the author of ``Naming Names,'' a study of
the Hollywood blacklist. Together, they have spent more than
three-quarters of a century in journalism, and for many years they
have disagreed, often vehemently, about the issues that have shaped
American life. For this Fourth of July weekend, The New York Times
asked them to discuss patriotism. The moderator of the discussion
was Barry Gewen, the editor of the Arts &AMP; Ideas pages and an editor
in the Book Review section of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Norman, you begin your new book, ``My Love Affair With
America,'' with the quotation from Samuel Johnson: ``Patriotism is
the last refuge of a scoundrel.'' This is probably the single most
famous quote about patriotism, and it prompts the question: Has
patriotism gone out of style?
</P>
<P>
   PODHORETZ. Well, I think Johnson was wrong and this was a most
uncharacteristic remark for him, a fervent Tory, to have made,
since conservatives, generally in Europe anyway, had been
associated with patriotic sentiment and the nationalist sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Has patriotism gone out of style in America? The answer is
certainly yes, as of very recently. But my own feeling is that it's
slowly coming back. We see signs of this resurgence of patriotic
sentiment in various sectors of the culture. The most salient, I
suppose, would be the enormous success of Tom Brokaw's two books on
the World War II generation. I think the success of a movie like
``Saving Private Ryan'' is another sign, a sign of a new respect
for the kind of virtues that were traditionally associated with
patriotism or love of country.
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY. Well, about Samuel Johnson: Ambrose Bierce had an
amendment to Johnson. I think he said, ``I beg to submit, sir, it
is the first.'' In other words, patriotism is not the last refuge
of scoundrels, it's the first.
</P>
<P>
   I don't agree with that. But I think it depends what your
definition of patriotism is. I would suggest that in the Vietnam
era the people who were protesting the war included a large number
of patriots. My definition of patriotism would involve fighting to
make sure your country lives up to its highest ideals. And from
that perspective even those who burn the flag _ not all of them but
some of them _ may have been as patriotic as those who wrapped
themselves in the flag.
</P>
<P>
   So the word may be coming back in some way, but the struggles to
make America the best it can be have been going on, it seems to me,
since the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   PODHORETZ. I would like to take issue with the definition that
Victor is offering. To define American patriotism as struggling to
make the country live up to its best ideals has in practice
generally meant denigrating the country for not doing so. The ideal
is very often the enemy of the real.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions under which Americans have actually lived in one
generation or another is the country that one either loves or does
not love. One can be critical of the country while loving it, just
as one can be critical of one's wife or husband or lover in
personal life. But I would submit that the people who burned the
flag during the Vietnam War or people who spelled the name of the
country with a K to suggest an association with Nazi Germany or
people who saw no difference between America and the Soviet Union
during the Cold War, morally or politically, were not patriots.
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY. I guess I don't pretend to know the motives of the
folks who chose the burning of the flag as their way of protesting
the Vietnam War, but I do know that going back to the beginning of
our history, and right up through the abolitionist movement and the
movement for labor rights in the 1920s and '30s and the movement
for civil rights in the '60s, those people who fought to achieve
the American dream of equal rights for all were scorned at the time
as, in effect, unpatriotic and later on as communists.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Let me ask Victor a question about patriotism and liberals
and the left. In the period around World War II, there was no
embarrassment on the left about engaging in traditional patriotic
activities _ flag waving, Fourth of July celebrations _ but these
symbols of patriotism seem to have disappeared from the left. Do
those symbols now totally belong to conservatives and the right, or
does the left have some call to them also?
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY. Sure, there was a shared symbology that went across the
ideological board. Irving Kristol has written an essay, which
Norman cites in his book, where he said that there is a holy
trinity associated with American patriotism and it includes the
Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and the flag. I would
say two out of three isn't bad. To me, the authentic symbols of our
country start with the covenants, the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution. The flag is important only for the principles
that it represents.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Next question: Is there a good patriotism and a bad
patriotism?
</P>
<P>
   PODHORETZ. Yes, though my own view is that patriotism has been
so ridiculed and has been so out of fashion that spiritual and
moral balance require an emphasis on patriotism as a good thing. I
mean, most people would say that when patriotism becomes
chauvinistic or jingoistic or even simply nationalistic, it becomes
aggressive and dangerous. But the heritage that we fight for is not
merely one of rectifying wrongs of the past, such as slavery or
discrimination, and trying to create conditions that are more in
consonance with what is promulgated, both in the Declaration and
the Constitution; it's also to fight off assaults on the system of
government that was designed by the Founding Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Victor, is there a good patriotism and a bad patriotism?
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY. Stephen Decatur, who said, ``Our country right or
wrong,'' said first, ``May she always be in the right.'' And that's
a good part of patriotism _ to fight to have your country be in the
right. A destructive part of patriotism is when it slips into a
kind of nationalism which makes you hate other countries, put your
country's interests first when you think it's behaving in an
immoral and unjust way. So that confusing patriotism with
unconditional support for a government policy, it seems to me, does
damage, and core damage, to the meaning of citizenship in our
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   PODHORETZ. But to denigrate the country, to call it foul names,
to desecrate its symbols, should not be given the name of
patriotism. People who want to do that are free to do that in this
country. But I don't think they ought to then wrap themselves in
the flag that they've just burned.
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY. When Frederick Douglass made his famous speech where he
said that freedom requires rain and thunder and lightning, what he
was talking about was that you have to do a lot of nasty and
uncomfortable things to bring the plight of folks who don't have
freedom to the national attention. And that is a part of a
patriotic America-loving act. It's not an America-hating act to try
to bring the African-American community to its entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   PODHORETZ. In the civil rights movement, the early civil rights
movement in the late '50s and early '60s, the most effective means
blacks employed happened to be not nasty, whatever, but nonviolent
resistance. Which was perceived by everybody in this country as
noble and admirable and which made the sheriffs who were attacking
them with water hoses look ignoble and evil. So I don't agree that
nasty things necessarily have to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A great deal of the historical scholarship of the last few
decades has examined and brought to light the negative aspects of
American history _ slavery, the treatment of American Indians, the
detention of Japanese Americans during World War II. How do we fit
these negative aspects of American history into education programs
for our children?
</P>
<P>
   PODHORETZ. Well, I think they have to be faced up to honestly.
Children have to be taught that these things happened. They also
have to be taught that many _ in fact, I think all of the ones you
mentioned _ were acted upon, were corrected. And that they were
corrected through the resources of the American constitutional and
institutional structure.
</P>
<P>
   It's very important to teach children that the history of this
country is on the whole a glorious one, not an inglorious one. That
this is a country to be proud of, including for the way it has
dealt with what I would say are the inevitable blemishes and warts.
I think that we as a socio-political-economic system rank with such
great civilizations of the past as fifth-century Athens and
Elizabethan England. Not, as I say in my book, in the production of
artistic monuments, though we haven't done so badly in that
department either, but in the provision of more liberty and more
prosperity to more people than has existed anywhere else on earth,
whether present or past. And this, too, has to be taught to our
children and should be emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY. I think the way you teach the abolitionists, for
instance, is that you make clear that, in terms of your own values,
the abolitionists were greater patriots than the plantation owners
against whom they were fighting. That the folks who were organizing
the workers, in my judgment, were greater patriots than the mine
and mill owners who were exploiting them. That the real patriots
during the Vietnam War were the folks who resisted it. And the
patriots during the civil rights movement were indeed, as Norman
said, the folks who adopted passive resistance. And it worked to a
degree there.
</P>
<P>
   PODHORETZ. I have nothing against the abolitionists, but I would
say that my hero in the Civil War is not John Brown but Abraham
Lincoln. They were very different, and they were not on the same
side. And it makes a big difference whether you think it's Abraham
Lincoln who should be celebrated or John Brown.
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY. I think they both should be celebrated, as should
Frederick Douglass.
</P>
<P>
   PODHORETZ. Well, I agree with you about him.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What impact, if any, has multiculturalism had on our idea of
patriotism?
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY. I think it requires a revision to this classic notion
of my country right or wrong, first of all, depending on when your
own group became part of the tradition and entitled to the rights
that other folks got.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, I think the real contribution of multiculturalism to
our culture today is the right of people to establish their own
identities and define their own identities.
</P>
<P>
   And thirdly, multiculturalism suggests that we have a series of
competing allegiances. One of them is love of family. A second is
love of tribe or culture or whatever it is. A third is love of
country. And a fourth is one's relationship to the international
community. And it seems to me the most valuable kind of patriotism
is one which honors the other relationships rather than competes
against them.
</P>
<P>
   PODHORETZ. Well, here we go again. I think multiculturalism is a
perversion of the traditional American idea of pluralism. The ideal
was that in the public sphere _ in the public schools _ the rule of
assimilation prevailed. That is, if an immigrant came to this
country, he was expected _ and, indeed, wished _ to learn English
and to absorb the traditions of his new country, to become an
American, to be Americanized. Nothing prevented that individual
from remaining loyal, within the private sphere, to the tribe and
the family. You were free as an individual to live in both worlds
if you chose. But what you were not free to do was to refuse to
assimilate to the culture of this country. Nobody was going to
arrest you or anything of that sort, but you would certainly limit
your opportunities for employment, for advancement and for
participation, including civic participation.
</P>
<P>
   I think that multiculturalism doesn't so much help to give
people the power to define their own identities as it keeps them
apart from the rest of the community. So I think it's a bad thing
and I think it is not _ does not _ contribute to a healthy
patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now each of you, if you want, can take a minute or two to say
something in summary. Norman?
</P>
<P>
   PODHORETZ. Yeah, why not. I'll take a crack at it.
</P>
<P>
   I think intellectual honesty requires us to recognize that we
have emerged from a period during which America-bashing, as some
call it, or denigration of America, has prevailed, particularly
among intellectuals, not so much among most people, but among the
elites. I believe this has begun to change. I hope it has begun to
change.
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY. I guess patriotism is best expressed in the struggle to
make this a better place. And it is not best expressed in saluting
the flag or in parades down Fifth Avenue but in writing, in
marching, in suing, in voting, in going to court, whatever it takes
to fulfill the promise of the Bill of Rights.

ADVERTISING: MADISON AVENUE IN A PREHOLIDAY RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Madison Avenue prepared for a long holiday
weekend, executives were scrambling to complete a spate of deals.
</P>
<P>
   Bates North America in New York, part of the Bates Worldwide
unit of Cordiant Communications Group, was concluding plans to
expand its offerings into technology advertising by acquiring
Donino, White &AMP; Partners in Atlanta, a shop with billings estimated
at over $100 million from clients like BellSouth, the Digital and
Applied Imaging unit of Eastman Kodak and the UUNet Technologies
division of WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   The plans call for Bates North America to operate a new unit,
named DWP Bates Technology, after acquiring the business assets of
Donino, White for a minimum of $30 million in Cordiant stock to be
paid over three years. Frank Donino, chief executive at Donino,
White, is to become chief executive at DWP Bates Technology, which
could later be expanded to other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Torello, a spokeswoman for Bates, said Thursday that
negotiations were continuing and declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   McCann-Erickson World Group in New York, part of Interpublic
Group of Cos., is expanding into personnel-recruitment advertising
by buying Nationwide Advertising Service in Cleveland for
undisclosed terms.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, with offices in 41 cities in North America, produces
print and Internet ads for Fortune 100 companies, governments and
universities seeking to fill job openings. Nationwide, with an
estimated $400 million in capitalized billings, will operate as an
autonomous unit of McCann-Erickson; John Graham will continue as
chief executive and Tom Richey will remain president.
</P>
<P>
   There were two other deals involving Interpublic, the agency
company that owns Draft Worldwide and Lowe Group in addition to
McCann-Erickson. Interpublic is taking an unspecified minority
stake in Software Associates International in Mount Arlington,
N.J., which offers customer-sales-support software and database
products for the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   Software Associates has 170 employees working for clients like
Johnson &AMP; Johnson; Shaleen Gupta, president and chief executive,
continues in that post.
</P>
<P>
   And Draft, based in Chicago, acquired Sloan Group in New York, a
creative marketing agency that specializes in youth, entertainment
and technology advertising. Sloan, which has 50 employees working
for clients like HBO, will operate as an autonomous unit of Draft's
KBA Marketing division.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two other deals are taking place in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom Group in New York is acquiring Court Burkitt, a London
agency formed in 1986. Court Burkitt will be merged with the London
office of Griffin Bacal _ part of the DDB Worldwide division of
Omnicom _ to form Burkitt DDB under the aegis of BMP DDB, the DDB
British agency. Terms of the acquisition, reported by Campaign, the
British advertising trade publication, were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin Bacal brings to Burkitt DDB clients like Burberry and
Hasbro, while Court Burkitt brings clients like the John Lewis
department stores and Peroni beer. Combined billings were estimated
at $80 million. At Burkitt DDB, Hugh Burkitt, chairman of Court
Burkitt, becomes chairman, while Jonathan Hoare, managing director
of Griffin Bacal, becomes managing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an opportunity in London to build an extension of the
DDB brand,'' said Tom Griffin, co-chairman and chief executive at
Griffin Bacal in New York. ``The case in London is different than
the U.S.,'' where Griffin Bacal will continue operating under that
name.
</P>
<P>
   The other British deal concerned Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New
York, which has agreed to be acquired by WPP Group. Y&AMP;R is buying
Partners, a London agency specializing in creative design and brand
identity consulting for clients like Harrods, Unilever and Warner
Bros. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Partners, which has 75 employees and revenue estimated at over
$11 million, will become part of the Diversified Communications
Group of Y&AMP;R. Aziz Cami, managing partner at Partners, continues in
that post.
</P>
<P>
   Another brand image and consulting agency, d/g, in New York and
Paris, agreed to sell a 60 percent stake to Future Source
Communications in New York and Toronto, for undisclosed terms. The
agency, formerly known as Desgrippes/Gobe, has 175 employees and
revenue estimated at $30 million, from clients like Coca-Cola and
Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   The top executives at d/g will continue in their posts: Marc
Gobe, 54, president and chief executive in New York, and Joel
Desgrippes, 55, president and chief executive in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, True North Communications in Chicago acquired Event
Management and Promotions in Santa Monica, Calif., which will
become part of a True North division named Marketing Drive
Worldwide. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Event Management, with more than 40 employees and revenue
estimated at over $10 million, from clients like Kellogg and Sony,
will be renamed EMP/Marketing Drive. Jamie Wark, 39, president at
Event Management, will be president at EMP/Marketing Drive.

SITE OF THE WEEK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HowStuffWorks.com: A site that, believe it or not, actually does
what it says, describing in simple, earnest (and exclamation
point-filled!) language how stuff, of all kinds, works. &QL; 
Where: www.howstuffworks.com &QL; 
What's cool: Right now, it's the special section on how fireworks,
uh, work. Consider it an explosive expose on aerial explosives,
perfectly timed for a hot holiday. &QL; 
Features: The site is loaded with lots of goodies, explaining not
just basic technology such as cell phones, diesel engines and the
Internet, but also more unstuff-like stuff, such as bread and
chocolate, your body, tattoos, weather and passports. There's a
nice selection of suggested reference books, the latest news about
interesting stuff, and other odds and ends. The site's No. 1
question: how ``Star Wars'' light sabers work. That leads to a
discussion of rotoscoping using common video editing software, how
green- or bluescreening works and more. We'd like more
illustrations, but there are some, and it's all well done and
penetrable by laypersons. &QL; 
You'll like this if: You're annoyed because there's nothing to see
when you take stuff apart in the digital age. &QL;

NORTH AND SOUTH AGREE TO PLANS TO REUNITE SEPARATED FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Red Cross officials from North and South Korea signed an
agreement Friday to begin reuniting families separated by more than
50 years of conflict on the Korean peninsula. The accord, an
outgrowth of breakthrough reconciliation talks between the two
countries two weeks ago, also provides for the return of North
Koreans who were imprisoned in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Under Friday's agreement, about 100 South Koreans will travel to
the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to meet with relatives, while
100 North Koreans will meet with family members in Seoul. These
initial reunions are scheduled to take place over four days,
beginning on Aug. 15, according to South Korean media reports from
North Korea, where the agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the deal is expected to reunite thousands of Koreans
who were separated from relatives when the peninsula was divided at
the end of World War II. South Korean officials estimate that there
are nearly 8 million people in the South, about 660,000 of them
over 60 years old, who have relatives living in the North.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean War broke out 50 years ago last month, and although a
1953 armistice suspended the fighting, North and South are
technically still at war, and only a handful of separated families
have been allowed to take part in officially sanctioned reunions in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   For reunions, Red Cross officials agreed to set up a permanent
visitation center where separated families can meet. The officials
said they had not yet decided where to establish the center.
However, they mentioned as possible candidates scenic Mount
Kumgang, on North Korea's east coast, and Panmunjom, the village in
the heavily armed demilitarized zone along the two countries'
border.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached after four days of talks between
representatives from the Red Cross of both Koreas at Mount Kumgang.
</P>
<P>
   ``This South-North agreement is the first concrete result
following the summit meeting, and it means that we have entered the
realization phase in dealing with the separated family issues,''
said Park Ki-ryun, secretary general of the South Korean Red Cross.
``We will try our best to insure that exchanges will occur without
complications.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his expectations for the family reunions were, Choi
Seung Chul, the head of North Korea's Red Cross, said: ``Things
will work out very well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The agreement also calls for the return of all North Koreans who
served prison terms in the South who want to return home. The North
Koreans, most of whom were convicted of spying for the North, would
be allowed to go in early September.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean Defense Ministry has said that 50 of the 88
former prisoners, who are mostly elderly, have indicated that they
want to return to North Korea. There was no mention in the
agreement of South Korean soldiers who may still be behind bars in
the North.
</P>
<P>
   To facilitate meetings between separated family members, North
and South Korean officials will trade lists of 200 separated
relatives and begin checking to see whether the individuals on the
list are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The visitation center will not be set up until the North Korean
prisoners are returned, the reports said. The center is expected to
identify hundreds of separated family members a month and bring
them together.

ORACLE'S SHENANIGANS CAST LIGHT ON PUBLIC CHOICE THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is no secret that the rivalry between the software leaders,
Microsoft and Oracle, is bitter. Still, the acknowledgment last
week by Oracle that it financed a series of escapades intended to
embarrass Microsoft provided some lively summer entertainment _
especially the Keystone Kops caper in which private investigators
offered office cleaners $1,200 for the contents of a pro-Microsoft
trade group's wastebaskets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the cross-fire of invective that ensued, the two foes
found some common ground in what is known as public choice theory,
whose practitioners use economic principles to analyze government
decision-making, especially the influence of special-interest
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in a statement, declared that Oracle's shenanigans
amounted to nothing less than ``dramatic evidence that Microsoft's
competitors have engaged in a massive and ongoing campaign to
unfairly tarnish Microsoft's public image and promote government
intervention to benefit themselves.'' Translation: The government's
antitrust case was a result of successful lobbying by Microsoft's
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Without regret or irony, Lawrence J. Ellison, the Oracle
chairman, called his company's campaign ``a public service'' that
brought hidden information to light. Oracle's private eyes failed
to buy any garbage of the Association for Competitive Technology, a
group that backed Microsoft in the antitrust case, but they did
turn up documents showing that two similar groups, the Independent
Institute and the National Taxpayers Union, were financially
supported by Microsoft. Those documents were passed to reporters
for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington
Post, who wrote articles about Microsoft's backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left undisclosed,'' an Oracle statement said, ``these
Microsoft front groups could have improperly influenced one of the
most important antitrust cases in U.S. history.'' Oracle, too,
seems to believe that public relations and lobbying can affect
federal antitrust cases.
</P>
<P>
   Public choice theory, to be sure, is a serious discipline. James
M. Buchanan won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in
1986 for his public choice research, and two other Nobel laureates,
George J. Stigler and Kenneth J. Arrow, have made important strides
in the field. But applying public choice theory to federal
antitrust actions runs into some logical problems. Do Microsoft's
competitors have a stake in the suit? Of course they do. And
Microsoft's rivals, who offered information and evidence to
prosecutors, say they were not lobbying, just educating the
government. (Of course, most any lobbyist would say that.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet such statements of the obvious do not show that the
government is dancing to the tune of the Microsoft-bashing band.
People who have worked in the Justice Department's antitrust
division over the years say the arithmetic works like this: Since
consumers rarely know what is going on, 90 percent of antitrust
leads come from competitors. But fewer than 1 in 10 complaints by
competitors prompt an investigation, and only a tiny fraction of
those lead to a suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have 350 smart people in the antitrust division to
separate the wheat from the chaff,'' said Robert E. Litan, director
of economic studies at the Brookings Institution and a former
Justice Department official. ``That's how antitrust enforcement
works.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the most compelling evidence against Microsoft
came from the company's own documents and e-mail, not from anything
competitors supplied. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Public choice theorists suggest that politics was behind the
Microsoft case, noting that the senior Justice Department officials
are political appointees and that the 19 state attorneys general
are elected officials. Yet the suit has never been much of a
populist cause. Microsoft and Bill Gates personally retained very
favorable poll ratings throughout the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement is not supposed to be done by referendum.
The Justice Department is a law enforcement agency, and the
judiciary is institutionally independent from the other branches of
government. Buchanan, the public choice pioneer, has noted that the
framers of the Constitution wisely used separation of powers and an
independent judiciary to curb the effects of self-seeking special
interests on government.
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable people can disagree about the Microsoft case.
Microsoft believes that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who found
the company a monopolist that has repeatedly violated the nation's
antitrust laws, was mistaken. That is now a matter for the U.S.
Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court. Lobbying or image campaigns
or public choice theory will not affect the outcome; no use bidding
for wastebaskets now. &QL;

DUMA VOTE ENABLES KREMLIN TO DISMISS REGIONAL GOVERNORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's lower house of parliament voted solidly Friday
to give the Kremlin the right to fire any of the nation's 89
governors for cause, handing President Vladimir Putin another
powerful weapon in his bid to centralize power in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house, or Duma, voted 399-9 in favor of the proposal,
which now goes to the upper house. The landslide vote means that
the measure almost certainly will become law, no matter how the
upper house votes, because the Duma would need only 300 of Friday's
399 votes to override action by the upper house.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has moved quickly to rein in the governors, potentially
powerful political forces who sometimes have run their provinces as
autocrats, almost independent of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma already has passed another bill that would sweep the
governors from their guaranteed seats in the upper house of
parliament, diluting their influence in Moscow and _ just as
important _ ending their immunity from criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are looking into political corruption in
two-thirds of the 89 regions, officials say. Should the legislation
passed Friday become law, Putin could dismiss a governor for any
violations of the Russian constitution, as long as a federal court
approves the act.

   For most people, home is a sanctuary, a place to hide from the
world. For Lisa Nowicki, it's her stage.
</P>
<P>
   Nowicki's modest apartment on the edge of Hollywood looks
unremarkable at first _ light colors, a little fireplace and
balcony, and a bedroom loft overlooking the narrow living room. But
then you notice one major difference: In every room, a videocamera
is bolted to a wall, and every few seconds, each camera snaps a
picture and sends it to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the evidence _ the hype surrounding reality television
shows like ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother,'' thousands of live
Webcam sites on the Net _ it seems we've become a closed loop of
voyeurs and exhibitionists, staring at each other through the
mediated lens of TV and 'Net.
</P>
<P>
   For Nowicki, it's the role of a lifetime, her lifetime, in her
apartment, before an audience of thousands. At
AspiringActresses.com, a Web site that runs 24/7, subscribers can
peek in on literally every part of Nowicki's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor, you're always looking for some other way to
distinguish yourself, and I thought, `Well, why not?' '' said
Nowicki, a pretty, pleasant woman from Chicago in her late 20s who
has been trying six years to make it in the acting business.
``Maybe it's a long-running documentary. It's like 'EdTV,' 'The
Real World' and 'The Truman Show' all blended together.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowicki is part of a Webcam world that has been building in size
for a while, attracting some of the same audience that has made
reality TV shows such ratings monsters. While sexually oriented
Webcams sites have done booming business for some time, the new
ones _ like Nowicki's and competitors such as Crushed Planet and
TheRealHouse.com. _ focus on more or less real life, if you
consider life in front of a camera all day real.
</P>
<P>
   Sex certainly is shown on these sites when it happens, but even
the salacious stuff is only a small part of the participants'
lives.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit like ``Being John Malkovich,'' the wacky 1999 film
where people pay to be literally inside the actor's head for 15
minutes at a time. His is not a glamorous life: Generally, all they
see him do is eat leftover Chinese food, or order linens from a
catalog. But they turn out in droves, paying $200 each, for that 15
minutes of time in the actor's head.
</P>
<P>
   The difference here is that in most cases, these are people
you've never heard of, even if, like Nowicki, they hope their
Internet exposure will make them famous.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to take a peek at people's lives isn't new, argues
author Simson Garfinkel, whose recent ``Database Nation'' explores
the collision between technology and privacy. ``It's just that
technology allows more people to see it,'' said Garfinkel. ``And
there's the possibility of a personal connection if you desire
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People could make money off their diaries and
autobiographies,'' Garfinkel said. ``The real difference is you can
get instantly there.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Winner, the man who runs Nowicki's site and eight other
sites that he collectively calls LIFEcam, says there's definitely
money to be made. The Canoga Park college couple in his CoupleTV
site attract as many as 10,000 viewers at a time, including
thousands of subscribers who each put up $19 a month to watch their
antics, sexual and otherwise, on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Winner acknowledges his sites provide a good business for him,
but says he does it ``because I just love exposing secrets. To me,
people-watching is so fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   He splits subscription proceeds with each site's participants,
though Nowicki, who's been decidedly more mild-mannered on screen
than her fellow LIFEcam counterparts, says she makes only enough to
pay some bills and avoid ``having to waitress seven nights a week''
to cover living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Winner put himself on screen about nine months ago, to better
understand what his employee/stars were experiencing. And he said
he found it a transforming experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The camera becomes a friend,'' Winner said. ``It becomes not
just a one-way mirror looking in at you, but a portal looking out.
When that camera is on, you don't feel lonely. It's sort of the
same reason people have their TV on. They're really hooked in, more
than anyone else in the world. I do know once they get hooked in,
they're in it for more than just money, or their exhibitionism.''
</P>
<P>
   That interaction with the rest of the world, in what would be a
haven from the craziness of daily life for most folks, can be
tiring, though.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Smith, a 22-year-old structural engineering associate,
is leaving The Real House (at www.therealhouse.com) after 10
months, in part because she tired of having to chat every day with
subscribers and keep a diary, both requirements of residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes some energy,'' Smith said. ``I can't keep up with it
any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   That interaction with the fans is a crucial part of what makes
these sites work, and fans use it to voice opinions on seemingly
everything they see and read.
</P>
<P>
   The Real House's president, Giovanni Barone of Santa Monica,
sent along one such piece of fervent, if frequently misspelled, fan
mail meant for Smith:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Suzzane, Your boyfriend doesn(')t seem to be concerned
about you and the way he makes you feel sexually. I say this
because he doesn(')t care if you are exposed to the camera while
you guys are making love but he always...ALWAYS!!! covers himself
while you guys are (having sex.)''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of scrutiny by viewers got old, Smith said, even
though she says she quickly was able to ignore the cameras
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard sometimes because some people, when watching you,
seem to get an opinion of their own about how you are and how your
relationship is,'' Smith said. ``They definitely voice their
opinion. They look at it like it's a soap opera that isn't real.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowicki said she is starting to get double takes from people in
public places who ask whether she's on the Internet, a sign that
someone is watching. And though Smith found the fan interest an
interference sometimes, particularly for her camera-shy boyfriend,
Nowicki welcomes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I get to the point, say, that I'm working on a show,
I would keep on doing it,'' Nowicki said. ``I just think it's so
much fun. I just stare up at (the camera) sometimes and make faces
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Nowicki and the other LIFEcammers, Smith only received
free rent and utilities for living in The Real House, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith initially became part of the place when her
then-boyfriend, Niko, signed both of them up. Once they were in,
though, the couple quickly split up when Niko was captured on
camera having sex with another woman. Both continued to remain in
the house, though Niko, too, is about to move out, essentially
because of a vote by the site's fans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith sees living in the house as a good and unique
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a test, to put myself in a different experience,'' said
Smith. ``I just wanted to be put in a weird situation. I didn't
mind it. It was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The participants on Woodland Hills-based Crushed Planet (at
www.crushedplanet.com) don't get paid a lot of money, either, says
co-CEO Harry Gantz. He and brother Joe are best-known for their HBO
reality show ``Taxicab Confessions,'' where a cabbie encourages his
fares to discuss intimate details of their lives while hidden
cameras are rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to the Web allows the Gantzes to show more than just
highlights of someone's life, Harry Gantz says. One of their shows,
``First Apartment,'' featuring a couple sharing their first
apartment together, provides the unedited reality dose that fuels
the Webcam world.
</P>
<P>
   Gantz has his own theory why it appeals to participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in a sense a personal expression, the same way someone
might be dabbling in art,'' Gantz said. ``It's the most idealistic
time of life, when people are most concerned with personal
expression. They've seen Webcams and think here's a situation where
they can trust the technology to show their lives honestly. The way
we set it up, people think, 'Wow, I have a chance to express myself
by being on this Webcam.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Barone said he picks only certain kinds of people to take part:
``I base it on their personality, their charisma, how they hold
themselves, if they're talkative and very charming and
enthusiastic, those kinds of characteristics. They don't have to
necessarily get along with everyone. And if there's something
interesting about them, (like) they're in a band.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask participants why others would watch their lives, and they
scratch their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was just me (in the house), I don't have any idea,''
said Smith. ``But with other (Real House residents), I can see the
attraction. You have actual contact with these people. Lots of
drama goes on. I think that's the attraction. That and the fact
that you can actually talk to these people and interact with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gantz attributes it to post-modern existential angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has to do with this feeling of people feeling so
disconnected to the world,'' Gantz said. ``They live in little
apartments. This in a sense makes you feel connected, by being with
these other real people. If you can care about (`The Sopranos'),
don't you think there's a bigger potential to care if it's someone
who's real?''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 4,000 people a day, from all over the world, may
watch Nowicki, typically keeping a window open on their computer's
desktop to monitor what's happening in her life as they live
theirs, Winner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just an enormous number of people who just really
appreciate the subtlety of watching life,'' Winner said. ``Why do
people watch? Because it's really, really entertaining. It's all
live, all subtle, but rather hypnotic: What's going to happen
next?'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Real House's president, Giovanni Barone of Santa Monica,
sent along one such piece of fervent, if frequently misspelled, fan
mail meant for Smith:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Suzzane, Your boyfriend doesn(')t seem to be concerned
about you and the way he makes you feel sexually. I say this
because he doesn(')t care if you are exposed to the camera while
you guys are making love but he always...ALWAYS!!! covers himself
while you guys are (having sex.)''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of scrutiny by viewers got old, Smith said, even
though she says she quickly was able to ignore the cameras
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard sometimes because some people, when watching you,
seem to get an opinion of their own about how you are and how your
relationship is,'' Smith said. ``They definitely voice their
opinion. They look at it like it's a soap opera that isn't real.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowicki said she is starting to get double takes from people in
public places who ask whether she's on the Internet, a sign that
someone is watching. And though Smith found the fan interest an
interference sometimes, particularly for her camera-shy boyfriend,
Nowicki welcomes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I get to the point, say, that I'm working on a show,
I would keep on doing it,'' Nowicki said. ``I just think it's so
much fun. I just stare up at (the camera) sometimes and make faces
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Nowicki and the other LIFEcammers, Smith only received
free rent and utilities for living in The Real House, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith initially became part of the place when her
then-boyfriend, Niko, signed both of them up. Once they were in,
though, the couple quickly split up when Niko was captured on
camera having sex with another woman. Both continued to remain in
the house, though Niko, too, is about to move out, essentially
because of a vote by the site's fans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith sees living in the house as a good and unique
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a test, to put myself in a different experience,'' said
Smith. ``I just wanted to be put in a weird situation. I didn't
mind it. It was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The participants on Woodland Hills-based Crushed Planet (at
www.crushedplanet.com) don't get paid a lot of money, either, says
co-CEO Harry Gantz. He and brother Joe are best-known for their HBO
reality show ``Taxicab Confessions,'' where a cabbie encourages his
fares to discuss intimate details of their lives while hidden
cameras are rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to the Web allows the Gantzes to show more than just
highlights of someone's life, Harry Gantz says. One of their shows,
``First Apartment,'' featuring a couple sharing their first
apartment together, provides the unedited reality dose that fuels
the Webcam world.
</P>
<P>
   Gantz has his own theory why it appeals to participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in a sense a personal expression, the same way someone
might be dabbling in art,'' Gantz said. ``It's the most idealistic
time of life, when people are most concerned with personal
expression. They've seen Webcams and think here's a situation where
they can trust the technology to show their lives honestly. The way
we set it up, people think, 'Wow, I have a chance to express myself
by being on this Webcam.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Barone said he picks only certain kinds of people to take part:
``I base it on their personality, their charisma, how they hold
themselves, if they're talkative and very charming and
enthusiastic, those kinds of characteristics. They don't have to
necessarily get along with everyone. And if there's something
interesting about them, (like) they're in a band.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask participants why others would watch their lives, and they
scratch their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was just me (in the house), I don't have any idea,''
said Smith. ``But with other (Real House residents), I can see the
attraction. You have actual contact with these people. Lots of
drama goes on. I think that's the attraction. That and the fact
that you can actually talk to these people and interact with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gantz attributes it to post-modern existential angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has to do with this feeling of people feeling so
disconnected to the world,'' Gantz said. ``They live in little
apartments. This in a sense makes you feel connected, by being with
these other real people. If you can care about (`The Sopranos'),
don't you think there's a bigger potential to care if it's someone
who's real?''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 4,000 people a day, from all over the world, may
watch Nowicki, typically keeping a window open on their computer's
desktop to monitor what's happening in her life as they live
theirs, Winner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just an enormous number of people who just really
appreciate the subtlety of watching life,'' Winner said. ``Why do
people watch? Because it's really, really entertaining. It's all
live, all subtle, but rather hypnotic: What's going to happen
next?'' &QL;

considered strong, that for the first time in 43 years there was no
defending champion. This year's field, however, is strong and will
include two other Tour champions joining Austin's Lance Armstrong,
the 1999 victor. Armstrong still is clearly the favorite, but he
should be pressed more than last year when he finished with a
7-minute, 37-second cushion over runner-up Alex Zulle. Armstrong's

The official designation probably won't be made by the agency until

to give the boot to homosexual scoutmasters. The next president's
Supreme Court appointments could overturn Wednesday's decision. I
don't know if George W. Bush or Al Gore were Boy Scouts or if they

fortunate in funerals. Our cousin, Don Harp, is a preacher. He
knows exactly what to say when a family member crosses the Jordan.
One of the things he pointed out at Aunt Ida Mae's funeral was that
we are running out of what Tom Brokaw and a lot of us think of as
The Greatest Generation. ``Who among us is going to take their

baby.'' ``You can't come this way, ma'am,'' an officer directed
her, then became silent, as understanding dawned: This is the

   TRUE-LOVE _ True love may wait, but Bill Hayes couldn't. Yes, he
promised back in 1993 to postpone having sex until he was married.
And yes, he held hands with hundreds of other young Christians at
The King's Academy in West Palm Beach and pledged to stay pure. He
even signed a True Love Waits card with the sincerest of
intentions. But that was when he was just 16, before he fell in
love for the first time. ``I didn't plan it or anything,'' said
Hayes, now 23. ``We were dating for nine months. I really cared
about her.'' The moral of this story, supporters of abstinence
programs will tell you, is not that Hayes failed to live up to his
commitment _ though they condemn his failure. It's that abstinence
until marriage has become a socially acceptable standard that Hayes
and other teenagers have set for themselves since they began their
campaign, a movement that has found its way into public school sex
education curriculums. And therein lies their victory. And the

the 1999 victor. Armstrong still is clearly the favorite, but he

   NATIONAL FORECAST  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An expanding area with mainly clear and pleasant conditions will
dominate the nation east of the Mississippi River. High pressure
centered over West Virginia will promote sunshine and near seasonal
temperatures from the Carolinas to Maine. The return circulation of
warmer air into the Plains will be accompanied by patches of
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   A few thunderstorms will develop over Minnesota and western
Michigan as a front pushes into the upper Great Lakes. A stalled
front from Florida to Texas will be the focus of thick clouds and
showers. A few strong storms may develop over Central Texas and
south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Hot weather will dominate the northern and central Rockies, but
thunderstorms will develop later in the day as cooler air moves in
from the Pacific. The monsoon in the Southwest will be active with
numerous storms in Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WETTEST MONTH
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, Minn., last month, the amount of rain fell as it
never had before. A total of 12.50 inches of rain were measured at
the city's airport, making June 2000 the wettest month on record in
Rochester. The previous record was 12.33 inches in July 1978. Of
course, weather anomalies are constantly occurring around the
globe. While the unusual wetness around Rochester occurred at an
official reporting site, countless weather anomalies go unreported
because they happen over oceans or sparsely populated land.

THE STORY OF O
</HEADLINE>
  Winfrey talks to her fans 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They came in pairs, threes and larger groups, in minivans and
SUVs, dressed in their nicest clothes _ not the fanciest, but the
most put-together.
</P>
<P>
   They were looking for the secrets to living in the moment,
curing themselves of ``the disease to please,'' learning how to put
themselves first _ at least some of the time.
</P>
<P>
   They came to see Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey, the self-described ``colored girl from
Mississippi'' who rose to television stardom through her own
determination, the media mogul with the Midas touch for nearly
every venture she pursues, a woman who readily laughs and sometimes
cries during her daily talk show, making her viewers do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey brought her sold-out Personal Growth Summit to the
6,300-seat Shrine Auditorium on Thursday night, the final stop
following other one-night appearances in Detroit, Atlanta and
Chicago. She talked without rest for more than an hour, then
fielded questions from the audience for another hour.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the summits mirrors the tone of her new O
magazine and her somewhat reinvented top-rated talk show: Helping
people _ mainly women _ find the best in themselves and discover
their own happiness.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was set with up-tempo Motown tunes and slides showing
inspirational words from Ralph Waldo Emerson, Eleanor Roosevelt,
Benazir Bhutto and even Joe E. Lewis. &QL; 
--Oprah on taking time each day for meditation or introspection:
</P>
<P>
   ``Put yourself first so that you can DO for the rest of the
world. If you can't give yourself a minute (that will improve
everything else in your life), then shut up. Stop complaining.'' &QL; 
Winfrey, dressed in a striking red floor-length evening coat,
frequently spoke off the cuff, occasionally visiting a Lucite
podium centerstage and even less often resting her spike-heeled
feet in an upholstered chair. &QL; 
--Oprah on self-awareness:
</P>
<P>
   ``Each trial in your life is there to show you who you really
are. It's the world standing outside you yelling that you are
broke, you are diseased, you are not worthy, and it's up to you to
go inside yourself, to be strong enough inside yourself to say,
`This is who I am.''' &QL; 
She spent much of the time pacing or meandering across the broad
proscenium, hitting on mantra-like key phrases and backing them up
with humorous and sometimes poignant personal anecdotes as well as
snippets of poetry and pearls of wisdom from celebrated
philosophers. She also brought her acting skills into play as she
characterized her grandmother, her father, ex-slave Sojourner Truth
addressing a suffragette gathering, the plaintiff's attorney in her
Texas beef market trial, and a few colorful fans she has met. &QL; 
--Oprah on intentions:
</P>
<P>
   ``When the person asks the question, don't just say `yes' before
it gets out of their mouth. ... What is your definition of `nice'?
For me it boiled down to being accommodating, the disease to
please.''
</P>
<P>
   When solicited by charities, she now says, ``Let me get back to
you.'' Then she ponders her intention: Would she be writing that
check to make the individual happy? To be perceived as generous? If
the charity itself and the good the money could do for it are not
among her initial reactions, she said she declines. (She made no
mention of the $10 million gift she made the day before to A Better
Chance, an organization that provides educational opportunities to
academically gifted minority students.) &QL; 
There was no doubt she was preaching to the converted, just as
political candidates and itinerate evangelists have always done.
Several remarks elicited replies of ``amen'' and ``uh-huh'' as
could be heard in a Baptist church service. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Oprah on relationships:
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first
time. The lesson is to try to surround yourself with people who are
going to lift you up, not people you know are toxic.'' &QL; 
Even before the program, women in the audience were speaking her
language. Lynda Roberts of Huntington Beach came with her three
grown daughters, Laura, Renee and Carrie. ``We want to live our
best life,'' Roberts said. ``We talked about it on the way, all the
improvements we want to make, and we hope to be inspired
tonight.'' &QL; 
--Oprah on life's possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what happened to me isn't a miracle, it's a possibility
for anybody who chooses. And that doesn't mean you'll have a talk
show. It means you find your own calling.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the power of one human being to be able to change
the face of the planet,'' Winfrey said toward the end of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   But she did not profess to have all the answers, any foolproof
guide to life. ``I don't speak as a therapist or any kind of
authority, but as a friend with something to share.'' &QL;

LIGHTS, ACTION ... COSTUMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By GUY TREBAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mosquitoes zoomed in squadron-style as dusk curtained
Whitestone, Queens. Paranoia suddenly seemed to fill the air with
their sinister whine. In recent news accounts, this area had become
identified with ground zero for West Nile virus: a local chicken
had reportedly become infected with the disease. As it would later
develop, the chicken was in the clear. But the actors filming the
new indie movie ``Dummy'' had no way of knowing that. They were not
leaving flesh to fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting devoured,'' the actor Adrien Brody said, hiking
the legs of his geek high-water pants and letting rip with a spray
can of Off. Perched in a director's chair, Illeana Douglas swabbed
Muskol on her naked forearms. On a lawn in front of a
``Sopranos''-style colonial house, Milla Jovovich engaged her
boyfriend, John Frusciante, the guitarist of the Red Hot Chili
Peppers, in a bug-proof lip lock.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Moments later Frusciante was walking around the snack table
dazedly, complaining that his mouth had gone numb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suck on one of these, honey,'' said Verna Hampton, a caterer
who owns Verna's Vittles. Then she handed him one of the Blow Pops
she had brought, ``to calm the masses,'' as she explained.
</P>
<P>
   There were no masses.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   There was a skeleton crew. There was a producer who drove to the
set in a banged-up Golf. There was an unknown 29-year-old
writer-director. There was a small cast of actors with unorthodox
professional trajectories and Next Big Thing bios, all working for
union scale.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a local family parading up and down 159th Street
with a 4-year-old got up in tights and a cape. ``See that kid
dressed as Batman?'' Gregory Pritikin, the director, asked. ``He
was Superman 20 minutes ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do Spider-Man, too, if you need him,'' the father
called out.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of Steven Schoichet, a maladroit suburbanite whose life
is transformed when he comes into possession of a ventriloquist's
prop, ``Dummy'' is the kind of movie Charlie McCarthy might have
starred in if Michael Ovitz had been his agent. Nearly everyone
else in the film is a client of Ovitz's firm, Artists Management
Group, a noncoincidence that helps explain how a script by an
obscure writer with a budget that wouldn't buy a two-bedroom in
Chelsea happened to get this far.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' said the English actor Jared Harris, who is part
of the ``Dummy'' ensemble, ``Adrien was interested in doing it and
AMG helped it to happen. It's not as if they're shoving actors down
producers' throats.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   A favorite of directors (at 27 he has already made films with
Spike Lee, Steven Soderbergh, Terrence Malick and Ken Loach), Brody
plays the lead role. Douglas is his older sister, a ``bitter
wedding planner who wants to sing,'' she explained. Jovovich is a
riot-grrrl type poetically named Fangora. Steven's crush, Lorena,
is portrayed by Vera Farmiga, a newcomer whose anonymity should end
by August, when three movies in which she acted _ with Robert De
Niro, Edward Burns and Richard Gere _ are released.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer code for films like ``Dummmy'' is ``quirky,'' a cliche
that translates as, ``Where's Blockbuster going to file this one?''
Directors claim to hate the term. Actors say it trivializes their
range. But ``genius'' is about the only word directors enjoy seeing
attached to their work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A reporter on the set of ``Dummy'' found himself wondering how
performers get into their parts, how they inhabit characters who,
say, live in demented households, talk through dummies, sing in
rock groups called the Botanical Booger Ensemble and
surreptitiously smash gifts at the weddings they stage. The visitor
arrived expecting Stanislavskian responses. The answers he got ran
to a simpler concept: costume.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I think about with a character is how much
money they make a year,'' said Douglas, who was not on call but was
visiting the set to lend support. ``Then you know how they dress,
and you don't put them in clothes they can't afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Brody, Harris and Farmiga all made similar points about
interpretation, not to mention, indirectly, about class.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clothes are always very much in step with who the character
is,'' said Brody, whose spiked Mohawk nearly upstaged his
performance in Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam.'' ``For `Dummy,' we
tried to find any article that could look boyish or could have been
from his childhood wardrobe. Anything that was stylish we
removed.'' Farmiga imagined her character, Lorena, as cautious,
shy, hesitant, meek _ did someone say a dormouse?
</P>
<P>
   ``She probably shops at Daffy's or Fashion Bug or Annie Sez,''
Farmiga said. ``We bought her shoes at Payless. And it all really
influences the way you play the part because, for one thing, the
shoes put your posture in a certain position and force you to walk
in a certain way.''
</P>
<P>
   When an actor is in the right clothes, Harris said, ``it gets
you a long way'' toward capturing the character. In Solondz's
``Happiness,'' Harris disappeared so deeply into the role of the
wife-beating, womanizing, sleazeball Russian cabdriver that people
who barely recognized him in the movie still talk to him about his
character's '70s-style fake-snakeskin shirt.
</P>
<P>
   `` ``When you've got the visual right, subconsciously you're
already hitting certain marks about the character,'' Harris said.
``After `Happiness,' people came up to me and said: `That shirt!
Brilliant!'''
</P>
<P>
   The clothes Douglas wears as Heidi Schoichet are ``slightly
incongruous for her surroundings,'' she said. ``Slightly vintagey,
very bright colors, nothing fits very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas herself had on snug yellow stretch hip-huggers, yellow
Converse All Stars and a midriff-revealing T-shirt bought at the
Beverly Center in Los Angeles. A puppy was pictured on the front,
beneath a legend that read ``Too Cute.'' Waiting for the crew to
set up a shot, she and Pritikin also talked clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guayabera,'' the director said of his shirt, a type
common in Latin American countries. ``It's from Guayabera, a small
island off Chicago. Typically, I wear shirts that come with lots of
pockets. This one has just two, so it's a mutant, irregular. It
doesn't look like it fits properly because they never do. Still,
I'm really glad I found one that makes me look like a barber.''
</P>
<P>
   The wooden clothespins clipped to the pocket? ``I always
accessorize with clothespins,'' Pritikin said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas added, ``Everyone on movie sets has them, although I
never saw one outside my childhood until I started making films.''
</P>
<P>
   You see all kinds of things you never expected on the sets of
movies. Take, for example, the sight of Jovovich, supermodel, and
Frusciante, rock star, with their feet hooked behind their heads,
practicing yoga on someone's front lawn. Frusciante is an
alternately coruscating and delicate guitarist who once left the
Chili Peppers to pursue some career alternatives that brought him
within Kubler-Ross distance of dying, then abruptly cleaned up,
returned to the group, and can now discourse extensively on
ashtanga yoga. Jovovich, of course, is the L'Oreal face who started
modeling at 11, was doing Avedon covers for Vogue four years later
and then transformed herself into an eerily plausible alien in Luc
Besson's science fiction mess, ``The Fifth Element,'' en route to
becoming a cross-dressing 15th-century farm girl in ``The
Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest surprise on this movie has probably been Milla,''
Pritikin said. ``You wouldn't think it to look at her, but she's
one of the funniest, most spontaneous, quick-witted people. She's a
regular Shemp Howard.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Jovovich could have raided the Three Stooges' closet
for her role as Fangora. Her outfit for the night's shot, a
stalker-style courtship raid she helps Steven make on Lorena's
house, involved a pair of Army fatigues, some pointy-toe shoes with
bows on the vamp and a knit Guatemalan ski mask that the film's
costume designer, Marie Abma, had found at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I really wanted to think about with Fangora,''
Jovovich said, ``is how cool is she? She's a total dork, but she's
also the coolest person in town.'' A tomboy ``who's never had a
boyfriend,'' Fangora is still a virgin, Jovovich explained, ``and
hasn't really got a style.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Fangora not only has abundant style, but also style of
a pretty specific sort: punk chick circa early Exene Cervenka.
``She goes out in these crazy outfits like an `I Love New York'
T-shirt that we drew on with a picture of a guy shooting a gun,''
Jovovich said. ``Then she wears a frilly, cupcakey old green prom
dress, with a garter and fishnets that I put my head through the
legs of, and some lady shoes that she probably stole. She wears a
shell-pink sequined cape with horns. Fangora's extrovertedness is a
defense, but you walk with your head held high in this life, people
will believe it. Fangora's a complete nimrod. But you see her on
film, and she really rocks.''

   NURSING-HOME-WORKERS _ WASHINGTON _ A nursing home in Palm Beach
County, Fla. wants to hire workers to assist elderly residents eat
but has been blocked by a federal regulation. Nursing homes in Ohio
and several other states also want to use ``single task'' employees
to assist residents in eating and to push their wheelchairs from
one place to another. The feds have stopped them. Patient rights
advocates support the government, claiming single task employees
won't solve the problem of understaffing in nusring homes. A bill
is pending in Congress to overturn the regulation blocking single

   SOUTH-INFLUENCE _ As the South enters the next century, the
ranks of lobbyists have in state capitals have swollen and begun to
change in ways every bit as dramatic as the partisan shifts in the
legislatures which they attempt to influence. Not long ago, it was
a relatively simple matter to determine the handful of companies,
along with the Farm Bureau or some other powerful, state-based
organization, which held sway in each South legislature. The new
economy and the rise of public-interest lobbying have dramatically
changed this picture. We look at data on political ontributions
across the South, as well as a unique North Carolina study which
yearly ranks the state's most influential lobbyists. (Baxter,

William Maxwell, a revered editor at The New Yorker. The one is
often hypnotic in its imagery (``... a wind hits and streaks of
snow revolve to the horizontal and double in volume, a

keep in touch, identifies him as their cause for being apart. An

 &HT;    Deciding to move an entire town pits safety against strong
emotion
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The residents of Grundy, Va., are not the first folks forced to
pack up their town and move to higher ground. In Soldiers Grove,
Wis., and English, Ky., in Pattonsburg, Mo., and Valmeyer, Ill.,
the local citizens, fed up with decades of devastating floods,
finally abandoned their soggy homes to rebuild in dryer locations.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups applaud such relocation efforts as a more
sensible _ and less expensive _ alternative to building more levees
and rebuilding damaged buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disasters cost and cost and cost,'' says Mary Hudak, a
spokeswoman for the Atlanta office of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. ``Getting people out of harm's way is a better
way. The people in Grundy are in a very vulnerable area because of
the floods every 20 years or so.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to move usually is left in the hands of the
townspeople, Hudak says. And, in some cases, such as in
Princeville, N.C., they decide not to move.
</P>
<P>
   The historic North Carolina town of 2,100 was nearly swept away
last September when Hurricane Floyd came through and destroyed
nearly two-thirds of the 600 homes and damaged most of the downtown
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Given an opportunity to move the town that was founded by freed
slaves in 1885, the citizens voted to stay. The 20-foot earthen
dike along the Tar River has been shored up and the downtown
business district is being revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our heritage, and this is where we plan to stay,''
Mayor Delia Perkins said shortly after the flood.
</P>
<P>
   Hudak admits emotional issues often outweigh the economic ones.
``Our thoughts were, `Why put yourself in a place where you would
be vulnerable again?' But it was their choice. And there is a loss
of that sense of community when a town is relocated. That's what
they wrestled with in Princeville. In the end, they decided to stay
because they said their ancestors had struggled with things far
greater than a flood.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a term filled with emotionally charged cases,
several Supreme Court justices jumped ideological fences,
reflecting conflicts that the public still has with such issues as
abortion, police power and separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the social issues, the only consistency was inconsistency,
much like the country itself,'' said David Garrow, a law professor
at Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the jurists have often divided into ideological
camps with Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin
Scalia and Clarence Thomas on the conservative side and Justices
John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and David
Souter on the more liberal side. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and
Anthony Kennedy have been the swing votes.
</P>
<P>
   But during this term the conservative Thomas surprised many
court-watchers when he joined with Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg as
well as Kennedy in a cable TV ruling. The five voted to strike down
a law requiring cable companies to either completely scramble or
take off the air sexually explicit broadcasts during hours when
children might see them.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing the unusual five-some were conservatives William
Rehnquist and Antonin Scalia, moderate Sandra Day O'Connor and
liberal Stephen Breyer, who argued that the restrictions were
proper.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the conservative Scalia lectured the liberal
Breyer on the importance of an undiminished right to trial by jury
for a defendant accused of a hate crime. In a 5-4 ruling, the court
said that juries, not judges, must decide whether those guilty of
violence were motivated by bias and therefore subject to longer
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   However, later in the term, Scalia and Breyer teamed up to
defend the right of federal agents looking for illegal drugs to
squeeze bus passengers' carry-on bags. The other seven justices
ruled that such searches were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was term where it was extremely difficult to know where
each justice would come out on any particular case,'' said Daniel
Troy, an expert on the court at the conservative American
Enterprise Institute here. ``On some of the biggest cases of the
year, the court surprised a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although all the justices but Breyer and Ginsburg were
appointed by Republican presidents, the court reaffirmed three of
the most controversial decisions of earlier, more liberal Supreme
Courts. These rulings involved abortion, school prayer and the
Miranda rule requiring that suspects be told of their rights to
remain silent and to have an attorney during police questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The most stunning surprise of the term came when Rehnquist broke
ranks with his fellow conservatives and wrote the majority opinion
upholding the 1966 Miranda decision. His action led to the term's
most bitter split among traditional allies. In his opinion for the
seven-member majority, Rehnquist said the Miranda rule was so
embedded in America's culture and so rooted in the Constitution
that Congress could not legally overturn it with a less-stringent
1968 law.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice's switch enraged Scalia, who along with
Thomas, called the original Miranda ruling ``judicial arrogance''
and accused Rehnquist of turning his back on his own previous
criticisms of Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also surprised court experts when they affirmed
1962 and 1963 Supreme Court decisions barring prayer in school. In
a Texas case the court ruled, 6-3, that a school district violated
the Constitution by allowing a student to lead prayers before high
school football games.
</P>
<P>
   With Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas dissenting, swing voters
O'Connor and Kennedy joined the more liberal justices to say that
the local school board was giving preferential treatment to a
particular religious viewpoint by granting the student the right to
use the school's public address system at a school-sponsored event.
</P>
<P>
   However, in another religion case, the court, by a 6-3 vote,
went the other way and broke down part of the wall separating
church and state. This time the swing voters as well as Breyer
jumped to the conservative side, ruling that the federal government
may lend computers and other educational equipment to parochial
schools. The decision _ which overturned two previous cases
limiting government aid to religious schools _ came amid a
politically charged, nationwide controversy over allowing students
to use taxpayer-supported vouchers to attend private schools,
including religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, the court finally voted in a way that many
expected. In a 5-4 decision, it struck down Nebraska's ban on
so-called ``partial-birth'' abortions, jeopardizing similar
restrictions in 29 other states. The justices, with O'Connor
joining the more liberal justices and Kennedy joining the
conservatives, said the Nebraska ban was too broadly written and
violated a woman's right to end her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Court scholars said that besides abortion, the only issue where
the justices took their traditional ideological stances this term
was the question of federal vs. state power.
</P>
<P>
   For the last six years, the Rehnquist-led court steadily has
chipped away at the power of the federal government to impose its
will on the states.
</P>
<P>
   In a Florida case the court ruled 5-4 that state workers
alleging age discrimination may not sue their employers under a
federal law because states are immune from federal lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In another 5-4 decision, the court said Congress exceeded its
power when it passed a section of the Violence Against Women Act
giving victims a right to sue their attackers in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Following are the high court's major decisions in other
categories:
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL LIBERTIES:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Washington state law allowing grandparents or others to sue
for the right to visit a child ``at any time'' illegally infringes
on parents' rights.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 6.2-million-member Boy Scouts of America is a private
organization and may therefore bar openly gay people from serving
as troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   POLICE POWER:
</P>
<P>
   _ Police may stop and frisk suspects who run away at the sight
of an officer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Police may not stop and frisk someone based on an anonymous
tip that hasn't been confirmed independently.
</P>
<P>
   FREE SPEECH:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cities may ban nudity in night clubs that feature erotic
dancing in cases where there are ``harmful'' effects on the
community.
</P>
<P>
   _ Public universities can force students to pay fees even when
some of the money raised goes to organizations they find
objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   _ States may force abortion protesters to keep at least eight
feet away from women entering health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTIONS:
</P>
<P>
   _ A state law barring individuals from giving more than $1,075
to a political candidate per election does not violate free speech
rights.
</P>
<P>
   _ California's free-for-all primary election system, which
allowed voters to choose candidates without regard to party
affiliation, violates the rights of political parties to define
their own message and decide their own candidates.
</P>
<P>
   FEDERAL REGULATIONS:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Food and Drug Administration lacks the power to regulate
the manufacture and sale of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   _ People injured in auto crashes may not use a federal law to
sue automakers for not installing airbags when they were not
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patients may not use a federal law to sue health maintenance
organizations for giving doctors financial bonuses to hold down
treatment costs.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL:
</P>
<P>
   _ Washington and other coastal states may not add their own
regulations to federal safety rules for huge oil tankers operating
in their waters.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Massachusetts law aimed at boycotting companies that do
business with Myanmar, also known as Burma, treads illegally on
existing federal sanctions. It compromises the president's ability
to speak for the nation with one voice in dealing with other
governments.

safer-sex publicity and new drug treatments, new HIV infections in
San Francisco doubled to 900 in the past year. (Summary from wires)

IS THE FUTURE LOOKING DANGEROUS?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Joy's career has been about linking people through
technology, developing a key version of the Unix computer language,
as well as the more recent Java and Jini languages. But perhaps
nothing has created a set of connections, of leaps across
boundaries, so fast, with such an amazing array of people, as his
recently published ``Why the Future Doesn't Need Us'' in Wired
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   It is Joy's lengthy, thoughtful consideration of where
technology may take us, especially if we don't pay attention as
developments coalesce in genetic manipulation, nanotechnology and
robotics (GNR, in his parlance).
</P>
<P>
   Together, he argued, GNR could result in threats to the species'
future even worse than the ones the world has faced from
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. He suggested we may, as a
species, want to decide against pursuing some areas of research,
because the potential for disaster is so great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it is always hard to see the bigger impact while you
are in the vortex of a change,'' Joy wrote. ``Failing to understand
the consequences of our inventions while we are in the rapture of
discovery and innovation seems to be a common fault of scientists
and technologists.'' In a week when publicly funded researchers in
several countries and a private company finished mapping the 3.1
billion bits of DNA that comprise the human genome, the piece is
worth pondering (go to www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04).
</P>
<P>
   Joy talks about his essential optimism about science and the
future, and his growing concern that the optimism is misplaced.
Based on reaction since the piece came out, Joy is far from the
only one concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of latent anxiety on the part of people about
what the future holds,'' said Wired editor in chief Katrina Heron.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the piece's publication, the magazine began
receiving some of the dozens of responses published in this month's
issue, from game designers, software engineers, professors,
historians, ministers, authors, two Nobel laureates, two Dysons
(historian George and physicist father Freeman), even a class of
14-year-olds from a small Italian village.
</P>
<P>
   And the reactions have continued, from all directions, Heron
said. Among the people who have contacted Joy were President
Clinton, several members of Congress and others, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wired has set up an e-mail address, whythefuturewired.com ``so
that readers can receive updates and alerts on issues related to
the article,'' Heron wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the hope is that it will spark a growing national and
international discussion that will be part governmental in
nature,'' Heron said. ``There are very different groups of people
who need to discuss this, need to discuss it in discrete groups,
then have some sort of global discussion, because we're really in
this all together.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, those discussions have indeed begun. The World
Economic Forum began a colloquium on the subject, Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government pondered whether to set up a department on the
question, and the Los Angeles chapter of Physicians for Social
Responsibility gave Joy their Caldicott Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so much that we agree with everything he's saying,''
said Jonathan Parfrey, executive director of the 2,700-member
group. ``The very fact that he is identifying things that could be
dangerous to human survival we found to be quite compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Parfrey likened Joy's piece to some of the warnings Albert
Einstein made in the years his theoretical work on the atom became
the underpinnings for creating nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Einstein said the splitting of the atom changes everything
except our way of thinking, therefore we drift toward unparalleled
catastrophe,'' Parfrey said. ``For a lot of these (current
scientific developments), the path leads back to Bill Joy. He is
now, like Einstein in his day, sending up a warning that there are
things to be worried over, and I think we should listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, when Joy spoke May 31 before the organization,
whose parent won the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for its opposition to
nuclear weapons, reaction to his speech was divided, Parfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a sense there were people who were very much fascinated
by what he had to say,'' Parfrey said. ``At the same time, there
were people who were somewhat skeptical. When it comes to virtually
any of these really big questions, people can focus on the garbage
truck spewing diesel in the front yard, but can they really focus
on killer robots taking over the planet?''
</P>
<P>
   On such questions may the future ride. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The first half of a desultory stock market year is history. What
investors may now be wondering is, will the past be prologue?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of what worked for investors in recent years stopped
working with a vengeance in the first half of 2000. The entire
Internet sector, which had brought new meaning to the term growth
stocks, has fallen flat. And some dearly beloveds among the
momentum investing crowd _ Qualcomm, Cisco Systems and JDS Uniphase
_ are well down from their historical, not to say hysterical,
highs.
</P>
<P>
   But while all eyes are on the disappointing action in many
big-name, large-capitalization stocks, the enviable performance of
a wide swath of the stock market has been all but ignored. That is
the large group of stocks made up of lesser-known, medium-sized
companies with market values of $1 billion to $10 billion _ the
midcap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 400 Mid-Cap Index is up 8 percent so far
this year, compared with the loss of 1 percent in the better-known
S&AMP;P 500 index and the 9 percent decline in the Dow Jones industrial
average, both of which track big stocks. Medium-sized companies
have also beaten the returns of smaller companies; the Russell 2000
is up only 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something really did go right in the first half,'' said
Marshall Acuff, market strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. And he
reckons that the outperformance of midcap stocks will continue the
rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Acuff cites several reasons why these shares have been the sweet
spot in the market of late. One is the growing investor obsession
with value. Investors still want to buy stocks with rising
earnings, but they are no longer willing to pay any price for the
privilege. ``What has been driving these midcaps is you get a lot
of earnings growth at a reasonable price,'' Acuff said.
</P>
<P>
   Medium-sized companies with 15 percent annual profit growth
often trade at price-to-earnings ratios that are much lower than
those seen in big-name stocks. Most of the companies Acuff favors
trade at P/E ratios roughly equal to, not higher than, their
earnings growth rates.
</P>
<P>
   This value proposition has lured many money managers who had
previously focused their buying on large-company shares.
Recognizing that these stocks had become too expensive, Acuff said,
many managers have begun to reach down to smaller companies that
provide good earnings growth. Before their rapid rise, ``Qualcomm
and JDS Uniphase were midcap stocks,'' he said. ``Managers
downsized, found them, and off they went.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for midsized stocks' hot streak is the spate of
mergers in which large companies, eager to keep their growth rates
high, buy smaller, prospering concerns. Last month, for example,
Texas Instruments paid $7.6 billion for Burr-Brown, an electronic
components maker in Tucson, Ariz. Shares in Burr-Brown, a midcap
company, rose 38 percent on the day the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Acuff says he thinks there will be many more such deals in
coming months. ``Consolidation continues to be a very powerful
theme,'' he said. ``If the Fed is going to be successful in slowing
growth, most companies are going to be challenged from a profit
standpoint. One way to get more growth is to consolidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the midcap stocks Acuff likes are Archer Daniels Midland,
the agricultural products concern; the Allmerica Financial Corp.,
which sells insurance and retirement services products to
individuals and institutions; Starwood Hotels and Resorts; the
Avery Dennison Corp., an office products and adhesive label
manufacturer, and John Hancock Financial Services.
</P>
<P>
   These companies may not be as glamorous as those that investors
have grown so fond of in recent years. But investors who hope their
old favorites will spring back should remember that no stock market
strategy remains profitable forever. The midcap sector is clearly
having its moment in the sun. Investors should make hay.

</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: NAIL BOMBER SENTENCED
</P>
<P>
   David Copeland, 24, a self-confessed fascist, was sentenced to
six life terms after a London jury found him guilty of three
murders in a series of bombings aimed at the city's gay and
nonwhite populations. The three deaths resulted from a nail bomb
that devastated a Soho gay bar and injured 139 people. The jury
rejected his defense of diminished responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: ON-THE-SPOT FINES
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair said he would propose at a special
crime summit meeting at 10 Downing St. that police be given power
to march drunken rioters to cash machines and make them withdraw
$150 fines. English fans caused widespread disturbances in Belgium
last week in the Euro 2000 soccer tournament during a game between
England and Germany. Blair spoke at an ethics forum in Tubingen,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY: EX-PREMIERS CLEARED
</P>
<P>
   Two former prime ministers supported each other and won
parliamentary votes that effectively killed investigations into
corruption charges against them. Tansu Ciller had been charged with
siphoning $71,000 from a discretionary fund while she was in
office, and Mesut Yilmaz was said to have sold mobile-phone
licenses at giveaway prices. Parliament voted down motions that
would have sent the cases to the Supreme Court.

</P>
<P>
   CANADA: SECESSION BILL PASSES
</P>
<P>
   Parliament has given final approval to a bill that will make it
harder for Quebec to secede if there is ever a third referendum
there. The bill authorizes the Commons to negotiate a province's
secession only after a referendum vote where the option of
independence is clearly stated and where secessionists win a clear
majority. Quebec separatists attacked it as a ``pseudo law'' that
sets up English-speaking Canada as a judge of a political process
that is internal to Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ASIA
</P>
<P>
   HONG KONG: 5,000 ORDERED OUT
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong court ruled that 5,000 mainland immigrants would
have to leave. The ruling adhered to the policy set by Beijing last
June, when it overturned a decision by Hong Kong's highest court
granting residency to mainland immigrants with at least one Hong
Kong parent. The ruling applied to immigrants who arrived in Hong
Kong after the first court decision, and claimed a right to
residency under it.
</P>
<P>
   SRI LANKA: CENSORSHIP LIFTED
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in a landmark case that censorship
imposed on an English-language weekly, The Sunday Leader, and a
sister publication was illegal and ordered that the paper be
reopened. It was closed for violating guidelines about reporting on
the war against separatist Tamil rebels. The court said the chief
censor had no authority to censor news reports or close the paper.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH AFRICA: LAND REFORM PLEA
</P>
<P>
   The head of the land restitution commission said a sizable
infusion of cash is essential if efforts to redistribute land to
poor blacks are to avoid confrontations like those in Zimbabwe. In
both countries, whites still control much of the most fertile land,
and since blacks won majority rule in Zimbabwe and South Africa,
land reform has been a pressing issue, with more than 63,000 claims
pending in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   MIDDLE EAST
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL: NETANYAHU ON RISE
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper poll of 590 people showed Benjamin Netanyahu, the
rightist former prime minister, beating Prime Minister Ehud Barak
by a significant margin _ 8 percent _ for the first time since
Barak beat Netanyahu and took office a year ago. According to the
Maariv-Gallup poll, Netanyahu would get 44 percent of the votes in
a new election, and Barak 36 percent, with 20 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL: CHINA PLANE PLEA
</P>
<P>
   A leading Cabinet member, Haim Ramon, said Israel should move to
halt the sale of a $250 million airborne radar system to China in
order to repair frayed ties with Washington. ``It is impossible to
postpone the deal,'' Ramon told Israeli Radio. Martin Indyk, the
U.S. ambassador to Israel, told Israeli legislators that
U.S.-Israeli ties would suffer if China got the plane.

   They were the power couple of modern design, working in their
Los Angeles studio from the 1940s through the '70s to create
furniture and artwork that embraced the technology of their age.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Ray Eames were husband and wife (not brothers, as
some think), and while the handsome Charles was most identified
with their designs, he was quick to point out his wife's
contribution. ``She is equally responsible with me for everything
that goes on here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than marble and oils, the couple turned to the materials
of their day _ plastics, fiberglass and plywood. Rather than a
singular work of art, it was functional furniture for the masses,
with an artistic sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Their ambition was to bring high design into every American
home. Nowhere is that ambition more evident than in those Eames
chairs _ the molded plywood chairs of 1940 and 1946, the
fiberglass-reinforced plastic armchair of 1949, the wire-mesh
chairs and wire sofa of the early 1950s, the black leather lounge
chair and ottoman of 1956. Many of the pieces are still being
manufactured today. The Ronald Reagan National Airport terminal in
Washington, D.C., has been lauded for its new look, but the chairs
in the waiting areas were designed by the Eameses back in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as C. Ford Peatross, the Library of Congress' curator
of Architecture, Design and Engineering Collections, pointed out,
``Almost everything the Eameses designed in terms of furniture is
still in production, or has come back into production.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple's work, which also includes architectural projects,
product design, paintings and film production, is the subject of an
exhibition that runs until Sept. 20 at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Eames was born in St. Louis in 1907, growing up in the
industrial Midwest. There he trained as an architect and became
fascinated with the manufacturing process and the properties of new
materials. His wife, Ray, was born in Sacramento in 1912, and
studied at several art schools in the East.
</P>
<P>
   So while he brought an engineering background to their work, she
brought one of color and flowing form. In 1941, the couple married
and moved to Los Angeles, where he took a job designing sets for
MGM. At night, the couple would experiment on creating an
inexpensive method for bending plywood in more than one direction.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the war ended, they set up their studio in L.A.,
which was their base for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Postwar America was a time of optimism that technology could
lead to a better life, and this mirrored the Eameses' own beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   With new advances in the molding process, the Eameses set out to
create a chair that was not only simple, comfortable and could be
mass-produced _ but which also had a whole new look, almost like a
sculpture. And you could plop yourself down on it.
</P>
<P>
   The chairs were a hit with the public. At the Museum of Modern
Art's 1946 show, ``New Furniture Designed by Charles Eames,'' one
of the chairs was placed in a transparent revolving drum and
allowed to bang about inside, to show its durability.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 came the colorful plastic molded armchair that would
become common in homes, offices and schools. The design was quickly
imitated and is still in use today.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve of 1949, the couple moved into their now-famous
Eames House in Pacific Palisades, which was built from standardized
construction elements found in trade catalogs. The project was
begun shortly after the war, with Charles Eames collaborating with
architect-designer Eero Saarinen.
</P>
<P>
   The steel-and-glass house has been described as Zen-like with
Mondrian colors, but as with the Eameses, it's hard to pin down.
Inside, the Eameses designed the furniture and even the eating
utensils.
</P>
<P>
   After 1955, the couple became involved in making educational
motion pictures, notably the classic ``Powers of Ten'' (1968),
which demonstrates the concept of orders of magnitude by
contrasting views from the Earth's surface with the universe's
edge, then back to an atom.
</P>
<P>
   Their involvement with big business _ corporations like IBM
would sponsor their work _ has been problematic for some critics.
The height of the Eameses' popularity was during the Cold War, so
some see them as emblems and ambassadors of capitalism rather than
as pure artists.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the Eameses banked on institutions that were
out to make a profit to help them with their vision of a
progressive future for the average Joe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, seven years before his death, Charles had second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a more efficient technology, and we got pesticides
in the soil. We wanted cars and television sets and appliances, and
each of us thought he was the only one wanting that. Our dreams
have come true at the expense of Lake Michigan. That doesn't mean
that the dreams were all wrong. It means that there was an error
somewhere in the wish, and we have to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Charles' death, Ray Eames continued to work on various
design projects until her death on Aug. 21, 1988, 10 years to the
day after her husband's.
</P>
<P>
   How much of the Eameses' influence remains? Well, there are
those chairs, of course. Today, some of what they created looks as
quaint and particular to its time as a Model T does to its. But
within the Eameses' colorful designs _ whether for a child's top or
a functional house _ a playful, joyous optimism and inventiveness
is evident.
</P>
<P>
   That spirit of creativity, which future artists will draw from,
is the Eameses' ultimate legacy and will endure even after all
their chairs have become museum pieces. &QL;

<P>
   They were the power couple of modern design, working in their
Los Angeles studio from the 1940s through the '70s to create
furniture and artwork that embraced the technology of their age.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Ray Eames were husband and wife (not brothers, as
some think), and while the handsome Charles was most identified
with their designs, he was quick to point out his wife's
contribution. ``She is equally responsible with me for everything
that goes on here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than marble and oils, the couple turned to the materials
of their day _ plastics, fiberglass and plywood. Rather than a
singular work of art, it was functional furniture for the masses,
with an artistic sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Their ambition was to bring high design into every American
home. Nowhere is that ambition more evident than in those Eames

<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ A late summer morning and the sun was already
harsh on the dusty high school football field. The shirtless blond
19-year-old in shorts stained with sweat kept dropping back to
pass, his hands at times so wet it was hard to grip the ball. He
was throwing to a friend, working ``up the ladder,'' as it is
called, starting with short passes and ending long.
</P>
<P>
   But his mind wasn't totally on his receiver. He could feel the
eyes of the man in the dark glasses who sat in a car on the other
side of a chain-link fence, a hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
   The boy knew the man was watching. It had been subtly arranged.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association does not allow
tryouts, but if a college coach happens by a field where kids
regularly throw the ball around, well, a coach may argue, where's
the harm?
</P>
<P>
   At that time, in July 1996, Southern University, a football
powerhouse among black colleges, desperately needed a quarterback,
and the boy, Marcus Jacoby, badly needed a place to play
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   After half an hour, the man in dark glasses, Mark Orlando,
Southern's offensive coordinator, had seen enough and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   It had gone well. The boy was invited to the coach's apartment,
where after a short visit he was offered a full football
scholarship. The coach explained that the boy had a shot at the
starting job, that the presumed starter had flunked off the team
and that the two remaining backups did not have the coaches'
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds good,'' said Jacoby, who had been a star at Catholic
High, one of Baton Rouge's schoolboy powers. ``But I have to think
about it _ talk with my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Jacoby was unaware that if he accepted the scholarship,
he would be the first white to play quarterback for Southern
University. And he would be the first white ever to start at
quarterback in the 76-year history of the black Southwestern
Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby had grown up in Baton Rouge, and yet he knew practically
nothing about Southern, had never even been to the other side of
town to see the campus. Until that July day, he had spent his life
surrounded by whites.
</P>
<P>
   THE BUSINESS OF HOW TO SUCCEED
</P>
<P>
   In three his years as Southern's head coach, Pete Richardson had
turned a laughingstock of a program into a national force. Southern
won 11 of 12 games his first year, 1993, and two years later it was
the No. 1 black college in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy for a black man to become a head coach. Despite
his record, Richardson, 54, has never had an offer from a Division
I college; only three of those 500 institutions have black head
football coaches. Instead he worked his way around the black
college circuit, serving as an assistant in Texas and Arkansas,
then taking the head coach's job at Winston-Salem State in North
Carolina, and finally, in 1993, getting his big break at Southern,
the largest historically black college in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and Marcus' parents, Glen and Marian Jacoby,
discussed everything from Southern's rich athletic tradition to the
engineering courses that interested Marcus, but for a long while
they didn't mention the thing that worried the parents most. The
quarterback is the team leader. Would a black team accept a white
leader? Would the black campus?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it will be that big a deal,'' said
Richardson. ``Sure, there will be some adjustments from all sides.
But Marcus will have the backing of the administration as well as
the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson pointed out that there were other minorities on
campus. He meant that of the 10,500 students, 5 percent were not
black, but what Mrs. Jacoby kept thinking about was how it would
feel to be in a stadium with her husband and 30,000 black fans.
</P>
<P>
   The coach didn't say it to the Jacobys, but no one knew better
than he about the strain that Marcus would feel being a minority.
As a successful black man, Richardson was used to the stares of
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   When he coached at Winston-Salem, he had a state government car.
``Whites look at you and ask you what you're doing driving the
state's car,'' he said. ``You pull over to get some gas and people
will address you the wrong way or policemen will look at you
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach thought he could make this Jacoby thing work. He
wasn't sitting there fretting whether Marcus could learn to be a
minority. There was no time for that. The first game was six weeks
away. As he would say later, his first-string quarterback had
flunked out and he didn't have ``ample time to find another black
quarterback.'' Marcus would have to do what all good football
players did, what Richardson himself had done: suck it up.
</P>
<P>
   To reassure the Jacobys, the coach told them about his staff. Of
six assistants he had hired when he started in 1993, two were
white, one Asian. He was told that Southern fans would never stand
for that. But after his 11-1 debut season _ the year before they
had been 6-5 _ a popular T-shirt on campus featured a photo of the
integrated staff, with the words ``In Living Color.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning, Richardson knew, often made problems go away. ``I don't
care what color Marcus is,'' Richardson said. ``If I believe he can
help our football team, I want him.''
</P>
<P>
   HARD WORK OR PRIVILEGE?
</P>
<P>
   From the Jacobys' home, in the upper-middle class white Tara
section of Baton Rouge, Southern was a 20-minute car trip,
literally to the other side of the tracks. As Marcus drove to the
first practice, he began imagining himself playing a game, he
recalled. ``Would I see a white face?''
</P>
<P>
   Southern's decision to sign a white quarterback made headlines,
first locally, then nationally, and the reaction of some whites he
knew startled him. When Jacoby called his girlfriend to talk about
it, her mother answered. ``The niggers over there will kill you,''
he recalled her saying. ``There are bullets flying all over the
place. It's a war zone.'' When his girlfriend got on the phone, she
said, ``Marcus, I don't want you to call me again.''
</P>
<P>
   To many on the white side of town, who had never visited this
campus bustling with middle-class black students on the bluffs of
the Mississippi, it was as if Jacoby had voluntarily moved to the
ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern coaches were impressed with Jacoby's arm and had
never seen a quarterback learn Richardson's complex offense so
fast. The other quarterback hopefuls would leave practice at 6, but
Jacoby stayed to do extra throwing and often studied game films
well past midnight. Within days of arriving, he was first-string.
</P>
<P>
   That sparked anger among many of his new black teammates. For
more than a year they had been friendly with the two quarterbacks
now relegated to backup, and they resented the newcomer,
complaining that he had not earned his stripes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several felt the decision was racial. ``It just became the fact
that we were going to have this white quarterback,'' said Sam
George, a quarterback prospect who was academically ineligible that
year. ``It wasn't about ability no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the coaches, Jacoby was isolated. In the locker room,
he recalled, ``I would walk around the corner and people would just
stop talking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day at lunch,'' he said, ``I'd sit down at a table full
of guys without being invited and they would continue their
conversations as if I wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the huddles there was dissension. Scott Cloman, a
Southern receiver, recalled: ``The minute Marcus was like,
`Everybody calm down, just shut up,' they were like: `Who are you
talking to? You're not talking to me.' You know, stuff like that.
If it was a black person it wouldn't be a problem. They all felt
that `I'm not going to let a white person talk to me like that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His entire time at Southern, Jacoby kept his feelings about all
this inside, sucking it up, repeatedly telling the stream of
inquiring reporters what a great experience it was being exposed to
a new culture. ``As soon as I signed and walked onto the campus,''
he said to one interviewer, ``I felt like part of the family. I
definitely feel at home here.''
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL AND STUDENTS IN STEP
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, 1996, six weeks after Jacoby arrived, Southern
opened its season away, at Northwestern State, with him at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Morgan, a supervisor at the local Exxon plant who attended
Southern in the 1960s, is one of many middle-aged black men who
rarely miss a practice, let alone a game. His wife, his mother and
his aunt graduated from Southern, too, as did 25 other relatives.
And now, his son Jabari, a drummer, who had dreamed of being in the
famous Southern band since he was a little boy, was out there
marching for the first time, a freshman living out his fantasy on
that same September day.
</P>
<P>
   Families like the Morgans were fiercely proud of their school
and its role in helping generations of blacks into the middle and
professional classes _ even if the state had long treated it as
second-rate.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern had become the flagship of the nation's largest
historically black public university system, with 15,000 students
on three campuses.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, change was brewing. The year before Jacoby
arrived, Southern and LSU settled a 20-year-old federal
desegregation lawsuit. LSU pledged to double its black enrollment;
Southern pledged to double its nonblack enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni like the Morgans worried. Would Southern soon become just
another satellite campus of LSU? Were black public colleges facing
extinction? Was the white quarterback the beginning of the end?
</P>
<P>
   But Jabari could not have cared less, he was so consumed with
the band. It didn't matter to Jabari if Jacoby was purple, as long
as Southern won and people came to see the halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   A MUTINOUS BEGINNING
</P>
<P>
   Southern lost its first two games. The team was young _ 10 of 11
offensive starters were new _ but what people remembered was the
11-1 record from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   During the second loss, Jacoby recalls, ``I heard the entire
stadium booing me.'' Fans were yelling, ``Get the white boy out!''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Williams, a Southern offensive lineman, believed that the
opposing team hit Jacoby harder because he was white. Cloman
recalled that after one Southern loss, opposing players said,
``That's what you all get for bringing white boys on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby was hit so hard and so often the first game that he was
hospitalized with a concussion. In the school paper, a columnist
wrote about the ``Jacoby nonblocking scandal'': ``Someone should
validate or refute the current rumor that Southern's offensive line
(or some of its members) purposely missed blocks.'' But Jacoby
still believes that it was just the mistakes of an inexperienced
line.
</P>
<P>
   After Southern's second straight loss, an angry fan confronted
Jacoby and threatened him. A coach had to jump between them. For
the rest of his career, Jacoby would have a police escort at games.
</P>
<P>
   WINNING WORKS WONDERS
</P>
<P>
   Southern won six of its next seven games, beating the two
top-ranked black colleges, and was invited to the Heritage Bowl in
Atlanta, the black college championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't getting booed nearly as much,'' Jacoby said. Some
teammates began warming to him. ``Things had changed,'' he said,
``to the extent that some of the players were calling me `the
man.'''
</P>
<P>
   He felt he was developing real friendships with several
teammates and Southern students. When Cloman needed a place to stay
for a month, Jacoby had him to his parents' home and the two grew
close. ``Marcus was the first white person I ever really got to
know,'' recalled Cloman. ``I always felt a lot of tension around
whites. I'd go into a store and I could just feel the tension.
Sometimes you just feel like, `I can't stand white people.' I
didn't understand them. I really didn't want to be near them.
</P>
<P>
   ``His parents treated me like a son,'' said Cloman. Some players
now joked when they saw Cloman, ``Where's your brother?'' ``And
some,'' he said, ``called me `white lover.' Didn't bother me. I had
come to understand the Jacobys. A lot of times people fear what
they can't understand. Because of being around the Jacobys my
attitude toward whites in general changed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Heritage Bowl that first year, on national television,
Southern took a 24-10 halftime lead against Howard University, then
fell behind, 27-24. In the closing minute, Southern drove to
Howard's 15-yard line. On third down, with 42 seconds left, Jacoby
dropped back, and under pressure, threw off the wrong foot,
floating a pass into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the crowd gasp,'' he said. ``I couldn't believe this
was happening.'' He'd been intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dragged myself off the field and sat on a bench and buried
my head in my arms,'' said Jacoby.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby said a few people came by and patted him on the back, to
be encouraging. ``But I heard, `You screwed up real bad this time,
whitey.' And: `You're as dumb as they come.' It was the lowest
point of my life.''

 BATON ROUGE, La.: my life.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Orlando, the defensive coordinator, who is
white, received an anonymous call: ``If Jacoby ever plays for
Southern again, we'll kill him _ and you.'' He said he had been
averaging a threat a week that season. A few weeks later as Orlando
and Jacoby left the locker room and headed to their cars, Orlando
pointed to several trees. Jacoby could see a yellow rope hung from
each tree. The ropes were tied in nooses.
</P>
<P>
   THE EYES OF SOUTHERN ARE UPON HIM
</P>
<P>
   On campus, Jacoby struggled with all the daily irritations that
go with being the minority. As a white who grew up among whites, he
was used to being inconspicuous. Here, he always felt on display.
``I hated that,'' he said, ``because it was like I had become just
a novelty act.''
</P>
<P>
   College is a place where young people are confronted with new
ideas _ sometimes only partially understood _ and encouraged to
speak out about them. And yet Jacoby felt that when he did, he was
criticized. At first, in his African American history class, when
slavery was discussed, he said he tried to be conciliatory. ``I
would say something like, `I kind of feel for you.' And it was
like, `Quit Uncle Tomming.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then he worried he wasn't being true to his white roots. ``I
felt that I had lost my pride and the respect of friends that I had
grown up with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For one oral report, he decided to speak his mind and said that
it was unhealthy for blacks to dwell too much on past racial
violence. ``There have been tragedies like slavery throughout
time,'' he said. ``I don't think one is more important than any
other.'' When he finished, he recalled, ``there was an eerie
silence and I saw at least three or four people glaring at me.''
</P>
<P>
   COMEBACK AND COMPETITION
</P>
<P>
   What got Jacoby through his second year at Southern was a
determination to avenge that Heritage Bowl interception, to show
everyone he could be a champion. He moved through the 1997 season
with a passion.
</P>
<P>
   Again, he was first string, but he had competition. Sam George
had returned from academic probation. George was a popular figure
on campus, known for his hard-partying ways. Though he was only
5'7,'' he had a strong arm and terrific speed. He excited fans with
his scrambling derring-do. ``And,'' said Scott Cloman, ``he was
black.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jacoby started, Richardson liked bringing in George when
the team seemed flat and needed a spark. Both quarterbacks saw race
as the true reason behind Richardson's substitutions. Jacoby was
convinced the coach was giving the black quarterback playing time
in order to pander to black fans; George was convinced Richardson
was starting the white quarterback as part of Southern's promise to
be more diversified.
</P>
<P>
   George wound up playing in 5 of 12 games. By Southern's third
game, against Arkansas Pine-Bluff, both quarterbacks were bitter.
After winning their first two, Southern was losing to Pine-Bluff
7-6 at the half, when Richardson decided to bring in George. Jacoby
was devastated; he felt he was a proven winner and shouldn't be
yanked for one bad half.
</P>
<P>
   George threw a last-ditch 37-yard pass on a scramble play that
tied the game, and threw another touchdown in triple overtime for a
36-33 Southern win.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, come Monday practice, Jacoby was the starter again.
George was frustrated and perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   Southern had a 9-1 record going into its two final games. A win
in the next game _ the Bayou Classic, against archrival Grambling _
would assure a return to the Heritage Bowl and a chance for Jacoby
to redeem himself.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando suggested that if Jacoby played a little more like
George, sometimes scrambling out of the pocket, he might be more
effective. Jacoby felt that he was being told to become something
he was not, but he was so desperate, so worn down and nervous about
being yanked, he followed the coach's advice. He ran as he rarely
had before, and it worked. In a 30-7 win against Grambling, Jacoby
threw three touchdowns and played the entire game. He was named the
Bayou Classic's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   A month later he achieved his football redemption, throwing the
winning touchdown pass in a 34-28 Heritage Bowl victory over South
Carolina State, capping an 11-1 season that earned Southern the
black national championship. ``I was happier than I had ever been
at Southern,'' he recalled. On the trip back from Atlanta he slept
soundly for the first time in months.
</P>
<P>
   THE GOING GETS TOUGH
</P>
<P>
   The more you achieve, the more that's expected. After that 11-1
season, the talk on campus was that Southern would go undefeated in
1998. But in the opener, trailing 7-0 at the half, Jacoby was
pulled for Sam George. Southern lost anyway, 28-7.
</P>
<P>
   In practice on Tuesday, Jacoby overthrew a pass to one of his
ends, John Forman, and Forman yelled at him in front of everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Forman would say later that it was just the frustration of
having lost the opener, but to Jacoby it was so much more, the
final straw. Forman was Sam George's roommate. He was sure Forman
was trying to subvert his control of the team to help George. He
was sure it was race. ``It was like I was right back where I had
started two years before, with a lot of the same attitudes against
me. I felt I had lost the team.''
</P>
<P>
   He quit, football and Southern.
</P>
<P>
   NO MORE APOLOGIES
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was surprised and asked Jacoby to stay. But more
recently, he said, he understood Jacoby's decision. Because of
``the type person he is,'' the coach said, ``it was the best thing
for Marcus because it would have killed him.'' Richardson meant
Jacoby just wasn't emotionally equipped to continue being the
solitary white.
</P>
<P>
   When Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers wanted to break major
league baseball's color line in 1947, he chose Jackie Robinson, not
simply because he was a great black ballplayer _ there were greater
black stars. He knew Robinson had experience inside white
institutions. Robinson was 28 that first year in the majors, a
mature man who had graduated UCLA and served in the U.S. Army.
Jackie Robinson knew what it was like to be the minority.
</P>
<P>
   When Richardson went after Jacoby, he was just looking for a
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters hounded Jacoby to find why he left, but until now, he
has never spoken openly about it. He had never mentioned race. In
brief interviews, he told them he was burned out, and in a sense
this was true. He had burned out on being the minority. And as a
white, he didn't have to be. ``You kind of look over your shoulder
and see your old life and you say, `I could go back.'''
</P>
<P>
   A white quarterback at Southern did make people think. Mo Morgan
had been against it at the start, but after watching Jacoby at
practices, he changed. ``I looked at the three quarterbacks that
were there and he was the best at the time. I'm just telling you
straight out. It wasn't his ability and I'm not saying he was
brighter than the other kids. He just put in the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby moved on to attend LSU, majoring in finance, but his
Southern experience still unsettled him. At times, he talks about
being lucky to have experienced another culture, but at other
moments, he describes it as ``two and a half years of a personal
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he appreciates walking around anonymously on the
mostly-white LSU campus. ``I got burned out as far as being
somebody,'' he said. ``At LSU, I've just enjoyed being a part of
the crowd.''

 &HT;    Strong field for this year's Tour de France
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ The 1999 Tour de France field wasn't
considered strong, given that for the first time in 43 years there
was no defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   A broken arm left 1996 Tour champion Bjarne Riis on the
sidelines. A knee injury wiped out Jan Ullrich, the 1997 champion
and 1998 runner-up. An embarrassing drug controversy knocked out
1998 winner Marco Pantani.
</P>
<P>
   Of the field of 180 riders, only Alex Zulle and Bobby Julich, a
Corpus Christi native, had ever finished on the Tour podium. And
Julich was knocked out of the three-week-long race after he crashed
in the eighth stage, a time trial in Metz in Northen France. His
arm and chest injuries were too severe for him to finish the
remaining 13 stages.
</P>
<P>
   This year's field, however, is strong and will include three
Tour champions, with Ullrich and Pantani joining Austin's Lance
Armstrong, the 1999 victor.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong still is clearly the favorite, but he should be
pressed more than last year when he finished with a 7-minute,
37-second cushion over runner-up Alex Zulle. Armstrong's margin of
victory was the fourth largest posted in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Count on the charasmatic Pantani to yank some of the limelight
from Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian, known as ``Il Pirata'' for his shaven head and
penchant for wearing colorful bandanas, is his country's most
popular athlete, edging Olympic skiing hero Alberto Tomba, and one
of the biggest names in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Pantani also is his country's most controversial athletic
figure.
</P>
<P>
   The problems for the slight 30-year-old came to a climax last
summer, during the Giro d' Italia, the second most glamorous
cycling event after the Tour. Pantani, wearing the race's pink
leader's jersey, held an overwhelming advantage on the next-to-last
day of the Giro. Only something unforeseen could keep him from
repeating as champion.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six hours before the scheduled end of the three-week-long
race, he was suspended after a drug test detected an abnormal level
of red blood cells in his system, indicating the use of the hormone
erythropoiten (EPO), a banned performance enhancing substance.
</P>
<P>
   He then announced he would not defend his 1998 Tour title,
claiming that the route was too flat and not conducive to his
riding style. Pantani's subsequent exile from cycling was a long
and emotionally torturous. During his time away, Pantani crashed
his car three times, broke up with his girlfriend of five years and
had a falling out with his family. He went into hiding in March,
saying that he was suffering from depression.
</P>
<P>
   But he also was secretly training for his sport's big races this
year, although he did not return to competition until the Giro.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly wasn't truly excited about competing until he had
an audience with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican City the day
before the Giro started. Pantani didn't win the Giro, but he did
well in the mountain stages to indicate he would be in excellent
form for France.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've regained Pantani the man. As for Pantani the champion,
we'll see,'' said Felice Gimondi, president of Mercatone, Pantani's
team.
</P>
<P>
   But trouble still is tagging after Pantani.
</P>
<P>
   He faces trial in Italy after being charged with ``sporting
fraud'' in April. Italian judicial officials allege that Pantani,
in at least two instances, used EPO to boost his performance. He
denies the charge. The allegations go back five years, when doctors
discovered that he had an abnormally high level of red blood cells
in his system while he was treated for a broken leg at a hospital
in Turin, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich, the German cycling star, has been plagued by injuries
and weight problems. But he also has been brilliant in the Tour,
sandwiching his victory 1997 at age 23 with runnerup finishes in
1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich, who says he can't resist cream cakes, has been nine
pounds overweight this season, which is not much for the average
person. But the weight gain was debated in cycling circles,
considering that the most elite in the sport have only about 3
percent body fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no further problems with my weight,'' Ullrich told
Kicker, a European sports magazine. ``The matter is closed as far
as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich tuned up for the Tour with a nice performance in the
Tour de Suisse. He led for several stages before giving way in the
rougher, mountainous stages.

<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ A late summer morning and the sun was already
harsh on the dusty high school football field. The shirtless blond
19-year-old in shorts stained with sweat kept dropping back to
pass, his hands at times so wet it was hard to grip the ball. He
was throwing to a friend, working ``up the ladder,'' as it is
called, starting with short passes and ending long.
</P>
<P>
   But his mind wasn't totally on his receiver. He could feel the
eyes of the man in the dark glasses who sat in a car on the other
side of a chain-link fence, a hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
   The boy knew the man was watching. It had been subtly arranged.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association does not allow
tryouts, but if a college coach happens by a field where kids
regularly throw the ball around, well, a coach may argue, where's
the harm?
</P>
<P>
   At that time, in July 1996, Southern University, a football
powerhouse among black colleges, desperately needed a quarterback,
and the boy, Marcus Jacoby, badly needed a place to play
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   After half an hour, the man in dark glasses, Mark Orlando,
Southern's offensive coordinator, had seen enough and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   It had gone well. The boy was invited to the coach's apartment,
where after a short visit he was offered a full football
scholarship. The coach explained that the boy had a shot at the
starting job, that the presumed starter had flunked off the team
and that the two remaining backups did not have the coaches'
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds good,'' said Jacoby, who had been a star at Catholic
High, one of Baton Rouge's schoolboy powers. ``But I have to think
about it _ talk with my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Practice starts in four days,'' the coach responded. ``We're
going to need an answer soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Jacoby was unaware that if he accepted the scholarship,
he would be the first white to play quarterback for Southern
University. And he would be the first white to start at quarterback
in the 76-year history of the black Southwestern Athletic
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby had grown up in Baton Rouge, and yet he knew practically
nothing about Southern, had never even been to the other side of
town to see the campus. Until that July day he had spent his life
surrounded by whites.
</P>
<P>
   THE BUSINESS OF HOW TO SUCCEED
</P>
<P>
   Southern's head coach, Pete Richardson, worked out of a modest
wood-paneled office lined with trophies. In his three years there,
he had turned a laughingstock into a national force. Southern won
11 of 12 games his first year, 1993, and two years later it was the
No. 1 black college in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy for a black man to become a head coach. Despite
his record, Richardson, 54, has never had an offer from a Division
I college; only three of those 500 institutions have black head
football coaches. Instead he worked his way around the black
college circuit, serving as an assistant in Texas and Arkansas,
then taking the head coach's job at Winston-Salem State in North
Carolina, and finally, in 1993, getting his big break at Southern,
the largest historically black college in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get caught up with the thought that, `Hey, why
shouldn't I be at Notre Dame?''' he said in an interview. ``I can't
get sidetracked or go around with a chip on my shoulder.'' He is a
stoical man and expected stoicism from his players.
</P>
<P>
   That day in his office, the Jacobys said, they were impressed by
his quiet intellect, the way he measured his words, his
determination. Indeed, the president of Southern, Dr. Dorothy
Spikes, often said that she had hired Richardson over better-known
candidates not just because his teams had been winners but because
of his reputation for integrity, for running a clean program.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and the Jacobys discussed everything from Southern's
rich athletic tradition to the engineering courses that interested
Marcus, but for a long while they didn't mention the thing that
worried the parents most. The quarterback is team leader. Would a
black team accept a white leader? Would the black campus?
</P>
<P>
   The night before, at the Jacobys' home in the upper-middle-class
white Tara section of Baton Rouge, talk had become heated. ``What
if they don't like Marcus?'' Marian Jacoby had said, tears in her
eyes. ``What if there's some kind of ... action?'' Marcus had not
been able to sleep he was so upset.
</P>
<P>
   Now his father, Glen, an environmental engineer, asked the
coach, ``How are you going to protect my son?''
</P>
<P>
   The room went silent, Glen Jacoby said later. ``I realize that
you're concerned,'' Richardson began, ``but I just don't think it
will be that big a deal. Sure, there will be some adjustments from
all sides. But Marcus will have the backing of the administration
as well as the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson pointed out that there were other minorities on
campus. He meant that of the 10,500 students, 5 percent were not
black, but Jacoby kept thinking about how it would feel to be in a
stadium with her husband and 30,000 black fans.
</P>
<P>
   The coach didn't say it to the Jacobys, but no one knew better
than he about the strain Marcus would feel being in the minority.
As a successful black man Richardson was used to the stares of
surprise. ``Walking into a place with a suit and tie on, you're
always going to get that second look because you're not supposed to
be there.''
</P>
<P>
   When he coached at Winston-Salem, he had a state government car.
``Whites look at you and ask you what you're doing driving the
state's car,'' he said. ``You pull over to get some gas and people
will address you the wrong way or policemen will look at you
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There was something else Richardson didn't say that morning: He
was well aware how hostile Southern's fans could be to any
newcomer, regardless of creed or color. Many had not wanted him
hired. They felt he had come from too small a college; they had
wanted a big name in black college football. They had even used
race on him. Shortly after he arrived, a rumor started that
Richardson's wife, who is light-skinned, was white, and that his
white offensive coordinator was his wife's brother. None of it
true, but Richardson didn't let it get to him. He knew the best
answer was to win, and since he had done so, he was _ as Southern's
registrar, Marvin Allen, liked to point out _ a campus god.
</P>
<P>
   The coach thought he could make this Jacoby thing work. He
wasn't sitting there fretting about whether Marcus could learn to
be part of the minority. The first game was only six weeks away. As
he would say later, he didn't have ``ample time to find another
black quarterback.'' Marcus would have to do what all good players
did, what the coach himself had done: suck it up.
</P>
<P>
   To reassure the Jacobys, the coach told them about his staff. Of
six assistants he had hired when he started in 1993, two were
white, one Asian. He was told Southern fans would never stand for
that. But after his 11-1 debut season _ the year before they had
been 6-5 _ a popular T-shirt on campus featured a photo of the
integrated staff, with the phrase ``In Living Color.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning, he knew, often made problems go away. ``I don't care
what color Marcus is,'' Richardson said. ``If I believe he can help
our football team, I want him.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents wanted to think about it overnight, but Marcus did
not. He climbed into his Jeep, he said later, and went riding. He
was getting his shot, finally. There was nothing he loved like
football. As a boy, when he couldn't find a friend, he tossed
footballs into garbage can lids in his yard. His parents held him
back in ninth grade, so he would have time to grow, and a better
chance to play high school ball. After starring at Catholic, he
went to Louisiana Tech, but there, prospects for playing were dim.
</P>
<P>
   Now he envisioned a game night at Southern with a crowd cheering
as he threw yet another touchdown pass. When he stopped at a red
light, he lifted his head and at the top of his lungs screamed,
``Praise God!''
</P>
<P>
   HARD WORK, OR PRIVILEGE?
</P>
<P>
   From the Jacobys' home, Southern was a 20-minute car trip,
literally to the other side of the tracks. On the ride to the first
practice, as he drove over the Hump _ the small hill that is one of
the barriers between Southern and white Baton Rouge _ the
momentousness of what he had done started sinking in. As he looked
around, he began imagining himself playing a game, he recalled.
``Would I see a white face?''
</P>
<P>
   Southern's decision to sign a white quarterback made headlines,
first locally, then nationally, and the reaction of some whites he
knew startled him.
</P>
<P>
   When Jacoby called his girlfriend to talk about it, her mother
answered. ``The niggers over there will kill you,'' he recalled her
saying. ``There are bullets flying all over the place. It's a war
zone.'' When his girlfriend got on the phone, she said, ``Marcus, I
don't want you to call me again.'' To many on the white side of
town, who had never visited this campus bustling with middle-class
black students on the bluffs of the Mississippi, it was as if
Jacoby had voluntarily moved to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   Like many white Americans, he knew there was still prejudice _
though, he says, not at home. He had been raised to believe that,
after generations of injustice, the country was now a fair place
when it came to race, and he had made a few black friends while
playing high school ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacobys were considered a little eccentric for Baton Rouge,
having moved here from California when Marcus was 3. His paternal
grandfather was Jewish. His mother had attended Berkeley in the
1960s and still had some of the flower child in her. She was a
fitness buff, and had even tried putting her family on a vegetarian
diet, stocking the refrigerator with so many oat products that
Marcus' buddies asked whether they owned a horse. Marcus and his
sister at first attended a private school, but their mother felt
too many children there were spoiled by wealth. So she taught them
at home for five years, until Marcus was a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and teachers at Catholic High remember him as
hard-working, smart and moralistic, with a strong Christian bent.
``We'd make fun of his being so innocent,'' said John Eric
Sullivan, one of his best friends. ``By that I mean, he didn't do
anything that most normal high school kids are doing. He'd be,
`Watch out, watch yourself,' when guys would be drinking. We'd say,
like, `Marc, relax, man.''' He told them he was waiting until he
was 21 to drink.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern coaches were impressed with his arm and had never
seen a quarterback learn Richardson's complex offense so fast.
Jacoby stayed to do extra throwing and often studied game films
well past midnight. Southern at times uses a no-huddle offense,
meaning the quarterback has to call plays rapidly right at the
line, and Richardson felt that of the three candidates, only Marcus
Jacoby knew the system well enough to do that. Within days of
arriving, he was first string.
</P>
<P>
   That sparked anger among many of his new black teammates. For
over a year they had been friendly with the two quarterbacks now
relegated to backup, and they resented the newcomer, complaining
that he had not earned his stripes. ``He was given his stripes,''
said Virgil Smothers, a lineman. ``There was a lingering
bitterness.''
</P>
<P>
   Several felt the decision was racial. ``It just became the fact
that we were going to have this white quarterback,'' said Sam
George, a quarterback prospect who was academically ineligible that
year. ``It wasn't about ability no more.'' Teammates picked at
Jacoby's weaknesses _ he didn't have ``fast feet'' and rarely
scrambled _ and joked that he was the typical bland white athlete,
which angered Richardson. ``A lot of minorities, they want the
flash,'' the coach said. ``We felt we needed a system in order to
be successful and a quarterback to operate within the confines of
that system.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the coaches, he was isolated. In the locker room,
Jacoby recalled, ``I would walk around the corner and people would
just stop talking.''

   Al Gore is leading George W. Bush by a 16-point margin among
Hispanic voters, the fastest-growing minority group in America and
one that could play a pivotal electoral role in some key states,
according to a Knight Ridder Newspapers poll released today.
Despite his lead _ nearly 50 percent to 34 percent nationwide _
Gore is getting far less support among Hispanics than Bill Clinton
got in each of his two presidential races. Some 16 percent of the
Hispanics in his own Democratic Party said they either will vote
for Bush or are leaning toward him. The same poll showed Hillary
Clinton leading Rick Lazio 63-21 percent among Hispanics in the New
York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN COURTING HISPANICS
</P>
<P>
   John McCain asked Hispanic voters to pick George W. Bush for
president, calling his former rival a leader on immigration with
``a well-earned reputation for reaching out to all his
constituents.'' Bush and McCain traded harsh words during their GOP
primary battle last winter, but McCain has said he'll campaign for
Bush now. He praised the Texas governor warmly _ and defended the
Republican Party's record _ in remarks to the League of United
Latin American Citizens in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   527S SHOT DOWN
</P>
<P>
   After a long losing streak, campaign finance reform scored its
biggest success when Congress closed a loophole that had enabled
so-called ``527'' tax-exempt political groups to raise millions of
dollars in secret contributions to influence national races.
President Clinton is expected to sign the bill. Fears that hoards
of secret cash could be deployed in the 2000 election cycle by the
527s _ named for the enabling section of the tax code _ spurred a
bipartisan effort to force them to disclose the source of funds
they use for advertising and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   LABORING FOR THE LABOR VOTE
</P>
<P>
   Republicans descend on Philadelphia in a month to nominate
George W. Bush for president, but some very important Democrats
were paying courtesy calls there this week: Al Gore and House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt several days ago; President Clinton
today. All three were there to speak to the national convention of
the 1.3 million-member American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees union. Clinton urged union workers to get out
the vote for Gore. ``The Republicans have given us the awfulest
mugging over the last 20 years,'' he said. ``And now they're all
acting like we're being mean and negative if we point out what
their positions are.''

<P>
   THE `TEXAS TRUTH SQUAD'
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO launched a series of town hall meetings to educate
members about life in Texas under their governor. ``You're hearing
a lot about what George W. Bush says he would do as president. But
it's time to hear about what he has done as governor of Texas,''
said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. A teacher, a prison guard and
a retired food worker told about 100 union brethren at the first
``Texas Truth Squad'' in Philadelphia that Bush wasted state budget
surpluses on tax cuts instead of spending them on working families.

<P>
   FOREIGN POLICY AT THE BORDER
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, aware he might have to forge relations with a
new ruling party in Mexico, is working hard to stay out of Sunday's
presidential election there. ``If elected, I look forward to
working with whomever the good people of Mexico choose to serve
them as president,'' he said. Bush also offered a carefully crafted
comment about Mexico's reputation as something less than a
full-fledged democracy, a reputation built in part on the fact that
one party has been in control since 1929: ``I believe a free and
fair presidential election in Mexico will be an affirmation of
Mexico's continuing political progress.''
</P>
<P>
   SHADING HITTERS TOWARD RIGHT FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush shifted gears after the primaries and
targeted their appeals to the political middle. But the political
middle these days seems to be a little to the right of center.
Nearly half of all likely voters in a Voter.com-Battleground poll
described themselves as ``somewhat conservative'' and leaned toward
Bush in the race. Gore was doing about as well among those who
described themselves as at least somewhat liberal, but the problem
for Gore is that twice as many of the likely voters in the poll
described themselves as conservative as those who said they are
liberal.

<P>
   MONEY CLOCK RAN OUT ON NADER
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader is seeking an exception to the rule that cuts off
federal matching funds once a candidate is officially nominated for
president. Nader already has received the Green Party's nomination,
but in a letter to the Federal Election Commission, his lawyers
have asked that he continue to receive federal funds through the
end of the Democratic convention in mid-August. This would allow
him to continue to raise money that is matched by the federal
government. Otherwise, Nader no longer would be eligible for
federal funds for his campaign. The request must be acted upon by
the six-member FEC.
</P>
<P>
   OIL GAME BLAME
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party's Ralph Nader asserted that the Clinton-Gore
administration's energy policies had set the stage for higher
gasoline prices this summer by allowing oil company mergers in
recent years. Nader said the administration was doing ``too little,
too late'' about high gasoline prices by having the Federal Trade
Commission investigate possible price gouging. He said a much
broader investigation by the Justice Department and state attorney
generals was warranted. He also called for increasing the nation's
oil reserves and taxing oil companies' profits found to be
excessive.
</P>
<P>
   END RUN FOR ENRON
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, George W. Bush placed a call to his friend Tom
Ridge, the Republican governor of Pennsylvania, to vouch for Enron
Corp., the giant Houston energy and trading company that, at the
time, was battling to sell electricity in Pennsylvania. After a
nasty regulatory fight, Enron cracked into Pennsylvania's market _
and in the ensuing years, Enron and Bush both have seen their
influence widen nationally and internationally. Along the way,
Enron and its executives have been Bush's most generous
contributors, giving more to his various campaigns _ over $550,000,
according to the New York Times _ than any other source.
</P>
<P>
   PASS TAKEN ON ANOTHER EXECUTION
</P>
<P>
   Despite protests from civil rights and Latino advocacy groups,
George W. Bush refused to grant a stay of execution in a death
penalty case laced with charges of racial bias. Jessy San Miguel,
28, was put to death by lethal injection Thursday night, after Bush
declined to grant his request for 30 more days to explore whether
racially tinged remarks biased the jury to sentence him to death
for a brutal 1991 rampage in which four people were shot to death
inside a walk-in freezer during a Taco Bell robbery.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHERS WOULD FLUNK BOTH OF THEM
</P>
<P>
   The nation's teachers give both presidential candidates low
marks for their proposals to fix the nation's most troubled public
schools. Only half agree with Al Gore that underperforming schools
should be shut down and reopened under a new principal, compared to
about seven in ten voters nationally. Teachers are even more firmly
opposed, by a 2-1 ratio, to George W. Bush's plan to give children
in failing schools vouchers to help them move to a private or
religous school. Voters overall are evenly divided on vouchers.
Ninety-one registered voters identified themselves as teachers in
the Washington Post/Kaiser/Harvard poll.
</P>
<P>
   BUT THE REAL ACTORS ARE UNION
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is searching for real people _ or at least
actors who look like them. In a casting notice sent to talent
agents this week, a company representing the campaign said it was
looking for ``a wide range of assorted, real-looking people'' to
appear in spots for George W. Bush that are to be filmed in July.
Describing the spot as a ``nonunion commercial,'' the memo asked
for ``everyday people on the street'' with a ``strong emphasis on
Hispanic and Caucasian.'' The notice was a surprise to officials of
the Screen Actors Guild, which is on strike against the advertising
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ROUGH ROAD FOR RICK
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Rick Lazio's campaign gaffes are mounting _ and
everyone's starting to keep score. The latest stumble was a
high-profile and conspicuously underattended fund-raising bash in
New York. That event adds to the growing list of Lazio lapses:
missing a vote on a critical heating-oil bill, which became ammo
for Hillary Clinton; falling under a corruption cloud for a
suspicious stock option deal; skipping out on the annual Lesbian
and Gay Pride Parade in New York; making remarks offensive to
Native Americans, and driving a gas-guzzling vehicle to an event
about energy prices _ and leaving the engine running as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   COUNTING DOWN TO VEEP TIME
</P>
<P>
   Media attention on vice presidential selections has seemed to
focus more on the Republican side, in part because George W. Bush
is gabbier than Al Gore, his convention is sooner, and he seems to
have more choices. But if Gore is to be taken at his word, he's
under the same time constraints as Bush. He told reporters in late
April that his choice wouldn't be dictated by Bush's choice and
that he expected to make his selection by the time the Republicans
convene at the end of July, even though the Democratic convention
is two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   WEB VEEP BUZZ: KEATING
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating has become the name-of-the-moment as
a potential running mate for George W. Bush. Keating's name
surfaced in Internet reports as the current favorite, albeit with
caveats saying everything could change. The Bush campaign took the
news in stride. ``It's not true. The governor has made no
decision,'' spokesman Ari Fleischer told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   TIPPER: LET HUBBY PICK JUSTICES
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court's stuck down Nebraska's ``partial
birth'' abortion ban 5-4, Tipper Gore said her husband would
protect a woman's right to end a pregnancy and urged women
supporters to help elect him. ``Take a look at what the Supreme
Court did yesterday and realize how thin, thin, our margin of
support is,'' she said at a ``Women for Gore'' reception in
Washington. ``The next president is definitely going to be able to
change the Supreme Court for the next 30 years'' she said.

<P>
   IMPENDING PROTESTS CAUSE WORRY
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after voting to set aside Pershing Square in
downtown Los Angeles as a gathering place for protesters at the
Democratic National Convention in mid-August, the Los Angeles City
Council is reconsidering the move under pressure from the police
and merchants' groups worried about violence or disruptions at
convention hotels and the jewelry mart near the square. The police
now propose putting demonstrators in a fenced-off parking lot near
the convention site.

 BATON ROUGE, La.: stop talking.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in the huddles there was dissension. Scott Cloman, a
Southern receiver, recalled: ``The minute Marcus was like,
`Everybody calm down, just shut up,' they were like: `Who are you
talking to? You're not talking to me.' You know, stuff like that.
If it was a black person it wouldn't be a problem. They all felt
that `I'm not going to let a white person talk to me like that.'''
</P>
<P>
   His entire time at Southern, Jacoby kept his feelings about all
this inside, ``sucking it up,'' repeatedly telling the inquiring
reporters what a great experience it was being exposed to a new
culture. ``As soon as I signed and walked onto the campus,'' he
told one interviewer, ``I felt like part of the family. I
definitely feel at home here.''
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL AND STUDENTS IN STEP
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, 1996, Southern opened at Northwestern State, with
Marcus Jacoby at quarterback. Of the 25,000 spectators, half had
made the three-hour trip from Southern, not unusual for this
football-crazy place. ``Fans plan their lives around games,''
Richardson said. ``They fight to get schedules, to see where we're
going to play so they can take holidays and go to games.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern University families like the Morgans will take more
than 20 people to an away game, filling several hotel rooms. Mo
Morgan, a supervisor at the local Exxon plant who attended Southern
in the 1960s, went so far as to buy a motor home just for Southern
football, which made him the object of good-natured ribbing.
Friends insisted that ``black people don't drive Winnebagos.'' His
wife, Wanda, and about 25 of their relatives are Southern
graduates, and his youngest son, Jabari, a freshman drummer and
cymbals player, was on the field for that same opening game.
</P>
<P>
   For the youngest Morgan, the band was only partly about music.
More famous than Southern's football team _ having performed at
five Super Bowls and three presidential inaugurations _ it had real
power and importance on campus. The 180-piece Southern band thrived
on intimidating lesser rivals on the black college circuit. With
its hard-brass sound and its assertive style, the group had a
militant edge that old-timers on campus attributed to the influence
of the civil rights era, when the band's show was honed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gray, who played cymbals with Morgan, said: ``When people
think about Southern band, they think about a bunch of big,
tough-looking, tight-looking dudes with psychotic looks on their
faces, ready to go to war. I just think _ Southern band _ black,
all male, just rowdy, loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Families like the Morgans were fiercely proud of their school
and its role in helping generations of blacks into the middle and
professional classes _ even if the state had long treated it as
second-rate. In the early 1900s, legislators planning to create a
new campus for Southern considered several locations around
Louisiana. But in city after city, white residents rose in protest,
and finally the state settled on a site that no one else then
coveted. In the 1950s, blacks like Audrey Nabor-Jackson, Wanda
Morgan's aunt, were prohibited from attending the big white public
campus across town, Louisiana State University. Southern was their
only alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Even as late as the 1970s, Louisiana's public higher education
system was capable of inflicting deep racial wounds. Wanda Morgan
was required to take several courses at LSU as part of a master's
program at Southern. In one class, she was one of four blacks, and
for every exam, she said, the four were removed by the professor
and put in an empty classroom across the hall, one in each corner,
while the white students took the exam in their regular seats. The
message was missed by no one: Black students would cheat.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, change was brewing. The year before Jacoby
arrived, Southern and LSU settled a 20-year-old federal
desegregation lawsuit. Both institutions pledged sharp minority
increases on their campuses, with 10 percent of enrollment set
aside for other races _ more whites to Southern, more blacks to LSU
</P>
<P>
   Alumni like the Morgans were worried. Would Southern soon become
just another satellite campus of LSU? Was the white quarterback the
beginning of the end?
</P>
<P>
   Mo Morgan and Audrey Nabor-Jackson agreed with an editorial in
Southern's student paper saying that a white quarterback did not
belong. ``There are plenty of young black athletes,'' it said,
``who could benefit from Jacoby's scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo Morgan said, ``I didn't like the fact that he was there.''
About the only Morgan not upset was Jabari. Mo Morgan worried that
his 18-year-old son was not race-conscious enough. ``I came through
the movement, I was confronted with things,'' said the father.
``That's one of the things that concerns me _ that he hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jabari Morgan couldn't have cared less, he was so consumed
with the band. Long before starting college, he had begun
assembling on his bedroom wall what he called his shrine, a montage
about the Southern band that included a picture of the first white
band member, in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in his freshman year, his long-nurtured fantasy was coming
true. Standing there that day with cymbals weighing nine pounds
each, ready to march into Northwestern State's stadium, he was at
the front of the band. The director, Dr. Isaac Greggs, always
positioned his tallest and most imposing players _ his ``towers of
terror'' _ at the front, and Jabari Morgan, at 6 foot 1, was one of
them. Football, he said, was about the last thing on this mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like winning the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't have cared if Marcus Jacoby were purple, as long as
Southern won and people stayed in their seats for the halftime
show.
</P>
<P>
   A MUTINOUS BEGINNING  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Southern lost its first two games. The team was young _ 10 of 11
offensive starters were new _ but what people remembered was the
11-1 record the year before.
</P>
<P>
   For fans, the quarterback, more than any other player, is the
team _ hero or goat. During the second loss, Jacoby recalled, ``I
heard the entire stadium booing me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Harrison, the mother of the quarterback prospect Sam
George, remembered, ``One lady had a megaphone and she was
screaming, `Get that white honky out of there!'''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Williams, an offensive lineman, believed that the other
team hit Jacoby harder because he was white: ``Teams took cheap
shots at him. I really believe that. I mean they hit him sometimes
blatantly late after the whistle.''

 BATON ROUGE, La.: the whistle.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Cloman recalled that after one Southern loss, opposing
players said, ``That's what you all get for bringing white boys on
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby was hit so hard and so often during the first game that
he was hospitalized with a concussion. Glen Jacoby, Marcus' father,
was sure the blockers were sandbagging their white quarterback, but
in interviews at the time, the young man denied it. He still says
he believes that it was just the mistakes of an inexperienced line.
</P>
<P>
   After Southern's second loss, an angry fan threatened Jacoby. A
coach had to jump between them. For the rest of his career, Jacoby
would have a police escort at games. There was a disturbance
outside the stadium at another game. Gunshots were fired. Jacoby
recalls thinking the shots were aimed at him.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday after the second loss, Jacoby rose at 5 a.m., worked
out in the weight room, then walked to the cafeteria for the team
breakfast. No one was there. He checked his watch. Shortly after he
sat down, Orlando came in, took him by the arm and led him through
a nearby door.
</P>
<P>
   As Jacoby remembered it, the entire team and coaching staff sat
squeezed into a small room. All chairs were taken, so he stood
alone against a wall. No one looked at him. Richardson stood. ``I
think Marcus should know what's going on,'' he said, adding, ``Who
wants to say something?''
</P>
<P>
   Smothers, the senior defensive end, rose. The night before, he
had talked about staging a strike. Now he mentioned some minor
gripes, then added: ``We're losing and we feel changes ought to be
made. Some guys aren't getting a fair chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone else said, ``Guys are playing who shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando walked to the front. As offensive coordinator, he
naturally worked closely with the quarterback. But several players
felt he favored Jacoby because they were both white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get this in the open,'' Orlando said, adding, ``This is
mostly about Jacoby, isn't it?'' Insisting that the quarterback had
been chosen fairly, he said: ``You have to accept Marcus, he's one
of us. We're 0 and 2, but we have to put this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Hayes, who had lost the quarterback job to Jacoby,
interrupted Orlando. ``You're just saying that,'' Hayes said,
``because you're Jacoby's Dad.'' It got a laugh, though his tone
was angry. Jacoby said later: ``There was a lot of hate in that
room. I felt like I was falling into a hole, and I couldn't grab
the sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson spoke again: ``We win as a team, we lose as a team.
Jacoby's doing what he's supposed to be doing, and he'll get
better. We all will.'' He said practice would be at 3. ``If anyone
doesn't want to be on the team with Jacoby as the starting
quarterback, don't come.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson remembered: ``What I saw was a frustration by some
players _ mostly seniors _ who weren't playing. They weren't
playing because they didn't deserve to. And so they needed a
scapegoat.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby remembers feeling like the invisible man. ``It was almost
as though I weren't there, and they were talking about me,'' he
said. ``I wasn't sure where to turn. I felt they didn't want me
there _ not me personally, but any white quarterback _ that I was
just another problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Three or four players didn't show up for practice, and
Richardson cut them. Not long afterward, Virgil Smothers and one of
the coaches argued, and Smothers was told, ``Clear out your
locker.''
</P>
<P>
   When the players gathered the next day at practice, before the
coaches arrived, Jacoby said, he stood to talk. A few tried to
shout him down, but John Williams, a star senior cornerback and
devout Christian who would go on to play for the Baltimore Ravens,
rose and said, ``Man, let the man talk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if you like me or hate me,'' Jacoby recalled
saying. ``All I ask is that we can go out and play football
together. This is not a popularity contest. I'm trying to win. I'm
just trying to be your quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   WINNING WORKS WONDERS
</P>
<P>
   Things improved dramatically. Southern won six of its next seven
games, beating the two top-ranked black colleges, and was invited
to the Heritage Bowl in Atlanta, the black college championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't getting booed nearly as much,'' Jacoby said. Some
teammates began warming to him. More than anything, they were
impressed by his work ethic. During a practice break, players drank
from a garden hose. ``Sorry, Marcus,'' one teased, ``this is the
black water fountain.'' They called him ``Tyrone,'' and
``Rasheed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciated it,'' he recalled. ``Things had changed to the
extent that some of the players were calling me `the man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before games, he and John Williams prayed together. One Sunday
the two went to the black church where Williams was a minister.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally strangers would wish Jacoby well. One day the
band's legendary director, Greggs, greeted him warmly and urged him
to persevere.
</P>
<P>
   He felt he was developing real friendships with teammates and
Southern students. When Scott Cloman needed a place to stay for a
month, Jacoby had him to his parents' home and the two grew close.
``Marcus was the first white person I ever really got to know,''
Cloman said. ``I always felt a lot of tension around whites. I'd go
into a store and I could just feel the tension. Sometimes you just
feel like, `I can't stand white people.' I didn't understand them.
I really didn't want to be near them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His parents treated me like a son,'' added Cloman. Some
players now joked when they saw him, ``Where's your brother?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And some,'' he said, ``called me `white lover.' Didn't bother
me. I had come to understand the Jacobys. A lot of times people
fear what they can't understand. Because of being around the
Jacobys my attitude toward whites in general changed.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION
</P>
<P>
   At the Heritage Bowl that first year, on national television,
Southern took a 24-10 halftime lead against Howard University, then
fell behind, 27-24. In the closing minute, Southern drove to
Howard's 15-yard line. On third down, with 42 seconds left, Marcus
Jacoby dropped back and, under pressure, threw off the wrong foot,
floating a pass into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the crowd gasp,'' he said. ``I couldn't believe this
was happening.'' He'd been intercepted. ``Their fans must have
cheered, but I remember everything being silent.'' A camera
captured Richardson on his knees, hands over his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dragged myself off the field and sat on a bench and buried
my head in my arms,'' Jacoby said. ``A few people, like John
Williams, came by and patted me on the back, to be encouraging. But
I heard, `You screwed up real bad this time, whitey,' and, `You're
as dumb as they come.' It was the lowest point of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Orlando received an anonymous call: ``If Jacoby
ever plays for Southern again, we'll kill him _ and you.'' The
coach said he averaged a threat a week that season. Later, as
Orlando and Jacoby headed to their cars, the coach pointed to
several trees. In the light of the street lamps, Jacoby could see a
yellow rope hung from each tree. The ropes were tied in nooses.
</P>
<P>
   THE EYES OF SOUTHERN ARE UPON HIM
</P>
<P>
   On campus, Jacoby struggled with all the daily irritations that
go with being in the minority. As a white who grew up among whites,
he was used to being inconspicuous. Here, he always felt on
display. ``I hated that,'' he said, ``because it was like I had
become just a novelty act.''
</P>
<P>
   He found that things he had done unconsciously all his life were
suddenly brought to his attention and analyzed. One was the way he
dressed. He liked to wear a T-shirt, shorts and flip-flops to
class; most students at Southern dressed up for class in slacks.
</P>
<P>
   Another was that the way he spoke, his slang, was different from
the black majority's. ``Many times I would say something at
Southern and they would repeat it and I wouldn't get my point
across,'' he said. ``It would get lost in the mocking of how I said
it instead of what I said. I might walk into a room and I'd say,
`Hey, how y'all doin'?''' Instead of answering, someone would do an
imitation of a white person talking, enunciating slowly. ``They'd
say `Hi, guy, how are you doing?' So I just learned to say,
`Hey.''' He believed the classmates were only needling him, but
being constantly reminded was exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's eyes were on him,'' said Chris Williams, a teammate.
``He just didn't blend in. I mean, like me, I just blended in
wherever I went.''
</P>
<P>
   A white with a different personality might have fared better.
There was one other white on the 70-man squad, Matt Bushart. And
though as a punter he was at the periphery of the team and little
noticed by fans, Bushart had the personality and experience to cope
better as a minority.
</P>
<P>
   While Marcus had seemed protected and naive even to the
middle-class white students at Catholic High, Matt's years at a
local public high school where most of his football teammates were
black had taught him how to live comfortably among them. While
Marcus was more introspective, a loner, a little too sensitive for
some of his coaches' tastes, Matt was noisy, funny, sometimes crude
_ so outgoing, his girlfriend said, that he could talk to a wall.
</P>
<P>
   When Bushart's teammates made fun of the country music he liked,
he gave it right back to them about their rap, and kept listening
to his music. ``I get kidded about it,'' he said, ``but there's
been a song that's been playing and one of the black guys will come
by and say, `Play that again, that's actually not too bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby loved music, too; playing guitar was an important outlet
for relieving the pressure, but he would not play on campus. As he
put it: ``At times the rap just blared from the dorms; I longed for
something that was my own. I couldn't play it on campus because for
most of the time, I was apologizing for who I was. I didn't want to
cause any more turmoil than there was. I didn't want to make myself
look like I was any more separate than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Interracial dating is complicated at Southern. Ryan Lewis,
Jacoby's roommate, says most black men would not openly date a
white woman on campus. ``They would keep it low so nobody knew
about it but them,'' Lewis said. ``I've never seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   As quarterback, Jacoby often had female students flirting with
him. He felt uneasy, caught between the white and black sides of
town. Among whites, he said, ``everybody just assumed the worst,
that I was dating a black girl now because I was at Southern.'' But
even though there were some ``gorgeous light-skinned black girls
over there,'' he said, and a couple of women from his classes
became good friends, he wasn't attracted. He thinks it was ``a
cultural thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though college students are confronted with new ideas _
sometimes only partially understood _ and encouraged to speak out
about them, Jacoby felt that when he did, he was criticized. At
first, in his African-American history class, when they discussed
slavery, he said he tried to be conciliatory in an oral report. ``I
would say something like, `I can't imagine how terrible it must
have been, that people could do those kinds of things to other
people.' And others in the class made some kind of jokes, but it
was like bitter jokes: `What are you talking about, Marcus? You're
one of those whites.' It was like they were saying to me, `Quit
Uncle Tomming.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then he worried he wasn't being true to his white roots. ``I
felt that I had lost my pride and the respect of friends that I had
grown up with,'' he said. For his next oral report, he decided to
speak his mind and said that it was unhealthy for blacks to dwell
too much on past racial violence. ``There have been tragedies like
slavery throughout time,'' he said. ``I don't think one is more
important than any other.'' When he finished, he recalled, ``there
was an eerie silence and I saw at least three or four people
glaring at me.''

 BATON ROUGE, La.: at me.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, being in the minority alienated him, made him feel
alone. ``I learned early on that I was a pioneer in all this and no
one else had gone through it and often the best advice I could get
was from myself. Because I was the only one who knew the whole
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that his preoccupied parents were going through a
divorce. At one point when he was upset about not fitting in, his
mother gave him a copy of ``Black Like Me,'' the story of a white
man in the 1960s who dyes his skin and travels the South to
experience being black during segregation. At the time, Jacoby
said, ``I resented my mother giving me the book. I felt she was
almost taking the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   ONE FITS, THE OTHER DOESN'T
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, of course, are much better at being in the minority,
since they have far more practice and, usually, no choice. When
Jabari Morgan was considering colleges, his father told him he was
free to pick Southern or a ``white'' college, but if he picked
white, he had better be prepared. Then he gave him the talk about
being in the minority that so many black American men give their
sons. ``You are going to face being called a nigger,'' Mo Morgan
told Jabari. ``Now, are you ready to deal with it? If you're not
ready to deal with it, don't go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Morgans have a family council of elders that meets regularly
to guide their young, and one message emphasized is this: ``A black
person in America has to be smarter and sharper and work harder to
achieve the same things as a white person of the same abilities.''
Mo Morgan says, as a minority, he understands that ``the majority
is white, and  &UR; you &LR;  have control and  &UR; you &LR;  want to keep control.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jabari Morgan did not think like his father.
</P>
<P>
   He had always dreamed of attending Southern, but for him its
great appeal was not as a racial sanctuary. He considered race
simply part of the rough and tumble of life, the cost of doing
business in a mostly white world. Southern was the place where he
might be able to play in the best marching band in America, as his
father had before him.
</P>
<P>
   He determined very early that the best high school marching
bands, like the best college bands, were black, and so he fudged
his address in order to attend a nearly all-black Baton Rouge
school where the band rocked. He figured that that would give him
an edge when he tried out at Southern.
</P>
<P>
   As a marketing major who graduated in May, Morgan fully expects
that he will one day work for a big white-controlled corporation.
But as a marching band member at Southern for four years, he was in
many ways the ultimate insider in the self-contained black-majority
culture of the Yard, as Southern's campus is known.
</P>
<P>
   All the things that Marcus Jacoby found so irritating were
second nature to Jabari Morgan _ the music, the dress, the
vernacular of put-downs and nicknames that is the campus currency.
He loved African-American literature class because the poetry and
stories reinforced what his family had taught him about black
history.
</P>
<P>
   Like all new band members, Morgan went through hazing. But as
part of the majority, he never worried that it was about race.
Jacoby, on the other hand, felt so unsettled as part of the
minority that he often had trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan eventually joined a fraternity _ a support in its own way
as strong as the band's.
</P>
<P>
   And, where Marcus Jacoby the minority had no steady girlfriend
during his years at Southern, Jabari Morgan the majority began, in
his second semester, dating Monique Molizone, an economics major
from New Orleans. She had also come to Southern partly for the band
_ to join the Dancing Dolls, who perform at the band's side.
</P>
<P>
   COMEBACK AND COMPETITION
</P>
<P>
   As much as anything, what got Jacoby through his second year at
Southern was a determination to avenge that Heritage Bowl
interception, to show everyone he could be a champion. He moved
through the 1997 season with a passion, working so hard in the
weight room that he could now bench-press 350 pounds; running
endless drills to improve his foot speed; and doing so much extra
throwing that by day's end it took an hour to ice and treat his
arm.
</P>
<P>
   Again, he was first string, but he had competition. Sam George
had returned from academic probation. George was a popular figure
on campus, known for his hard-partying ways. Though he was only 5
foot 7, he had a strong arm and terrific speed. His teammates,
responding to his take-charge style in huddles, nicknamed him the
Little General. ``And,'' Scott Cloman said, ``he was black.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jacoby started, Richardson liked bringing in George
when the team seemed flat. Both quarterbacks saw race as the true
reason behind the coach's substitutions. Jacoby was convinced that
Richardson was giving the black quarterback playing time to pander
to the black fans; George was convinced that Richardson _
influenced by Orlando _ was starting the white quarterback because
of favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   George wound up playing in 5 of 12 games. By Southern's third
game, against Arkansas-Pine Bluff, both quarterbacks were bitter.
After winning its first two games, Southern was losing to Pine
Bluff 7-6 at the half. Richardson decided to replace the white
quarterback with the black. Jacoby was devastated; he felt he was a
proven winner and should not be yanked for one bad half.
</P>
<P>
   Given his chance, George threw a last-ditch 37-yard pass that
tied the game, and threw another touchdown in triple overtime for a
36-33 Southern win.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, come Monday practice, Jacoby was the starter again. Now
George was frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Southern had a 9-1 record going into its two final games. A
victory in the next game _ the Bayou Classic, against Grambling,
its archrival _ would assure a return to the Heritage Bowl and a
chance for Jacoby to redeem himself. His parents and teammates had
never seen him so obsessed. He had trouble sleeping and little
appetite. His father called Orlando, worried that Marcus' weight
was down.
</P>
<P>
   In a journal account of that period, Marcus Jacoby wrote: ``I
sat down and wrote out a detailed plan of how I was going to get
through these last two games, including my political and
motivational moves. My survival as a person depended on these last
two games. Nobody, including Orlando, knew the amount of outside
forces that were pressing on these last two games. I was at a point
where I felt that I was crawling on my knees.''

 BATON ROUGE, La.: my knees.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I dreamed of a time when I could just say that I had
accomplished something, instead of fighting for respect, fighting
in a classroom full of people who disagreed with everything I stood
for, and could have a day of true rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the big game against Grambling, he pleaded with Orlando.
``If you don't pull me,'' Jacoby said, ``I guarantee we'll win our
next two games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't guarantee that,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just did,'' Jacoby said. Orlando suggested that if Marcus
Jacoby played a little more like Sam George, sometimes scrambling
out of the pocket, he might be more effective. Jacoby felt that he
was being told to become something he was not, but he was so
desperate, so nervous about being yanked, that he followed the
advice. He ran, and it worked. In a 30-7 win against Grambling,
Jacoby threw three touchdown passes and played the entire game. He
was named the Bayou Classic's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   A month later he achieved his redemption, throwing the winning
pass in a 34-28 Heritage Bowl victory over South Carolina State,
capping an 11-1 season that earned Southern the black national
championship. ``I was happier than I had ever been at Southern,''
he recalled. On the trip back from that game he slept soundly for
the first time in months.
</P>
<P>
   THE GOING GETS TOO TOUGH  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The more you achieve, the more is expected. After that 11-1
season, the talk on campus was that Southern would go undefeated in
1998. But in the opener, with the team trailing 7-0 at the half,
Jacoby was pulled for George. Southern lost anyway, 28-7.
</P>
<P>
   In practice on Tuesday, Jacoby overthrew a pass to one of his
ends, John Forman, who yelled at him in front of everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Forman would say later that it was just the frustration of
having lost the opener, but to Jacoby it was so much more _ the
final straw. He was sure that Forman was trying to subvert his
control of the team to help George, his roommate. ``If you have a
choice, you choose black first,'' Jacoby would later say. ``I felt
that I was all alone again, on an island by myself. It was like I
was right back where I had started two years before, with a lot of
the same attitudes against me.''
</P>
<P>
   He quit football and Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was surprised and asked Jacoby to stay. But more
recently, he said he understood the decision. Because of ``the type
person he is,'' the coach said, ``it was the best thing for Marcus
because it would have killed him.'' The coach meant that Marcus
Jacoby was not emotionally equipped to continue being the solitary
white.
</P>
<P>
   When Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers wanted to break major
league baseball's color line in 1947, he chose Jackie Robinson, not
simply because he was a great black ballplayer _ there were greater
black stars _ but because he had experience inside white
institutions. Jackie Robinson was 28 that first year in the majors,
a mature man who had graduated from UCLA and served in the Army. He
knew what it was like to be in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   When Richardson went after Jacoby, he was just looking for a
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters hounded Jacoby to find why he had left, but he never
spoke openly about it. He never mentioned race. In brief
interviews, he told them he was burned out, and in a sense this was
true. He had burned out on being in the minority. And as a white,
he didn't have to be. In those last months at Southern, he often
thought about returning to a white life. ``You kind of look over
your shoulder and see your old life and you say, `I could go
back.'''
</P>
<P>
   There had been such anguish over the Jacoby-George quarterback
battle, and all its racial nuances, but at least on the field, in
the end, it didn't seem to make much difference. That year
Southern, with Sam George at the helm, finished 9-3, once again
winning the Heritage Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   A white quarterback at Southern did make people think. Mo Morgan
had been against it, but not after watching Jacoby at practices.
``I looked at the three quarterbacks that were there and he was the
best at the time. I'm just telling you straight out. It wasn't his
ability and I'm not saying he was brighter than the other kids. He
just put in the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's son Jabari said he, too, was sorry to see Jacoby go; he
liked the idea of a white guy being open to attending a black
college.
</P>
<P>
   This past year, as a senior, Jabari Morgan reached out to a
white freshman tuba player, Grant Milliken, who tried out for the
band. He helped him through the hazing. One of Morgan's friends
said he had done it because Milliken was white, but Morgan said no,
he had done it because Milliken was really good on tuba.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan even helped Milliken create a tuba dance solo full of
shakes and shivers and fancy steps, which was performed at
halftimes to wild applause. What the crowd loved, said Morgan, was
not just that a white guy could dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of letting the white guy dance is that we were
saying to the world, `Hey, you can learn our culture just like we
can learn yours.'''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's father continues to be both fearful of his son's more
relaxed attitude about race, and a little in awe of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't think it's something he can't overcome,'' said Mo
Morgan, ``and you know, I think he's right. You can get caught up
in this, and it will screw up your thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   NO MORE APOLOGIES
</P>
<P>
   One weekend last fall, at the request of a reporter, Jacoby went
to a Southern game for the first time since quitting. This was
Homecoming Day, and from his seat in the stands he watched Southern
seniors and their families being introduced to the crowd at
midfield. It could have been his moment. Ryan Lewis, his old
roommate, was there, and so was Matt Bushart, the white punter.
</P>
<P>
   Bushart's name was called, to applause. Jacoby had read in the
newspaper Bushart's saying how much he had enjoyed Southern.
</P>
<P>
   The team had won seven straight games at that point, and so
Jacoby was surprised during the first quarter when Southern's
starting quarterback was replaced after throwing an interception.
Jacoby had always been so sure he'd been replaced with Sam George
to pander to fans; now Richardson was using the exact same strategy
with two black quarterbacks. In the paper the next day, Richardson
said he had just been trying to light a spark under the offense.

 BATON ROUGE, La.: the offense.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the game, outside the stadium, a large black man spotted
Jacoby and, extending his hand, said, ``Hi, Marcus, how ya doin'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Virgil,'' Jacoby said. ``How you doin'?'' The two chatted
for a moment outside the stadium _ the man said he had left school
and was working as an account executive for a drug company _ then
they went their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Virgil Smothers,'' Jacoby said afterward. It was
Smothers who had led the aborted strike against Jacoby. ``I guess
he figures it's all in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not all in Jacoby's past. Though he had moved on _ he was
now majoring in finance at LSU _ his Southern experience still
unsettled him. ``Just last night I had a dream about it,'' he said.
``Weird dreams. Like some of these people are coming back to haunt
me in some way. By these people I mean some of those who I
considered friends and who I felt kind of turned on me.''
</P>
<P>
   At times he talks about being lucky to have experienced another
culture; at others he describes it as ``a personal hell.'' His
sister Dana says, ``There are some scars that haven't gone away,
from the bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Southern, Jacoby took a while to realize how much
pressure he had felt. ``I remember one time a few months after I
quit _ and this was part of the healing process _ I said something
about country music, that I liked it. And I remember standing
around with four white people and thinking, `Oh, my God, I can't
believe I just said that.' And then I caught myself right before I
got through that whole thing in my mind and I looked at the
people's faces and they were agreeing with me. I went `Whoa,' I
didn't have to apologize for that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he appreciates walking around anonymously on the
mostly white LSU campus. ``I got burned out as far as being
somebody,'' he said. ``At LSU, I've just enjoyed being a part of
the crowd.''

&HT;     COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FOR DOCTORS FACES GRIM PROGNOSIS

   WASHINGTON _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Friday he
would not support a House-approved collective-bargaining bill for
doctors, all but dooming the legislation that would give physicians
more power over cost-cutting health insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which passed the House 276-136 early Friday,
would give health care professionals the same rights enjoyed by
union workers to negotiate with insurers and managed care companies
over fees and services.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dismissal by Lott, the lopsided House vote was a
political boost for Rep. Tom Campbell, the Republican sponsor of
the bill who is waging an uphill battle for Senate in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm elated,'' Campbell said Friday. ``I believe that improving
the way Americans receive their health care is a cause worth
fighting for. . . . Medical professionals should be allowed to
provide care for their patients as they think best and today
Congress empowered them to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care companies have fought Campbell's legislation,
saying it would lead to billions of dollars in escalating medical
costs and too much clout for physicians, while the American Medical
Association has said doctors need to be empowered to fight managed
care providers to improve patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Campbell's effort to address voter concern that cost
cutting by health plans is compromising patient care, Lott's
prognosis for the measure was grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I would support at all,'' Lott, R-Miss.,
told a news conference. ``I just don't think that is something we
should be moving toward. I don't think we need more lawsuits in
America and I don't think we need more labor unions and that's
basically what they are trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Lott's quick rejection of the bill was not
surprising, given Campbell's low standing in the polls against Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might have been a little more diplomatic about it if he
thought Campbell had a good chance of winning,'' said Jack Pitney,
a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in
Claremont, Calif. ``You don't want to alienate your members before
they even take the oath.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Field Poll showed Feinstein leading Campbell 58 to 32
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lott nor House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., likes
the substance of the Campbell measure. Both leaders have been
inclined to side more readily with managed care companies than
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert prevented Campbell's bill from coming up for a vote for
months, until Campbell held a news conference in which he attacked
the speaker for filching on two promises to allow a vote on the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the leaders has a real material incentive to be overly
deferential to Tom Campbell,'' Pitney said. ``He's leaving the
House, so he won't be a factor in the House next year, and he is a
long shot to being in the Senate. The most likely place where Tom
Campbell is going to be a powerhouse next year is the campus of
Stanford University.''
</P>
<P>
   If he loses the Senate race, Campbell is expected to return to
teach law at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, a Washington think tank, said most Republicans ``can't
stand the idea'' of doctors with union rights and fear the
implications of moving in the direction of collective bargaining
for professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans don't want this kind of hassle coming forward,''
Ornstein said. ``I wouldn't be surprised to find that Lott and
other Republicans might have talked to Campbell to try and persuade
him to back off from his position, which is not going to happen
with Tom Campbell.''
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell spokeswoman Jackie Corcoran said she did not view
Lott's rejection of the legislation as a slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been down a difficult road before in the House,''
Corcoran said. ``We were able to get a vote before and we were able
to get a bill. I don't see how this is any different.''
</P>
<P>
   When Campbell was unable to get a House vote, he accused fellow
Republicans of delaying a vote so they could continue ``milking''
money from both physicians and insurance plans _ in the form of
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's legislation would not allow physicians to strike and
the collective-bargaining law would expire after three years.

FDA APPROVES TAMOXIFEN TO HELP LOWER RISK OF INVASIVE BREAST
CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The drug tamoxifen, already widely prescribed to treat breast
cancer and to help prevent it in women at high risk for the
disease, received approval from the Food and Drug Administration on
Thursday for another use: to lower the risk of invasive breast
cancer in women who have had surgery and radiation for ductal
carcinoma in situ, often referred to as DCIS or intraductal
carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   A five-year course of the drug will be recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen, also called Nolvadex, is the first drug approved to
treat intraductal carcinoma, which is a very early form of breast
cancer that is still confined to the cells lining the milk ducts.
It is noninvasive, meaning that it has not spread to other tissue
in the breast, or to lymph nodes or other parts of the body. The
tumors are usually too small to feel, and most are detected by
mammography.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 40,000 cases of intraductal breast cancer a year
in the United States. They are not counted as part of the 180,000
cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed yearly. The number of
intraductal tumors detected has increased sharply in the last
decade because mammography has become more sensitive, and more
women are being screened.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the condition is not invasive, intraductal tumors
can spread widely through the milk ducts like the branches of a
tree, and until the 1980s most cases were treated by mastectomy.
Now, more than half are treated with either lumpectomy alone or
lumpectomy with radiation. But studies have found that the tumors
can recur within five years after lumpectomy and radiation, in 6
percent to 21 percent of patients. After 10 years, the risk of
recurrence can be 30 percent to 40 percent, and about half of the
recurrences are invasive. Recurrences are usually treated by
mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of tamoxifen for women with intraductal tumors was
based on a study published in The Lancet, June 1999, of 1,804 women
who had had lumpectomy and radiation for DCIS. Half took tamoxifen,
and half took placebos. After about five years, the women who took
tamoxifen had 43 percent fewer cases of invasive breast cancer.
Survival in the two groups was similar.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is being approved for women who have had both
lumpectomy and radiation because that combination was studied. But
once a drug is approved, doctors can prescribe it for other
patients, including those who have had lumpectomy alone.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kimberly VanZee, a breast cancer surgeon at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said that many doctors had
already begun recommending tamoxifen for women with intraductal
tumors, especially since the Lancet study appeared. But she said
many women refused to take the drug, because of exaggerated fears
of its side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tamoxifen has had so much negative press,'' she said, adding
that she thought it was not deserved. Standard chemotherapy is
riskier than tamoxifen, she said, and yet many women fear tamoxifen
more.
</P>
<P>
   The most common side effects of tamoxifen are hot flashes and
vaginal discharge. Less common, but more serious side effects
include an increased risk of uterine cancer and blood clots in the
lungs and legs, which occur in less than 1 percent of women. But
endometrial cancer is usually detected early, and is considered
highly curable, VanZee said. The risks of stroke and cataracts are
also slightly increased.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elvis was in the building on Thursday night at Irving
Plaza. She had red hair and wore a purple tie-dye jacket, and
called herself Wynonna Judd. The country star, making a rare club
appearance to introduce her latest album, ``New Day Rising''
(Mercury Nashville), projected enough self-confidence and loony
charisma to pass as a female reincarnation of the King. She even
did the karate moves and muscle-flexing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Elvis had some bad qualities, and so does Wynonna (like
Presley, a first-name-only star). Her biggest vocal flaw revealed
itself throughout Thursday's set: merely adequate breath control.
Fudging the sustained notes in her cover of Joni Mitchell's ``Help
Me,'' relying on her back-up singers when she got slightly winded,
Wynonna revealed that even after 18 years in showbiz, she still
sometimes pushes too hard. She's a belter and a growler, but
sometimes that pedal-to-the-metal singing approach doesn't serve
the vocal cords.
</P>
<P>
   This is a small quibble against someone with a far rarer talent
than perfect timbre. Wynonna is one of those real stars who mix
monumentalism with humanism; she cuts through her own big show to
uncover raw feeling. This is one of her Elvis-like qualities _ she
can't help being honest, at least in performance. Even unbearably
trite songs like ``Testify to Love,'' from the ``Touched by an
Angel'' soundtrack, became visceral when Wynonna claimed them.
</P>
<P>
   Her other link to Elvis is her ability to cross racial lines
musically without seeming like a minstrel. Her uptempo songs were
mostly unsanitized Memphis soul, far looser than most Nashville
artists dare. Her new album's title track echoed the Wilson Pickett
classic, ``Midnight Hour.'' During ``Who Am I Trying to Fool?'' she
intoned a ``Hey baby'' worthy of Barry White. Clutching the hand of
a smitten male fan _ and then kissing it _ during that song, she
asserted herself as a stellar love-woman.
</P>
<P>
   The intimacy Wynonna established with both her audience and her
sometimes banal material, did not shrink her presence in the least.
Wynonna could modestly allow her outstanding backup singers to go
full-force during their designated solos, because even if her voice
was smaller, her way with it was huge.
</P>
<P>
   Her sweeping charm overcame any weaknesses caused the set by
superficial Nashville songwriting. She even escaped blame for
softening the words in her version of the Macy Gray song ``I Can't
Wait to Meetcha'' and for singing the worn-out hymn ``How Great
Thou Art.'' These choices were imperfect _ rather corny, very
country. But, truthfully, Elvis made the same ones.

FRANCE REVERSES DECISION ON MORNING-AFTER PILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France's highest administrative court on Friday reversed
a decision that had allowed nurses in high school health centers to
hand out a ``morning-after pill'' to prevent pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The Council of State overruled a decision made by an education
minister last year, saying that the official had misunderstood a
1967 law, which says that hormonal contraceptives may only be
distributed under prescription by pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Deputy Education Minister Segolene Royal, a
Socialist, told high school health centers to stock the pill,
called Norvelo, for circumstances in which doctors could not be
reached immediately. That decision made France the first country in
the world to allow public school nurses to dispense such postcoital
contraception pills.
</P>
<P>
   The decision applied to schools that had girls as young as 12 in
them. Although nurses were advised to try to inform the child's
parents, they were not required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said in Friday's ruling that the pill was in the
category of drugs that could present a danger if not used under
medical supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The Norvelo pill can be taken up to three days after sex. It
prevents implantation of a fertilized egg, and opponents have
called it tantamount to abortion because it keeps an embryo from
developing.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church here strongly opposed Royal's decision, and
the National Confederation of Catholic Family Associations said it
``rejoiced'' at Friday's ruling but regretted that the court had
not gone further to reaffirm parental authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Voltaire Network, a civil rights group, said it was
``worried about the dramatic consequences of this decision for
young women who had no choice but to submit to a pregnancy that was
unwanted or even forced.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal said Friday that the government would immediately propose
a new law governing contraception.
</P>
<P>
   When she made her decision, health and education officials said
they hoped the policy would reduce unwanted pregnancies and lower
the abortion rate, which is higher here than in Germany, Italy or
Spain, but lower than in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Yet abortions have failed to decrease despite the easy
availability of contraception. French schoolchildren receive little
or no sex education, and surveys suggest that they are ill-informed
about sex, contraception and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The union of school nurses accepted last year's policy decision
eagerly.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the French government allowed pharmacists to sell the
pills without a prescription.

   CHICAGO _ The Mexican election has come north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican presidential candidates have campaigned in Chicago, Los
Angeles and Washington, even though Mexicans cannot vote from
abroad. The politicians are urging Mexicans from New York to San
Francisco to call their family and friends back home, advising them
how to vote on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Political parties have organized caravans of buses and cars _
even evoking history by going on horseback _ to take registered
voters to polling places set up in border towns in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And in what experts call an extraordinary step toward linking
Mexicans north and south of the Rio Grande, three Mexicans living
in the United States are running for seats in Mexico's Congress. If
they win _ and chances are good for at least two of them, in
Chicago and Los Angeles _ they will live in the United States and
represent Mexicans here.
</P>
<P>
   The extension of the hotly contested campaign in Mexico to the
barrios of the United States is a sign of how important the 10
million Mexicans living in here have become to Mexico. In a
presidential race in which the governing party is considered
vulnerable for the first time in 71 years, expatriates have been
courted and lobbied like never before.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole family is there, and I tell them the importance of
voting,'' said Rosario Rabiela, who owns Decima Musa, a restaurant
in Chicago's heavily Mexican Pilsen neighborhood. ``We are here,
but we contribute so much in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Emigrants ``are going to be a big factor in this election,''
said Robert Smith, a sociologist at Barnard College who studies
Mexican migration to the United States. ``They will call their
people back home and tell them vote for so-and-so. They are also
big leaders of public opinion in the towns where they're from.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three main presidential candidates have barnstormed
in the United States in recent weeks. The third, Francisco
Labastida, of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI, initially criticized his opponents for campaigning here. But
he has sent his wife and other representatives to the United
States, run campaign ads in American newspapers, and last week met
just south of the border with 350 leaders of Mexicans in Chicago,
Los Angeles, Dallas and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   There are even telephone calling cards being marketed in the
United States that feature a 10-second message, complete with
swelling music, from Vicente Fox, the opposition candidate running
neck and neck with Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans living in the United States can vote only if they have
election cards and go to Mexico on July 2. Fox, of the National
Action Party, and the other main candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of
the Party of the Democratic Revolution, have sponsored caravans to
take Mexicans who qualify from cities as far-flung as New York and
Yakima, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   For those staying at home, Mexicans in New York, Florida,
Illinois, California, Texas, Iowa, Washington, Ohio, Michigan and
elsewhere are holding ``symbolic'' elections, and will deliver
their ballots to Mexican election officials to register their
political views.
</P>
<P>
   For decades Mexicans here had been dismissed by the Mexican
government, and no effort was made to involve them in the political
system. But now, Mexicans abroad have reached such a critical mass
_ an estimated one in nine Mexicans lives in the United States _
and have become an economic lifeline for countless people in
Mexico. Mexicans here send about $7 billion a year to their
families and to churches and public programs in their hometowns,
the country's third biggest source of legal foreign exchange, after
oil and tourism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It used to be presidential candidates couldn't leave the
country for six months before an election _ Mexicans were that
afraid of foreign influence,'' said Rodolfo de la Garza, a
political science professor at the University of Texas. ``I was
quite surprised when these guys were up here running around,
campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Garza said some emigrants had begun ``influencing politics
in Mexico.'' adding, ``They shape the local campaign, get the local
government to respond to domestic pressures, embarrass the mayor by
saying `we're not going to give you this money.'''
</P>
<P>
   While he and other observers say it is unclear how many Mexicans
here are intensely interested in Mexico's politics and thus how
influential they will be, at least some are paying close attention.
Fox got a rally and parade in Chicago in May, and some people are
actively coaching relatives about Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Being allowed to vote in Mexico's elections is a major issue for
some Mexicans here. Immigrants from other countries have that
right, but the number of Mexicans in the United States _ possibly
15 percent of the Mexican electorate _ makes it sensitive for the
Mexican government and a potentially touchy subject for U.S.
politicians too.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mexico's Congress passed a bill to give expatriate
Mexicans the right to cast ballots at certain foreign locations,
but the bill was blocked in the senate by the PRI. That has made
the issue even bigger here, and both Fox and Cardenas champion it.
Mexicans here are presumed to be more supportive of opposition
candidates because they blame the PRI for economic hardships that
prompted them to emigrate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On visits here, PRI representatives say they support voting
rights too, although they express wariness about cost and
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in favor of Mexicans here having the right to vote,''
said Francisco Guerrero Aguirre, a senior PRI official campaigning
for Labastida this week in Chicago, where a Mexican population of
an estimated one million is second only to that of Los Angeles.
``We are concerned about how it will be implemented. Imagine the
possibility of fraud or intervention of other countries. But the
PRI is very much interested in having contact with Mexicans in the
U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic elections, in which people with proof of Mexican
citizenship can vote at mock polling places on street corners and
outside neighborhood grocery stores, are partly meant to keep the
voting rights issue alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that our vote is not going to be used in the
elections, but we can use this information to have influence,''
said Joel Magallan, executive director of Tepeyac Association, a
Mexican organization in New York, who said there would be 15
polling places in the city, one in Harlem and others in the Bronx,
Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. He said sending the voting list
to Mexico would also prevent unscrupulous people from casting
ballots under the names of emigres.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the prospect of Mexican congressmen who live in the
United States is considered more than symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these guys win congressional seats, that would really be
big,'' said de la Garza. France has an elected representative for
overseas citizens, but some Mexicans are talking about going
considerably farther. The National Action Party recently introduced
a proposal in Congress to reserve 10 of the 500 seats for Mexicans
abroad, and others talk of slates of U.S. candidates in the 2003
congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of the Democratic Revolution has two candidates in
this election, Raul Ross Pineda, director of Mexican affairs for
the American Friends Service Committee in Chicago, and Jose Jacques
Medina, a community organizer in Los Angeles. The PRI candidate is
Eddie Varon Levy, a lawyer in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are not named on the ballot, but are on regional
party slates. The more votes a party gets in a region, the more
congressmen it gets. By that calculus, Ross and Varon are
considered likely winners, while Jacques is less likely.
</P>
<P>
   If they win, they plan to commute to Mexico at least part of the
time Congress is in session _ about six months a year, in two month
stretches. Their priorities include streamlining the process for
sending money to Mexico, making it easier for Mexicans abroad to
invest in their hometowns, and influencing United States
immigration and drug policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be a special kind of congressman,'' said Ross,
who advocates voting rights for Mexicans abroad and will not be
voting in Mexico on Sunday. ``My main obligation is going to be to
represent people who live in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Varon said, ``we'll set up offices here too _ in
Oklahoma, Chicago, California, wherever concentrations of Mexicans
are.''

 &HT;    Armstrong has a point to proveArmstrong has point to prove as he
sets out to defend his championship
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ Although he is the defending Tour de
France champion, some well-known cyclists have decided that Lance
Armstrong's recent achievements aren't that monumental.
</P>
<P>
   These cyclists, including French hero Laurent Jalabert, claim it
was Armstrong's unique preparation and not his immense talent that
got him his incredible Tour win in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand. I was a world champion in 1993. I've been
here a long time. I don't know why my detractors are saying what
they've said,'' Armstrong said. ``I've always had class. I've
ridden in the front, and I've won the big races . . . at some point
this has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he still likes to think of himself as a
``outsider.'' ``They think that since the Tour never was my
specialty, that one year I just decided to focus on it and I won,''
Armstrong said from his part-time home in Nice, France. ``They
think if they change their focus, then it's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear as the world's top cyclists gather for the Tour
prologue in Futuroscope this afternoon that Armstrong has changed
the way other top competitors prepare for this torturous marathon
event that will span three weeks and go through three countries
before it ends July 23. That's when the cyclists will hop on the
historic Orient Express to Paris and cap off the 2,255.7-mile Tour
with an 85-mile trek through the City of Lights.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's approach in 1999 might have been novel, but it was
nothing more than smart practice habits. He picked up those habits
while competing in swimming meets and running triathlons while
growing up in Plano before concentrating on cycling and moving to
Austin a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's plan last year was simple. He mapped out the 1999
course and rode the Tour stages in the months leading up to the
Tour. He knew he would be strong in the time trials. Because his
climbing ability had been a weakness, he paid close attention to
the mountains so there would be no surprises once the Tour started.
</P>
<P>
   His familiarity with the routes allowed him to be more
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   That mind-set probably won't change this year, although it's
likely other previously more conservative riders might adopt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sort of more traditional way to win the Tour has been to
make up what you lost in the mountains by making it up in the time
trials,'' said Chris Carmichael, Armstrong's longtime coach. ``And
then you limit your losses in time and rely on your team to be
strong in the flats.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Lance didn't do that last year. He attacked the time
trials and he attacked the mountains. So in the time trials, he
made up some serious time on the real climbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could ride more conservatively this year and not really
attack, then have his team control it. That way you don't expose
yourself as much and that's the good way to win overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not in Lance's makeup. That's why Lance is
different. He looks for every opportunity to help him win. He races
every day like it's the final day.''
</P>
<P>
   ADVICE: DODGE THE LIMELIGHT
</P>
<P>
   It has been an odd year for the Tour winner because Armstrong
still has yet to garner total respect from his competitors and from
the critical French-based media.
</P>
<P>
   Jalabert again said Armstrong peaked too soon after the
28-year-old Austin resident turned in almost flawless performances
in the Classique des Alpes and the Dauphine Libere, two Tour
tuneups. Those races were in May and early June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armstrong is 100 percent fit, and that seems premature,''
Jalabert said after Armstrong's third-place performance at the
Dauphine Libere. ``The Alps in the Tour are scheduled in 10 weeks'
time, and it will be hard for him to maintain his condition so
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong contends he is in the best shape of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, others have criticized him for spending too much
time making money and not enough time training.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was profiled nationally by USA Today earlier this
year. The story detailed Armstrong's ever-increasing popularity,
while mentioning his multi-million-dollar endorsement deals. He
likely will make $7 million this year, with last year's Tour win
swelling his total endorsements to $15 million over the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
   The French newspaper L'Equipe reprinted the USA Today story and
put editorial comments in italics throughout the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pay much attention to it,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty negative,'' said Bill Stapleton, Armstrong's
Austin-based agent. ``It's ironic, because Lance really loves Nice.
He speaks French fluently, but he's still an American (to the
French).''
</P>
<P>
   Even longtime friend Miguel Indurain, the legendary Spaniard who
won five consecutive Tours, wondered earlier this year if Armstrong
was spreading himself too thin between riding and endorsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would recommend to Lance is to have people work for him
and do the press and the events,'' Indurain said through a
translator. ``That way he can concentrate on riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every rider who wins has the same problem. Every one who has
won the Tour for the first time, it has changed his life forever.
Lance became very popular. Everyone knows him. If I could advise
him, I would tell him to keep training so he can be in the best
shape possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A TOUGHER TEAM
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's popularity not only has increased his bank account,
it also has allowed his U.S. Postal Service team to build a strong
squad of supporting riders for the Tour. Including Armstrong, there
will be nine U.S.P.S. riders competing. Six of them are American
and rode with Armstrong last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Osipow, director of operations for the U.S.P.S. team, said
he was able to add five to six new corporate sponsors to the team.
These sponsors paid a minimum of six figures to have their logos
displayed on the U.S.P.S. jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable new additions to the roster have been Cedric
Vasseur of France and Viatcheslav Ekimov of Russia. Vasseur led the
1997 Tour and wore the yellow jersey for five days. Ekimov, who
specializes in time trials, is a former Tour stage winner.
</P>
<P>
   The third addition was Benoit Joachim of Luxembourg, who also
excels in time trials.
</P>
<P>
   Austin resident Kevin Livingston is on the team and again will
help Armstrong in the mountain climbs.
</P>
<P>
   Johan Bruyneel, the U.S.P.S. team director, said Tour experience
rather than potential played a huge part in team selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice of the team was based on the experience of last
year,'' Bruyneel said. ``I selected the riders for this year based
on who had the experience of defending the leader's jersey last
year. That was a big factor, plus the experience of Ekimov and
Vasseur and the solid fitness of Joachim. It's no use going to the
Tour de France with one leader and eight climbers. I learned that
from last year _ you need people for the high mountains, middle
mountains and flats. You need a well balanced team.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S.P.S. member Tyler Hamilton of Marblehead, Mass., has proved
this year that he is a cyclist on the rise. Hamilton likely will
play a significant role in the mountains riding for Armstrong. He
won the Dauphine Libere last month, with Armstrong, in a rare turn,
riding to give his teammate the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was not a real surprise that Tyler won the
Dauphine,'' Bruyneel said. ``That was an objective before the start
of the race. He has improved a lot in the climbs. Last year, he did
a couple of good mountain stages but there was some inconsistency.
This year, he made big improvements in May in training and at the
Dauphine. He knows we will again count on him to assist Lance in
the mountains, and he now has evidence he can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong acknowledged the strength of his Tour teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team did a good job for me last year, and they seem to be
a stronger group this year,'' he said. ``One thing (Armstrong's
win) did. We were able to buy a stronger group of guys.''

<P>
   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ Mexico has taken more time to establish a
clear democracy than any other Latin American country.
</P>
<P>
   With two unusual exceptions _ Francisco I. Madero's presidency
(1911-1913) and the decade of the liberal republic of Benito Juarez
(1867-1876) _ Mexicans have always lived in an ironclad and deaf
autocratic tradition. An all-powerful president with the right to
designate his successor, and a political party that has governed
without allowing the slightest dissent are the hallmarks of life in
Mexico for past 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   These days, everything seems ready to change with the election
on July 2, except for blind political authoritarianism. For those
who observe from afar the fierce electoral campaign, it's easy to
see that the opposition candidate Vicente Fox's followers in the
National Action party, or PAN, aren't willing to accept the
possibility of a defeat, nor the right of their rivals to think
differently.
</P>
<P>
   For most Mexican intellectuals, to express support for the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, or for its official
candidate, Francisco Labastida, means a spontaneous confession of
venality or stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the only way to change a corrupt political
system is to vote for Fox has became a fixed idea in the mind of
thinking Mexicans. Some have even said that the only possible road
for democracy in Mexico is alternation in power, without thinking
that a forced alternation is as antidemocratic as a forced
continuity.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is so serious that Labastida has to win by a
margin of more than 5 percentage points. If the official candidate
wins by a slim margin, he wouldn't be capable of governing a
peaceful country because he wouldn't be accepted as a legitimate
president.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the journalists, sociologists and writers with whom I
have talked in the last weeks say they are not satisfied with the
two main candidates and have decided to vote for the candidates of
smaller parties. And every time such intentions have been expressed
or written about, they have been attacked by supporters of Fox
because, from their point of view, only Fox has a chance of
defeating Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they are right, but there is more than one motive for
Mexicans not to be happy about their future, whatever it may be.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who could have renounced his candidacy
to pave the way for a united opposition _ with all the personal
benefits this might have guaranteed _ has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   On the one side, history is against such a move. The National
Action party was created in 1939 as an act of rebellion against the
progressive policies of Cuauhtemoc's father, President Lazaro
Cardenas. On the other side, Cardenas does not believe that Fox
will fulfill his promises. The only thing both candidates agree on
is that they will oppose electoral fraud in any form, and this
accord was reached just one month before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the PRI's Francisco Labastida is among the cadre of
elite young leaders who have helped modernize Mexico, few believe
he'll also be capable of modernizing the PRI. And when the polls
were not favorable to him in May, he sought the party's help to
reverse the tendency.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has appeared awkward in public debates and he has been
less than clever in his public declarations, but nobody doubts that
he would be a capable bureaucrat _ as gray as former President
Miguel de la Madrid and as honest as Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, on the contrary, is an enigma _ similar in more ways than
one to Juan Domingo Peron. Like the Argentinian leader, Fox is
willing to tell everyone what they want to hear, and he isn't
afraid of contradicting himself. And, also did Peron, he has been
able to obscure a conservative background by using leftist
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when he was the governor of Guanajuato State, he
was one of the most ardent advocates of privatizing Pemex, the
state-owned oil company, despite its being one of the great symbols
of Mexican nationalism. Today he defends vigorously the exact
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN was created as the Catholics' answer to the
anti-clericalism of the elder Cardenas. Fox has already made
several gestures intended to please the Church, among them paying
public devotion to the Virgin of Guadalupe and promising to push
legislation to increase the restrictions on abortion. But when
confronted by opposition forces, he swears that he would never use
the power of the state to impose particular religious faith or life
style.
</P>
<P>
   Even Fox's most ardent supporters admit that he is an incurable
populist. He is tall, congenial and eloquent, and he likes to dress
as a cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's problem, then, is to decide which is the least of two
evils _ populism or continuity. Many in the country are not happy
about the six years of Zedillo's presidency, despite the fact that
he has done more to change the political habits of Mexico than all
of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's success, though, is imperfect. The New York Times, in
its June 19 edition, said that although the electoral campaign has
been ``the cleanest and most competitive in Mexico's history,''
there have been numerous instances in which the PRI has tried to
buy votes or threaten peasants, workers and public employees.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Zedillo's predecessor, won the
presidency in what seemed a fraudulent election. Yet he succeeded
in creating a sense of national prosperity, which was reinforced by
the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Had Salinas wanted to, he could have imposed the political
reforms many Mexicans have long demanded. He did not. He has since
said that PRI factionalism prevented him from acting: His duty, he
said, was to unite the PRI so that reforms could be made by Luis
Donaldo Colosio, the man he had chosen to be his successor.
</P>
<P>
   But Colosio was murdered before he could be elected so the
weakest of the heirs of Salinas was the one who accomplished that
improbable and enormous task.
</P>
<P>
   If Fox wins, he will owe Zedillo a debt of gratitude for helping
to create a country now ready to practice democracy in a mature
manner. If Labastida wins, he will be the first president who was
not selected by the arbitrary ``finger'' of his predecessor. The
problem is that the winner must have a very clear margin of
victory, and nobody knows if that will be possible.
</P>
<P>
   No country changes overnight. A few years will have to pass
before Mexico's autocratic traditions give way to the traditions of
tolerance.

   HAYWARD, Calif. _ In an ironic twist, the most damaging piece of
evidence against a San Leandro sausage maker facing triple homicide
charges may have been created by the defendant himself.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Alexander, 39, charged with gunning down three government
meat inspectors at his Santos Linguisa Factory, turned on the
store's surveillance cameras shortly before the shooting rampage,
according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's employee, Brooke Silverglide, 21, of San Jose, told
the police she helped her boss climb into an attic in his office to
turn on the factory's two security cameras, one in the front retail
area where the shootings occurred and the other in the rear office.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the court records said, the cameras captured
Alexander shooting unsuspecting meat inspectors Jeannie Hillery,
Tom Quadros and Bill Shaline, who had arrived at Santos Linguisa
for an unannounced inspection.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander's original intent in turning on the cameras was to
help prove that he was being harassed by the inspectors, not to
tape a shooting, defense attorney Stuart Hanlon said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander ``felt they were harassing him, and something
traumatic happened between turning on the camera and him going out
there,'' Hanlon said. ``Something snapped and that's what the trial
will be about.''
</P>
<P>
   In a chilling sequence of events, the video shows Alexander
firing numerous shots at federal inspectors Hillery, 56, of
Alameda, and Quadros, 52, of Hayward, and state inspector Shaline,
57, of Sacramento, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander then ran outside and allegedly chased another food
inspector who was waiting for police officers to arrive. Quadros
had called for police assistance moments before the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   State inspector Earl Willis told detectives he was chased around
the corner and down the street as the suspect fired gunshots at
him. He was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Elliott, assistant district manager of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, told the police that sanitation problems were
discovered in Alexander's factory in January and government meat
inspectors shut the business down for some time.
</P>
<P>
   There were instances when both state and federal inspectors were
asked to leave by Alexander when they came to see if he was abiding
the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Then in May, Alexander called the USDA's office in Alameda,
saying he wanted to be reinstated again, but ran into more trouble
for not processing the meat in accordance with federal standards.

NADER'S UNLIKELY CAMPAIGN IS HAVING AN UNEXPECTED IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: ``Withering Heights'' in 3rd from last graf is correct)  
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It was nearing 10 o'clock at night, but in the
sweltering lecture hall that served as the stage for this political
rally, the Green Party's nominee for president of the United States
was still going strong.
</P>
<P>
   He railed against an ``apartheid economy'' that was benefiting
only the rich, and he bemoaned the state of affairs in a country
with ``far more problems than it deserves and far more solutions
than it applies.'' And he scoffed at the notion that he might be a
``spoiler,'' drawing enough votes away from Al Gore to tip the
election to George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't spoil a system,'' said Ralph Nader, ``that's spoiled
to the core.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience of 300 people or so loved it, repeatedly breaking
into applause and giving the 66-year-old Nader a standing ovation
coming in and heading out.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know whether, as current polls suggest,
Nader's Raiders will have more impact on the race than the Buchanan
Brigades of the likely Reform Party nominee, Pat Buchanan. But one
thing is clear on the campaign trail with the country's best-known
consumer advocate: He is running an exceedingly more energetic race
than he did four years ago, when he essentially stood in as a
protest candidate, spending less than $5,000, speaking rarely and
taking 1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the difference between a person running and a person
standing still,'' Nader said by way of comparison to his 1966 White
House bid. He has campaigned in every state this year _ flying
commercial coach class, frequently using his senior-citizen's
discount _ and he appears well on his way to his goal of raising $5
million, with the help of the vast direct-mail network he has built
over the years and plugs from several big Hollywood names.
</P>
<P>
   He may wind up as a passing phenomenon in this campaign, like
Bill Bradley or John McCain. But for now, Nader is attracting a lot
of attention _ among the media, among left-leaning voters who see
him as a more reliably liberal voice than Gore, and among leaders
of organized labor, who agree with his stands on trade. Nader is a
staunch critic of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the
World Trade Organization, both of which he depicts as evidence of a
``corporate globalization'' that harms worker rights and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Polls in recent weeks have put him at between 5 percent and 10
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a stretch to call Nader a natural politician, and
his one-and-three-quarter-hour nomination acceptance speech on
Sunday in Denver may have been a tad long. But he seems highly
animated, and has a lot of sound bites down. He even claims to be
enjoying his life as a politician, though he chooses a rather grim
analogy to explain why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I have programmed myself so that if something is important
to do, it's enjoyable,'' he said in an interview Monday, after
speaking at a women's center in San Francisco's Mission District.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, there are some professional people who do that, too,''
Nader continued. ``A good doctor, if he believes it's important to
treat people, he'll enjoy treating people, even though outsiders
may say, `Oh, My God, what horrible tragedies and near-misses, what
pain you're dealing with.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Nader's depiction, most of the country is in pain. ``At no
time in our history have the children of America been in such
crisis,'' he said in San Francisco the other day. And most
wage-earners, he told the crowd here, are working harder and longer
than ever but have less purchasing power than they had in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Nader sees the West Coast _ with its mix of liberals, radicals,
environmentalists and others who lean to the left _ as a fertile
ground for his campaign. And indeed in California, where Nader has
been involved in tort initiatives and has campaigned for so-called
``patient protection'' and HMO-reform initiatives, polls show his
support in the 5 to 7 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   Though the number is small, much of that support comes at the
expense of Gore, who most analysts believe has to win California to
win in November. But even with Nader campaigning hard in the state,
Democrats here profess to have little concerned about his impact.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rather than reaching out to Nader and his backers, they have so
far been dismissive. ``Ralph Nader is a 66-year-old Corvair in this
race ready to be rear-ended,'' said Bob Mulholland, campaign
adviser to the California Democratic Party. ``This is the most
serious vote of people's lives, and they're not going to throw it
away.'' He said the party would not ``waste one ad'' campaigning
against the Green Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nader became famous because of the Corvair, and he's been
doing college campuses ever since,'' Mulholland said. ``And now he
wants to be president? It's a joke, it's ridiculous. Only in
America can someone completely irrelevant run for president.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Nader's message is a bit complicated. He says that
he hopes his candidacy will energize turnout for Democratic
candidates in close races for the House of Representatives, and
thus help turn power over to House Democratic leaders, and away
from the Republicans in the House leadership whom he calls ``beyond
the pale.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the presidential level, Nader has nothing but venom for
Gore and President Clinton, whom he accuses of offering ``some of
the most intensive demonstrations of political cowardliness in
American history.'' He says the race offers voters two
``Republicrat'' candidates, barely distinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only distinction between Bush and Gore is the velocity
with which their knees hit the floor when big corporations knock on
the door,'' said Nader the other day in Los Angeles, campaigning
outside a public housing project.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A seasoned political strategist might suggest that while Nader
remains so hot, he should be barnstorming the country. He did
follow up his nomination acceptance in Denver with the swing here,
and he said he plans many such swings. But afterward, he headed
back to Washington, D.C., where aides said he planned to spend the
rest of the week, mostly conducting media interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Oakland, speaking Monday at a downtown school called the
University of Creation Spirituality, Nader elicited hisses of
agreement from the crowd when he blasted several big-name Democrats
in California, including Gov. Gray Davis and U.S. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein. And he drew sustained applause when he described the
state of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the central planks of his campaign are pledges to enact
universal health insurance, to change labor laws to make it easier
for unions to organize and to eliminate corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If there was any good news for Gore out of the rally here, it
would seem to be that Nader's crowd was, by and large, so
left-leaning that many voters there were not even the vice
president's to lose. Several people in the audience said they had
voted for Green or Libertarian Party candidates in the past.
</P>
<P>
   What seemed to resonate with them most was Nader's ``honesty _
just the sense that nobody is going to own him,'' as Corine
Thornton, a 77-year-old retired waitress, put it. She voted for
Nader four years ago: ``I just was no longer satisfied with voting
for the lesser of two evils.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mateo Williford, a 28-year-old self-described ``traveling
activist,'' rejected the idea that a vote for Nader was a wasted
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're ever going to have the possibility of three, four,
five political parties,'' he said, ``we have to make the choice to
start bringing those in.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some people were not even sure about the whole electoral
effort on Nader's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that all this energy is being put into the
political system,'' said Jonah Zern, 22, who graduated from Cornell
University last year with a degree in environmental policy. ``I
mean, the idea that one person can represent 250 million people is
absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader is not without potential vulnerabilities to exploit.
Eyebrows were raised recently when the financial disclosure
statements of America's most famous corporation-basher revealed
that he was worth nearly $4 million, in large part because of some
savvy stock investments in high-technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader scoffed at the notion that there was anything untoward
about reaping such gains. He said he lives on about $25,000 a year,
giving away 80 percent of his after-tax income, and that any of his
gains in the market represent a ``de facto philanthropic fund'' for
his favorite causes.
</P>
<P>
   No one really expects it, but what if Nader wound up in ``that
corporate prison we used to call the White House,'' as he describes
it, having to deal with the lawmakers ``who have turned Capitol
Hill into Withering Heights''?
</P>
<P>
   Would he find it all daunting? Nader thought about the question
for a while, and said no. ``First of all, I've been in Washington
too long, I've seen what kind of characters were in power, who
should have been daunted but weren't.'' So no, daunting wasn't the
right word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would find it challenging to be president,'' he said.
``Daunting has almost a stuck-in-the-headlights, taken aback sense,
that maybe you're surprised by what you find yourself having to
cope with. I don't think that would be the case.''

AT&AMP;T MAY SPIN OFF ITS LONG-DISTANCE UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is considering spinning off its long-distance telephone
operation, the largest in the United States, as a separately traded
tracking stock, people close to the company said this week.
</P>
<P>
   No such plan has yet been presented to AT&AMP;T's board by its
management, the people said. AT&AMP;T declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   One reason AT&AMP;T may want to issue a new stock to track the
long-distance unit is that the shares have languished recently.
Shares of AT&AMP;T hit a new 52-week low during trading Friday and
closed at $31.8125, down 44 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company's management is eager to bolster the stock price and
may believe that issuing a new stock could boost AT&AMP;T's share
price.
</P>
<P>
   If the shrinking consumer long-distance unit were made separate,
the remainder of the company would show faster growth. Those
remaining units would include the operation that sells
communication services, as well as data services, to business
customers, and AT&AMP;T's cable television operation, the largest in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's consumer long-distance operation generates about $20
billion a year in revenue, but is shrinking. In the first quarter,
that unit reported $5.1 billion in revenue, down 5.6 percent from
the comparable period of 1999. The consumer long-distance business
is shrinking, because many other companies compete against AT&AMP;T in
the long-distance business and prices have come down quickly in
that market.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many companies have offered new shares that are
meant to track the performance of specific units in those
companies. Tracking stocks do not, however, represent any actual
economic interest in the unit that they represent. In April, AT&AMP;T
offered new shares meant to track the performance of its
fast-growing wireless business. Those shares of AT&AMP;T Wireless Group
were offered to the public at $29.50 on April 27 and closed Friday
at $27.02.
</P>
<P>
   Companies generally offer tracking stocks for their units that
are growing quickly. Because AT&AMP;T's consumer long-distance unit is
shrinking, however, it is unclear what investors would be willing
to pay for such a stock.
</P>
<P>
   While it is shrinking, AT&AMP;T's consumer long-distance unit does
generate a lot of cash for the company. In the first quarter, that
unit generated $2 billion in earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, up 4 percent from the comparable
period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people own AT&AMP;T's stock, making it one of the most
widely held in the nation. For decades, AT&AMP;T enjoyed a monopoly in
the long-distance telephone industry, but that monopoly began to
crumble under assault from the government and from competitors like
MCI in the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Since the old American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph Co. was broken up
in 1984, the remaining long-distance company has lost share in the
long-distance market every year. It has been very hard for AT&AMP;T to
compete against smaller companies that have lower costs, according
to analysts and industry experts.

PROGRESS AGAINST PACS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be easy to minimize the victory that campaign finance
reform finally achieved in Congress this week _ easy, but wrong.
</P>
<P>
   True, the loophole Congress closed was a small one. ``Stealth
PACs,'' operating under Section 527 of the tax code, will no longer
be able to keep their donors secret, but they will still be able to
operate, like scores of other ``independent'' political
organizations, using huge soft money contributions to advance their
political ends. And even the elimination of all soft money, as the
McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan bills would do, is only the first
major step toward democratizing a national politics still
controlled far too much by moneyed interests.
</P>
<P>
   So Congress this week only healed the blister on top of the boil
on top of the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the large majorities _ 92-6 in the Senate and 385-39 in
the House _ show the enormous potential for bipartisan progress.
Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, reform's arch foe,
had boasted that the GOP lock on the issue was impregnable because
voters didn't care. This week he was reduced to encouraging
senators to vote for reform so they wouldn't suffer at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the stealth PAC loophole was a good step. More
important, Congress created a coalition that should now press its
momentum for more substantial reforms.

BARGAIN HUNTING WITH PUTNAM INTERNATIONAL VOYAGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Britain, Germany, Italy and France)   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nigel P. Hart and Andrew Graham, both 33, are of like build and
stature. Both are British expatriates in Boston. But Hart hails
from just outside London, and Graham is from Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're quite different, but it works quite well,'' Hart said.
``As a true Scot he's happy to control costs, and as a true
Englishman, I'm happy to conquer borders.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the fund of which they are co-managers, the $2.22
billion Putnam International Voyager, has given them cause to bury
any differences. Its Class A shares returned 35.3 percent a year,
on average, for the three years through June 23, compared with 12.2
percent for its peers in the foreign stock category, according to
Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge a stock's worth, the fund focuses on a company's
long-term return on capital _ taking into account earnings,
depreciation, working capital and capital expenditures. The
managers project that return on capital into the future and then
discount it by using long-term bond rates particular to each
market. The resulting figure is what they call the real return on
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that's the driver of underlying worth, because
ultimately the return that management can generate is rewarded by
the market,'' said Graham, who joined the fund last October. Their
goal is to find companies with a real return on capital that
exceeds 6 or 7 percent over the next two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   The managers start with lists of small-capitalization stocks _
5,000 in developed markets outside the United States and 2,000 in
emerging markets. To whittle the total to 500, they screen the
lists for various criteria. First, they look for companies with
market caps of $500 million to $3 billion and for average daily
trading volume of at least 500,000 shares. Moreover, they also make
sure there are enough shares traded so that the fund can buy its
position within 20 days without the purchases exceeding one-third
of the average daily trading volume.
</P>
<P>
   In the final screen, the fund uses a proprietary model to
correlate valuation and return on capital. Specifically, it
calculates a company's enterprise value _ the market value of its
equity plus total debt, minus cash and short-term investments. _
and divides it by the company's after-tax net operating profits.
The lower the resulting figure, called the E.V./Nopat multiple, the
better, because the fund gets a higher return for a lower price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a less easily manipulated figure than earnings per share,
and it's relatively comparable across various markets,'' Hart said.
``EPS is defined very differently in different countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The two also calculate a 12-month price target for each stock by
dividing a company's enterprise value by its shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   They make their final cuts, to a portfolio of 130 or so stocks,
by scrutinizing company management and business models to see if
profits can be both sustainable and large. That requires extensive
travel by analysts and managers alike; Hart and Graham estimate
that they spend about half their time on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Though the managers say they are indifferent to whether their
prospects are growth or value stocks, the holdings generally fall
into two camps: fast growers, with minimum annual revenue growth of
15 to 20 percent, and more mature companies that have undervalued
assets or are good takeover targets. Companies in this second group
may grow at different rates and sometimes are unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   When any holding grows to more than 5 percent of the portfolio,
it is automatically trimmed. Any stock that reaches their price
target is reviewed: they either raise the target or prune the
position.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their travel schedules, the managers often
communicate via telephone and e-mail. Twice a week _ on Tuesdays
and Thursdays _ they meet formally with their analysts to arrive at
buy or sell decisions. On Thursdays, they also review currency,
political and other country-related risks for the portfolio, as
well as the ramifications of any overweighting or underweighting in
individual countries or sectors.
</P>
<P>
   They are now finding the best values in Continental Europe,
which accounts for about 60 percent of the fund's assets; Hart
particularly sees bargains among financial services companies in
Germany, Italy and France.
</P>
<P>
   One pick is Tecis, a German financial services and mutual fund
company. Tecis has a wide range of products and a sophisticated
sales force, Hart said, and is benefiting from Europeans' rising
savings. While the business is relatively mature in the United
States, he added, it is growing fast in Germany. He expects
revenues to grow 35 percent, annualized, over the next three years,
and return on capital of 30 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The fund bought shares in November at 35 euros each; they now
trade at 99.95 euros. Hart's 12-month price target is 160.
</P>
<P>
   The managers also like Bulgari, the Italian luxury goods
company. ``In recent years, they've been following the Gucci
model,'' Hart said, ``broadening their product lineup, increasing
the number of stores and appealing to a bigger audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is also rebuilding sales lost during the Asian
financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, he added. He predicts sales
growth of 20 percent, annualized, over three years, and a return on
capital of 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fund bought shares in March at 10.5 euros, they now trade at
14 euros. The fund's price target is 16 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Tecan, a Swiss manufacturer of equipment
used to automate pharmaceutical and biotechnology laboratories. The
company is a market leader in a fast-growing sector, Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole drug discovery process is changing with the onset of
genomic research,'' he said. ``The number of avenues of research
has dramatically expanded, and companies need a way to explore all
the ideas efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   He forecasts three-year annual sales growth of 25 percent and
return on capital of 40 percent. The fund bought shares in February
at 800 Swiss francs; they closed on Friday at 1,561. His price
target is 1,900 francs. &QL;

BREAKING RANKS OVER ANTHRAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Boston to the Pentagon, health officials are addressing the
threat of biological weapons that have the potential to cause
deaths on a scale with nuclear weapons but at a fraction of the
cost and difficulty. In Boston and elsewhere the focus is on
creating a computerized warning system in which a sudden spiking of
emergency-room visits or deaths would alert authorities to the
possibility of such an attack. Without such a system, casualties
could mount for days as patients suffer from symptoms that, in
initial stages, look like just a severe flu.
</P>
<P>
   That plan is not controversial. The Defense Department's
two-year-old program _ requiring members of the military to be
vaccinated against the most probable threat, anthrax _ is
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the armed forces have vaccinated against a range
of diseases uncommon in the United States, from cholera to yellow
fever. But because of a small number of adverse reactions to the
anthrax vaccine, none of them fatal, some personnel are refusing to
take it, and an antivaccine campaign has arisen on the Internet.
Protesters have caught the attention of congressmen, who have
raised their own questions about the Pentagon's program.
</P>
<P>
   Such questions are valid and could serve a public health purpose
for the nation by raising awareness of the havoc that an
``aerosolized'' anthrax-spore weapon in the hands of a foreign
power or a group of terrorists could wreak. On Thursday, a CIA
official warned of the danger of bioterrorism at Congress's
first-ever hearing on the global danger of infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Bacillus anthracis usually affects animals but in its inhaled
form is almost 100 percent lethal to human beings who get a
substantial exposure and no immediate treatment. In recent years,
US officials have suspected 10 foreign countries, including Iraq
and North Korea, of possessing or developing anthrax weapons. ``The
threat is so serious,'' the Defense Department stated in response
to a call in May by 35 congressmen to halt vaccination, ``that our
commanders-in-chief in Korea and Southwest Asia are adamant in
their insistence that all of their forward-deployed forces . . . be
vaccinated.''
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine that the Pentagon has turned to is one that since
1970 has been given in a series of six injections to veterinarians
and others who work with animals. In three decades, the vaccine has
been found effective and safe, causing occasional reactions similar
to those brought on by other vaccines. The most common is redness
and swelling at the injection.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pentagon, of the 440,000 military personnel who
have received a total of more than 1.7 million vaccine shots, 31
people have required hospitalization. Of the 31, six have been
determined to have illnesses probably caused by the vaccination and
have been granted waivers from further anthrax shots.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this creditable record, the military is regularly
vilified on Internet Web sites for its handling of the anthrax
vaccine. It is a classic instance of how double-edged computer
communication is: While special software will make it possible in
Boston for health officials to detect worrisome ``clusters'' in
emergency departments that might signal bioterrorism, Internet
links have helped to foster resistance to the anthrax vaccine among
service personnel. In both cases, here and in the military, health
officials should follow through on their plans to protect American
lives from an insidious killer.

COMMENTARY: IT ISN'T WORKING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The state of our political system _ the depressing
state _ was illuminated by a report in The New York Times last
week. The story, by Michael R. Gordon with Steven Lee Myers, showed
how petty domestic politics had imposed heavy costs, financial and
diplomatic, on plans for a U.S. missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration thought of building the anti-missile
system at Grand Forks, N.D., where an exception written into the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty allows a U.S. installation. But
then computers showed that the single system would not cover the
far western end of the Aleutian Islands, with a population of a few
thousand.
</P>
<P>
   That discovery killed the plan. Why? Because the Senate
Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee is headed by Sen.
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. No one was willing even to ask him about the
idea of leaving those few constituents of his unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   So the plan now being considered by President Clinton would put
a huge radar installation on a remote Aleutian Island and deploy
100 interceptors in central Alaska. The change will add $2 billion
to the cost of the system _ and require problematic negotiation
with Russia about amendment or abandonment of the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   That tale illustrates a curious aspect of contemporary American
life. In business, we expect hard-nosed leaders to make decisions
based on cost and comparative advantage _ and we thrive
economically as a result. But in public policy, fewer and fewer
decisions are made on the substantive merits.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called missile shield is an example in another sense,
even more profound. Clinton is considering a ``thin'' system,
designed to deal with the possibility of long-range nuclear
missiles coming from such countries as North Korea. Republicans in
general, and Gov. George W. Bush in particular, are arguing for a
much bigger and more expensive system that would also cover
American troops abroad and our allies.
</P>
<P>
   The thin system is a halfway measure. It reminds one of what
Winston Churchill said about the name of a fellow member of
Parliament, Sir Alfred Bossom: ``It's neither one thing nor the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the thin idea is plainly political. Clinton wants
to protect himself _ and Vice President Gore _ from Republican
charges that they are weak on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it seems doubtful that the tactic will succeed.
Despite enormous scientific doubts about the workability of
anti-missile devices, and extravagant cost, Americans have liked
the dream of an invulnerable shield since President Reagan floated
it. Bush is likely to score with his call for an all-out system.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would the limited plan now being considered by Clinton
obviate the diplomatic and security dangers of any anti-missile
system. Forty-five China scholars and diplomats, including Reagan's
ambassador to Beijing, have warned that an early decision to begin
building any new system would provoke China into ``negative steps
that would undermine American security.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics also underlies another dangerous decision: the
proposal, just approved by Congress, to send more than $1 billion
in aid to Colombia to fight drugs. Here again Clinton embraced an
idea whose ramifications have hardly been thought through in order
to protect himself from being called soft on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are a subject that has paralyzed American political
leadership for a generation and more. The war on drugs fills our
prisons without reducing drug use. But only a few politicians have
been brave enough to say that the emperor has no clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The other day the chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals,
Judith Kaye, ordered the courts to begin offering treatment instead
of prison time to nonviolent criminals who are addicts. It took a
judge to do what every study has shown is more effective and far
less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Our sluggish democracy has always depended on courageous
political leadership. It took a strong president and dedicated
congressional leaders, working together, to end American
isolationism after World War II _ and to act on civil rights in the
1960s. When will we get the leadership to deal forthrightly with
today's problems?

EDUCATIONAL AIRWAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 02, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A harmful war rages over the rights of religious broadcasters,
pitting Republicans in Congress against the Federal Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are licenses to run what's called noncommercial
educational stations. They date back to 1945 when the government
set aside 20 percent of the FM dial for educational programming. In
1952, 242 television channels were also reserved. The goal was to
create educational shows for the entire community, children and
adults, that would be free from commercial pressure. Today there
are more than 370 noncommercial educational television stations
(NCETV). One local example is WGBH.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy arose because Cornerstone TeleVision, a religious
broadcaster near Pittsburgh, wanted to take over one of two
stations licensed to a public broadcaster. The public broadcaster
agreed because it had money problems. The full plan: Cornerstone
would take over the public NCETV channel, sell its commercial
channel, and split the profit with the ailing public broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   Some Pittsburgh residents and community organizations cried
foul. They insisted Cornerstone would not meet the community's
educational needs.
</P>
<P>
   It's an understandable concern. Cornerstone's Web site shows its
deeply religious orientation. A message from its president, Oleen
Eagle, says the station's goal is ``to impact our culture and
reverse society's moral downslide by broadcasting the Gospel and
bringing a fresh, positive, Christ-centered outlook. . . . At the
heart of our mission are the Three E's: Entertainment. Evangelism.
Edification.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, the FCC approved Cornerstone's NCETV request,
pointing out a tendency to defer to applicants' judgments about
programming unless they are ``arbitrary or unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   But FCC chairman William Kennard and commissioner Gloria
Tristani did dissent in part, saying Cornerstone had failed to
prove its programming would be ``primarily educational.''
</P>
<P>
   The order also contained what would become a bomb: ``additional
guidance'' from the FCC. It said that more than half the broadcast
hours of NCETV stations must ``primarily serve an educational,
instructional, or cultural purpose in the station's community of
license.'' Religious programming could indeed qualify as
educational, but not if it was ``primarily devoted to religious
exhortation, proselytizing, or statements of personally held
religious views . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   This sounds like common sense. To broadcast on an NCETV station,
adhere to NCETV educational rules. But the National Religious
Broadcasters, an association of Christian broadcasters, called the
FCC ruling ``a dangerous decision'' that interfered with religious
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen wrote ill-advised bills. In the House, the
``Religious Broadcasting Freedom Act,'' said the additional
guidance was invalid because the FCC could not make up new rules
unless it did so through official rule-making procedures. The FCC
said it was only issuing an explanation, but, caving in to
pressure, it still rescinded the guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Another bill that passed in the House and has moved to the
Senate, ``The Noncommercial Broadcasting Freedom of Expression Act
of 2000,'' claims noncommercial educational broadcasters should use
stations to ``primarily serve an educational, instructional,
cultural, or religious purpose in its community of license'' _
adding the word ``religious.''
</P>
<P>
   Passing this bill would be a disaster. Related Senate bills
should also be scrapped. NCE stations are a valuable government
effort to reserve a corner of the crowded airways for education.
And while the First Amendment says government must defend the
``free exercise'' of religion, it's a violation of the separation
of church and state for government to promote religious purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, religious broadcasters have not had their free
speech rights trampled. They air on commercial and noncommercial
stations. The ``2000 Directory of Religious Media'' includes 285
television stations and 1,731 radio stations. So based on FCC
figures, at least 17.6 percent of TV stations (of 1,616 in total)
air religious content, as do at least 13.7 percent of radio
stations (of 12,615 in total).
</P>
<P>
   After the outburst, Cornerstone chose not to assume the NCETV
license. But it could have. And, as Kennard has argued, since only
a majority of its shows were supposed to be educational, a minority
of shows could have been solely religious in purpose.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the FCC has been timid. It should have let its
``additional guidance'' stand. Because it didn't, it may have to
fight much harder to protect the educational mission of NCE
stations.

CNBC AND MSNBC WILL EXPAND NBC'S OLYMPIC COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By   RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over 40 years, Olympic broadcasts have developed into highly
rated soap operas building to nightly crescendos by focusing on a
few sports to the exclusion of many.
</P>
<P>
   Gymnastics is a biggie, for example, boxing an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lampley, who has helped describe nine Olympics, earlier this
week called the prime-time Games, a ``sort of bait-and-switch,
hide-and-seek, piecemeal coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Those tart bon mots came at an NBC news conference Wednesday to
discuss a makeover of Olympic television.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul does not change much at Mother NBC, which in
Atlanta four years ago was the only way to watch the Olympics. But
by adding MSNBC and CNBC on cable, NBC is providing avenues to show
complete versions of sports ignored or shrunk into highlights in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Lampley, who will host MSNBC's seven hours of daily
coverage. He said that when he tells people ``you're going to see
an entire beach volleyball match, you're going to see the entire
equestrian competition without interruption, in many cases people's
jaws literally dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, CNBC and MSNBC will be on the air 11 hours a day,
catering to the fervent sports fan unsated by NBC's format. But you
may need a vacation to capitalize on this bounty of long-form
sports coverage. CNBC will be on from 5-9 p.m. weekdays and 4-9
p.m. on weekends; MSNBC will be on from 10 a.m. -5 p.m. on weekdays
and 10 a.m.-4 p.m. on weekends (with daily replays at midnight).
</P>
<P>
   ``In all, we are going to broadcast more than 20 different
sports and more than 30 gold medal finals,'' said Molly Solomon,
the coordinating producer of the cable coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The MSNBC-CNBC plan will please those outraged by NBC's minimal
coverage of women's soccer and women's softball _ events won by
United States teams four years ago but largely ignored by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, Australia, where the Olympics begin Sept. 16, MSNBC
will carry every United States women's and men's soccer game, save
the women's semifinal, which will be on NBC. MSNBC will also show
every United States men's baseball and women's softball game.
</P>
<P>
   Cable will be the home to such long-ignored sports as beach
volleyball, rowing, equestrian events, tennis and water polo.
Boxing owns the 5-7 p.m. Eastern block on CNBC every day.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more: 10 days of water polo, four archery
finals and both field hockey finals!
</P>
<P>
   Solomon affirmed the cable philosophy: ``It's not highlights.
It's not featurized segments.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's mantra remains the same _ emotional storytelling. But its
ability to pluck heartstrings from 7 p.m. to midnight for 17 nights
will be tested more than ever because the 15-hour time difference
from Sydney to the Eastern time zone will give fans a half day to
study results before NBC airs the events on tape.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Web site, www.nbcolympics.com, will carry instantaneous
scores (and bios, analysis, diagrams and photographs) but no video,
leaving each and every moving image of prime-time sports to NBC's
discretionary use.
</P>
<P>
   But viewers must wait to see the chosen images of the prime-time
sports. Nothing is being carried live. So, if the men's 100-meter
dash final ends at 11 p.m. in Sydney, that's 8 a.m. the same day in
New York. At the earliest, viewers must wait at least 11 hours to
see it in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NBC is certain that results matter less than the tales,
and prime-time viewers will continue to turn out. NBC's 84{
prime-time hours ``are geared to putting the whole family in front
of the television set,'' said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC
Sports.
</P>
<P>
   A greater effort will be made to reduce the pro-United States
slant of the past coverage. An estimated 48 percent of NBC's
features will look at foreign athletes, 37 percent at Americans.
NBC will also show more foreign anthems being played, rather than
ducking out after Francis Scott Key's tune.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC's effort is still an American TV network's broadcast
back to an American audience, so the jingo bells will still ring
for Team USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be quick to point out that we're alone now amongst
countries of the world that qualify athletes and teams in almost
every single event of the Olympics,'' Ebersol said. ``If we don't
show the Americans who are in all their events, I think that's a
larger mistake for us to make, because we are the American
broadcast network.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's features will still emphasize the struggles endured by
athletes to reach the Olympics. But, Ebersol said, the definition
of a struggle has been narrowed. ``We've downgraded asthma as a
major story of sacrifice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol described occasional debates over how emotional the
storytelling should be, allowing that he is ``more Mantovani than
Bob is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Costas, NBC's prime-time host, said: ``I agreed silently
with some of the criticism of the excess in the past. But when
there is a real story, real drama, that doesn't need violin
strings, that doesn't need manipulation. There's some genuine
emotion to it. That's what the best of Olympic broadcasting is
about.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first three nights, Costas will tell viewers that
everything emanating from Sydney is on tape, an admission that the
``plausibly live'' ruse of 1992 and '96 _ in which events were
taped but viewers were not told _ was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for us to come 100 percent clean and say what
we were going to do,'' Ebersol said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the ``plausibly live,'' which was intended only to
explain that the taped coverage was to be shown as if it were
happening live, ``really turned around and hurt us.''

AFFIRMING INTERNET PRIVACY

<P>
   A decision by the Clinton administration will discourage federal
agencies from using tiny computer files called cookies to identify
computer users. This useful step ought to prompt Internet companies
to protect the privacy of their customers as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of National Drug Control Policy set off a controversy
when newspapers revealed that anyone who visited its Web site on
drug information received an unwanted gift _ a hidden cookie on
their computer. The office had subcontracted the work to the
DoubleClick ad company, which used the cookies to track the number
of visitors to the site.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick stirred up its own controversy last winter when it
tried to link millions of cookies and other information into huge
databases for marketing campaigns. The company backed down, but
fears linger that something intrusive could be done with personal
information available on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the drug site was well timed to remind people of
the dangers of cookies. DoubleClick might have been using them
anonymously, but it is technologically easy to attach people's
names to the computer files. Anonymity is essential on such a
sensitive topic as drug information.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the controversy, the Clinton administration has
decided that cookies will almost never be used on federal Web
sites. Agencies will have to demonstrate a compelling need to gain
an exception from the rule. Some agencies have been slow to respond
to the order, the magazine Wired News reports, but if the White
House keeps the pressure on, they will be sure to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Private Internet companies have yet to adopt a concerted policy
on privacy, one that would discourage the collation of data, be
especially sensitive to such confidential matters as health and
income, yet not inhibit the innocuous use of cookies. There is no
harm in advising customers which goods to purchase, based on their
prior buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission is looking into the privacy issue,
and Representative Edward Markey (D-Mass.) has filed legislation to
establish privacy standards. If the dot-coms do not become
protectors of privacy, then the government will have to police more
than just itself.

MANY HONG KONG PARENTS WANT TO CHOOSE BABIES' SEX

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In an off-the-rack world, Hong Kong remains
stubbornly made-to-measure. Wander into any alleyway off the main
shopping boulevard, Queen's Road, and you can order tailored suits,
personalized Chinese scrolls, custom-designed furniture or handmade
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in one of these narrow streets _ behind locked doors on
the eighth floor of a nondescript office building _ is Anthony S.Y.
Wong's fertility clinic. For $2,450, Wong offers the ultimate in
customized service: He helps parents choose the sex of their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Wong does not advertise, and the sign on his door identifies the
clinic only as the Victory Medical Laboratory. But he is happy to
discuss his treatment, which he says has had an 83 percent success
rate in 100 births since the clinic opened in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a couple has a boy and wants a girl, we help to get them a
girl,'' said Wong, a dapper 44-year-old with a master's degree in
biochemistry and the trace of a British accent. ``If a couple has a
girl and wants a boy, we help them get a boy. We think of this as a
form of family planning.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, more than 90 percent of Wong's customers choose
boys. That has drawn fierce criticism from doctors and politicians,
who say he practices a reckless form of genetic engineering. Last
week Hong Kong's legislature passed a law banning sex selection,
except in cases when it is necessary to prevent the transmission of
a hereditary disease.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be a couple of months before the law takes effect.
In the meantime, Wong says business is booming. The Gender Choice
Center is the only clinic in Hong Kong that offers sex selection,
and couples are rushing to sign up while they can still do it
legally.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, they are laying bare a social phenomenon that is
little discussed but widely prevalent in Hong Kong: the
determination to control virtually every facet of childbirth. From
selecting the sex to scheduling the delivery _ down to the minute,
never mind the day _ people here go to extraordinary lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from Wong's clinic are Chinese medicine shops, which
sell potions made from the antlers and tails of deer. By drinking
these concoctions, men are supposed to become more virile and
increase their chances of fathering a son. Couples also consult
charts that predict the sex of a baby by cross-referencing the
mother's age with the month of conception. A particularly popular
one is said to come from the imperial palace of the Qing dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Western culture, parents do not automatically want a boy,''
said Cyd Ho, a female legislator who opposes sex selection. ``But
in Chinese culture, boys are still the precious gem, particularly
in the eyes of the grandmother. We have to say no to this form of
gender discrimination.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wong is unruffled. ``Sex selection among Chinese people is
nothing new. It has been going on for ages and ages,'' he said.
``The government wants to stop the only method that has been proven
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of disagreement about that. Wong's method, which
was developed by an American doctor, Ronald J. Ericsson, rests on
the assumption that sperm bearing the male, or Y, chromosome swim
faster than sperm bearing the female, or X, chromosome. Ericsson's
innovation was to place the sperm over an albumin-based medium,
which has layers of increasing density.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the sperm that make it to the bottom layer are mostly
male. To increase the odds of a boy, sperm are distilled from that
layer and used to inseminate the prospective mother. To increase
the odds of a female baby, sperm are distilled from less dense
layers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no scientific proof that this works,'' said Kenneth
Mao, a specialist in fertility. ``But it may improve your chances a
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his skepticism, Mao opposes banning the procedure. He
noted that in a few cases it might prevent abortions by couples
desperate not to have a girl. The abortion rate for female babies
is no higher in Hong Kong than in the United States. But elsewhere
in China, boys are so highly prized that parents resort to abortion
and infanticide.
</P>
<P>
   Wong said he had a code of ethics to prevent abuses. He asks
couples to sign a pledge that they will not terminate the pregnancy
if the procedure fails. And he said he does not permit couples to
select the sex of their first baby. The procedure, he says, is
meant to balance families with multiple children.
</P>
<P>
   Wong holds himself up as an example. He and his wife have two
girls, and they dearly wanted a son. By the miracle of sorted
sperm, he said, they had a boy, now 4{.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Wong's precautions are not enough. Without a ban,
such as exists in Britain and some parts of the United States,
disreputable clinics could set up shop like back-alley
abortionists, they say. Even the spread of properly licensed
clinics could lead to a population imbalance, given the Chinese
mania for boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we let this spread far and wide, Hong Kong will be full of
boys,'' Ho said. ``Men will end up having to seek their wives
outside Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the demographic implications, some critics say sex
selection devalues childbirth in a city where people already treat
it like a dentist's appointment, something to be penciled in months
in advance. One obstetrician here said she had lost patients by
refusing to deliver their babies by Caesarean section at the
precise time dictated by a master of feng shui, the ancient art of
choosing auspicious locations and dates for harmonious balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it good enough just to have a baby?'' asked Mak Chung
Man, a Chinese herbalist who treats infertile couples. ``To control
the gender is asking too much. It's like going to a casino and
betting on certain chips.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Wong, he said he would abide by the law. But he noted
that it did not prohibit artificial insemination _ merely the
sorting of sperm. So could he move that part of his operation to
nearby Macao?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're giving me ideas,'' he said quietly.

EUROPEAN FARMERS TURNING TO LAND OF OPPORTUNITY: CANADA, US 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRISHTOWN, Prince Edward Island _ Peter Lauwerijssen, 31, and
his younger brother, John, muscled a wayward Holstein into position
in the state-of-the-art milking parlor. The grunts of beast and men
seemed incongruous among the high-tech fixtures of the huge new
barn, but no amount of digital displays and stainless steel will
ever remove the sweat entirely from farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how we've taken to our new culture?'' Peter boomed. ``We
swear at her in English as well as Dutch. But cows are very
international _ they will ignore you in every language.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated at rising land prices at home and pervasive European
regulation, increasing numbers of farmers from northern Europe,
like the Lauwerijssens, have sought greener pastures in Canada and
the United States. The new wave of agricultural immigration has
been barely noticed on this side of the Atlantic, but is causing
alarm back in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the exodus is not just that farmers are
quitting Europe but that they see North America as still a
boundless field of plenty. That's a sharp contrast to the pessimism
of many farmers in North America, who are struggling through what
some agricultural experts call the worst farm crisis since the
Great Depression. Plummeting wheat prices and other woes have sown
panic in the grain belt, and many farms and ranches in the American
Midwest and the Canadian prairie provinces are on the edge of ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The European newcomers are acutely aware of the economic risks.
But they are confident that the New World remains a promised land
for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, the Lauwerijssen clan _ Peter, his brother, and
their parents, Piet and Mary _ came to a tough realization, one
being being made by thousands of other farmers in Europe's richest
countries these days.
</P>
<P>
   Their Dutch dairy operation, though prosperous enough, held no
real prospect for expansion. Land was too expensive, the
countryside getting too crowded, and the agricultural restrictions
of the European Union becoming too stringent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day to day, we were doing OK. But there was no future,'' Peter
recalled. ``We looked hard at the realities. And then we looked
hard across the ocean. There we could see opportunities like ripe
apples on a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   So the old steading was sold, and every guilder, roughly $4
million, reinvested in 450 red soil acres, farm buildings and
machinery on this Canadian island. Now the tricolor flag of the
Netherlands floats from the beams above the stalls and stanchions
of the gigantic metal barn, a reminder of the old country abandoned
for the new.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus has produced handwringing headlines back home,
exemplied by farm sale earlier this year by one of Holland's
foremost skating champions, Evert Van Benthem, who then took up the
John Deere in Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many farmers are discouraged and deciding to leave,'' said
Henk Letschert, an official of the Dutch Farmers Union. ``Farming
is still a good business in Holland. But we are feeling the loss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad years might be worse than we experience in Europe, but
we believe the good years will be much, much better,'' said Jose
Van Wezel, 31, who with her husband, Jeroen, has invested more than
$2 million in a farm in northern Ohio. They couple and their two
children emigrated from Holland in February. ``Farming is always
about cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked closely at other places in Europe, at France and
even east Germany, but finally decided it should be Canada or the
US,'' she said. ``Here you can you can still dream the big
dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Exact numbers of agricultural immigrants from Western Europe are
hard to pin down since crop growers, dairymen and livestock raisers
are admitted to the US and Canada under a variety of
classifications, often as business entrepreneurs or technicians.
But from a trickle at the outset of the 1990s, the ranks of
arrivers has swollen to many hundreds every year, perhaps
thousands, according to agricultural officials in Canada and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are definitely growing. Just in Ontario we've seen
hundreds of newcomers from Holland alone,'' said Ernie Hardeman,
Ontario's agriculture minister. ``To them, the future of farming
seems brighter in North America... (It's) a vote of confidence in
our agricultural economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new agricultural immigrants are from Great Britain
and Holland, countries where shortages of agricultural land are
becoming most critical and whose independent-minded farmers are
rankled by the omnipresence of the new Eurocracy. Others are also
coming from Denmark, Ireland, Switzerland, and, to lesser extent,
Germany and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring European land costs tend to be the prime pusher. But the
farmers also complain bitterly about the regimen of tight new
environmental controls and agricultural regulations that have come
with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting so you fill out three forms every time a cow
burps,'' said Roger Haynes, who with his wife, Marie, sold their
farm near Stratford-on-Avon, England, in 1997 and purchased 460
acres near Neepawa, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farming is a tough business anywhere you live, but the
pressures on land use in Europe are unbelievable,'' Haynes said.
``Britain is headed for serious agricultural decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes is converting the grain farm to a beef cow operation, but
will also cultivate mixed crops. Before picking Canada, he weighed
Australia and southern Africa, then made seven visits to North
America before making the life-changing leap. It's been a hard go,
but no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The Lauwerijssen family on Prince Edward Island has taken some
brutal licks. Last year, a fire destroyed the cow barn, killing the
entire dairy herd. Their response was to go the bank and borrow
money to build the biggest, most modern barn in Maritime Canada,
finished in April and already a landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``In five years, I expect to double the size of my herd,'' Peter
Lauwerijssen said confidently. ``My brother and I don't want to
`survive' as farmers. We want to be making damn good profits.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey in the Netherlands found that a quarter of the
country's 100,000 farmers have considered moving their operations
abroad, and that 10 percent are actively pursuing possibilities.
The small country _ 15 million people on a land about the size of
Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island combined _ has a proud
agricultural tradition. But with 15 million pigs, 4.5 million cows
and 100 million chickens, not to mention all those tulips, all
living alongside some of Europe's fastest-growing cities and
suburbs, things are getting a mite crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution from manure has roused the wrath of both European
Union regulators and the Dutch public, causing the Ministry of
Agriculture to order pig herds to be cut by 25 percent. Meanwhile,
the average cost of agricultural land shot up 19 percent last year
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same is occurring in Britain, which has suffered the
added whammy of ``mad cow'' disease, which resulted in worldwide
bans on British meat. Farmers there are also embroiled in bitter
disputes over run-off, public access to farmland and other
controversies. Resentment against the European Union also burns
fiercest in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The onslaught of new regulations is proving the final straw
for many,'' said Maurice C. Torr, a transplanted Briton who
specializes as an agricultural real estate broker in Brandon,
Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, Torr reckons, he's helped more than 100
British and Irish farm families relocate to the fertile farm region
of southeast Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about `hobby farmers' amusing themselves
with a rural lifestyle. Nor are we talking about peasants come to
eke out a living,'' he said. ``We are talking about bright,
aggressive, extremely modern farmers investing hundreds of millions
of dollars to start a new life in a new land.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there is friction at all between the newcomers and
their neighbors, it seems to come from the willingness of the
Europeans to quickly embrace new technology and methods _ and their
tendency to regard their new colleagues as a bit spoiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans and Canadians seem a little lazy, not in their
work but their thinking,'' said a Dutch farmer who settled four
years ago in southern Michigan. ``They have access to so much cheap
land, they've never had to farm as intensively (as in Europe). The
techniques and practices here are closer to the techniques and
practices we used 20 or 30 years ago. Just doing your accounts on a
desktop computer doesn't make a modern farm.''

   &QL;  WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, Ext. 218.
WASHINGTON, June 30 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Patients-p
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 51-47, a patients' rights
measure. An amendment to an appropriations bill for federal
agencies, the provision would guarantee some patients access to
emergency room care and allow suits against health management
organizations in federal courts. Supporters said it would offer
greater patient protections than a bill approved last year that
barred lawsuits. Opponents said the measure would not cover all
insured Americans. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: Patients-f
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 47-51, a proposal to apply
patient protections to all insured Americans. The measure would
have been part of an appropriations bill for federal agencies.
Supporters said it would have covered approximately three times the
number helped by the limited patients' rights legislation that
passed. Opponents said the measure would have created a
bureaucratic federal health plan. A ``yes'' vote favors the
provision.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: Sdisc
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 92-6, legislation to require
tax-exempt groups to disclose their finances. The bill, endorsed by
the House on Tuesday, would force political groups to report
contributors and spending. Supporters said it would control
campaign financing. Opponents said the plan would restrict free
speech. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: HRdisc
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday passed, 385-39, a bill to force
tax-exempt groups to disclose donors and expenses. Supporters said
it would control campaign financing. Opponents said the plan would
restrict free speech. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: Rx2000
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 217-214, the Medicare Rx2000
Act. The bill would allow senior citizens to choose among
prescription drug plans managed by insurance companies. Federal
subsidies would ensure that all eligible citizens 65 and older
would be covered. Supporters said that seniors would pay less for
prescription care. Opponents defended uniform Medicare coverage,
denouncing the bill as unworkable. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: Emergency
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 306-110, an $11.2 billion
emergency spending bill. The legislation provides funding for
troops in Kosovo, hurricane relief and drug trafficking prevention.
$1.3 billion would aid the Colombian Army. Supporters argued that
the Colombian provision would stem the flow of drugs into the
United States. Opponents denounced it as an escalation of Central
American military conflict and a poor substitute for drug
rehabilitation and education programs. A ``yes'' vote supports the
measure.

 (For release Monday, July 03, 2000) (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   As Washington and Moscow stumble toward a showdown over American
plans to deploy a national missile defense, their avoidable
confrontation is bringing out the worst in each country's
military-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has objected strenuously to the specter of an American
national missile defense system, threatening to withdraw from all
arms limitation agreements if Washington abandons the 1972 ABM
Treaty for the sake of 100 missile interceptors that, when tested,
could not distinguish warheads from simple decoys outside the
earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   As if Washington's heedless rush toward a technologically
dubious missile defense system were not bad enough, Moscow has
responded with an equally unrealistic proposal to obviate the need
for an American system with a missile defense system of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we need is the political will,'' Russian President
Vladimir Putin said during a recent trip to Berlin, speaking of his
proposal to deploy a missile shield over Russia and Europe, and
perhaps even the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as Putin may have in mind development of a boost-phase
antimissile defense _ one that targets missiles before they escape
the atmosphere, when they are traveling slower than in space and
giving off an easily identifiable heat signature _ his idea would
be worth pursuing cooperatively. But Russian defense officials have
not been very forthcoming in subsequent discussions on boost-phase
cooperation, and US officials insist they need to have some
national antimissile defense in place before 2005, when they fear
North Korea might be able to hit outlying islands of Alaska and
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, existing Russian interceptors around Moscow have
too short a range to protect Europe, much less the United States.
They are nuclear-tipped and meant to work on the principle of
``nuclear direct intercept'' _ to destroy targeted missile warheads
by setting off nuclear explosions within a kilometer of incoming
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in Moscow Times, the independent defense
analyst Pavel Felgenhauer _ who used to serve that function for Red
Star, the paper of the Soviet Red Army _ described the missile
defense system created to protect Moscow:
</P>
<P>
   ``The A-35 system was designed not to protect Moscow per se, but
to disable the first wave of incoming US warheads and give the
Soviet leadership 10 to 15 extra minutes to get airborne and out of
town before all hell breaks loose. Since Moscow was doomed anyway,
close-range nuclear intercept was considered acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is this left-over Soviet system of missile defense of
no use to anyone else, it also stands as a grotesque technological
metaphor for the relation between rulers and ruled in the homeland
of what Soviet officials liked to call ``real existing socialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Felgenhauer went on to explain that the missile defense Putin
has been touting to Europe would not use the A-35 system in place
for Moscow but Russia's ``S-300 long-range anti-aircraft missiles
or more advanced versions of the same weapon to shoot down rogue
missiles during the `boost phase.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since these S-300 missiles, which use shrapnel from conventional
explosives, are designed to bring down aircraft, Felgenhauer
explained, they would be useless against ICBMs _ as useless as
American interceptors whose infrared sensors cannot tell an empty
balloon from one containing a nuclear warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's offer to cooperate on missile defense with Europe, then,
could only be what Felgenhauer called ``the same old Soviet `peace
initiative,' designed to produce cracks in Western ranks . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson for Americans should not be that Russia is
indistinguishable from the imploded Soviet Union. Putin's Russia is
much weaker and has been much more cooperative on security matters.
The lesson should be that America's military-industrial complex, in
pursuing the boondoggle of a missile defense that is not yet
technologically possible, is stimulating its Russian counterpart to
peddle a complementary delusion.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian leaders in both countries need to solicit the
advice of honest, independent scientists and replace delusions with
policies that can truly make both more secure.

RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT ASSERTS MORE CONTROL OVER GAZPROM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's government strengthened its influence Friday
over natural gas giant Gazprom, the nation's biggest company,
loosening the grip of a entrenched management that shareholders say
has ignored their interests and obscured the company's operations.
</P>
<P>
   The government's increased control, which came in a shareholder
vote for a new board of directors, reflects a broader effort by
President Vladimir Putin to exert more authority over the country's
most important companies like Gazprom, which is Russia's biggest
cash-earner and supplier of a quarter of Western Europe's natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a common theme of the Putin presidency _ more
control over state assets,'' said Stephen Sullivan, head of
research at United Financial Group investment bank in Moscow.
``Gazprom is one of the state's major assets and it hasn't been
well served by the company in terms of shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   In the vote for a new board, shareholders tipped the balance to
favor the government, which controls 38.4 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The vote greatly reduced the influence of Gazprom s chief
executive, Rem Vyakhirev, who had wielded tremendous power in the
company. Shareholders also blocked Vyakhirev's proposal to require
a unanimous board vote to oust him as chief executive. Now a simple
majority of the 11-member board can remove him.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser close to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, was elected
chairman, replacing former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who
used to run Gazprom. Over the past year, Chernomyrdin saw his
influence in the company wane. Earlier this week he denied Russian
press reports linking him to corruption charges by the Swiss
prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Minority shareholders won two seats on Gazprom's board,
including the first-ever foreign representative. That helped
strengthen Gazprom's share price, which soared on foreign exchanges
Friday. Local shares closed up more than 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom is one of Russia's most popular companies among foreign
investors. It is a giant, with revenue expected to total $15.9
billion this year, according to United Financial Group. However,
management has not adequately accounted for its vast assets,
investors and analysts say. Of the 546 billion cubic meters of gas
the company produced last year, its annual report accounts for
sales of only 474 billion, according to Moscow-based investment
bank Brunswick Warburg. That means about 13 percent of last year's
production is missing.  &QL;

EUROPEAN FARMERS TURNING TO LAND OF OPPORTUNITY: CANADA, US

<P>
   IRISHTOWN, Prince Edward Island _ Peter Lauwerijssen, 31, and
his younger brother, John, muscled a wayward Holstein into position
in the state-of-the-art milking parlor. The grunts of beast and men
seemed incongruous among the high-tech fixtures of the huge new
barn, but no amount of digital displays and stainless steel will
ever remove the sweat entirely from farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how we've taken to our new culture?'' Peter boomed. ``We
swear at her in English as well as Dutch. But cows are very
international _ they will ignore you in every language.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated at rising land prices at home and pervasive European
regulation, increasing numbers of farmers from northern Europe,
like the Lauwerijssens, have sought greener pastures in Canada and
the United States. The new wave of agricultural immigration has
been barely noticed on this side of the Atlantic, but is causing
alarm back in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the exodus is not just that farmers are
quitting Europe but that they see North America as still a
boundless field of plenty. That's a sharp contrast to the pessimism
of many farmers in North America, who are struggling through what
some agricultural experts call the worst farm crisis since the
Great Depression. Plummeting wheat prices and other woes have sown
panic in the grain belt, and many farms and ranches in the American
Midwest and the Canadian prairie provinces are on the edge of ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The European newcomers are acutely aware of the economic risks.
But they are confident that the New World remains a promised land
for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, the Lauwerijssen clan _ Peter, his brother, and
their parents, Piet and Mary _ came to a tough realization, one
being being made by thousands of other farmers in Europe's richest
countries these days.
</P>
<P>
   Their Dutch dairy operation, though prosperous enough, held no
real prospect for expansion. Land was too expensive, the
countryside getting too crowded, and the agricultural restrictions
of the European Union becoming too stringent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day to day, we were doing OK. But there was no future,'' Peter
recalled. ``We looked hard at the realities. And then we looked
hard across the ocean. There we could see opportunities like ripe
apples on a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   So the old steading was sold, and every guilder, roughly $4
million, reinvested in 450 red soil acres, farm buildings and
machinery on this Canadian island. Now the tricolor flag of the
Netherlands floats from the beams above the stalls and stanchions
of the gigantic metal barn, a reminder of the old country abandoned
for the new.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus has produced handwringing headlines back home,
exemplied by farm sale earlier this year by one of Holland's
foremost skating champions, Evert Van Benthem, who then took up the
John Deere in Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many farmers are discouraged and deciding to leave,'' said
Henk Letschert, an official of the Dutch Farmers Union. ``Farming
is still a good business in Holland. But we are feeling the loss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad years might be worse than we experience in Europe, but
we believe the good years will be much, much better,'' said Jose
Van Wezel, 31, who with her husband, Jeroen, has invested more than
$2 million in a farm in northern Ohio. They couple and their two
children emigrated from Holland in February. ``Farming is always
about cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked closely at other places in Europe, at France and
even east Germany, but finally decided it should be Canada or the
US,'' she said. ``Here you can you can still dream the big
dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Exact numbers of agricultural immigrants from Western Europe are
hard to pin down since crop growers, dairymen and livestock raisers
are admitted to the US and Canada under a variety of
classifications, often as business entrepreneurs or technicians.
But from a trickle at the outset of the 1990s, the ranks of
arrivers has swollen to many hundreds every year, perhaps
thousands, according to agricultural officials in Canada and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are definitely growing. Just in Ontario we've seen
hundreds of newcomers from Holland alone,'' said Ernie Hardeman,
Ontario's agriculture minister. ``To them, the future of farming
seems brighter in North America... (It's) a vote of confidence in
our agricultural economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new agricultural immigrants are from Great Britain
and Holland, countries where shortages of agricultural land are
becoming most critical and whose independent-minded farmers are
rankled by the omnipresence of the new Eurocracy. Others are also
coming from Denmark, Ireland, Switzerland, and, to lesser extent,
Germany and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring European land costs tend to be the prime pusher. But the
farmers also complain bitterly about the regimen of tight new
environmental controls and agricultural regulations that have come
with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting so you fill out three forms every time a cow
burps,'' said Roger Haynes, who with his wife, Marie, sold their
farm near Stratford-on-Avon, England, in 1997 and purchased 460
acres near Neepawa, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farming is a tough business anywhere you live, but the
pressures on land use in Europe are unbelievable,'' Haynes said.
``Britain is headed for serious agricultural decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes is converting the grain farm to a beef cow operation, but
will also cultivate mixed crops. Before picking Canada, he weighed
Australia and southern Africa, then made seven visits to North
America before making the life-changing leap. It's been a hard go,
but no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The Lauwerijssen family on Prince Edward Island has taken some
brutal licks. Last year, a fire destroyed the cow barn, killing the
entire dairy herd. Their response was to go the bank and borrow
money to build the biggest, most modern barn in Maritime Canada,
finished in April and already a landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``In five years, I expect to double the size of my herd,'' Peter
Lauwerijssen said confidently. ``My brother and I don't want to
`survive' as farmers. We want to be making damn good profits.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey in the Netherlands found that a quarter of the
country's 100,000 farmers have considered moving their operations
abroad, and that 10 percent are actively pursuing possibilities.
The small country _ 15 million people on a land about the size of
Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island combined _ has a proud
agricultural tradition. But with 15 million pigs, 4.5 million cows
and 100 million chickens, not to mention all those tulips, all
living alongside some of Europe's fastest-growing cities and
suburbs, things are getting a mite crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution from manure has roused the wrath of both European
Union regulators and the Dutch public, causing the Ministry of
Agriculture to order pig herds to be cut by 25 percent. Meanwhile,
the average cost of agricultural land shot up 19 percent last year
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same is occurring in Britain, which has suffered the
added whammy of ``mad cow'' disease, which resulted in worldwide
bans on British meat. Farmers there are also embroiled in bitter
disputes over run-off, public access to farmland and other
controversies. Resentment against the European Union also burns
fiercest in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The onslaught of new regulations is proving the final straw
for many,'' said Maurice C. Torr, a transplanted Briton who
specializes as an agricultural real estate broker in Brandon,
Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, Torr reckons, he's helped more than 100
British and Irish farm families relocate to the fertile farm region
of southeast Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about `hobby farmers' amusing themselves
with a rural lifestyle. Nor are we talking about peasants come to
eke out a living,'' he said. ``We are talking about bright,
aggressive, extremely modern farmers investing hundreds of millions
of dollars to start a new life in a new land.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there is friction at all between the newcomers and
their neighbors, it seems to come from the willingness of the
Europeans to quickly embrace new technology and methods _ and their
tendency to regard their new colleagues as a bit spoiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans and Canadians seem a little lazy, not in their
work but their thinking,'' said a Dutch farmer who settled four
years ago in southern Michigan. ``They have access to so much cheap
land, they've never had to farm as intensively (as in Europe). The
techniques and practices here are closer to the techniques and
practices we used 20 or 30 years ago. Just doing your accounts on a
desktop computer doesn't make a modern farm.''

ULSTER GIRDS FOR THE RETURN OF `MARCHING SEASON' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ Mad Dog was foaming at the mouth.
Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny ``Mad Dog'' Adair worked himself up into a froth a couple
of weeks ago, spitting as he told how the Irish Republican Army was
driving innocent Protestant families from their homes all over
north and west Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with Mad Dog's story: It wasn't true.
</P>
<P>
   After it emerged that 21 Catholic families had been intimidated
from their homes by the likes of Adair's buddies last month, while
there were no reports of Protestants being forced out, Mad Dog was
forced by his superiors in the Ulster Defense Association to
rescind his threat to shoot Catholics that he had delivered to a
group of reporters with his face hidden by a black ski mask.
</P>
<P>
   Now as all eyes turn Sunday to this sad, angry town, keeping a
leash on Mad Dog and his pack of bitter loyalist thugs is essential
if Northern Ireland is going to emerge from this year's annual
``marching season'' with the peace process intact.
</P>
<P>
   For pro-British loyalists, hardliners who want no part of
accommodating Catholic nationalists who aspire to a united Ireland,
this is their Alamo, their last stand. They have painted this
year's attempt to get a Protestant parade down the
Catholic-dominated Garvaghy Road in apocalyptic terms.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the barrier here, a 20-foot metal gate that
is locked and secured by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and British
troops, Catholics who live in the housing projects on either side
of the Garvaghy Road are as equally adamant that the Orange Order
not be allowed to march the traditional route.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has brought in 2,000 troops to back up the police for
the marching season.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants say they march to commemorate the 17th century
victory of the Protestant William of Orange over the Catholic King
James II, which established the Protestant hegemony in Northern
Ireland that has now crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics say the parade is a display of triumphalist bigotry,
aimed at reminding them who's boss.
</P>
<P>
   With such polarized, opposite views of the same event, there is
no hope for a compromise over the parade, unlike the compromises
that have pushed the political process in Northern Ireland far
along over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last November the Ulster Unionists dropped their demand that the
IRA begin disarming before they would sit in a power-sharing
government with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political representatives. But
the power-sharing government collapsed after just 72 days when the
IRA refused to commit itself to disarming or saying their war was
over.
</P>
<P>
   The unionists compromised again, rejoining the government after
the IRA pledged to allow international inspectors to verify that
its arms remain locked up in hidden dumps, mostly in the Irish
Republic. On Monday, the two international inspectors, former
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and former African National
Congress general secretary Cyril Ramaphosa, announced that they had
inspected several arms dumps and said they were convinced the IRA
was serious about keeping its arms locked up to move the peace
process forward.
</P>
<P>
   But the spirit of compromise that has been so evident in Belfast
this past year is nowhere to be found on the mean streets of
Portadown, the most segregated, bitter place in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The hatred is palpable here, always was. Catholics feel
isolated, sealed off from the rest of the town, and have no
intention of compromising so the Orangemen can enjoy a 15-minute
stroll down the Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen of Portadown, meanwhile, are the most belligerent,
most uncompromising in Northern Ireland. They profess to be a
religious organization, but routinely include loyalist paramilitary
members as part of their entourage. Nearly every year, the
loyalists manage to kill innocent Catholics during their standoff
in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago loyalists set a Catholic home in Ballymoney on
fire, killing three young boys, an act that led to the suspension
of the Orangemen's stand on the field opposite Drumcree Church.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Police Chief Ronnie Flanagan said he feared hardliners
might seek to take over the march this year, producing more
violence. Loyalists have increasingly described this as their final
stand. The Orangemen usually try to march from Drumcree Church down
the Garvaghy Road on the second Sunday of July. But this year, they
formally applied for permission to march twice, this and next
Sunday. Their applications were rejected by the Northern Ireland
Parades Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Police and British military officials see this year's tactics by
the Orangemen as a concerted effort to draw out the standoff even
longer than usual, to stretch police and army resources as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Police are especially worried about ``Mad Dog'' Adair, a
maverick within the Ulster Defense Association, the biggest
loyalist paramilitary group that has, with a few murderous
exceptions, observed a cease-fire since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   According to senior detectives in the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
Adair is a multiple murderer who transformed a Belfast brigade of
UDA gunmen from petty racketeers to an efficient assassination
squad. In the early 1990s, Adair's ability to murder innocent
Catholics and especially a number of Sinn Fein members contributed
to the IRA being forced to consider calling its own cease-fire in
1994, police say.
</P>
<P>
   Adair was imprisoned, on what even republicans saw as cooked up
charges by a police force determined to get him off the street, but
he became a leading advocate for the peace process once in prison.
Some now believe that Adair was mainly interested in getting
himself out of prison, an argument that seems more credible now
that Adair has so publicly opposed the peace process, which he has
dismissed as having become a capitulation to the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Police are worried that Adair and other UDA dissidents have been
able to organize the stragglers left in the Loyalist Volunteer
Force, a vicious, sectarian gang of murderers who were led by Billy
Wright until his murder by Irish republicans in the high-security
Maze Prison in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Wright's new group is headquartered here in
Portadown, where few loyalists have any faith in the peace process.
Wright and his followers had been members of the Ulster Volunteer
Force, the smaller of the two main loyalist paramilitary groups.
But the Ulster Volunteer Force threw him out, and threatened to
kill him and his followers, when Wright opposed the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Ulster Volunteer Force who support the peace
process and dissidents loyal to Wright have been killing each other
in an internecine war over the last few years. Adair, however, has
brought a sense of discipline to the dissidents, as he did when he
took over the UDA on the Shankill Road in Belfast a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   A detective who hates Adair conceded that he ``inspires loyalty
and he gets his men to put their pints aside until they do a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fear among police is that Adair will assume a
legendary status among loyalists as Wright once did, being seen as
the great defender of the besieged Protestant working-class.
</P>
<P>
   This may not only be the last stand of loyalists in a place the
locals call Portydown. It may be Mad Dog's first stand, something
that sends shivers down the spines of those who hoped and may have
even begun to believe that the bad old days and the likes of Billy
Wright were behind them.

FOR `PERFECT STORM' DEVOTEES, EBAY OFFERS THE LADY GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the swirl of The Perfect Storm comes the perfect gift for
the mariner with everything else _ a fuel-guzzling movie prop with
sides of steel, a 360-horsepower diesel engine, a permit to catch
tuna, and a fake name on the stern.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Grace, purchased last year by Warner Brothers and used
to portray the ill-fated fishing boat Andrea Gail, went onto the
Internet auction block Thursday for those Perfect Storm
afficionados who want more than the plastic mackerel and squid
props also for sale at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding on eBay (www.ebay.com) closes July 7. As of Friday
night, the high bid was $86,200.
</P>
<P>
   ``See the movie. Buy the boat,'' teases the WB publicity
literature, and indeed, this baby's loaded. It comes with models of
radars, fishfinders, satellite faxing equipment, and radios that
were not around when the Gloucester, Mass.-based Andrea Gail sank
with all hands in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   How times change. Last September, in deference to the friends
and relatives of the six lost men, movie crews had draped tarps
over the vessel's ``Andrea Gail'' lettering when the cameras were
off. Now the 93-ton prop has become ``the perfect opportunity to
own an important piece of marine and move history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something just a little crass and hit-and-run about
all of this,'' declared Michael Salvi, a former Gloucester
fisherman, reflecting the views of some who remember the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more forgiving, partly because $25,000 from the sale
will be donated to The Gloucester Fund and the people impacted by
the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, profits are part of the game, but those film people were
genuinely sympathetic,'' said Louis Linquata, a fisherman who had
worked with several of the 1991 victims. ``They still are.''
</P>
<P>
   For the future Lady Grace/Andea Gail owner, there's one hitch.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer has to make the pickup in Hamburg, Germany, where the
vessel is headed to participate in the Mid-July European opening of
the film.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Fraser, editor-in-chief of National Fisherman, finds this
a somewhat amusing way to buy a boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to bid for a boat unseen, then fly to another
continent and bring it home,'' he said. ``At least it appears that
you can start fishing part way home.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   While the vessel holds a current permit for tuna, its permit for
sword fishing _ the operation that put the Andrea Gail on the
silver screen _ has expired, according to Kate Naughten, a
spokeswoman for the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the specifications suggest a remarkably dynamic craft.
For example, Warner Brothers lists the boat as 72 feet long. The
Coast Guard registration lists it as 57.9 feet long. Warner
Brothers says the fuel tanks hold 6,000 gallons on one Web page,
and 10,000 gallons on another page. Either way, a 360-horsepower
engine quaffs 12 gallons an hour, and with the going price for
diesel about $1.20 a gallon, the vigilant mariner should think
twice before saying ``fill 'er up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've gonna really have to like the movie to spring for this,
because it's gonna be worse than a Hummer to operate,'' quipped one
fisherman on the Boston Fish Pier.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. The 22-year-old Lady has got her sea legs.
Warner Brothers bought the vessel in early 1999 in Ocean City, Md.,
and almost made a filming date in Los Angeles via the Panama Canal
when an actor's scheduling conflict foiled the shoot. So the vessel
turned around and went all the way back, past Norfolk to Gloucester
for another film date.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back again to southern California after surviving
Hurricane Lenny off Cuba and a breakdown off El Salvador. This
spring the boat returned to Gloucester, and is now en route to
Germany. That's 25,000 miles and change in 17 months, which begins
to rival what the clipper ships did in the early 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   Now Warner Brothers wants someone else to bring the boat home.

 &HT;    Eating on the run, riders are models of efficiency
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Tour de France is the most physically
demanding major sporting event in the world. It's torturous
mountain climbs and desperate sprints contested over 2,255.7 miles
and 21 stages. It's hearts pounding as fast as 200 beats per minute
and legs continuing to churn when they sear with the will-sapping
lactic acid of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tour, Lance Armstrong and the other human engines mounted
on bikes will have to burn massive amounts of fuel to pedal all
those miles. Those who are most efficient at that task have the
best chance of being cloaked in the yellow jersey at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to the physiology of performance,'' said Eddie
Coyle, head of the Human Performance Lab at the University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates vary on just how much daily fuel a Tour de France
rider needs. Some say 7,000 calories, about five times what an
average 150-pound man might need simply to exist. Some say 8,000
calories a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's six hours a day expending up to 9,000 calories every day,
and it's going on day after day,'' said Coyle, who has done
sophisticated measurements on Armstrong and some other elite
endurance athletes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a Men's Health article compared the 8,730 daily
calories consumed by cyclist David Phinney and the intakes of some
other athletes. Then-heavyweight boxer George Foreman wolfed down
4,579 calories in a day, 7-foot San Antonio Spurs basketball star
David Robinson loaded up with 5,030, decathlete Dan O'Brien used
4,213 to fuel his practice in 10 sports, 6-foot-7-inch swimmer Matt
Biondi consumed 4,752, NFL defensive end Bruce Smith 4,074 and
marathoner Steve Spence ate 4,157.
</P>
<P>
   Tour de France riders have to take in as much as they expend
each day because they don't have much else to burn. Armstrong has
about 3 percent body fat.
</P>
<P>
   Typically if a rider starts losing weight on the Tour, he won't
be able to reverse the trend and will be on his way out. The
cyclists all know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be eating or drinking something every 15 minutes when
they're riding. They know exactly how much they need to take in,''
Coyle said. ``The first hour or two is more like a rolling meal.
They'll be handed food from the cars or they'll grab a feed bag, a
bag with a long string.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I eat after the first hour until about an hour to go,''
Armstrong said. ``I eat a lot of simple sugars in the race like
energy bars or cookies. After the race it's complex carbs like
potatoes and pasta.''
</P>
<P>
   During the race, Coyle said riders need to consume 60 grams of
carbohydrates per hour. They'll eat bread and jelly and sandwiches
and a variety of other foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bananas are one of their favorite foods. It's the original
energy bar. It even has a wrapper,'' Coyle said. Bananas also are
rich in potassium, the depletion of which can lead to muscle
cramping.
</P>
<P>
   Sports drinks are popular for replacing lost nutrients and
fluids. It's been estimated that Tour riders sweat away 10 to 12
liters of water a day.
</P>
<P>
   While replenishing food and water is vital for Tour riders,
that's just the basics. What counts is how efficiently they are
able to convert food into energy. Even the very best aren't .300
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 25 percent goes to power the pedals,'' Coyle said. ``The
rest becomes heat. For Lance, less and less goes to heat. We've
seen his efficiency increase by 6 percent in recent years. Before
that he was just average (among elite cyclists).''
</P>
<P>
   Coyle said there are 10 different measures he uses for measuring
cycling performance, with muscle efficiency being just one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one category where he is superhuman, but Lance is
high in everything,'' Coyle said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Armstrong is ``incredible'' when it comes to the
level of lactic acid his muscles produce. He doesn't generate much
of the burning energy sapper, which allows him to work at very high
levels for longer periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   A measure the cycling world likes to use is maximal oxygen
intake or VO2max, which is measured in meters per kilogram of body
weight. According to Coyle, Armstrong's rating is between 80 and
82, which again puts him on the high end, even for elite cyclists.
Tour de France legend Miguel Indurain has been reported to have a
rating between 92 and 95, but Coyle said it's more like 78.
Indurain almost has been said to have a resting heart rate of 28
beats per second, but Coyle said it's in the 40s, like Armstrong's
and many other cyclists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many myths being perpetuated,'' Coyle said.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of three grueling weeks and more than 2,000 miles
should dispel a few.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen, start your human engines.

DROUGHT AND GROWTH POSE CHALLENGES TO WATERING METROPOLITAN
ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALPHARETTA, Ga. _ The long drive leading to the water treatment
plant is bordered by grass that is suspiciously green, with flowers
that are clearly healthy and _ can that be a purely ornamental
fountain recklessly gurgling water in the midst of one of the great
droughts in Georgia history?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK; it's all done with recycled water,'' said Mike
Leonard, the plant's general manager. ``I just wish we could get
everyone to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will probably be many years before the suburban
homeowners of the South begin routinely soaking their gardens with
used bath water. As serious as the drought is _ and in the last
week it has edged farther into neighboring Alabama and South
Carolina _ it is essentially a passing phenomenon, and the warnings
of water system managers like Leonard have still not changed the
basic instincts of Atlanta-area residents to water their sprawling
lawns for hours at a time. (The summer's strict watering
restrictions across the metro region have helped, though.)
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it is the region's stupendous growth, not its
weather, that poses the most serious challenge to its water supply,
putting the Atlanta-Fulton County Water Treatment Plant on the
front lines of the effort to keep the eight-county metropolitan
region of 3.2 million people from running dry. The ring of suburbs
around Atlanta has been one of the fastest-growing settlements in
American history, and the state of Georgia says that at the current
rate of growth, the region will exceed its water capacity in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, himself a suburban resident with a browning lawn, has
seen that growth firsthand at the helm of a gleaming,
state-of-the-art plant that supplies drinking water to about
300,000 people in the section of Fulton County north of Atlanta
city limits. When the plant opened in 1991, it pumped 3.8 billion
gallons of water a year; in 1999, its output more than quadrupled
to 16.8 billion gallons. The county has had to expand the plant
well ahead of schedule to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just keep moving in, and it's all centered right in our
area,'' said Leonard, relaxed in a polo shirt while millions of
gallons of treated water flowed to the region's faucets in pipes
beneath his office. ``And when summer comes, they turn on the
timers on their watering systems and just let them run. This
summer, we really felt it.''
</P>
<P>
   About half of warm-weather water consumption in a suburban area
like North Fulton is poured directly on lawns and gardens, making
suburbanites much bigger water consumers than their city
counterparts. Faced with an extremely dry April and May, homeowners
who rely on the plant turned on their hoses and did not stop, and
Leonard's plant was often unable to keep up with demand. The big
computer screen in his office, which shows graphic representations
of storage tanks and pipelines, spent several days this spring
flashing alarms about dangerously low water pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The plant and the distribution network rushed to keep up, but
many homes in the county had only a trickle of water. A major fire
on one of those days could have caused a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   At Leonard's urging, the Fulton County area outside the city of
Atlanta quickly imposed a ban on watering between 10 a.m. and 10
p.m., but it was not enough _ water levels fell every morning and
every night. Now the county has one of the strictest bans in the
state: outdoor watering can be done only between 10 p.m. and 5
a.m., and then only on alternate days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's working,'' Leonard said. ``For now, we're doing OK. I've
been telling people, dirty's beautiful. If you don't wash your car,
you get a red badge of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard gets to work around 6 a.m. preparing for more water
distribution headaches, but his more pressing concerns are for the
future. Every drop pumped by his plant is sucked directly from the
adjacent Chattahoochee River, the principal water source for a
region without underground aquifers from which to draw. Most of the
other counties and cities farther downstream also draw from the
river and are also planning to step up their use, while Alabama and
Florida are threatening a legal battle if Georgia does not begin to
reduce its reliance on that river and others.
</P>
<P>
   To save water, high-tech plants like the one in North Fulton
will have to begin more processing of treated sewage water, sending
it out to be consumed. But at the same time, the accelerating
development in the region is filling the river with sediment and
pollution, making it even harder to treat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make it past the year 2030, we're going to have to rely on
greater treatment technologies,'' said Pat Stevens, the
environmental planning chief at the Atlanta Regional Commission,
the planning body that encompasses the eight county metro area and
the city of Atlanta. ``It puts a lot of pressure on these plant
managers to come up with solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, 51 and the father of two daughters, is an Atlanta
native who spent his summers as a teen-ager working for the city's
water department, later studying chemistry and business at Mercer
University. He has since become an expert on water quality, serving
as drinking water enforcement chief for the Environmental
Protection Agency before coming to work for Fulton County in 1990.
Much of his job involves finding new ways to use chemicals and
filtering techniques to keep the water pure, like selling cakes of
dried river sediment as compost instead of sending them downstream
for another county to treat.
</P>
<P>
   But Leonard has also become an evangelist for water
conservation, urging businesses to spend money on water-recycling
devices, planting drought-tolerant varieties of grasses and shrubs
around his home and _ since the watering ban _ making a nuisance of
himself around his Alpharetta neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to drive around my neighborhood wondering why all those
people were pouring all that perfectly nice drinking water onto the
ground,'' he said. ``Now I just turn them in.''

PREPARATION FOR CLINTON DISBARMENT TRIAL MOVES FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court filed
suit in Little Rock, Ark., Friday asking a state court to enforce
its recommendation that President Clinton be stripped of his law
license for falsely denying under oath that he had a sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The filing set in motion the preparation for a full-fledged
trial in a Little Rock courtroom, perhaps as early as this fall,
over Clinton's fitness to be a lawyer. The lawsuit before the
Pulaski County Circuit Court became inevitable last month when the
committee said that the president should be disbarred for what it
said was ``serious misconduct'' in his testimony in the sexual
misconduct lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kendall, a Washington lawyer who is representing
Clinton in the Arkansas case, said Friday night, ``We fundamentally
disagree with the complaint filed today and will defend vigorously
against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The case will be heard without a jury. It was first randomly
assigned by a computer Friday to Judge John Ward of the Pulaski
County Circuit Court. But Ward immediately recused himself, noting
that Clinton first appointed him to the bench in 1988, when Clinton
was governor of Arkansas. Ward said in an interview that ``it would
create an impression of impropriety should I accept that case.''
</P>
<P>
   The case will be sent back to the computer to be assigned to
someone else, but court officials acknowledged that it might not be
easy to assign it to an impartial judge.
</P>
<P>
   Judges in Arkansas are elected, but governors fill unexpected
vacancies in the middle of judicial terms. Because Clinton served
as the state's governor for many years, he was able to appoint
dozens of state judges.
</P>
<P>
   Even those he did not initially appoint ran for their seats in
partisan elections and thus are either associated with the
Democratic or Republican parties. Some of the other seven judges on
the court suggested that they would ask to be excused from
presiding over a trial involving Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers have 30 days to respond to the formal
request for disbarment. Court officials said that would mean the
trial could occur as early as this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Professor John DiPippa of the University of Arkansas Law
School at Little Rock said Friday night that finding a suitable and
willing judge was only one of the issues that could delay the
trial. In addition, DiPippa said that Clinton's lawyers would be
able to postpone the trial perhaps even until the president left
office by filing various motions.
</P>
<P>
   If the trial occurred while Clinton was still president, he
probably would not appear on his own behalf. When the committee
reached its conclusion recommending disbarment, Clinton said that
his lawyers would mount a vigorous defense, but that he would not
participate personally while still in office.
</P>
<P>
   Dipippa said that no matter what the judge decides, the ruling
may be appealed directly to the state Supreme Court. He added that
such cases are routinely appealed whether the trial judge decides
in favor or against the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the case against Clinton involves his testimony
during a January 1998 deposition in Paula Jones' sexual misconduct
suit. In the presence of the federal judge presiding over the case,
Susan Webber Wright, he said that he did not have sexual relations
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   That August, he told a federal grand jury that he did, in fact,
have an inappropriate intimate relationship with Lewinsky. Wright
cited Clinton for contempt of court, fined him and recommended that
the state Supreme Court consider disciplinary action against him.

 &HT;    Armstrong ready to ride
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ On a sun-splashed Sunday afternoon in
Paris last July 25, the director of the Tour de France actually
smiled at the notion of a brash, tough-talking Texan winning his
country's quintessential sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100,000 fans lining the Champs Elysees that day
to watch Lance Armstrong take his celebratory victory stroll past
the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe, there appeared to be as
many people waving Lone Star and American flags as there were
flag-waving fanatics from rabid cycling countries such as France,
Italy and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance Armstrong is the best winner the Tour can imagine,''
proclaimed Tour director Jean Marie LeBlanc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebirth of Armstrong is amazing and is good for the
rebirth of the Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc was keenly aware then that Armstrong, a survivor of
testicular cancer, was the feel-good story the event needed to
distance itself from drug allegations that threatened the race's
existence the year before.
</P>
<P>
   That feel-good story opens a new chapter today when the
three-week-long Tour begins with the traditional prologue, a
9.9-mile mini time trial in Futuroscope. The scientific-themed
amusement park about 200 miles southwest of Paris was the site of
Armstrong's fourth stage victory in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 180 participants representing 20 teams from eight countries
will compete in 21 stages over 23 days. Those who finish the
grueling race will ride 2,255.7 miles, starting southwest of Paris,
then turning north to Britany, before heading back to the center of
the country for the Tour's relatively easy, flatter stages. Then
the riders will head south to the Pyrenees mountains, with steeper
climbs ahead of them in the French Alps. The cyclists will stray
briefly into Switzerland and Germany before heading back to the
final stage in Paris, which starts at the Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   This year's route promises to be more punishing than 1999, with
more treacherous mountain climbs and fewer flatter stages.
Armstrong, who excels in time trials, also is an excellent climber.
He won the first mountain stage of the 1999 Tour, with the victory
basically cementing his title more than a week before the cyclists
got to the finishing stage in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, speaking last week by phone from his spring-summer
home in Nice, France, wouldn't predict a repeat victory. But he
talked as if there were no doubts in his mind that he would claim
another Tour for the U.S. Postal Service team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better than I did last year,'' Armstrong said.
``Mentally, I'm more aware of what I need to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I had no idea I really could win the Tour. I never
thought I could do that. I was really surprised when I won it. Now,
I know I can do it because I know what I had to do last year.''
</P>
<P>
   He was more emphatic about his ever-growing confidence when he
arrived in Futuroscope this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, I'm not as nervous as I was last year,''
Armstrong said. ``My life is pretty comfortable right now.
Fatherhood has helped calm me down when it comes to racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have watched Armstrong continue to develop since last
year's momentous achievement say he should be the undisputed
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, Lance is at least as good as last year, and
mentally he is stronger than last year,'' said Johan Bruyneel, the
director of Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's even better than he was last year,'' said Chris
Carmichael, Armstrong's longtime coach. ``He's ready to go. He's
another year removed from the cancer. And he won the race last
year, so he will be really confident.''
</P>
<P>
   BEST-SELLER MATERIAL
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's Tour preparation has been no different from last
year. He again rode all of the Tour's routes during his training
sessions, a feat that once was unthinkable in international cycling
circles, concentrating especially on the climbs. Until the 1999
Tour, most top competitors had been dependent on others to map out
the route of each stage. Armstrong took out the middleman so that
he would be familiar with every nuance when he rides the routes for
real.
</P>
<P>
   The only negative training episode occurred in late May, when he
suffered a mild concussion. The injury, which Armstrong suffered
after a downhill crash on a training run in the French Alps, made
international headlines. After spending a night in the hospital and
a weekend off his bike, he was competing again, finishing third in
the Classique des Alps and the Dauphine Libere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my crash was overblown,'' Armstrong said. ``I
recovered more quickly than they thought I could. It definitely set
things back some. But it was probably a good thing. I was maybe
ahead of schedule (before the crash). So it came at a good time.
Now if I had to spend 10 days off my bike, then it would have hurt
my training for the Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparation aside, nothing else has been the same for the
28-year-old since that July afternoon when he won the Tour, the
third most popular sporting event in the world behind the Olympics
and soccer's World Cup. Even the French media, which never has
warmed up to Armstrong's American habits, applauded Armstrong's
achievement, with L'Equipe, the French daily sports newspaper,
calling his feat the ``comeback of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the bike, Armstrong has become a father _ his son, Luke
David, was born in October _ and a best-selling author. His book,
``It's Not About the Bike,'' ranked ninth on Sunday's New York
Times best-sellers' list for non-fiction.
</P>
<P>
   LIFE IS RICH
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong last was in Austin in April for his ``Ride for the
Roses'' weekend to raise money for the Lance Armstrong Foundation.
His wife, Kristin, stayed an extra week to oversee the selling of
their mansion on Lake Austin, a home he designed and had built in
1996. The home, which he named ``Casa Linda'' to honor his mother,
Linda Armstrong, was completed five months before he was diagnosed
with advanced testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to sell the house,'' he said. ``The thing was, I
wasn't really there for the sell. It wasn't like there was this day
that I sort of walked out and said, `This is it, I'll never be
back.' But earlier in the season, when I left for France in
February, I had a feeling that it would be the last night in my
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely cared a lot for that house.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he returns to Austin this fall, his family, which also
includes a yellow tabby cat named Chemo and a small white Maltese
named Boone, temporarily will live in a house in Tarrytown.
Sometime soon, the Armstrongs will finish plans for their home near
Lake Travis, which will have more privacy than the previous one,
which was accessible to every boater sailing by on Lake Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's wealth also has increased about seven times since
his Tour win. He is expected to make about $7 million this year,
roughly the same salary as Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman.
According to Bill Stapleton, Armstrong's Austin-based agent, $5
million of his client's annual income has come from endorsements.
His salary with U.S. Postal was $500,000 before his Tour win. It
has been renegotiated to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has lent his name to several high-profile companies.
He has been featured in eight national television commericals
representing Nike (three), American General Insurance, AIM Mutual
Funds, Wheaties, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Bridge Information
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of his marketing deals have come from American
companies. In the winter off-season, Armstrong proved to be a
popular speaker, with companies paying up to $100,000, plus
first-class expenses for two, to get Armstrong to appear at their
functions. Before the Tour, Armstrong's asking price was $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's the favorite to repeat his Tour victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have asked which one would be harder to win, the first
one or the second one,'' he said. ``That's a good question. It was
hard to win the first one because I'd never done it before. The
second one, I don't have the anonymity as I did last year. When
you're the defending champion, you're a marked man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I made my comeback from cancer. If you compare that
to repeating as defending champion, I think coming back from cancer
and winning the first one was definitely harder. This one should be
a little easier.''

FOR `PERFECT STORM' DEVOTEES, EBAY OFFERS THE LADY GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the swirl of The Perfect Storm comes the perfect gift for
the mariner with everything else _ a fuel-guzzling movie prop with
sides of steel, a 360-horsepower diesel engine, a permit to catch
tuna, and a fake name on the stern.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Grace, purchased last year by Warner Brothers and used
to portray the ill-fated fishing boat Andrea Gail, went onto the
Internet auction block Thursday for those Perfect Storm
afficionados who want more than the plastic mackerel and squid
props also for sale at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding on eBay (www.ebay.com) closes July 7. As of Friday
night, the high bid was $86,200.
</P>
<P>
   ``See the movie. Buy the boat,'' teases the WB publicity
literature, and indeed, this baby's loaded. It comes with models of
radars, fishfinders, satellite faxing equipment, and radios that
were not around when the Gloucester, Mass.-based Andrea Gail sank
with all hands in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   How times change. Last September, in deference to the friends
and relatives of the six lost men, movie crews had draped tarps
over the vessel's ``Andrea Gail'' lettering when the cameras were
off. Now the 93-ton prop has become ``the perfect opportunity to
own an important piece of marine and move history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something just a little crass and hit-and-run about
all of this,'' declared Michael Salvi, a former Gloucester
fisherman, reflecting the views of some who remember the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more forgiving, partly because $25,000 from the sale
will be donated to The Gloucester Fund and the people impacted by
the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, profits are part of the game, but those film people were
genuinely sympathetic,'' said Louis Linquata, a fisherman who had
worked with several of the 1991 victims. ``They still are.''
</P>
<P>
   For the future Lady Grace/Andea Gail owner, there's one hitch.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer has to make the pickup in Hamburg, Germany, where the
vessel is headed to participate in the Mid-July European opening of
the film.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Fraser, editor-in-chief of National Fisherman, finds this
a somewhat amusing way to buy a boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to bid for a boat unseen, then fly to another
continent and bring it home,'' he said. ``At least it appears that
you can start fishing part way home.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   While the vessel holds a current permit for tuna, its permit for
sword fishing _ the operation that put the Andrea Gail on the
silver screen _ has expired, according to Kate Naughten, a
spokeswoman for the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the specifications suggest a remarkably dynamic craft.
For example, Warner Brothers lists the boat as 72 feet long. The
Coast Guard registration lists it as 57.9 feet long. Warner
Brothers says the fuel tanks hold 6,000 gallons on one Web page,
and 10,000 gallons on another page. Either way, a 360-horsepower
engine quaffs 12 gallons an hour, and with the going price for
diesel about $1.20 a gallon, the vigilant mariner should think
twice before saying ``fill 'er up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've gonna really have to like the movie to spring for this,
because it's gonna be worse than a Hummer to operate,'' quipped one
fisherman on the Boston Fish Pier.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. The 22-year-old Lady has got her sea legs.
Warner Brothers bought the vessel in early 1999 in Ocean City, Md.,
and almost made a filming date in Los Angeles via the Panama Canal
when an actor's scheduling conflict foiled the shoot. So the vessel
turned around and went all the way back, past Norfolk to Gloucester
for another film date.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back again to southern California after surviving
Hurricane Lenny off Cuba and a breakdown off El Salvador. This
spring the boat returned to Gloucester, and is now en route to
Germany. That's 25,000 miles and change in 17 months, which begins
to rival what the clipper ships did in the early 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   Now Warner Brothers wants someone else to bring the boat home.

AGASSI SURVIVES BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MARTIN'S NERVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ A handful of games into Andre Agassi's
unnerving fifth-set slide toward extinction Friday, the
introspective soul-searcher stopped his service motion to allow a
bird to swoop into Center Court, circle, and then exit.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the carrier pigeon that he was looking for. There was
no message to help Agassi decode the unassuming but unrelenting
Todd Martin as he continued to plunge into a 2-5 chasm.
</P>
<P>
   But on his way to saving two match points, Agassi came to rely
on Martin's demons to aid his tense and improbable 6-4, 2-6, 7-6
(3), 2-6, 10-8 escape on the fifth day of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   From across the net, the second-seeded Agassi watched his U.S.
counterpart lose his nerve on returns, try too much on second
serves and begin missing forehand volleys on floating returns that
dangled in front of Martin's eyes like soap bubbles. It was like
1996 again, when in the semifinals at Wimbledon, Center Court
became a burial site for Martin's composure when he failed to close
out MaliVai Washington after taking a 5-1 lead in the fifth and
final set, only to lose by what is now the hauntingly familiar
score of 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is possible for players to develop certain
reputations where you can count on certain weaknesses,'' Agassi
said. ``I wouldn't put the label `choking' on Todd. While there was
a certain opportunity he definitely let go of, it takes a lot more
than one time before you feel like that's actually a weakness of a
certain player.
</P>
<P>
   ``So at 5-2 down, while I was aware of the fact that he's
managed to do that here before on Center Court, I certainly didn't
expect it. But when I got the break with the double fault at
30-all, it did start crossing my mind, `Make him play, at least
make him win it.'''
</P>
<P>
   It took a while. A 3 hour47 minute match that was suspended by
rain after three sets and one game of play Thursday night finally
ended after a 70-minute fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   The resilience of Pete Sampras, the defending champion, was not
tested Friday. After tendinitis crept into his lower left shin
Wednesday, Sampras was given another day of rest when his
third-round match with Justin Gimelstob was postponed until
Saturday due to rain.
</P>
<P>
   The elements also washed out Venus Williams' third-round match.
Between rain delays, Venus sat as a hooded spectator for her
sister's match against Cristina Torrens-Valero. Against a backdrop
of wild applause, Serena Williams walked onto Court One in her
white warm-up jacket, with her first name stitched stylishly across
the back. It might as well have been a heavyweight boxer's shiny
silk robe. With 12 aces, Serena Williams unleashed a flurry of
power to dismiss the Spaniard, 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking good, and I'm feeling good,'' said Serena
Williams, looking for her second Grand Slam after winning the U.S.
Open last summer. ``I think that I'm actually doing a lot of things
better than I was at the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up to Williams at the U.S. Open was taking note.
Understanding how sharp she'll have to be to get past Williams
should they meet in the semifinals, Martina Hingis made quick work
of the 22nd-ranked Silvija Talaja of Croatia, 6-2, 6-2, to advance
to the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a great situation here,'' said Hingis, who was defeated
in the first round here last year. ``I have nothing to defend. I
just can get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring an upset, Hingis and Venus Williams will meet in the
quarterfinals. Friday, jumping ahead was a matter of reflex.
Because for another day, the American dream final of Sampras and
Agassi still has life after Martin experienced a re-creation of his
1996 collapse on Center Court. Visibly drained from his unthinkable
finish, Martin couldn't deny the similarities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, for sure, there were points where I got tight, and those
were critical points,'' said Martin, who was serving for the match
at 5-2 in the fifth set but double faulted at 30-all. ``From there,
you know, I tried to keep '96 in my mind so I could draw from the
positives that I found from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't do it again. That was part of it. I was trying not to
think so much about, `OK, you're up, 5-2, you're serving at
15-all.' You say, `What's the best way to win this point?' Then, at
30-all, I overhit my first serve, and on the second serve I said,
`You know, let's be aggressive with it.' I remember that's the
thing I struggled with most a few years ago. I was aggressive with
it, and I didn't make it. Sort of live by the risks, die by the
risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he had a 5-3 lead and two match points on Agassi's serve.
But he allowed one second serve by Agassi to handcuff him, and then
lost control of a volley.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the serve, it ended up taking a little bit of a low bounce
and sliding a little bit,'' Martin said. ``I think if I was a
little more composed and a little bit more relaxed, then I can
adjust to that ball and get it in play.''
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't unwind, though, and Agassi drew life from Martin's
distress. He took advantage of a backhand by Martin that died into
the net for a break point to tie the fifth set at 5-5. Then Agassi
continued his run of four straight games by changing his tactics _
coming in on one point, staying back on the next _ to go up, 6-5.
Although Martin steadied himself to hold serve in front of a crowd
that stirred each time Agassi was in peril, he couldn't hold it
together through the end.
</P>
<P>
   On the 18th game of the fifth set, Agassi watched Martin send a
backhand into the net for the final break he needed, the one that
gave him the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I needed a little help from him at 5-2 down,''
Agassi said. ``I was very lucky to get back into that match.''

 &HT;    Armstrong's plan shouldered by his mountain men
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As the U.S. Postal Service riders gathered at
Futuroscope for the start of the Tour de France, Kevin Livingston
was asked via telephone about the team's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall plan is to get into Paris with Lance wearing the
yellow jersey,'' Livingston chuckled. ``The Tour, you have to
respect it. It's a three-week race. There are too many variables.
So much can happen. We'll have to see how the race plays out. But
if you're going to win, you have to win the hard days.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the hard days in the Tour are the climbs, and the
route this year is more demanding than the one on which Armstrong
pedaled to triumph last year.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven climbs so severe they are rated ``beyond
classification'' in this Tour and they all fall from July 10-July
16 as the Tour hits the Pyrenees and then the Alps. The most
picturesque, storied and character testing should be on Mont
Ventoux, a 6,260-foot-high lump of heartbreak dubbed the ``Giant of
Provence.''
</P>
<P>
   It's on such climbs that Livingston will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest job should be to make sure Lance has some teammates
in the mountains,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Tyler Hamilton are the team's specialist in that area.
George Hincapie, Frankie Andreu and Viatcheslav Ekimov are better
on flat terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The main job of all members of the team, which also includes
Cedric Vasseur, Benoit Joachim and Steffan Kjaergaard, is to aid
and protect Armstrong. It is not an easy task. It's believed that
helpers, or ``domestiques,'' who ride in front to break the wind
for the team's leader, expend 30 percent more energy in an an event
that already taxes the body to its limits.
</P>
<P>
   Coordinating U.S. Postal's strategy for the Tour is its
director, John Bruyneel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day we talk. We try to make a strategy and then see what
happens,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston added that as the day's race develops, sometimes an
experienced rider like Andreu will make a quick strategy decision.
More likely, though, decisions will be made from a car armed with a
radio, television and communications system.
</P>
<P>
   The riders are all plugged into radios.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty amazing,'' Livingston said. ``They're about as big
as a credit card and as thick as three credit cards. The mic is
clipped on the jersey. You pinch it to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The riders can all talk to each other, not just the director.
The team will be linked just as tightly on the 43-mile fourth
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a team time trial this year. We have to step up so
that it doesn't hinder Lance and hopefully even helps him,''
Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston and another U.S. Postal rider, Christian Vande Velde,
both suffered fractured collarbones earlier in the season. Vande
Velde appeared to have recovered from that only to be sidelined by
an infected and swollen area near his tailbone, believed to have
been caused by a particularly nasty spider bite. He has been
replaced by Kjaergaard for the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said, ``In terms of the injury, I'm fully recovered.
Once I got back on the road I started training pretty hard. I don't
feel like I lost too much.''

TOYSMART SELLING CUSTOMER DATABASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ In what may be an increasingly common scenario
in the dot-com world, personal information on thousands of
Toysmart.com customers has been put up for sale in potential
violation of Toysmart's own privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection
in June, is planning to sell customer information to settle its
debts with creditors, confirmed David Lord, chief executive of the
Waltham, Mass. online toy seller.
</P>
<P>
   Lord also said his company was contacted last week by the
Federal Trade Commission about the sale of Toysmart's customer
list. Lord said his company is negotiating a settlement with the
FTC, which just weeks ago lobbied Congress for stronger legislation
to protect consumer privacy over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For Toysmart, the dilemma is between selling its customer list
to pay back more than $20 million in debt, and keeping its pledge
not to share customer information with outside parties. It is a
problem that could become more common as dozens of online retailers
appear headed for financial failure, privacy advocates warn.
</P>
<P>
   As Toysmart's attorneys scramble to untangle its unanticipated
quandary, lawmakers and privacy advocates are quick to condemn
Toysmart's plans to sell its customer list.
</P>
<P>
   In a searing statement released Friday, TRUSTe, an industry
watchdog based in San Jose, Calif., said it ``believes that the
sale of this data is ethically wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line here is we believe this is an invasion of
privacy,'' said Bob Lewin, executive director of TRUSTe, which has
more than 2,000 corporate members, including Yahoo!, Lycos,
Microsoft Corp., and Excite(at)Home.
</P>
<P>
   Lewin's comments were extraordinary since Toysmart is a member
of TRUSTe.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Jane Swift, who has adopted a strong
consumer privacy plank, said she is searching for a legal remedy to
either prevent the sale or, failing that, to require that all
customers on the list be notified of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Office of Consumer Affairs is looking into this,'' said
Swift, who also happens to be a Toysmart customer, having purchased
an ant farm and a Winnie the Pooh drum for her godchildren last
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   FTC officials declined to comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy experts say customers of Toysmart volunteered personal
information based on the company's pledge not to share or sell that
data. Toysmart's policy, posted on the company's Web site, states,
``When you register with toysmart.com, you can rest assured that
your information will never be shared with a third party.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates are also concerned that anyone buying the list
_ which contains names, home addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone
numbers and order information _ will not be bound by Toysmart's
privacy policies because the list will have been purchased during a
bankruptcy court proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a huge loophole,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director
of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, D.C.,
and a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. ``We
simply don't think companies should have the right to sell customer
data in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a scenario that will inevitably be repeated as numerous
Internet commerce Web sites head towards financial doom and are
left with little more than their customer lists as assets. In an
era where information is power, such lists are coveted by
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Lord said several companies have expressed interest in buying
the Toysmart list, but all are ``family oriented companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not sell our information to an inappropriate
organization,'' Lord said. ``We reserve the right to accept or
reject any bid. We will not alienate our customers, not while I'm
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart attorney Harry Murphy, of Hanify &AMP; King in Boston, said
the company is ``working with the FTC to reach a resolution that is
satisfactory to both the FTC and the company.'' Possible remedies
could include selling the list to another toy company that promises
to commit to specific privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Steer, a spokesman for TRUSTe, said the case is
precendent-setting and points to a potential ``information Valdez''
in which the personal data of millions of people who buy products
online from retailers that later go bankrupt can be scattered far
and wide without the consumers' knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more companies go belly up, this type of incident can
happen again and again,'' Steer said. ``So it's important that we
plug this up now before we end up with an information Valdez where
personal and private information are uncontrollably spilled out.''
</P>
<P>
   The world of online retailing is widely known to be in the midst
of a financial shakeout with many companies expected to fail in the
next few months. As they go under, many will be tempted to sell
their customer data to help pay debts.
</P>
<P>
   London-based Boo.com, for example, sold data on 350,000
customers to Fashionmall.com after going out of business earlier
this year. Another online casualty, CraftShop.com, is actively
seeking a buyer for its customer data, despite a vow on the
company's Web site to ``never release it to any person or any
company for any purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   These promises, some point out, were written without considering
the possibility of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be funny for a Web site to say, `We promise to
protect your privacy unless we go out of business,' '' said John
Zittrain, professor at Harvard Law School. Zittrain said customer
information is routinely sold by non-Internet businesses, from
catalog companies to medical practices, making the Toysmart case
somewhat ambiguous. ``This is not a slam dunk for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is a sale of Toysmart's customer list, given the
hailstorm of criticism that has fallen on the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not advise my client to purchase this list because of
the numerous, highly sensitive privacy related issues,'' said an
attorney who represents a Toysmart creditor and who declined to be
identified. ``In this case, what comes to mind is a hornet's
nest.''

GORE, IN INTERVIEW, ASSAILS PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attacking the pharmaceutical industry for engaging
in ``corporate chutzpah'' and for ``gouging the consumer
unfairly,'' Vice President Al Gore said Friday that he would take
on the drug manufacturers next week at campaign stops in
battleground states from California to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the veranda of his home here, Gore cast
himself as a longtime critic of the industry's excessive prices and
profits. He does, in fact, have a long record on the topic, dating
to his days as a young Tennessee congressman in the early 1980s,
when he played a crucial role in defeating legislation that would
have granted patent extensions on lucrative medicines.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore is dusting off his congressional record and past
speeches to stake out policies at odds with the manufacturers. But
a careful review of his record, and a detailed talk with the vice
president himself, makes clear that his views are more nuanced than
his fiery rhetoric suggests. And some of the same drug companies
that Gore now criticizes have hired his friends and advisers to
represent them as lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Gore's positions have been embraced by the
pharmaceutical industry. For instance, pharmaceutical manufacturers
are among the biggest beneficiaries of the government's tax credit
for research and development, and Gore favors legislation that
would make that credit permanent. While he argued for greater
disclosure of the industry's pricing practices, the vice president
allowed that some information probably should remain proprietary.
And Gore has also been a strong supporter of the biotechnology
industry, which through collaborations and mergers is increasingly
becoming part and parcel of the prescription drug business.
</P>
<P>
   With his heightened, anti-industry rhetoric that consumers are
``being ripped off'' by drug makers, the vice president is
positioning himself as a champion of a far-reaching Medicare
prescription drug benefit for senior citizens. He is also
attempting to sharpen the political distinctions between himself
and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who supports a benefit that would
rely more heavily on private insurers _ an approach the industry
favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself as a basher of the pharmaceutical
companies,'' the vice president said. ``I see myself as opposing
the excesses that have accompanied their enormous market power,
excesses that have come at the expense of consumers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Industry lobbyists say privately that they have mixed feelings
about Gore. His support for innovation and new technology endears
him to them, and he is not nearly as strident a critic as the Green
Party candidate, Ralph Nader. But industry executives are becoming
increasingly nervous about Gore as the presidential campaign
progresses. And when asked about Friday's escalating attack, their
trade association responded in kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly sad to hear the vice president arguing for reducing
incentives for biomedical innovation,'' said Alan F. Holmer,
president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, in a statement. ``If his rhetoric became government
policy, patients would suffer. Thankfully, no one will be fooled by
political posturing four months before an election.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is reflected in the financial contributions the
two major presidential contenders have received. To date, Bush's
campaign has received $221,715 from pharmaceutical company
executives, while Gore has received $50,700, election records show.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry is one of the nation's most
lucrative, and secretive, businesses. It consistently ranks as the
most profitable industry in the Fortune 500 list of companies; in
1999, the industry's net profit after taxes was 18.9 percent of
revenues, as compared with 15.8 percent for the next most
profitable industry, and 5 percent overall, according to a recent
compilation by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers argue that their prices are justified by the high
costs, and extreme risks, of researching and developing new
medicines. And they say they need substantial profits to plow back
into research and development, clearing the way for the next
generation of wonder drugs. From the industry's perspective, any
threat to profits or drug prices is a threat to innovation.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has not made the prescription drug issue a
cornerstone of his campaign, one of his top health advisers said
this week that the Texas governor is philosophically opposed to
tampering with the industry's ability to develop life-saving
medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that would dampen innovation, particularly price
controls, ought to be avoided,'' said Dr. Bill Roper, who was a top
health official in the administration of Bush's father, and is now
dean of the School of Public Health at the University of North
Carolina. ``We need to trust the marketplace,'' he added. The Bush
campaign did not make the Texas governor available for an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Friday that he, too, is opposed to regulating drug
prices, or profits. ``I don't see it as the government's role,'' he
said. But he does say the industry's profits are out of line, and
he favors policies that would, in effect, cut into profits and curb
prices.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gore said he supported a legislative amendment,
recently passed by the House of Representatives, that would require
the drug companies to agree to reasonable prices for drugs that are
invented in collaboration with government scientists.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 90 such collaborations underway with the
National Cancer Institute alone. But the industry has consistently
opposed a reasonable drug pricing clause, and its protests were a
main reason why the National Institutes of Health abandoned such a
provision in 1995. ``If I had been in the Congress, I certainly
would have voted for it,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, Gore supports the idea of requiring drug
companies to pay a fee to the government for medicines developed
with the help of government grants. Some of today's top-selling
drugs got their start in the federally financed laboratories of
university scientists, and Gore said that the public ``ought to
have some right not to be gouged on the purchase of products that
they themselves helped to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the vice president favors a proposed rule that
would make it more difficult for companies to use the regulatory
process to delay competition _ a rule the industry opposes. And he
is against a highly publicized provision that has been circulating
in Congress to extend the patent for Claritin, the top-selling
allergy medication.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's stance on Claritin puts him somewhat at odds with one of
his closest advisers and friends, Peter Knight. Last year,
Claritin's manufacturer, Schering-Plough Corp., hired Knight to
help develop a lobbying campaign for the patent extension, among
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Knight has since given up his lobbying business, and Gore
insisted today that he has never talked with Knight, or other
friends who have represented drug companies, about pharmaceutical
issues. ``All the positions I've taken,'' he said, ``are against
their clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was clearly well-briefed for the hour-long interview, and
seemed to relish the opportunity to go on the offensive against an
industry he has long taken an interest in. At one point, he reached
back to recall the private meeting he had 18 years ago with Rep.
Richard Bolling, the powerful chairman of the House rules committee
_ a meeting that led to the defeat of the patent extension
legislation the industry coveted.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gore said, he was particularly irked that the
industry refused to make public data that would have supported its
position. ``It was the most astounding example of corporate
chutzpah I had ever run across,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a serendipitous moment for the vice president, his
11-year-old black labrador, Shiloh, wandered onto the veranda
midway through the conversation to nuzzle against his leg. As it
happens, Shiloh takes medicine for arthritis. ``This dog here,''
Gore said, ``gets a cheaper price for the same drug than humans.''

   &QL;  WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, Ext. 218.
WASHINGTON, June 30 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Patients-p
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 51-47, a patients' rights
measure. An amendment to an appropriations bill for federal
agencies, the provision would guarantee some patients access to
emergency room care and allow suits against health management
organizations in federal courts. Supporters said it would offer
greater patient protections than a bill approved last year that
barred lawsuits. Opponents said the measure would not cover all
insured Americans. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: Patients-f
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 47-51, a proposal to apply
patient protections to all insured Americans. The measure would
have been part of an appropriations bill for federal agencies.
Supporters said it would have covered approximately three times the
number helped by the limited patients' rights legislation that
passed. Opponents said the measure would have created a
bureaucratic federal health plan. A ``yes'' vote favors the
provision.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: Sdisc
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 92-6, legislation to require
tax-exempt groups to disclose their finances. The bill, endorsed by
the House on Tuesday, would force political groups to report
contributors and spending. Supporters said it would control
campaign financing. Opponents said the plan would restrict free
speech. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: HRdisc
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday passed, 385-39, a bill to force
tax-exempt groups to disclose donors and expenses. Supporters said
it would control campaign financing. Opponents said the plan would
restrict free speech. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: Rx2000
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 217-214, the Medicare Rx2000
Act. The bill would allow senior citizens to choose among
prescription drug plans managed by insurance companies. Federal
subsidies would ensure that all eligible citizens 65 and older
would be covered. Supporters said that seniors would pay less for
prescription care. Opponents defended uniform Medicare coverage,
denouncing the bill as unworkable. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: Emergency
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 306-110, an $11.2 billion
emergency spending bill. The legislation provides funding for
troops in Kosovo, hurricane relief and drug trafficking prevention.
$1.3 billion would aid the Colombian Army. Supporters argued that
the Colombian provision would stem the flow of drugs into the
United States. Opponents denounced it as an escalation of Central
American military conflict and a poor substitute for drug
rehabilitation and education programs. A ``yes'' vote supports the
measure.

AGASSI MARATHON AGAINST MARTIN GIVES SAMPRAS A REST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ There was a break in the action, except for Andre
Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours 45 minutes into a match that had begun the previous
night and seemed intent on stretching into the next one, the
competitors, spectators, theatrics, and heroics were well past the
point of exhaustion during this changeover at Wimbledon's Centre
Court Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And here came Agassi racing to his seat as if he were playing a
game of musical chairs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tossup as to which was more startling: the burst of
energy or that Agassi was still standing. When this rendition of
American auld lang syne with his fellow senior citizen was
suspended by rain in the gloaming Thursday, Agassi was flat on his
back, a victim of the treacherous surface. For a while, he was
lower than that, a victim of Martin's majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who turns 30 next Saturday _ a milestone Agassi
reluctantly reached in April _ was serving for the match at 5-2. By
the time he slumped toward his seat while Agassi was racing toward
his, Martin was serving for his life.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Agassi had put him out of his misery, 6-4,
2-6, 7-6 (7-3), 2-6, 10-8, with a display that illustrated again
why he is the world's top-ranked male player and showman.
</P>
<P>
   There is one man seeded ahead of him in the Wimbledon pecking
order, however: perennial champion Pete Sampras. And Agassi
inadvertently helped his archrival _ and prolonged the suspense
surrounding Sampras _ with the elongated melodrama that co-starred
Martin. Scheduled to play the final match on Centre Court, Sampras
instead got the night off because the length of the matches, an
early-evening suspension for rain, and just plain lack of time
prevented all the business on the docket from being completed. So
Sampras got extra time to rest for his third-round match against
Jason Gimelstob and to rehabilitate the acute tendinitis of the
lower left leg that has made his bid for a record-tying seventh
Wimbledon and a record-setting 13th Grand Slam title a dicey
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras probably would have been too worn out to play, anyway,
had he watched Martin-Agassi. Not only was it a worthy reprise of
the 1999 US Open final Agassi won after dropping two of the first
three sets, it was a stirring tribute to the golden age of American
tennis _ starring Sampras, Agassi, Martin, Jim Courier, Michael
Chang, and, to a lesser extent, MaliVai Washington _ that is
gradually acquiring a coat of rust.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Martin could almost be heard creaking from the
cumbersome brace on his right knee and the torn ligaments in his
left ankle that had limited him to 11 matches this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the way Martin was serving (28-11 advantage in aces) and
volleying (28-9 in winners), Agassi wasn't in a particularly
nostalgic mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all secondary to the fact that we're both here to
win,'' he said. ``Whoever you have to play, you have to take care
of business. It's just highly competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   And Agassi's prospects were looking highly dubious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I'd gotten to the point where I was controlling
play,'' said Martin. ``Even the points I wasn't dictating, I felt
like Andre was forcing when he had a little bit of an opportunity.
(But) you know, the tide can turn very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   As quickly as it took Agassi to stop double-faulting and start
showing the flair that makes each of his matches a passion play.
Surviving two match points at 5-2, he finally started landing his
serves with regularity and slashing his returns at impossible
angles for Martin to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to feel like you're really against the wall,''
Agassi said. ``Then at that point, you're just thinking, `Just make
the guy earn it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi had berated Alan Mills for not suspending play earlier
Thursday night, but he called and apologized to the tournament
referee Friday morning. He eventually had just enough time to keep
his dinner reservation with paramour Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such intrigue or exertion for No. 1 women's seed
Martina Hingis. She breezed to a 6-2, 6-2 win over Silvija Talaja
and hasn't been challenged yet here this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played very well,'' she said, ``very focused from the first
point on to the last.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a pleasant contrast to 1999 when Hingis came here alone
amid rumors of a rift with her mother-coach, Melanie Molitor, and
left in a shambles after becoming the first top seed to lose to a
qualifier in the first round. That implausible conqueror, Jelena
Dokic, seems to have inherited Hingis's problems this year, even
though she doesn't realize it.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hingis, 19, is best buddies with Molitor again, Dokic
is left to cope with the fallout from the outrageous behavior of
her father, Damir.
</P>
<P>
   He was evicted from a tournament at Birmingham, England, last
year for a drunken display in which he labeled WTA Tour honchos
``Nazis.'' And on Thursday, he made that performance look like an
exercise in gentility. He ranted against England, calling one side
of the country ``fascist,'' changed his opinion of the WTA to
``criminal and poison,'' and smashed a television reporter's cell
phone after asking to borrow it. Dokic wasn't arrested only because
the journalist, Sky TV's Gary Saggers, declined to press charges
after police were called in. And the All England Lawn Tennis &AMP;
Croquet Club issued a statement saying the senior Dokic would be
banned from the grounds if there is another such episode.
</P>
<P>
   And his daughter, all of 17 years old and the darling of this
event when she advanced to the quarterfinals last year, was left to
answer for him. She didn't want to, and the press conference
moderator/censor admonished interrogators to confine all questions
to tennis. But nobody wanted to know about Dokic's doubles victory
with Jennifer Capriati. They wanted to know about Daddy Dearest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this many times: I have a great relationship with my
dad, him going to tournaments with me,'' said Dokic. ``He's always
been with me in tennis, a big influence. Doesn't bother me at all.
I like having him around.''
</P>
<P>
   So another tennis prodigy's drama continues. But unlike
Martin-Agassi, there's nothing uplifting about it.

<P>
   PARIS _ Louis Schweitzer does not look like a gambler.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and lanky, a kind of Gallic Abe Lincoln, Schweitzer, 57, is
a grandnephew of Albert Schweitzer and a distant cousin of
Jean-Paul Sartre. Like many of the business elite of France, he is
a product of L'Ecole Nationale d'Administration; he was chief of
staff in the 1980s for Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, now the
finance minister, and still enjoys good political connections.
Schweitzer is, in short, the very model of French establishment
probity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he now finds himself chairman and chief executive of the
auto giant Renault, which likes to boast that it was built on a
bet. In company lore, its founder, Louis Renault, started by
winning a wager in 1898 that a Renault with an innovative
crankshaft could beat a car with a bicycle-like chain drive, common
at the time, up a winding road in Montmartre. Renault won.
</P>
<P>
   So Schweitzer has become a gambler of sorts, too. Last year, he
flew to Japan to sign a $5.4 billion deal to acquire a controlling
stake in Nissan Motor after DaimlerChrysler had rejected the
carmaker as unsalvageable. Schweitzer is wagering that a restored
Nissan will become a solid partner in a globe-circling alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Nissan his only high-stakes wager. In 1996, he ventured
into Latin America, building a $1 billion factory in Brazil, the
first that Renault had built anywhere in 20 years, to make its
successful Megane sedan. Last year, he paid $50 million for 51
percent of the Romanian carmaker Dacia, to gain a steppingstone
into Eastern Europe. He also struck a deal to manufacture Renaults
in an idle factory near Moscow. And this year, he bought a
controlling stake in Samsung, the bankrupt South Korean carmaker.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he has focused Renault on cars. First, he
unloaded the company's foundry, bus-making divisions and Renault
Automation, which makes auto factory equipment, to Fiat. In April,
he sold the industrial vehicles division to Volvo, while taking a
20 percent stake in that company.
</P>
<P>
   What is sobering, however, is that Renault has often lost on its
biggest bets. In 1987, not long after Schweitzer joined the
company, a strategy to enter North America by acquiring American
Motors went sour. Six years later, after Schweitzer had become
chairman, a marriage he had arranged with Volvo collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Never before, moreover, has the company had more at stake. If
Schweitzer's bets do not pay off, Renault risks falling prey to a
takeover, or being forced into a humiliating surrender of
independence. Renault was nationalized after World War II, and
while part of it was sold to private investors in the 1990s, the
government retains 44 percent. Would the government stay neutral if
the independence of such a national institution were threatened?
</P>
<P>
   Renault once believed that the future belonged to the swift, not
to the big. Today, Schweitzer says the world auto industry will one
day be dominated by a half-dozen giants, like General Motors, Ford
Motor, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler. He wants
Renault to be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Renault survives, it will be one of the great world
carmakers,'' said Elie Cohen, a leading French economist. ``If it
fails, it will disappear.'' Cohen, echoing other experts, said
Renault was, in a sense, ``condemned to take important risks, if it
wanted to have a chance at survival.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenges are enormous. In Romania, economic progress has
been dismal; at Samsung, Renault's reorganization has yet to begin.
But the biggest test, most experts agree, will be in Japan. If
Nissan, a stumbling, debt-ridden company, fails to revive in Japan
and in the United States, the burden on Renault could prove
unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of Renault is being played out in Tokyo,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Few people would have predicted all this when Schweitzer took
over in 1992. Then, Renault was struggling with bad quality, a
narrow product line and an overreliance on the French market. A few
years before, without huge infusions of taxpayer money, Renault
would have gone under or been taken over _ if anyone had wanted to
buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company is among Europe's leaders in building cars
cheaply and has largely overcome its quality problems. Models like
the Scenic minivan are among Europe's most reliable. ``They are
looked upon much more seriously today by the German
manufacturers,'' said Stephen Reitman, who follows Renault at
Merrill Lynch in London.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have meant profits. Renault's operating profit,
before absorbing Nissan's losses, is strong, reaching 1.48 billion
euros, about $1.4 billion, in 1999. It faced a loss of 330 million
euros from Nissan last year, and that will hit 376 million euros
just in the first half this year. Renault's stock price has gyrated
accordingly. After soaring in January to a 52-week high of 54.95
euros, it fell to 38.60 in February and recovered to 51.80 in late
May. But it has since slipped to 47.6 euros. Most analysts, not
surprisingly, have adopted a wait-and-see attitude about the
company's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the transformation of Renault reflects deep changes in
France. As the government privatizes industries, executives like
Schweitzer, steeped in traditional business practices, have learned
to compete in a brasher, riskier climate.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer's analysis of Renault's situation was simple: The
breakdown of his proposed marriage with Volvo resulted in large
part from continued government control of Renault, which Volvo
shareholders felt was a threat to independence in making business
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with Renault factories running at low capacity, cars
were pricey; the slightest market downturn led to losses, as
happened in 1996, three years after the Volvo breakup, when Renault
had a net loss of just over $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer began by pushing the government to slash its stake.
Helped by the election in 1993 of a conservative prime minister,
Edouard Balladur, Schweitzer induced the government to cut its
holdings to 52 percent, then to relinquish control by dropping to
44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That was only the beginning. In 1996, to bring down costs,
Schweitzer hired the man who, if all bets pay off, will probably be
his successor: Carlos Ghosn.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, now 46, had been the boy wonder at Michelin, the tire
maker. When he was still in his 20s, he built Michelin's business
in Latin America amid volatile national economies and, in Brazil, a
soaring inflation rate. In 1990, he steered the merger of Michelin
in North America with Uniroyal Goodrich. Though his methods earned
him the title of ``le cost-cutter,'' colleagues recall human
touches. When a Goodrich factory in Ardmore, Okla., was switched to
multiple shifts, Ghosn (rhymes with loan) contacted local
ministers, patiently explaining why some Sunday school teachers
might not be available every week.
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently why he joined Renault, Ghosn showed his hunger to
be tested. ``Renault, in Europe, is a prestigious name, with a very
good history,'' he said. ``But I have always had an intuition that
you don't join a company when things are good. You join when there
are challenges, to earn your position.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn's recipes are classic. In purchasing, he cut the number of
suppliers, to reduce administrative costs. In engineering, he
created teams to develop products. In manufacturing, he reduced the
number of models per plant and negotiated more flexible shifts. His
plan was to save 20 billion francs _ $2.8 billion today _ in three
years. ``We delivered it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Griffiths, an analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in London,
said one of Renault's greatest strengths was its use of
manufacturing capacity, which he put at over 90 percent, close to
American levels. ``Far better than the average in Europe,''
Griffiths said.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn's arrival signaled to workers and shareholders that ``this
company has changed,'' said Philippe Martinez, head of the leftist
labor union at Renault, Confederation Generale de Travail. ``It was
good for the owners, but the message was political. It was a
culture shock.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Ghosn who provoked the first test of Renault's
independence. In 1997, he decided to close a factory at Vilvorde,
Belgium, cutting 3,000 jobs. Renault workers in France and Belgium
took to the streets, and the recently elected Socialist prime
minister of France, Lionel Jospin, begged Schweitzer to reverse the
decision. Schweitzer said no.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, Vilvorde reflects just how much Renault has
changed. Once a union stronghold, the company by 1997 had stopped
being a social laboratory where politicians tested labor reforms
before introducing them nationwide. Schweitzer's predecessor,
Raymond Levy, signaled the change in 1992, closing Renault's oldest
plant, at Billancourt, on an island in the Seine near Paris. The
plant had long been a symbol of French labor militancy: In 1968,
when students protested in Paris, Schweitzer's cousin Jean-Paul
Sartre stood at Billancourt's gates to call auto workers to join
them. But at Vilvorde, the unions ultimately accepted the
inevitable. It was Renault's last major labor unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The changes at Renault say much about Schweitzer's own
evolution. His experience has enabled him to manage both politics
and business. Cohen, the economist, says a peculiar blend of French
culture and Protestant ethic enabled him to make painful decisions.
``He lost friends on the left,'' Cohen said, adding that ``he is a
man totally identified with Renault.''
</P>
<P>
   A French executive who has known Schweitzer since college days
calls him a ``quintessentially French mind: Conceptual, yet not
lost in fantasies; able to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Schweitzer and the Brazilian-born Ghosn worked hand in
glove, despite enormous personal differences. Schweitzer is an
expert in numbers; Ghosn received his degree from L'Ecole des
Mines, a top engineering school, though he later earned a doctorate
in economics at the University of Paris. While Schweitzer had been
chief aide to a Socialist prime minister, Ghosn had always been in
business. And the cerebral strain in Schweitzer contrasts with
Ghosn's Latin exuberance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the success of the two men would probably have been
impossible without the artistic flair of a third.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, when Schweitzer was chief financial officer, Renault
hired a new chief designer, Patrick Le Quement, whose talent shaped
the education of Louis Schweitzer _ and the transformation of
Renault.
</P>
<P>
   Born in France and educated in Britain, Le Quement earned a
reputation as one of Europe's most daring designers while working
in the 1980s for Ford and Volkswagen. He joined Renault, he said,
because of its tradition of risk taking. ``When you're a kid, you
have your favorite Dinky toys,'' he said in an interview, referring
to the toy cars known by generations of young English boys. ``Mine
were Renault.''
</P>
<P>
   His first task was to complete the design of a diminutive model,
later dubbed the Twingo. Le Quement took an earlier design, widened
it and gave it headlights like frogs' eyes and a snoot that made it
look, he said, ``like a pet: In winter you don't want to leave it
outside; you place it next to the fireplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The design polarized management. Some, like Schweitzer, hated
it, though he now says his objection was to the way the project was
financed. In a desperate appeal to the chairman at the time,
Raymond Levy, Le Quement said he wrote that ``the biggest risk with
the car was to take no risk.'' Levy agreed.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, Renault was selling little Twingos about as fast as it
could make them, nearly 20,000 a month. Under Le Quement, other
remarkable models followed, including the Scenic, a micro-minivan
that has also been a big seller.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, when Renault decided to revive its luxury car
line, Schweitzer was easily won over to a daring design based on a
concept car called the Avantime, a futuristic sedan with an oddly
truncated rear end and wraparound rear window.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are Renault's designs changing, but so is the way they
are put together. Le Quement's office, adorned with bright
canvases, has for two years been in Renault's new $785 million
Technocentre, which opened in 1998 on former farmland west of
Paris. In its central wing, La Ruche (the hive), and adjacent wing,
Le Diapason (the tuning fork), experts from design and research,
vehicle engineering, purchasing and product cost analysis _ once
scattered over 50 sites _ work jointly to bring down costs and
development time. Renault's successful subcompact, the Clio, took
40 months to develop before it was introduced in 1991; recent
models have taken 36 months, and the target is 20.
</P>
<P>
   As for shopping for a partner in Asia, Schweitzer says the idea
was born during the Asian economic crisis. ``We saw an
opportunity,'' he said. Nissan ``was fundamentally a sound company,
with good products.''
</P>
<P>
   The process was accelerated in 1998 when Daimler-Benz announced
its takeover of Chrysler. ``This was an electric shock in the
industry,'' Ghosn said. ``It was obvious for us that we had to
connect fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Renault took its stake in Nissan, and Ghosn was
dispatched to revive it. Now chief operating officer at Nissan, he
will become president this summer, the first foreigner to assume
such a prestigious role at a major Japanese corporation.
</P>
<P>
   At Nissan, Ghosn has set clear goals, and his record for meeting
objectives is enviable. By the end of 2002, he said, 22 new models
are planned, including four in Japan later this year. By the end of
2003, he wants to cut Nissan's debt by half, from $16.8 billion at
the end of March. And he expects the company to be profitable in
the current fiscal year, which ends next March, after losses in
seven of the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Change is also apparent elsewhere in the global operations.
Today, Schweitzer says Renault is focusing on distribution. It is
the European leader in shrinking order-to-delivery times, building
about half its cars to order and delivering them in six to eight
weeks. The goal, at least in Europe, is to make three-quarters of
its cars to order and to deliver them in 14 days, matching what the
Japanese often do in their home market. In April, to cut purchasing
costs, it joined Covisint, the online marketplace set up by G.M.,
Ford and DaimlerChrysler to consolidate the search for parts and
services.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer said he wanted to emphasize different Renault brands
in different markets, making Renault strongest in Europe and Latin
America; Nissan (and its Infiniti luxury division) in North
America; Nissan and Samsung in Asia; and Dacia in Eastern Europe
and emerging markets. It is not a novel recipe. Volkswagen
supplemented its VW and Audi brands by snapping up Skoda in the
Czech Republic and Seat in Spain. Yet unlike Volkswagen's cars,
Renault's brands do not compete with one another. ``Why buy a
Volkswagen at German prices,'' Cohen said, ``when you can get a
Skoda, the same car, at Czech prices?''
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer says Renault's plans are on track, though much work
remains. In Europe, Renault and Nissan have begun melding their
sales organizations, but the bulk of reorganization is still ahead
at Dacia and Samsung. In Latin America, Nissan models will be
produced at Renault plants, and Ghosn says that by 2010 he wants 10
common platforms, or underbodies, so that the companies can build
Renaults and Nissans everywhere, while maintaining the look, feel
and identity of their separate brands. Nissan alone currently has
some two dozen platforms, none of them shared with Renault or other
brands.
</P>
<P>
   The investment in Nissan has already paid off handsomely.
Reitman of Merrill Lynch calculates that Renault's stake is now
worth roughly 8.25 billion euros, or $7.8 billion, 65 percent more
than Renault paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   One bottleneck could be finding managers to run all the
operations. Reitman says one reason for selling the
industrial-vehicles division to Volvo was to free up Renault
management. To replace Ghosn when he left for Nissan, Schweitzer
lured a senior Volkswagen executive, Pierre-Alain De Smedt, a
Belgian who was chief executive of VW's Seat division.
</P>
<P>
   But that was an exception. Local talent is crucial to
Schweitzer's concept, for despite all of Renault's globalization _
the common language of executive meetings and reports is now
English, which Schweitzer speaks fluently _ he misses no occasion
to stress his appreciation of national qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think car companies need roots,'' he said, since ``there are
links between products, company culture and the nationality of the
group.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart of his vision is the link with Nissan. ``We are
talking about a binational group,'' he said, adding that such a
structure could be ``clearly only fully productive if the two
companies are working well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An alliance,'' he said, ``is not a substitute for bringing
your house in order.''

JOHN ASPINALL, 74, BRITISH GAMBLER AND ZOO OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ John V. Aspinall, a rakish millionaire who made his
fortune in the port-and-cigar world of upper-class gambling tables
in London and devoted it to creating country estates for breeding
gorillas and tigers _ species that he said he preferred to humans _
died on Thursday in London. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that man should be guided by primitive instinct rather
than reason, and determined to close the gulf between the species,
Aspinall delighted in romping with his wild animals.
</P>
<P>
   He encouraged his zookeepers to do likewise, sometimes with
horrific consequences. Five were mauled to death in the last 20
years, the most recent one this February, yet Aspinall successfully
fought off laws that would have barred the workers from entering
enclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Of his 30 best friends, he said, half were animals, and he
argued that at one time there had been a golden age in which beasts
and humans had been equal. Asked once whether he would leave his
children in the company of his wild animals, he said, ``I'd rather
leave them with gorillas than with a social worker.''
</P>
<P>
   The success he had in fleecing some of London's more louche
aristocrats and rich foreign visitors in his Mayfair gambling clubs
and then spending the profits on his own eccentric model of animal
protection was sometimes said to have done as much for
redistributing the wealth in Britain in the 1960s as the social
programs of the liberal intelligentsia who regularly excoriated him
for his extreme right-wing views.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Aspers,'' he ran with a high-living set that included
business buccaneers like James Goldsmith, Tiny Rowland and Lord
Lucan, the Belgravia aristocrat who disappeared in November 1974
after bludgeoning his family's nanny to death with a lead pipe in
the darkened foyer of his home, believing her to be his wife.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Lord Lucan has been a subject of high-society
rumor and subway-wall graffiti ever since, with sightings of the
disgraced peer periodically reported in the tabloid press.
Aspinall's death is not likely to end the speculation, which a
quarter-century of denials has not dimmed, that he and his gambling
cronies somehow managed to spirit Lord Lucan out of Britain to a
new life abroad.
</P>
<P>
   John Victor Aspinall was born in India on June 11, 1926, the son
of _ or so he long thought _ Robert Aspinall, an army surgeon.
Years later when he pressed his supposed father for money to cover
his gambling debts, he discovered to his delight that he had more
exotic origins. His real father was George Bruce, a soldier who had
had his way with his mother, Mary Grace Horn, under a tamarind tree
after a regimental ball.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 6, Aspinall was sent to preparatory school in
England, and in 1938 his mother, divorced by that time, married Sir
George Osborne, who paid for the young man to go to private
boarding school at Rugby.
</P>
<P>
   He was expelled for being ``idle and rebellious,'' and he served
in the Royal Marines for three years before going to Jesus College,
Oxford, where he devoted himself to dandified dress and gambling.
He boasted of never having attended a single lecture.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of his final exams at the university, he feigned
illness and went to the Gold Cup at Ascot instead. He consequently
never earned a degree, but he did bet on the right horse, and his
professional life was launched.
</P>
<P>
   By that time he had fallen under the influence of an adventure
book called ``Nada the Lily,'' by Rider Haggard, about an
illegitimate Zulu prince who lived outside his tribe among wild
animals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956 Aspinall married Jane Hastings, a Scottish model, and
moved into an Eaton Place apartment where he installed a garden
shed housing a capuchin monkey, a 9-week-old tigress and two
Himalayan bears. In what was to become a typical pattern of
cavalier behavior, he paid no attention to the annoyance of
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, gambling was illegal, and the game he set up had
to float from one high-toned address to another to escape the
authorities. He attracted so many well-placed players that when the
game was finally shut down by the police in 1958, the action led to
the passing of a new law permitting gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962 he opened the Clermont Club on Berkeley Square, which
became famous for the Mayfair set that frequented it and for
Annabel's in the basement, the dance and dinner club that became
London's most fashionable and exclusive evening spot. Membership in
Aspinall's gambling rooms was limited to 600 and included five
dukes, five marquesses and 20 earls.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the Clermont Club financed the opening of
Howletts, Aspinall's first zoo, at a neo-Palladian mansion outside
Canterbury. In 1972 he sold the Clermont Club and established his
second grand park on 275 acres at Port Lympne, near Folkestone.
</P>
<P>
   The need for cash prompted him to return to running gambling
clubs in London, and he set up two new successful ones in
Knightsbridge and Mayfair. In 1983 he made $30 million from their
sale, but a decade later he was in financial difficulties again,
and in 1992 he set up yet another gambling spot.
</P>
<P>
   He was often pictured at ease with his beloved wild beasts,
having his eyelids delicately tweaked by a gorilla, having new-born
tiger cubs dumped in his lap by their mother, or being surrounded
by a peaceable wolf pack. A tall, rangy man with a booming voice,
Aspinall liked to shock the sedate and once announced that when
making love, he roared like a lion and beat his chest like a
gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   While experts were skeptical of his approach, they were obliged
to admire his breeding breakthroughs with Siberian tigers, ocelots,
and gorillas, and his success at introducing some of them into the
African wild.
</P>
<P>
   These triumphs were overshadowed, though, by the deaths of the
five assistants, two killed by the same tigress in 1980, one
trampled by an elephant in 1984, another mauled by a tiger in 1994,
and the last, Darren Cockrill, 27, crushed by an elephant four
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   His Darwinian beliefs led him to make admiring comments about
the benefits of diseases like malaria which rid the world of
inadequate human stock and culled it of 2 billion undesirables. But
it also led him to support animal preservation and to criticize
``the import of rare animal skins to satisfy the witless wishes of
women.'' He had no time for equality of the sexes, saying that his
wife was ``the perfect example of the primate female, ready to
serve the dominant male and make his life agreeable.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his one political effort, he ran unsuccessfully for
Parliament in 1997 as the candidate of his friend Jimmy Goldsmith's
single-issue Referendum Party against Britain's deepening
involvement in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 he divorced his first wife and married Belinda Musker.
Then in 1972, he divorced again and married Lady Sarah Courage, the
widow of the racing driver Piers Courage, who had died in a crash
two years earlier. Besides her, he leaves two sons, Damian and
Bassa, a daughter, Amanda, and two stepsons, Jason and Amos
Courage.
</P>
<P>
   A half-brother, James Osborne, said on Friday that the two wild
animal parks that now boast 1,100 animals and more than 80 species
would be run by the John Aspinall Foundation ``in the manner and
philosophy of their founder'' _ dedicated to preservation rather
than exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   On finding out last year that the cancer in his jaw was probably
terminal, Aspinall had a characteristically bluff reaction. ``You
can have 5-to-2 against me making it, or better yet, I'll give you
3-to-1,'' he said. ``It's a good bet. I only have a 30 percent
chance of surviving this.''

CHARLES SCHULZ MUSEUM OFFICIALLY UNDER WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Calif.)   By MARY CALLAHAN   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Charlie Brown, Lucy and Linus were missing,
but Snoopy was there to play crew boss for assorted dignitaries at
this week's groundbreaking for the Charles M. Schulz Museum and
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   With organizers promising the $8 million museum will be
completed in 14 months, Schulz's wife, Jeannie, and others donned
hard hats and spooned soil with golden shovels Thursday to launch
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannie Schulz said she hoped the museum honoring the Peanuts
creator's life also would prove beneficial to his adopted hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think it's going to be a mecca for all the Peanuts'
fans, and I think it's going to be wonderful for Santa Rosa,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stated mission of the museum is to preserve and interpret
Schulz's work over 50 years of drawing the comic strip, examining
his inspirations and influences, and building an understanding of
cartoonists and their art form.
</P>
<P>
   Museum board member Lucy Shelton Caswell, curator of the Cartoon
Research Library at the University of Ohio, said it's critical to
keep his legacy alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people don't realize how innovative Schulz was, and
how many things he did new, first,'' Caswell said. Among other
contributions, she said, ``he made it OK to talk about failings and
anxieties.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27,384-square-foot museum has been in the works for more
than two years and Schulz had hoped construction could start last
fall to mark the beginning of Peanuts' 50th year. But the project
was delayed several months and Schulz, who was diagnosed with
cancer in November, did not survive to see the groundbreaking. He
died in February, the day before his last comic strip ran.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by C. David Robinson Architects of San Francisco, the
museum will include a 100-seat theater, classrooms and large
galleries with both permanent and temporary exhibits.

<P>
   According to Finance 101, when an old-line manufacturing company
finds that one of its offspring far surpasses it in profit growth,
the best course is to liberate this child star to soar on its own.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Ford Motor Co. followed the textbook two years ago
and spun off the Associates First Capital Corp. as a dividend to
shareholders , the stock of the unit _ founded in 1918 to finance
Model T's _ promptly flopped to earth.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, with the shares at $22.3125, investors who had once
eagerly awaited the day that Ford would unleash the unit's
unrecognized value were sitting on a loss of nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why such market disregard for a company that has seen its
earnings jump 19 percent or more in each of the last five years and
has had rising operating earnings for 101 consecutive quarters,
compared with the year-earlier periods?
</P>
<P>
   Various clouds hang over the company, also referred to as the
Associates or First Capital, but several analysts and investors say
they are far less worrisome than has been suggested by the
depressed state of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent is the fact that the financial services business in
general has been in considerable tumult, with rapid consolidation,
high-profile casualties and new high-technology entrants scrambling
to fill niches. One of the biggest failures was the Money Store, a
second-mortgage lender that the First Union Corp. bought for $2.1
billion in 1998 but that proved such a drag that the bank announced
last week that it would shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   Another depressant has been fear that the Federal Reserve, in
its drive to cool off a white-hot economy, will tighten monetary
policy too much and tip the economy into recession.
</P>
<P>
   That could clearly hurt the Associates, whose prime clientele
are blue-collar and clerical workers and which is already seeing a
rise in delinquencies.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the company's costly shutdown early this year of
its poorly performing unit that financed mobile homes. The move
involved a special $110 million charge against first-quarter
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also point to some profit-margin erosion and glitches
in the integration of Avco Financial Services, a 1999 acquisition
that added more than 1,200 branch offices and six new countries,
and to a new law in Japan, where the Associates' foreign business
is heavily concentrated, cutting the maximum interest rate it can
charge to 29 percent from 40 percent. And in a report earlier this
month, The Wall Street Journal said the Justice Department was
preparing to file a lawsuit contending that the Associates has
discriminated against black borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   But this litany, many people on Wall Street say, does not
justify a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 10 _ especially for
a company with such an outstanding record of growth, even during
recessions. In 1992, for example, when the 1990-91 downturn had its
biggest effect on borrowers, the Associates raised its profits by
12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's proven its mettle through various kinds of
environments,'' said Robert Napoli, financial services analyst for
ABN Amro in Chicago, who figures that the stock should climb to
about $43 by the end of next year, based on projected earnings of
$2.70 a share and a price-to-earnings multiple of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Money Store's failure, of course, means one less competitor, and
the Associates' setback in manufactured housing appears to reflect
aggressive rate-cutting by Green Tree Financial, the ailing unit of
Conseco Inc. The Associates said the discrimination accusations
involve just 3 of 90 independent brokers with whom it dealt in one
city, Detroit. It also said that it was prepared for the change in
Japan's usury law and that the impact would be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a pretty harsh environment for financial
companies,'' said Jeff G. Morris, a portfolio manager whose Invesco
Financial Services fund held 1.29 million Associates shares on May
31 and who has high regard for the company's management and the
diversity of its business, which includes credit cards, truck
financing, personal loans and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Guthrie, chief financial officer of the Associates, said
that the company was not as vulnerable to rising interest rates as
many people thought, and that it would be looking at the industry's
current upheaval as a chance to take advantage of low prices for
other companies' shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get some bargains,'' Guthrie predicted.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own company's stock, he added, ``I think it's a
screaming buy.'' Associates has authorization to buy back $50
million worth of its shares but says it will not have the capital
to begin making purchases until later this year.

FOR MARTIN, THE MELODRAMA IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Deja Vu, who I'd thought was a famous Romanian tennis
player, appeared at Wimbledon Friday. The word was around. In
Centre Court somebody said, ``If that's not deja vu, then Todd
Martin isn't the tallest guy to come up short in this precinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Martin soon recognized deja vu himself, and it was a sight
to make his eyes sore enough to weep. Maybe Martin, the best
6-foot-6-inch specimen ever to decorate a tennis court _ as game as
he is high _ did sob in private after what happened to him Friday
in full view of 13,812 witnesses and millions across the globe. He
was entitled.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in the fifth set was serious, big-time, drop-dead
deja vu, courtesy of winning Andre Agassi: 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-3),
2-6, 10-8. Agassi had been floudering like a trout with asthma,
gasping at the depths of 2-5, and soon two match points.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it hit me _ as it hit Martin in the chops. I felt like
a guy walking into a movie house, taking a look, and groaning,
``Oh, no. I've seen this one before. In fact, this is where I came
in four years ago'' _ with Martin leading MaliVai Washington, 5-1
in the fifth. Same court. Same full house. Semifinals. Amazingly,
almost the same score, favoring that Martin beneficiary,
Washington: 5-7, 6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3, 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I remember now. This flick is called ``Pulp Affliction.''
It seems a joyful tale of an all-American (from Northwestern) boy
marching triumphantly behind a huge serve and trenchant volley.
Martin is further ahead than Napoleon on the way to Moscow but . .
. but . . . there is no happy ending in store. Not if you are Todd
Martin, or one of his faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The wheels come off. The battery goes dead. The fuel line
freezes. He is afflicted by a pulpiness of his strong right arm at
enough critical moments _ not many, but just enough _ to allow
Agassi to squirm free in a two-reel melodrama that consumes almost
four hours over two days, bounding into the third round.
</P>
<P>
   At the Thursday evening intermission, the screen going black in
a drizzle, so did Agassi. He skidded, flopping onto his back,
convincing the authorities that the lawn is too damp and slippery
for further activity.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly enough, upon Friday's resumption, that backbone of
Agassi's was up against one of the venerable arena's forest green
walls. But it is a backbone that won't bend.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had been pounding aces (28 in all) and Agassi hadn't been
able to serve well enough to keep his lofty foe away from the net.
He found himself lagging 1-3 in the fifth, and had to duck two
break points to get to 2-3. But at 2-4 the total collapse of the
1992 champ, the little bald guy from Las Vegas, seemed imminent. He
double-faulted and Martin is way up, two breaks and 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough because deja vu was kicking in. Even though
Agassi was thinking, ``Hope is just about gone. If I'm gonna lose,
I want to lose my way _ making him hit the shots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 straight games, Martin muscled his serve through Agassi,
and at 5-2 he opened with an ace. Three points from a nice shower.
Not this time. A double fault and a ripping Agassi forehand return
cut the lead to 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Andre's turn. He got to 40-30, but a lob floated over his head
and he was in a maze of five deuces and two match points. Martin
could taste the win now as he looked at a second serve on the first
match point.
</P>
<P>
   He rushed the backhand, double-barreled it into the net. His
great opportunity was probably gone right there, although they
played 38 more minutes. Agassi rescued the next match point with a
daring volley, but Martin was still ahead, 5-4, and with serve.
</P>
<P>
   He stared deja vu in its beady eyes and said to himself, ``Don't
let it happen again.'' He was in a spot he shouldn't be in. A guy
with his class on grass (two semis and two quarters at Wimbledon)
rated a seeding, not a second-round scuffle with Agassi. But when
the injudicious tourney committee jiggled the seedings, they forgot
Martin and inserted such as the undeserving homeboy, Greg Rusedski,
who was beaten at the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   On losing to Washington in 1996 he confessed ``choking,''
describing the dread condition: ``I couldn't breathe, couldn't move
my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   This time he experienced those afflictions ``to a lesser
degree,'' he said. ``The momentum changed. You don't feel it until
it happens. Then it's a matter of how quick you can get it to stop.
Unfortunately it took me a couple of games.''
</P>
<P>
   By then Agassi had the scent, ``although I had my tense, tight
moments,'' he said. ``At 5-4, it came across my mind that this has
happened to him before. He gave me some help. But I had to have the
mentality to execute my shots under pressure, so that he'd have to
hit his. Todd played tremendously to have me down 5-2 . . . but
great things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for the admirable Todd Martin, caught in the clutches of
deja vu.

 &HT;    Choose a partner, hope for the best
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, FLA. _ Who do you trust?
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup drivers are asking themselves that question as they
approach tonight's Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR requires race teams to use restrictor-plate engines at
Daytona and Talladega, its two fastest tracks. For a driver to push
his car to the limit at the two superspeedways, he must draft with
other drivers to maximize aerodynamics. Sometimes a driver drafts
with a racing partner; sometimes he drafts with a car from another
team.
</P>
<P>
   In February's Daytona 500, Mark Martin showed what can go wrong
when you pick the wrong dancing partner. In the closing laps of the
season-opener, Martin made a deal with Dale Jarrett to work
together to pass leader Johnny Benson.
</P>
<P>
   But when the opportunity for the two drivers arrived, Martin
went high and Jarrett dipped toward the apron. Martin was hung out
in the draft briefly and dropped back to finish fifth. Jarrett, who
ended up winning, said he had to bail out because Jeff Burton was
charging hard on the inside groove.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, Martin uttered his line, ``I got lied to'' about
the broken deal with Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a drafting partner, but finding someone whose
car is suitable and who is willing to work with you is a big part
of that game,'' Martin said. ``It is an ongoing challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin probably won't forget what Jarrett did, but he apparently
retains a cordial relationship with him. Even Martin's teammate,
Jeff Burton, acknowledges that broken deals are common in
restrictor-plate racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark and I had a conversation before the race, and we said,
`If you can help me, you help me, but if it's going to harm you,
don't do it,''' Burton said. ``That always happens on a
restrictor-plate race, where somebody gets mad at somebody else.
It's not done out of malice. It's just out of protecting
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Benson, driver of the No. 10 Pontiac, was on the verge of
pulling an upset in the February race when a fleet of six Fords _
including Jarrett and Martin _ ganged up on him at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only partners you really have are the guy in front of you
and the guy behind you, and that changes throughout the race,''
Benson said. ``I don't care what anyone promises you before the
race or on the team radios during the race. If they think they can
help themselves, they are going to forget about any agreement just
as fast as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   More surprising than the Martin-Jarrett fiasco at the Daytona
500 was the on-track feud between the Earnhardts. Dale Sr. and Dale
Jr. left each other out of the draft on at least two occasions,
costing both better finishes. It resulted in the father and son
trading barbs through the media after the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you really pick and choose who you go with, you
just go with what works best for you at the time,'' Earnhardt Sr.
said. ``You hope that it is someone you feel confident with, but
that doesn't always happen. It's who's your friend for this lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookies usually have the toughest times in restrictor-plate
racing. Because they're new to the major-league circuit, veteran
racers aren't jumping at the chance to draft with an inexperienced
driver only inches away at speeds in excess of 190 mph. One wrong
move can ignite a life-threatening wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys will avoid rookies a little bit, but that's just
part of the game,'' said Dave Blaney, first-year driver of the
Pontiac No. 93. ``You've just got to hang in there and not make any
moves to get yourself shuffled back. Then you'll be OK.''

 &HT;    Attorneys spar in Coke case
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attorney Willie Gary came out swinging Friday, strongly denying
allegations that he illegally solicited fees from Coca-Cola workers
involved in the racial discrimination case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This garbage that I was trying to solicit clients is
ridiculous,'' Gary said in a telephone interview. ``They requested
to meet with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary also said the allegations, made by the group of attorneys
representing the class of 2,000 black employees, were a
``smokescreen'' to hide an inadequate agreement in principle that
was reached two weeks ago to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Coca-Cola, which is being kept confidential
until it is completed, was reached by a team led by plaintiffs'
attorney Cyrus Mehri. Gary was not involved in the settlement
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realizes he probably didn't get enough money and is worried
that he may lose the class,'' Gary said of Mehri. That could
happen, Gary said, if individual class members decide to ``opt
out'' of the settlement and file individual lawsuits against Coke
for monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Mehri's team filed a motion alleging that Gary's
law firm solicited fee agreements from class members in violation
of a local federal court rule. Gary's law firm does not represent
the class as a whole. Recently, however, his firm started to
represent four of the eight plaintiffs in the case and at least
four other individual class members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gary firm is soliciting fee agreements that require class
members to fork over 25 percent of their settlement shares for
nothing,'' Mehri's team said in its motion.
</P>
<P>
   The motion asks U.S. District Judge Richard Story to stop Gary's
Stuart, Fla., firm from continuing the alleged practice and to
invalidate any agreements that have been reached so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of our brief is that you're not above the law,
whether you're a corporate giant or a high-flying lawyer,'' Mehri
said Friday. ``As we did with Coke, we will stand up for the rights
of the class members and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary said his firm is not trying to take money received by a
class member as a result of work performed by Mehri's team.
</P>
<P>
   He said he initially got involved in the case because some of
the plaintiffs had developed a ``lack of trust'' in Mehri's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, Mehri's team was hired to help fight discrimination
within the Coca-Cola Co.,'' Gregory Allen Clark, one of the four
plaintiffs Gary represents, said Friday. ``Lo and behold, we sadly
learned that those very same attorneys that we hired treated us
poorly, disrespectfully and as if we had no rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But plaintiff Kimberly Orton, who stuck with Mehri's team, is
quite satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, I have never had a lack of trust in our
attorneys,'' Orton said. ``Their work has been outstanding,
committed and filled with integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary also accused Mehri's team of having a ``slave contract''
with plaintiffs in the case.
</P>
<P>
   He said provisions in Mehri's agreement require plaintiffs,
under certain conditions, to pay exorbitantly high fees and
penalties if the plaintiffs reject Mehri's legal advice.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff Linda Ingram sharply disagreed with Gary's
characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The provision was put into the agreement to protect the entire
class from any one person putting their individual interests above
that of the class,'' Ingram said. ``We all discussed that provision
and agreed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that Coca-Cola has discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the allegations but agreed to a
settlement for the class, which should be finalized at the end of
October.

 &HT;    Movie doesn't exaggerate '91 storm
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Special effects for the summer blockbuster ``The Perfect Storm''
were done on a movie set in Los Angeles. But on Oct. 30, 1991,
Mother Nature was directing the action off the coast of New England
as the storm that spawned the movie unleashed its fury.
</P>
<P>
   There really was a perfect storm. It really did sink the Andrea
Gail. And there really were 100-foot waves. At the time, however,
the National Weather Service was having as much trouble convincing
people that nature could whip up such a storm as Hollywood may have
persuading moviegoers that George Clooney really is a Gloucester
fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a certain amount of skepticism to our warnings,''
says retired forecaster Bob Case, who was the deputy meteorologist
in the Boston office of the National Weather Service when the storm
formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a beautiful autumn in New England,'' he says. ``Not too
many people could fathom _ or believe _ 100-foot waves and
hurricane-force winds in a storm that was heading from east to
west. You were looking at a set of meteorological circumstances
that come together maybe every 50 to 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Case helped coin the phrase ``perfect storm'' in describing it
to author Sebastian Junger, whose book by the same name inspired
the film. According to Case, the storm's formation was caused by
the rare convergence of three separate weather systems in the days
preceding Halloween 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a strong disturbance associated with a cold front
that moved through New England on Sunday, Oct. 27. It passed
without incident, but began to intensify rapidly as it encountered
the edge of an unusually intense high pressure area over
southeastern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``These circumstances alone could have created a strong storm,''
says Case. ``But then, like throwing gasoline on a fire, a dying
Hurricane Grace delivered immeasurable tropical energy to create
the perfect storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by warm, moist air from the Gulf Stream, the storm turned
and headed west _ the opposite direction of New England's familiar
nor'easters _ catching both fishermen and coastal residents off
guard. By the morning of Wednesday, Oct. 30, the storm was bearing
down on the Massachusetts coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew something was going to happen,'' recalls Ross
Dickman, who worked in the weather station of Boston's Logan
Airport that day. By afternoon it was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could lithat ``Storm'' director Wolfgang Petersen has
represented the fury of the storm accurately.
</P>
<P>
   They take exception, however, to promotional claims that it was
``the storm of the century.'' New England has seen several such
storms _ including the Hurricane of 1938, the Blizzard of 1978 and
the winter storm of 1993, which dumped up to 50 inches of snow in
North Georgia and also raised 100-foot waves off the New England
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using a bit of poetic license to call it the worst,''
says Case. ``But it's probably in the top 10 storms in the last 50
to 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Case is also piqued by one other aspect of Hollywood's version
of the real storm. ``In the book, Sebastian Junger describes me as
`fit, balding and in my mid-50s,''' he says. ``In the movie, they
replace me with a television weatherman.''

PARENTS OF PLAYERS STILL AT CENTER OF CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (With TEN-WIMBLEDON)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ A day after the police led Jelena Dokic's
father away and Alexandra Stevenson accused one French player of a
racial slur and another of pushing her mother, there was a warning
issued to Damir Dokic and a mystified look on the face of
Anne-Gaelle Sidot.
</P>
<P>
   Sidot was the player accused of pulling down the hat of Samantha
Stevenson and pushing her at a recent tournament. In another
incident, Alexandra and Samantha Stevenson said Sidot's boyfriend
had cried out, ``Let's get her,'' after a practice session.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Amelie Cocheteux, who allegedly used a racial slur
in Alexandra's direction, said, ``All of this is purely invented.''
Friday, Sidot had a chance to defend herself.
</P>
<P>
   After losing her third-round match to Tamarine Tanasugarn, 6-1,
4-6, 6-1, Sidot acknowledged yanking down Samantha Stevenson's hat,
but said it was only in response to an insult Alexandra's mother
had directed at her. As for the threat allegedly issued by her
boyfriend, Sidot said: ``It's a lie. Never, never, never, never.
She said so many wrong things, so I'm not surprised that she said
another thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also not shocking to see a release issued jointly by the
World Tennis Association and the All England Club regarding the
rowdy and hostile behavior Damir Dokic displayed on Thursday. The
father of Jelena Dokic boisterously stormed around the grounds and
smashed a reporter's cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be monitoring the conduct of Mr. Dokic closely,''
officials said in the release. ``Should this again fall below
acceptable standards, it would lead to Mr. Dokic being banned from
the grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Jelena Dokic, with her father nearby, cruised through
her doubles match Friday with her partner, Jennifer Capriati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great relationship with my father,'' Dokic said.
``He's a big influence. I like having him around. Doesn't bother me
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of her own circus, there was irritation clearly
registered on Sidot's face. She could not understand why
accusations were being aimed at her, but Sidot did have her own
opinions about Alexandra Stevenson's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I never had problems with players or with coaches,''
Sidot said. ``So, I don't understand. Maybe she doesn't feel good
in this world, I don't know. She said that if she knew before it
was going to be like this, she would have sent Alexandra to school.
I mean, it's more her who has a problem than us. She said something
bad about me, but it's not true.''

<P>
   Just before Referee Alan Mills postponed the Andre Agassi-Todd
Martin match on Center Court Thursday night because of rain, Agassi
expressed his concerns about the increasingly slippery grass.
Still, play continued until Agassi took a bad fall. Mills stepped
out and suspended play, but Agassi was furious and shouted his
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I phoned him up this morning and told him that I apologized
for certainly raising my tone,'' Agassi said. ``At that moment, I
was very frustrated and concerned because of what happened at
Queen's club.''
</P>
<P>
   A week before Wimbledon, in a similar circumstance, Agassi
slipped and tweaked his back in a match at Queen's club. On
Thursday, he was not hurt by his fall, but he did take his time
gathering himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just laying there trying to stall, hoping it would rain
more,'' Agassi said with a smile. ``I went over and toweled off,
just worked it like a veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' Status in Doubt
</P>
<P>
   The Davis Cup is just over three weeks away and Pete Sampras'
injury (tendinitis) has put the U.S. team's makeup in question. But
another issue was also posed Friday: should Davis Cup Captain John
McEnroe play doubles?
</P>
<P>
   ``As exciting as that would be for the public, and the press,''
said Todd Martin, ``it also takes away from the productivity that I
think John can have on the rest of the team during the practice
week, and then even during our doubles match. I think that would
hurt us more than help us.''  &QL;

TECHNOLOGY VETERANS SEE DOUBTS ABOUT INCUBATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're known as incubators _ but one venture capitalist now
calls them incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   The high-technology bounty of the last few years yielded a small
crop of these companies, which nurture nascent Internet start-ups,
then spin them out or sell them as they mature. Among the
best-known publicly traded incubators are CMGI of Andover, Mass.,
and the Internet Capital Group and Safeguard Scientifics, both of
Wayne, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   But as the technology market has come down to earth, some people
are questioning the very rationale behind taking public what is
essentially a venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   One major problem is that the core business operation of the
incubators _ launching their portfolio companies into the public
markets _ has lost much of its allure in recent months, as
offerings have been postponed or canceled and as first-day gains
have shrunk considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street in general has become less receptive to the kind of
companies that most incubators are nurturing _ early-stage
businesses with big ideas but no products or profits. So the ``time
to market'' has lengthened for many Internet companies in the
incubators' portfolios. This means that the risk of owning these
companies has increased while the real value of an incubator's
investments has decreased sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McNamee, a general partner at Integral Capital Partners,
noted that while the public market is a beguiling source of
low-cost capital for these incubators, it comes at a steep price _
time horizons and expectations that are incompatible with a venture
capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incubators were compelling in 1998, 1999, because the time
frame for creating market value in ventures was very short,'' he
said. ``If recent trends persist, it will take much longer to build
market value in new ventures. This suggests that some incubator
funds will ultimately incinerate the capital that goes into them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the technology market has cooled, incubators' share prices
have turned icy: CMGI is down 66.9 percent this year through
Friday, to $45.8125. Internet Capital has tumbled 78.2 percent, to
$37.015625, and Safeguard is down 41 percent, to $32.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Incubator stocks are viewed by Wall Street as a way to tap into
privately held companies before their initial public offerings.
Analysts have typically computed target prices for incubators by
tallying the value of the holdings _ for the private companies,
they estimated the public value _ and added a premium for good
management and for synergies between the holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the better-known private incubators, Idealab of Pasadena,
Calif., and Divine InterVentures of Lisle, Ill., are poised to go
public, hoping for a taste of the spectacular Wall Street success
enjoyed by companies like Internet Capital in its initial offering
last August; its shares were priced at $6 but rose to $200 by Jan.
3.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one investment bank is wary about the timing.
Credit Suisse First Boston had been scheduled to be lead manager
for Divine InterVenture's public offering. But last month, after
the bank tried to postpone the sale until the fall, Andrew J.
Filipowski, chief executive of Divine InterVentures, jettisoned
First Boston and hired Robertson Stephens to lead the offering
instead. Last week, Divine InterVentures postponed its offering,
which is for up to $200.1 million, until next Thursday. Idealab's
initial offering, for up to $30 million, is not yet scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the credentials of both Filipowski, a former chief
executive of Platinum Technology, and Bill Gross, the venture
capitalist who is chief executive of Idealab, some analysts are
wary about their long-term prospects. Another problem for
incubators is that they tend to be invested in the kinds of
companies that are not in favor at the moment _ those focused on
e-commerce, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is more interested in companies that are making net
profits now,'' said Gail Bronson, a senior analyst at IPO Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Idealab has a portfolio that includes companies like eToys,
whose business model looked much more compelling last year. Divine
InterVentures, like Internet Capital, is focused on
business-to-business exchanges, an area that generated much
investor enthusiasm late last year but is also cooling because of
market saturation.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, recent new-issue successes have been in areas like
Internet infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Core technology and infrastructure companies are more likely
to attract venture funding immediately and not need the services of
an incubator,'' said Bronson, adding that incubators tend to
finance companies at an earlier stage of development than do
traditional venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Incubators may also suffer from competition with other
incubators for management teams and ideas. Internet Capital had the
first-mover advantage in the business-to-business e-commerce
sector, but Divine InterVentures does not.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as more incubators go public, they compete with one
another for investor capital, possibly driving down their stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Should investors be placing bets on incubators at all?
</P>
<P>
   Henry T.C. Hu, a professor at the University of Texas
specializing in law and finance, says no, partly because an
incubator's public investors do not have access to detailed
information about the companies in its portfolio. ``How do you
convey to the public how much these opportunities are worth?'' he
asked. ``It's very different from the kind of information flow
between a venture capitalist and their investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with a mutual fund, he said, incubators suffer because
their holdings are not publicly traded and thus are neither priced
by the market nor reflect its movements.
</P>
<P>
   Others think the incubator model still has value.``The symbiosis
between companies is there, and it's real,'' said Phil Leigh, vice
president of Internet research at Raymond James, the brokerage
firm. It is just that ``one's perception of that value gets overly
optimistic in a bull market and gets overly scrutinized in a bear
market.'' &QL;

<P>
   The deciphering of the human genome, announced last week by
rival public and private teams, promises to change the practice of
medicine in profound ways in the decades to come. But for
investors, whose focus may be a bit more short term, surprisingly
little changed last week.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in medicine, whether the stocks of pharmaceutical
giants or smaller biotechnology concerns, has always been about
identifying those groups most likely to turn scientific discoveries
into safe, effective drugs, and to manufacture and market them
efficiently. One can also invest in tools companies _ the providers
of chemical reagents, laboratory equipment and, increasingly, data,
that are used to discover and develop new drugs, although these
products usually offer lower margins.
</P>
<P>
   One of these tools companies, Celera Genomics Group, a unit of
the PE Corp., joined with the Human Genome Project, a consortium of
academic centers, to announce last Monday that they had compiled a
rough but nearly complete draft of the human genome. While the
consortium's data becomes part of the public domain, Celera plans
to sell access to its genome data by subscription, seeking in
effect to become the Bloomberg of biology.
</P>
<P>
   Celera only has six subscribers, but some analysts said last
week's news should spur others to sign up. One bullish analyst was
Eric Schmidt of SG Cowen; the announcement, he said, ``will serve
as an impetus to new collaborations, as Celera has clearly
demonstrated its capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are many other ways to play the genomics card. Celera
is actually a latecomer to the industry, compared with companies
like Incyte Genomics, which has more than 20 subscribers to its
database of genes, or Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Human Genome
Sciences, both of which have sold data on a more limited basis and
are concentrating on making drugs using genomics discoveries. Many
mature biotech companies, like Amgen and Genentech, have genomics
programs of their own, as do several big pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fairly negative on genomics stocks,'' said Stuart
Weisbrod, a portfolio manager with the Merlin Biomed Group, a New
York hedge fund. ``I don't think they reflect economic value yet,
and there's been a big misconception on the part of the public that
once you have a gene you can have a drug in a bottle in two years.
It takes 10 years, and even then, most drugs fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while sequencing the entire genome is a major
scientific accomplishment, there is far more utility in sequencing
individual genes whose functions will provide the target for new
drugs. Merlin's only major holding in a genomics company is Incyte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incyte has a gene database which is already being used to
develop drugs'' by more than 25 large drug company partners,
Weisbrod said. ``They have over 500 issued patents with utility,
and Celera has zero.'' (Merlin also has a small stake in Genset,
the French genomics company, which he believes has been
overlooked.)
</P>
<P>
   Kris Jenner, manager of the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences fund,
is also an investor in Incyte, as well as in Affymetrix, which
makes so-called gene chips used in analyzing genomics data, and PE
Biosystems, Celera's sister company, which makes gene sequencing
machines and other laboratory equipment, and which, unlike Celera,
is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   But Jenner said he did not believe that investors had to own
shares of the genomics companies themselves to benefit from
genomics discoveries. ``There will be many beneficiaries of that
knowledge, and that includes the pharmaceuticals companies,'' he
said. ``You don't necessarily have to have a concentrated focus in
companies identified by Wall Street as `genomics' companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Genomics is a consideration, but investments in drug companies
should be based primarily on nearer-term factors, he said. ``There
is not an immediate benefit likely to be seen by an investor in
distant derivative players like a Pfizer, an Eli Lilly or a
Genentech,'' he said, although he owns all three based on other
merits.
</P>
<P>
   While genomics companies may have an edge in the research phase
of producing a new therapy, mature biotechnology and large
pharmaceutical concerns have proved their ability to develop,
manufacture and market drugs. All of these companies have access to
genomics, whether through major collaborations or internal efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple fact of life is drug discovery will be driven by a
variety of tools applied to the raw data from the human genome;
every company is going to do that,'' said Viren Mehta, head of
Mehta Partners in New York. ``Nothing fundamental in the industry
has changed, except we are going to apply these new insights. So we
are focused on companies with management who we think have the
vision to apply the new science successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehta is an investor in Millennium and Human Genome Sciences but
also looks for companies that can use genomics data most directly
in drug discovery. These include Abgenix and the Cambridge Antibody
Technology Group _ two producers of so-called monoclonal
antibodies, genetically engineered copies of immune-system proteins
_ as well as Transkaryotic Therapies, which has a novel gene-switch
technology for producing proteins in the body. Among larger
companies, he owns Pfizer, Pharmacia and American Home Products.  &QL;

 &HT;    Adoption lawyer wanted on three felony charges
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Former Boca Raton adoption lawyer Stuart
Gordon Horowitz, who resigned from the bar amid accusations his
mishandling of adoptions left a trail of heartache across South
Florida, is wanted on three felony charges, authorities confirmed
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy court records also show Horowitz, 31, and his wife,
Susan, legally walked away from more than $2.5 million in debts.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Donald Ganzel of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office
warrant division said this week the charges were filed June 14.
Horowitz is charged with grand theft, failure by an intermediary to
obtain prior approval of expenses, and failure of an intermediary
to report intended placement of a child.
</P>
<P>
   All three are third-degree felonies, each punishable by a prison
term of up to five years and a fine of up to $5,000, according to
state laws. Ganzel did not have details of the charges and the Palm
Beach County state attorney would not confirm them.
</P>
<P>
   Ganzel said the warrants were good only in Florida but could be
expanded if authorities learn the wanted person has left the state.
The Horowitzes listed a Colorado address late last year, records
show.
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz's criminal attorney, Michael Dutko, did not return
calls. His civil attorney, Michael Wood, would only say he did not
know Horowitz's current address and did not know he'd moved to
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz resigned from the Florida Bar in November 1997 after at
least 17 people complained about his practices. Some were clients
who said they lost money or the chance of adoption; some were birth
mothers who said Horowitz failed to support during their
pregnancies as agreed. Two families said they were promised Chapter
7 bankruptcy protection for himself and his wife as well as his law
practice, claiming their debts were $2.53 million. A deed filed
with the Palm Beach County Clerk of Courts shows the Horowitzes
sold their suburban Boca Raton home in November 1999 for $238,000
and listed a new address in Englewood, Colo., a Denver suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy was closed last December after a court-appointed
trustee concluded that all of Horowitz's $245,772 in assets,
including his home and any proceeds from its sale, were protected
from creditors under state law. The Horowitzes kept their assets.
</P>
<P>
   Broward County prosecutors closed their investigation of
Horowitz in September 1999 and turned the case over to Palm Beach
County. Assistant State Attorney John F. Hanlon Jr. said Horowitz
had moved his law office from Hollywood to Boca Raton before most
of the alleged incidents, and it was the home county for most of
the alleged victims.
</P>
<P>
   Hanlon suggested Palm Beach County charge Horowitz with grand
theft, saying Horowitz billed his clients certain fees without
obtaining prior court approval, as required by law for those kinds
of fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our firm belief that this was never done by Horowitz,''
Hanlon wrote Ken Selvig, Palm Beach County's chief assistant state
attorney, in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Jaffe and Simie and Shelley Platt have said Horowitz led
them to believe he'd taken all the necessary steps for adoption,
but in each case had not contacted the birth father.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, Jaffe had obtained custody of half-sisters Amanda,
then 4, and Sierra, then 6. She formally adopted Sierra in October
1998, but Amanda's birth father, Scott Charlton, who was in prison,
had said he had been looking for Amanda for the last year and a
half.
</P>
<P>
   The birth mother said at the time that Horowitz knew all along
who Charlton was and Charlton knew where to find her. She said she
left it to Horowitz to obtain consent forms. The case, originally
filed in Martin County, was moved to Palm Beach County, where a
judge gave custody to Jaffe in January 1999. Horowitz resigned from
the Bar before Jaffe could submit her complaint.
</P>
<P>
   In the Platts' complaint to the Bar, they said they adopted
their son Isaac, but Horowitz didn't tell them the birth father had
filed for custody. The two sides later agreed to turn the baby over
to the birth father. The Plattses later sued Horowitz, but the case
was frozen when Horowitz filed for bankruptcy protection. David
Gold, the Platts' attorney, said Friday he will file to reopen the
case.

 &HT;    Chick-fil-A ruffled over Burger King ad
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where's the beef?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, between Chick-fil-A and Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   Feathers are flying at the College Park-based restaurant chain
over a Burger King promotion tied to the hit summer flick ``Chicken
Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Chick-fil-A filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court late Friday
against Burger King, seeking a halt to a promotion in which
characters from the movie hold up cards that say: ``Save the
Chickens: Eat A Whopper.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit also seeks unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims the Burger King promotion is too similar to
Chick-fil-A's popular ads featuring cows that urge consumers to:
``Eat Mor Chikin.'' The Burger King TV spots tell consumers to eat
more beef and, at one point, the chickens mistakenly spell Whopper
with a ``C'' before correcting it, the suit contends.
</P>
<P>
   The Chick-fil-A cows frequently misspell words. The cow ads have
been an integral part of the company's marketing efforts for five
years, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be a direct imitation of our campaign,'' said
Chick-fil-A spokesman Don Perry. ``Our concern is obviously the
dilution of our trademark and infringement on our copyrights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely serious,'' Perry said. ``It confuses the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   A Burger King Corp. spokeswoman said the Miami-based chain is
reviewing its options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to be chicken, but I simply cannot comment
further since this is a legal issue,'' said spokeswoman Kim Miller.
``However, I can assure you we don't believe there is any merit to
the situation and we will certainly defend ourselves vigorously.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 2, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-TERM-REVIEW (Washington) _ It was a Supreme Court term of
surpassing interest, rich in symbol and substance, a vivid reminder
of the court's power to scramble settled expectations, put old
questions to rest and, ultimately, to have the last word. By Linda
Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-AIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ How much would it cost to contain
the global AIDS epidemic? The answer is: How much would it cost to
banish ignorance, to deaden lust, to shame rape, to stop war, to
enrich the poor, to empower women, to defend children, to make
decent medical care as globally ubiquitous as Coca-Cola _ in short,
to get rid of all the underlying causes of the epidemic in the
Third World? By Donald G. McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL-LYING-REVIEW (Undated) _ What is it about legal
proceedings and particularly those pre-trial sworn interviews known
as depositions that turn sophisticated people into quibblers,
dissemblers or amnesiacs? Why can't they just respond to the
questions posed as people respond in everyday conversations? By
Adam Liptak.
</P>
<P>
   SKIMPY-CLOTHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Blame ``Sex and the City'' or
blame the decline of the ozone layer, but skin is in. American
women are wearing less than ever before. Summer itself is hotter.
And over the past decade, the proliferation of the Wonderbra
coincided with global warming so that just as cleavages became more
pronounced, shorts became shorter. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   GENOME-PROGRAM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Just as surely as any
shrink-wrapped Microsoft disk, the human genome is a program, a set
of precisely coded instructions that evolution has written for the
design, operation and unfortunately rather limited maintenance of a
person. That people should be operated by such a specific script is
as amazing as it would be to find that robots have souls. By
Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY-CELEBS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some statements from
celebrity women who have explained why they chose to appear nude in
Playboy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-BLUES-REVIEW (London) _ Britain is endlessly wondering
``How'm I doing?'' But unlike Ed Koch, the self-congratulating
former mayor of New York, Britain rarely expects a positive answer.
And lately, a nation that is always sensitive about perceived
slights to its international status has found more than usual to be
upset about. And now along comes ``The Patriot,'' a film about the
American Revolution that presents the English as effete war
criminals with snobby accents who herd families of fledgling
Americans into barns and set them on fire, just for fun. To Britons
sick of being pushed around, this obnoxious affront to
retrospective pride may be the last straw. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ All of Mexico's
presidential candidates call themselves democrats, but the voters
will really be choosing between two sharply different ways of
political life. The longtime ruling party, known as the PRI, offers
its tradition of top-down control and doing what it takes to stay
in power. The opposition comes from a contrasting wellspring of
grass-roots struggles for citizens' rights and the fight for the
balance of powers. The opposition is democratic, in the way that
most Americans understand the term. The PRI is not. Yet Mexicans
are clearly torn about this choice. By Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ANTIMISSILE-REVIEW (Beijing) _ It's hard to find any
foreign-policy expert here, in or out of government, who believes
the stated U.S. rationale for a continental anti-missile defense:
That it's merely intended to stop the likes of North Korea or Iraq.
Even Westward-leaning scholars here think the new push for missile
defense in Washington reflects an underlying conviction that the
United States must better prepare for battle with China. By Erik
Eckholm.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 2, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-TERM-REVIEW (Washington) _ It was a Supreme Court term of
surpassing interest, rich in symbol and substance, a vivid reminder
of the court's power to scramble settled expectations, put old
questions to rest and, ultimately, to have the last word. By Linda
Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-AIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ How much would it cost to contain
the global AIDS epidemic? The answer is: How much would it cost to
banish ignorance, to deaden lust, to shame rape, to stop war, to
enrich the poor, to empower women, to defend children, to make
decent medical care as globally ubiquitous as Coca-Cola _ in short,
to get rid of all the underlying causes of the epidemic in the
Third World? By Donald G. McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL-LYING-REVIEW (Undated) _ What is it about legal
proceedings and particularly those pre-trial sworn interviews known
as depositions that turn sophisticated people into quibblers,
dissemblers or amnesiacs? Why can't they just respond to the
questions posed as people respond in everyday conversations? By
Adam Liptak.
</P>
<P>
   SKIMPY-CLOTHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Blame ``Sex and the City'' or
blame the decline of the ozone layer, but skin is in. American
women are wearing less than ever before. Summer itself is hotter.
And over the past decade, the proliferation of the Wonderbra
coincided with global warming so that just as cleavages became more
pronounced, shorts became shorter. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   GENOME-PROGRAM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Just as surely as any
shrink-wrapped Microsoft disk, the human genome is a program, a set
of precisely coded instructions that evolution has written for the
design, operation and unfortunately rather limited maintenance of a
person. That people should be operated by such a specific script is
as amazing as it would be to find that robots have souls. By
Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY-CELEBS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some statements from
celebrity women who have explained why they chose to appear nude in
Playboy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-BLUES-REVIEW (London) _ Britain is endlessly wondering
``How'm I doing?'' But unlike Ed Koch, the self-congratulating
former mayor of New York, Britain rarely expects a positive answer.
And lately, a nation that is always sensitive about perceived
slights to its international status has found more than usual to be
upset about. And now along comes ``The Patriot,'' a film about the
American Revolution that presents the English as effete war
criminals with snobby accents who herd families of fledgling
Americans into barns and set them on fire, just for fun. To Britons
sick of being pushed around, this obnoxious affront to
retrospective pride may be the last straw. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ All of Mexico's
presidential candidates call themselves democrats, but the voters
will really be choosing between two sharply different ways of
political life. The longtime ruling party, known as the PRI, offers
its tradition of top-down control and doing what it takes to stay
in power. The opposition comes from a contrasting wellspring of
grass-roots struggles for citizens' rights and the fight for the
balance of powers. The opposition is democratic, in the way that
most Americans understand the term. The PRI is not. Yet Mexicans
are clearly torn about this choice. By Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ANTIMISSILE-REVIEW (Beijing) _ It's hard to find any
foreign-policy expert here, in or out of government, who believes
the stated U.S. rationale for a continental anti-missile defense:
That it's merely intended to stop the likes of North Korea or Iraq.
Even Westward-leaning scholars here think the new push for missile
defense in Washington reflects an underlying conviction that the
United States must better prepare for battle with China. By Erik
Eckholm.

 &HT;    Bush turns around and OKs $2 million for Daytona Speedway
 &HT;    By S.V. Date
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ On the eve of his presidential candidate brother's
appearance at the annual Pepsi 400 stock car race, Gov. Jeb Bush
announced a $2 million state grant for the racetrack to build a
pedestrian walkway _ a project he deemed unworthy of public money
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush a year ago vetoed $3 million for a pedestrian bridge over
the eight-lane road adjacent to Daytona International Speedway,
questioning how the state as a whole would benefit from a project
for a company that in 1999 reported a pre-tax income of $95
million.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush gushed in a news release about the walkway's
importance to Florida, just a day before brother and presumptive
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush was to serve as
grand marshal at the Daytona track. ``It's exciting to be able to
assist this world-class facility with an investment that will
stimulate economic growth,'' Jeb Bush said. ``These funds will
encourage new job growth and increased opportunities for Florida
residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats quickly seized on the flip-flop.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of money for a campaign appearance,'' said state
Democratic Party spokesman Tony Welch.
</P>
<P>
   ``What changed over the past year? What's changed is that his
brother is in a hotly contested race for the state of Florida. . .
. This smells looking at it from any angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Liz Hirst denied any attempt to help George
Bush's campaign. ``This was done to help the state of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three months ago, the governor said publicly that he had
the same reservations about the project as last year, hinting
strongly that he would veto it again should it appear in the
2000-01 state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Hirst said the money was awarded now because the City of Daytona
Beach and the company had met the criteria required by the
governor's Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development.

 &HT;    ABSENT BUSH, GORE TALKS UP LIBERTIES

<P>
   Sweet land of liberty. Now there's a grand, overarching theme
that should make a presidential candidate's heart (or at least his
speech writer's) go pitter-patter as the Fourth of July approaches.
</P>
<P>
   But we haven't heard much from George W. Bush and Al Gore about
the under- &QL; 
lying principles of our generally exceptional nation, unless you
count the throwaway lines.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Bush's efficacious pander to the League of United
Latin American citizens included a flourish on ``life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness.'' Touching but not very informative.
</P>
<P>
   Inattention to the biggest-picture ideas is not likely to have
much effect on the outcome of the presidential race unless one of
the major contenders announces in late October an unanticipated
affection for establishing a monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Supreme Court's 5-4 votes on abortion rights and other
culturally divisive issues, Gore, of course, hopes he can make the
bank shot and get some mileage from the threat that Bush's high
court nominees might pose. Polling has shown repeatedly, however,
that only rarely are voters driven by a single issue, even abortion
or other emotionally charged questions that make their way to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   To make any inroads, Gore would have to convince voters that
Bush presents a more broad-gauge threat. That was exactly the point
of the recent ``Courting Disaster'' treatise from the People for
the American Way Foundation. Lord knows this tax-exempt 501(c)3
wasn't promoting Gore _ oh, no _ but if you're really dense they
provided a helpful subtitle: ``How a Scalia-Thomas Supreme Court
Would Endanger Our Rights and Freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it says something comforting, if not ennobling, about
the strength of our democracy that the major party candidates would
rather go hammer and tong over salmon-defeating hydroelectric dams
in the Pacific Northwest than to offer straightforward musings on
the founding concepts of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it's not a good idea to let the campaign pass
without having an understanding of the candidates' views of such
basic tenets.
</P>
<P>
   So, both campaigns were asked to make their big guy available.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore's limousine picked up speed last week in downtown
Philadelphia, just a few blocks from Independence Hall, the vice
president warmed quickly to the question of what his tenure in the
White House would mean to basic constitutional liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolute protection of them,'' Gore began. ``I believe that
our Constitution is a living and breathing document that has not
only the enumerated liberties mentioned in the Constitution but
also liberties such as right of privacy that has been found by the
Supreme Court in the Constitution even though the word does not
appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Eminently sensible answers like this send strict
constructionists around the bend and contrast with what Bush has
had to say on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   When outlining his criteria for Supreme Court nominees, Bush
said last fall: ``The most primary issue is will they strictly
interpret the Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, although he wouldn't like it, needs to be drawn out on
this point. On which issues has the court gone too far? Privacy,
voting rights, jury selection, gun control, environmental
protection?
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible to question the governor directly on the
point, as his handlers failed to make him available. Perhaps they
thought there would be a pop quiz on the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was cagier when the issue was turned around and he was
asked how constitutional principles might be diminished by a Bush
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know the governor's views on all these
questions,'' Gore replied initially and unconvincingly. The highly
electronic vice president probably could have pulled out his Palm
Pilot and told you if Bush had, since birth, said three or more
words about the shroud of Turin or Kerensky debt.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, given just a moment, Gore conjured up a dig at
the constitutional implications of a George W. Bush presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that he opposes a woman's right to choose,'' Gore said,
noting Bush's relentlessly narrow take on abortion. This comment
came the day before the Supreme Court's big abortion &QL; 
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that he has said that his two favorite Supreme Court
justices are Justice (Antonin) &QL; 
Scalia and Justice (Clarence) &QL; 
Thomas,'' Gore said. ``Those would be the last two that I would
name as models for future ... nominations.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be a slender reed on which to hang much of a
presidential campaign, but in this area the vice president is going
with what he's got.

HEAPING HELPINGS OF NOSTALGIA, A CHILD'S PLATE OF PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 20 
 By JANE HODGES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ When a busload of diner owners and
enthusiasts from the fourth annual Diner-Rama conference descended
on the Seaplane Diner here last Sunday, Bob Arena, a 61-year-old
New Englander who has run the place for 25 years, was prepared.
</P>
<P>
   The lunch crowd had barely sat down before the Seaplane's
four-person staff began producing specials like baked scrod,
gravy-laden hamburger plates and mayo-heavy tuna _ each less than
$5. But while the portions were generous and their prices right,
the diner business rarely makes owners feel as good as their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the rewards of running a diner are often more
sentimental than financial. Owners go into the business because
they envision a career where the whole family can work together, or
they want to restore a vintage building to its former glory, or
they want to run the small place that has served comfort food to
locals on Main Street since before anyone can remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money you make? It pays the bills and if you have any left
over, well, you're lucky,'' Arena said. It took a decade of 90-hour
weeks before he began bringing home the $35,000 to $40,000 he makes
in a good year. Arena still counts himself lucky: The diner he
bought for $95,000 back in 1975 made it through those tough times
and he is still in business.
</P>
<P>
   But, as his own story implies, the diner owner, the
quintessential American small-business person, is becoming an
endangered species. Owners underestimate the costs of restoring
their buildings, including rewiring and updating to meet zoning
codes. They overestimate how much money they can make from low-cost
meals and tables that in many cases seat fewer than 40. The
fast-food and family restaurant chains have lured many of their
customers away.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Zilka, who coordinated the conference and is a
professional diner restorer, estimates that 6,000 of these
restaurants were built between 1905 and 1965. Only 2,500 remain, he
says. Since 1983, the National Register of Historic Places has
added 18 diners to its list.
</P>
<P>
   To raise awareness about the diner's role in history, Zilka
organized Diner-Rama, which meets in a different region each year.
The event last weekend attracted 75 people, ranging from a
half-dozen diner owners to recreational food buffs and a sales
executive who is considering buying a diner and moving it to
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Zilka also began curating the American Diner Museum, which opens
here in 2003 as part of the Heritage Harbor waterfront complex. The
museum has been designated a Smithsonian affiliate, and
construction began last week. To date, 10 diners have been donated
to the museum, with two already moved to the museum grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Garbin, founder and editor of Roadside, a Worcester,
Mass.-based magazine for diner enthusiasts, estimates that owners
need to start with at least $750,000 for restoration and, if
necessary, relocation. He says that as many as one-third of all
owners, especially the newcomers, aren't making a profit. Rather
than trying to accumulate diners, owners typically sell and look
for another one to restore and operate.
</P>
<P>
   Chains have given the family-owned diner more competition, which
Denny's is carrying to a new level by pursuing its own nostalgic
theme. Last year, the company spent $200,000 to $300,000 each
converting 140 of its 1,784 restaurants into what it calls Denny's
Diners.
</P>
<P>
   Denny's also bought 44 restaurants last year from Starlite
Manufacturing of Ormond Beach, Fla., one of the few remaining diner
manufacturers. This year, Denny's is building 20 restaurants from a
second diner blueprint done in-house.
</P>
<P>
   While Denny's revenue per restaurant increased by 2.4 percent
last year, the diner-style restaurants gained 8 percent. ``By
creating an environment that's fun and different from a typical
Denny's, we've attracted younger customers,'' said Jon Jameson, the
company's chief strategy officer.
</P>
<P>
   The Diner-Rama crowd at the Seaplane was not about to stop by a
Denny's instead. Arena has managed to keep the building,
manufactured in 1952 by the Jerry O'Mahony Co., gleaming. One
waitress has worked with him for 25 years, and his kitchen prides
itself on blueberry pancakes and a snail salad, developed at a
regular's request.
</P>
<P>
   But to stay afloat, the Seaplane has had to move with the times.
Since the supper crowd was small, Arena shut down for dinner and
sold his liquor license. The diner reopens from midnight to 4 a.m.
to cater to customers leaving nearby clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to local demographics _ and finding attractions
beyond food _ are crucial. Jerry Berta, one of the conference
speakers, bought his first diner, the Diner Store, now in Grand
Rapids, Mich., as a gallery and store for his neon-lit sculptures
of diners and other images from the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   After passers-by kept stopping in to ask for food, he bought the
Rosie's Diner once used as a setting for Bounty paper towel
commercials and moved it to his lot in 1991 to serve meals. He
turned it to face the west, where it would catch the sunset and
lure motorists. His 92-seater, profitable at its launch, brought in
$1 million last year, better than average for a large diner.
</P>
<P>
   Other diner owners encourage their customers to become a
community. The Red Arrow in Manchester, N.H., a 36-seater owned by
Carol Lawrence, who attended the conference, publishes a newsletter
about her customers and staff. Her diner, 78 years old, had $1
million in revenue last year, benefiting from staying open around
the clock. It gets an extra dose of attention every four years
during the New Hampshire primary campaign; Vice President Al Gore
used it last winter for a stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   Not all attention-getting efforts improve the business. Celeste
and Phil Paleologos, conference speakers who run the Shawmut Diner
in New Bedford, Mass., began operating a radio talk show three
years ago from an enclosed booth in the restaurant. The show,
however, has not significantly raised its $400,000 in revenue.
Finding employees, meanwhile, has become increasingly difficult;
she has canceled two family vacations in recent years because of
the shortage of help. And her three children probably will not take
over the business. ``I think about selling this place everyday,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some conference attendees persist despite failure. Gordon
Tindall, 52, bought the Clarksville Diner in the town of that name
in New Jersey, for $3,000 in 1988. He restored the diner by hand,
even securing its place on the National Register of Historic
Places. He moved it to Decorah, Iowa, a college town of 8,000, and
opened it in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was naive enough to think that if you had good food and good
wait staff and kept it clean it would catch on,'' he said. His wife
joined him in working 84-hour weeks, but their marriage dissolved
under the strain.
</P>
<P>
   Tindall moved into a cramped basement under the diner and
continued for a few more years before acknowledging defeat. In
1998, he sold the diner to a French television station that shipped
it abroad. ``There were a lot of $300 days,'' he recalled. ``That's
not much when you have a 14-hour workday.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he bought another diner, which he is now restoring and
then plans to sell. He still aspires to operate one.
</P>
<P>
   It's a process, he says, that defies logic. ``My advice to
anyone who wants to get into this business is: `Don't ask too many
questions. Just do it.'''

<P>
   The hidden man in the saga of the human genome, the gent whose
photograph was not on the cover of Time magazine last week, is
54-year-old Tony White. He is the Cuban-born businessman who two
years ago, through shrewd investing, precipitated the acrimonious
race between public scientists and private entrepreneurs that ended
Monday in the East Room of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   White belongs in the promoter's hall-of-fame, along with Bofors,
Krupp, Vickers, Zaheroff, and others who got rich selling arms to
both sides of an arms race.
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive of PE Corp., White last year put molecular
biologist J. Craig Venter in the genome business, leasing him 300
of the DNA sequencers that PE Biosystems makes and sells for
$300,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   White then quickly booked a similar number of orders from
government labs that, having begun sequencing as a public project
in 1995 at a more stately pace, suddenly found themselves in a
desperate race with Venter for priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed matters'' it says in faux Da Vinci notebook script on
the Celera home page, and by now the Venter story has been
relatively well-ventilated.
</P>
<P>
   How Venter drifted until a tour of duty deciding who among the
wounded to treat first as a Navy hospital corpman during the Tet
offensive in Vietnam turned him on to life. How he earned a PhD in
physiology and pharmacology from the University of California at
San Diego in 1976. How as an ambitious and inventive gene-hunter,
he couldn't persuade the National Institutes of Health to fund
various increasingly clever hurry-up drills.
</P>
<P>
   Less well-understood is Tony White's story, though a Forbes
magazine cover story last February hit the nail on the head.
</P>
<P>
   There was no fancy business school for White. Born in Havana to
an American father and a Cuban mother, he was raised in
straightened circumstances in Ashville, N.C. In 1969 he graduated
from Western Carolina University and took a job with health care
giant Baxter International in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   White's first job was peddling surgical gloves and intravenous
supplies to hospitals, he told Norm Alster of Investors Business
Daily in 1997. Such goods ordinarily sold on price. But as a
student of reimbursement schemes, White discovered that hopitals
were compensated by the government for their purchases on cost plus
a percentage of the cost; in other words, they had an incentive to
buy the most expensive gear. Baxter International began to
seriously differentiate its products.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later White was executive vice president of the
global giant, behind chief executive Vernon Loucks. ``Maybe I
didn't have the right pedigree,'' he told Forbes. ``I hadn't been
to business school, my father hadn't been a big CEO. Or maybe I was
too aggressive and just didn't have the style.'' In any event,
White did not figure he would be moving up, and when a curiously
loaded technology laggard named Perkin-Elmer asked him in 1995 to
be chief executive in 1995, he went.
</P>
<P>
   Perkin-Elmer had hit the front pages in 1989, when Japan's Nikon
Corp. sought to buy it. The Norwalk, Conn., technology conglomerate
was among the nation's largest vendors of the sophisticated
semiconductor manufacturing machines known as photolithographic
steppers and alligners. Its biggest customer was IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The sale was prevented; the value of the yen soon collapsed
against the dollar. But Perkin-Elmer continued to show indifferent
financial results until 1995. Then executives of hedge fund
operator George Soros and money management firm Neuberger &AMP; Berman
took an interest in the company, and White was hired by the board.
</P>
<P>
   White knew a goldmine when he saw it. Tucked away among
Perkin-Elmer's assets was a little California company, Applied
Biosystems. White announced to his first annual meeting that he
would use capital liberally to finance its growth. Over the next
several years, he shed most of its old core businesses (and even
the Perkin-Elmer name), creating instead a holding company known as
PE Corp. possessing, at first, a single asset.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Biosystems had started in the early 1980s by a couple of
California of Institute of Technology professors, Leroy Hood and
Michael Hunkapiller (and several others) with a view to
manufacturing a gene-sequencing machine they had invented.
</P>
<P>
   The laser-driven, highly computerized optical reader would
dramatically speed up the process of gene assay by automating it,
they thought. The sequencer would revolutionize biology in the same
way that atom-smashers had revolutionized physics, they claimed.
And, in due course, it did precisely that.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Hood was lured to the University of Washington by a $12
million gift to create a molecular biology department from
Microsoft's Bill Gates, proving that there are even more tempting
opportunities in genomics than selling gene-sequencers. Michael
Hunkapiller stayed on to run the company. And it was Hunkapiller
who in 1998 persuaded Tony White to hire Craig Venter to begin an
all-out race against the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project had been launched in 1990, precisely to
take advantage of the development of the new automatic sequencing
machines. Initially the effort to map and sequence a complete set
of human chromosomes was to take 15 years. Advances in mapping
techniques _ in particular an approach known as the whole-genome
shotgun method, pioneered but not invented by Venter _ moved the
timetable up.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, Venter was champing at the bit to put his ideas into
practice. But the NIH continued to channel its funds through the
five major centers of the government effort. So when White
approached Venter with the offer of enough start-up capital to
support 300 around-the-clock machines _ and 5 percent of the
company to boot _ Venter quickly agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Celera Genomics Corp. (the latin root means speed) was born, on
May 8, 1998. Overnight PE Biosystems had acquired a sibling
business unit, a new best friend, and biggest customer. After a
offer to the government to cooperate in publishing its data
(presumably with eventual scientific recognition in mind,) Venter
announced that Celera itself would sequence the entire human genome
by 2001, for around a tenth the cost of the public project.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would withhold its data just long enough to
give its investors a first look at potential genomic ``waterfront
property''to which they might stake a claim. The public project, in
contrast, posted its data on the World Wide Web for all to see at
the end of every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after we announced Celera, we set off an arms race,''
White later crowed to Forbes. ``Everyone, including the government,
had to retool, and that meant buying our equipment.'' And the rest
is history. The government bought more machines and speeded up its
efforts. The new techniques worked even better than has been
forecast. And the mapping milestone of a ``working draft'' was
celebrated in Washington last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the public purpose in all this?
</P>
<P>
   On its surface, the genome story seems designed to illustrate
one of the oldest of all American homilies: the virtues of extreme
decentralization. An entrepreneur here is free to go into business
for him or herself, over the objections of the chain of command,
even in competition with the government. Expert opinion may get it
wrong. Hierarchy may be stifling. Competition benefits Americans,
especially in a race or a war. All this is true, as far as it goes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the story points to a deeper moral, in an opposite
direction. Last week's ceremony, to which Tony White was invited,
in which Venter appeared at center stage with arch-rival Francis
Collins of the NIH's Human Genome Research Institute, didn't just
happen, after all. There had to be a certain amount of cooperation
and knuckling-under _ the details of which may take years to come
out.
</P>
<P>
   The White House gala was brokered by the elders of the
scientific establishment, an effort that began a year ago with a
call to PE's Tony White from Eric Lander of the Whitehead Institute
of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The lever presumably was
a piece of a Nobel Prize. The intense behind-the-scenes diplomatic
effort ended with the benediction pronounced last week by President
Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get all this worked out and we are all living to be
150 _ young people will still fall in love, old people will still
fight about things that should have been resolved 50 years ago _ we
will all, on occasion, do stupid things, and we will all see the
unbelievable capacity of humanity to be noble. This is a great
day.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea of Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader agreeing on anything
seems strange enough.
</P>
<P>
   To realize they not only agree on political points _ such as
mutual opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement _ but
are particularly united in their convictions they should get free
rides in their campaigns for president goes past strange to
downright weird.
</P>
<P>
   Were it Nader alone who wants government money to pay for
campaigns; or, if just he feels justified in demanding another free
political ride by requiring his and Buchanan's inclusion in any
presidential debates, that's one thing.
</P>
<P>
   (After all, this is a man who has been known for decades as a
consumer advocate opposed to so-called big business and in favor of
extensive defenses for the consumers he thinks are victimized by
corporate interests. He, the man who made seat belts mandatory in
automobiles, seems quite a logical choice to win, as he recently
did, the presidential nomination of the Green Party, a relatively
small political collective known for its emphasis on populism and
environmentalism.)
</P>
<P>
   But it's very much another thing for Buchanan, the super
conservative, notably on social issues, to so lust for government
money to finance his presidential campaign that he is willing to
leave the Republican Party to charge into the Reform Party. He thus
hopes to be the political beneficiary of $12.6 million in
government funds.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Buchanan toiled to take control of the name of the
Reform Party, if not the actual concept of the party Ross Perot
created, he has done it to win the government funds Perot earned
for the party with his showing in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and his troops have quite cheerfully worked to drive
completely from the Reform Party any who oppose the onetime GOPer
and/or his nomination in the slightest degree.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Buchanan is using the Reform Party
name and reputation in his relentless drive to be included in all
the presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting aspect of that mission is Buchanan's clear
belief his oratory skills put him head and shoulders above Democrat
Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There likely is more than the proverbial grain of truth in that
conviction. But, there is no truth in Buchanan's (and Nader's)
claims that, someway, it's not fair for the major parties to make
it so difficult for third-party or independent candidates to be
included in the debates.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only fair, it would be less than responsible for the
debate organizers to allow the participation of anyone who doesn't
meet the requirement candidates must draw at least 15 percent in
polls conducted before Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The notion Nader, Buchanan or anyone else should be allowed
debate participation just because they want it is absurd. Does
Nader or Buchanan just want himself included or do the two fairly
well-known political types want any and everyone who might want to
be president to be allowed to participate?
</P>
<P>
   As Buchanan has griped more than once: Gee whiz, it's really
tough for someone who's not a major-party candidate to raise
himself to that level. It's idiocy to whine that it is not fair to
require small-party candidates to achieve the level of major-party
candidates so the lesser knowns will have better shots at winning.
</P>
<P>
   Good grief, is this idiocy. It's not just political idiocy, it
is just plain idiocy.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no remote way it is fairness. On the contrary, it is
not fair to Gore and Bush to have a couple of losers taking up
debate time. And, it's sure not fair to any American voters who
still are trying to make up their minds about whom they want to
support.
</P>
<P>
   If it's fair for Nader and Buchanan to participate in
presidential debates primarily because they want to, then it ought
to be just as fair for any and all off the streets who have
announced they want to be president to be included in the debates.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested it might be ``fun'' to let Buchanan and
Nader in on the debate action. Clearly, those who suggest that
never had to sit through a Republican debate with Alan Keyes
shouting it was only fair he be heard _ as much as he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute Buchanan for Keyes and try telling folk that would be
fair _ and fun. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived
in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a
team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of ordinary
people and some of the troubling issues that Americans continue to
face. These stories, two or three each week, will be approximately
6,000-7,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are
organized into chapters, papers with severe space restraints may
choose to spread a single article over several days.

it. They included a black woman and a white woman as well as
Chancellor, who is black, and Dyer, who is white. The paper, it

ACREAGE OF GENETICALLY ALTERED CROPS STAYS LEVEL, GOVERNMENT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Despite growing controversy over the use of
biotechnology in agriculture, American farmers are not
significantly scaling back their planting of genetically altered
crops, according to a recent government survey.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which conducted the survey,
estimates that genetically altered crops were planted on about 69
million acres of American farmland last spring. That compares to
about 71 million acres planted with the crops a year ago, according
to seed industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The Argriculture Department, however, refused to interpret the
figures, saying they were not comparable to earlier statistics the
agency had compiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have the data to go one way or another,'' said
John Willard, a spokesman at the department.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest seed companies, which have invested billions
of dollars to create genetically altered crops, say the survey
largely confirms their own data, which suggests that overall
biotechnology acreage has not declined much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monsanto's projections continue to show that we expect total
acreage to be flat to slightly up,'' said Scarlett Foster, a
spokeswoman at Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that hidden in the Agriculture Department's
numbers are hints that after several years of spectacular growth _
biotechnology planting went from 3 million acres in 1996 to 69
million this year _ the planting of altered crops may be in
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a leveling off shows a level of concern,'' said Charles
Margulis, a spokesman at Greenpeace USA. ``Two years ago the
industry said 100 percent of the soybean crop would be genetically
engineered by the year 2000 and we're at about half that. And with
increasing concern, that could fall even further.''
</P>
<P>
   The planting of genetically altered crops has become a
contentious issue because of agitation from environmental activists
who say they are potentially dangerous to humans and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   American seed companies counter by arguing that the genetically
altered crops have been deemed safe by the Food and Drug
Administration and that the companies have not seen adverse health
effects even though they have been in the nation's food supply for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department survey released Friday seems to
contradict a March study that showed farmers intended to plant
fewer acres than they did a year ago. But the big seed companies
disputed some of those numbers and the department conceded that the
figures from an earlier study were not entirely comparable.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey released Friday, 54 percent of the
soybeans, 25 percent of the corn and 61 percent of the cotton
acreage in the United States was planted with genetically altered
seeds, which are biologically altered to create their own
insecticide or to make the crops immune to chemical spraying that
kills weeds.

 &HT;    North Carolina's Guthridge retires
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ It was Thursday afternoon, and several North
Carolina players joined coach Bill Guthridge for what they thought
would be a routine session.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started out just like a normal day,'' fifth-year senior
forward Brian Bersticker said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Guthridge dropped the bombshell. On Friday, he would step
down as head coach. Soon, Bersticker would be playing for his third
North Carolina coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock,'' he said. ``None of us were prepared for
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bersticker's reaction summarized the mood in this tight-knit
community, which was stunned when Guthridge gave up the reins to
one of college basketball's dynasties after just three seasons. Not
long ago, Guthridge said in a newspaper interview that he might
coach another five years. As recently as last Tuesday, Guthridge
was joking with reporters as they prepared stories on the upcoming
NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   But at a hastily called news conference Friday at the Smith
Center, Guthridge said he had simply run out of energy and could
not get his ``batteries recharged'' for what would have been his
fourth season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went on my vacation in May I was tired,'' said
Guthridge, who turns 63 in July. ``When I got back, I hoped I could
get myself ready again. But it just wasn't there. I gave myself a
month to see if I could do it but I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   He said he began talking to athletics director Dick Baddour
about the possibility a week ago but did not make a final decision
until Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team deserves somebody who can give them 100 percent,''
Guthridge said. ``And I didn't think I could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years as an assistant to Dean Smith, college
basketball's all-time winner, Guthridge took over the North
Carolina program for the 1998 season. With a record of 80-28, he
averaged nearly 27 wins per season, won an ACC championship by
taking the ACC Tournament in 1998 and made two trips to the Final
Four, in 1998 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success, the 1999-2000 season took something out of
Guthridge. After a four-game losing streak in January, the Tar
Heels dropped out of the rankings for the first time in 24 years.
North Carolina was eliminated by Wake Forest in the first round of
the ACC Tournament and finished the regular season 18-13, the most
regular-season losses for the school since the 1951-52 season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its record, North Carolina received its 26th consecutive
NCAA Tournament bid. Then, the Tar Heels then got hot in the
tournament, upsetting No. 1 seed Stanford on the way to the South
Regional championship and North Carolina's second Final Four bid in
three seasons under Guthridge.
</P>
<P>
   Having weathered that storm, it appeared that ``Coach Gut''
would stick around. Point guard Ed Cota is the only real loss from
last season's team, and the Tar Heels have a promising recruiting
class coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't last season; it was just an accumulation of
things,'' Guthridge said. ``I know now how Dean felt three years
ago (when he retired).''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Guthridge ended his 33-year association with the
North Carolina basketball program. The final two years of his
contract probably will be spent working in the athletics department
in a position that has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really decided what my future plans are,'' Guthridge
said. ``Right now, I'm going to the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   The 58 wins Guthridge posted in his first two seasons was an
NCAA record. In 1998, he became only the seventh coach in NCAA
history to take a team to the Final Four in his first season on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Smith said, ``To me, this is a day of
celebration for a fantastic career.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Supporters of a manned mission to Mars have been out in
force since NASA's announcement last week that there are recent,
perhaps even current, sources of liquid water on the planet. They
argue that water will enable human colonies to thrive. But it would
be foolhardy to bend the findings to justify a manned mission.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for life has become the focus of NASA's Mars program,
and without question, the discovery of persuasive evidence for it
(there is none yet) would have profound implications for our
perception of our place in the universe. If life is not even unique
to Earth within our solar system, it may be common in the cosmos at
large.
</P>
<P>
   Finding life (or the fossilized signs of it) means ``following
the water,'' for without liquid water, life cannot exist. By this
reasoning, we should perhaps be looking instead to Jupiter's moon
Europa, which seems to have a global ocean of salty water beneath
its icy crust. But Mars is nearer and in many respects more
Earth-like. Besides, it has sentimental attractions, dating from
the astronomer Percival Lowell's claims in the 1890s to have seen
canals built by a dying civilization to the later fantasies of H.G.
Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that water once flowed on Mars is all but
incontrovertible. The planet is covered with sinuous channels that
cannot easily be interpreted as anything other than dried-up river
valleys. These features are at least a billion years old, but the
new findings reveal that at least some of this water went
underground. The gullies now seen by the orbiting Mars Global
Surveyor appear to be ``young'' in geological terms, which means
they might be anywhere from a million years to a week old.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery, another triumph for the Global Surveyor,
demonstrates just how effective unmanned missions can be. And at
$165 million it is something of a bargain. But NASA knows too well
that cheap missions can be false economies. In September last year
the Mars Climate Orbiter was lost, followed in December by the Mars
Polar Lander, the victim of human calculation errors.
</P>
<P>
   These experiences have forced NASA to rethink its strategy. It
was trying to do too much with too little: to answer a barrage of
scientific questions with budget spacecraft that, in the end, cut
too many corners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the impulse to use unmanned craft was the right one. Simple,
focused missions can pay rich dividends, as the 1997 Pathfinder
mission demonstrated by successfully landing on Mars and returning
new images of the planet's environment. There is much more science
to be reaped from unmanned orbiter and lander missions than from
the hubristic endeavor, at many times the cost, to put people on
Martian soil.
</P>
<P>
   NASA would do well to resist the temptation to act upon the
invitation inherent in the words of Dr. Michael Malin, who heads
the Global Surveyor imaging team. ``One of the most interesting and
significant aspects of this discovery is what it could mean if
human explorers ever go to Mars,'' he said, explaining how useful
water would be for drinking or splitting into hydrogen and oxygen
for rocket fuel.
</P>
<P>
   While ``cathedral science'' _ huge projects that are more
inspirational than useful _ has its place, we must not allow
ourselves to be blinded by the supposed glamour of manned space
flight. The unmanned Mars missions are themselves ``cathedrals'' of
which NASA can be proud, and they needed no passengers to make that
so.

<P>
   WAYLAND, Mass. _ Despite terrific pacing and beautiful costumes
and photography, something has gone wrong in ``The Patriot,'' the
new Mel Gibson movie about the American Revolution. Signs of
trouble appear in the idyllic opening scenes. Gibson plays a
reluctant hero named Benjamin Martin, a widower with seven perfect
children, a ``Gone with the Wind'' plantation and a work force of
free and happy Black Folk who toil in his fields as volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Then the plot unfolds. We learn that Martin was the hero of an
earlier Indian war, but he decides to sit out the War of
Independence until the villainous British Colonel Tavlington (who
somewhat resembles the real-life British officer Banastre Tarleton)
burns his plantation, carries off the happy Black Folk, kills one
of his children and threatens to hang another.
</P>
<P>
   Martin impulsively decides to fight, mainly for revenge against
Tavlington, and wins the war more or less single-handed. With a
little assistance from George Washington, Nathaniel Greene and
Light Horse Harry Lee, and a lot of help from his long-suffering
sons and neighbors, Martin reforms American tactics, defeats
General Cornwallis and sets up the British surrender at Yorktown.
</P>
<P>
   The film purports to be a history of the American Revolution.
Its Web site tells us that it is ``loosely based'' on fact. How
loosely might that be?
</P>
<P>
   In short, ``The Patriot'' is to history as Godzilla was to
biology. Egregious errors appear in every scene.
</P>
<P>
   Some inaccuracies are introduced to create an illusion of
authenticity. Tavlington, for example, is dressed in a red coat. In
fact, Tarleton's mounted legion wore green, but these are the
Redcoats, and red their coats must be (an issue discussed at length
in Alan Alda's hilarious spoof ``Sweet Liberty''). A similar
example appears in the written documents that the tangled
underplots require. Eighteenth century ink was black, which on the
documents we have from those days has faded to a soft brown. To
make the letters seem authentic in the film, they are freshly
written in faded brown ink.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson's character is ``loosely based'' on five historical
figures: Francis Marion, Daniel Morgan, Elijah Clark, Thomas Sumter
and Andrew Pickens, combined into an American hero without fault or
flaw. The climactic battle where Mel Gibson defeats General
Cornwallis and kills Tavlington is ``loosely based'' on a
combination of the Battles of Cowpens (which Tarleton lost in
Cornwallis' absence) and Guilford Courthouse, Hobkirk's Hill and
Eutaw Springs (all of which Cornwallis won). Cornwallis was not
defeated in the Carolinas. Tarleton was not killed.
</P>
<P>
   The film is also heavy with anachronism. The dialogue alternates
between 21st century slang and loose quotations from irrelevant
historical materials. Mel Gibson is made to say ``I prefer one
tyrant 3,000 miles away to 3,000 tyrants one mile away'' _ a
garbled quote from Boston Tory Mather Byles _ and then lapses back
into slang.
</P>
<P>
   Other errors introduce to the American Revolution events far
removed in time and place. The extreme violence reaches its peak
when the villain Tavlington confines the inhabitants of town in a
church, sets it ablaze and burns them alive.
</P>
<P>
   Something remarkably like this event actually happened, but not
in South Carolina during the American Revolution. It happened in
the French village of Oradour-sur-Glane on June 10, 1944, during
World War II, and it was done by Emmerich's countrymen of the 2nd
S.S. Panzer Division. There were atrocities enough on both sides in
the American Revolution, but the German director has converted an
18th century British and American loyalist army into the S.S.
</P>
<P>
   The British villain Tavlington is so steeped in evil and
Cornwallis is so feckless and incompetent that the two men become
mere caricatures. (So does the saintly American hero.) The real
Tarleton was deeply conflicted, and more dramatic than the
cardboard villain we are given here.
</P>
<P>
   The inaccuracies in ``The Patriot'' are all errors in the first
degree: willful and premeditated. Emmerich is quoted on the Web
site as saying, ``On certain kinds of points, we had to decide what
is most important, historical accuracy or the dramatic impact.''
One wonders if there was ever any point where the filmmakers
decided accuracy was the more important.

JUSTICE ACQUISITION PUSHES YANKEES' PAYROLL OVER $100 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees did not need Sammy Sosa or Juan
Gonzalez to establish an historic payroll plateau. The acquisition
of David Justice did the job just fine.
</P>
<P>
   In obtaining Justice from the Cleveland Indians, the Yankees
inherited his $7 million salary, which catapulted their payroll
beyond the $100 million mark, making them the first baseball team
to wade in those expensive waters. George Steinbrenner, the
Yankees' principal owner, doesn't like to establish standards, but
he can't escape this one.
</P>
<P>
   Although baseball payrolls are computed in different ways for
different purposes, the method used by both Major League Baseball
and the players association to determine season payrolls puts the
Yankees' adjusted payroll at nearly $103 million, or $102,724,260
if all of the players' salaries are added. That total is up from
the record level of $92.5 million at which the Yankees began the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The primary change resulted from two trades. In adding Justice,
who joined the Yankees Friday in St. Petersburg, Fla., and sending
Ricky Ledee to the Cleveland Indians, the Yankees exchanged Ledee's
$240,000 salary for Justice's $7 million. The Indians were
delighted with that exchange rate, but the Yankees weren't going to
let money stand between them and another shot at the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Yankees got Jose Vizcaino from the Los
Angeles Dodgers for Jim Leyritz. That trade added a net of $2.5
million to the Yankees' payroll because Vizcaino has a $3.5 million
salary and Leyritz $1 million. To help offset the difference, the
Dodgers included $500,000 in the deal, but even if that sum were
subtracted from the total payroll, the Yankees would still be in
the nine-figure payroll area.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians did not send any money with Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Historic though it may be, the Yankees' bulging payroll will not
evoke any congratulatory notes. The arrival of a $100 million
payroll is generally seen as further evidence that something
drastic has to be done to resolve the growing disparity in
payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who began the season with the second-highest
payroll, are now more than $15 million behind the Yankees. But at
the other end of the salary scale, the four lowest payrolls
combined _ belonging to Minnesota, Florida, Kansas City and
Pittsburgh _ don't equal the Yankees' figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were inexorably marching toward a club being over $100
million,'' Commissioner Bud Selig said, ``so I guess no one will be
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the frugal head of a club with a payroll that
falls somewhere between the Yankees and their poorest cousins said
he was not disgusted that the Yankees had reached the $100 million
landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a big deal for me,'' he said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``This is a natural evolution of the game. I might
not like it, but so what?''
</P>
<P>
   A lucrative television contract has enabled the Yankees to spend
more than other teams. This is the last year of the Yankees'
12-year, $486 million deal with Cablevision. No other team has
earned even half that $40.5 million annual average in that period.
</P>
<P>
   An even bleaker prospect is ahead for the Yankees' competition.
Whether they sign a new contract with Cablevision or embark on
their own cable network through YankeeNets, the Yankees will reap
far more revenue in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have estimated that if the Yankees and Cablevision
negotiate another deal, it could be worth $100 million a year to
the team that has won the World Series three times in the last four
years. Should the Yankees decide to create their own network, they
would generate even more revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams could console themselves because the Yankees added
Justice and not Sosa or Gonzalez. If they had succeeded in
completing a deal with the Chicago Cubs for Sosa, the Yankees would
have had to sign him to a contract extension to secure his needed
approval for the trade. That extension would have been worth
somewhere in the $16 million to $18 million range.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees could argue that because Justice has spent nearly
half the season with the Indians, the Yankees' share of his salary
will actually be $3,615,384. But when Major League Baseball and the
players association compute a season's payroll, the entire salary
is charged to the acquiring team.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Where's the beef?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, between Chick-fil-A and Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   Feathers are flying at the College Park, Ga.-based restaurant
chain over a Burger King promotion tied to the hit summer flick
``Chicken Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Chick-fil-A filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court late Friday
against Burger King, seeking a halt to a promotion in which
characters from the movie hold up cards that say: ``Save the
Chickens: Eat A Whopper.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit also seeks unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims the Burger King promotion is too similar to
Chick-fil-A's popular ads featuring cows that urge consumers to:
``Eat Mor Chikin.'' The Burger King TV spots tell consumers to eat
more beef and, at one point, the chickens mistakenly spell Whopper
with a ``C'' before correcting it, the suit contends.
</P>
<P>
   The Chick-fil-A cows frequently misspell words. The cow ads have
been an integral part of the company's marketing efforts for five
years, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be a direct imitation of our campaign,'' said
Chick-fil-A spokesman Don Perry. ``Our concern is obviously the
dilution of our trademark and infringement on our copyrights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely serious,'' Perry said. ``It confuses the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   A Burger King Corp. spokeswoman said the Miami-based chain is
reviewing its options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to be chicken, but I simply cannot comment
further since this is a legal issue,'' said spokeswoman Kim Miller.
``However, I can assure you we don't believe there is any merit to
the situation and we will certainly defend ourselves vigorously.''

STORAGENETWORKS IPO A SMASH HIT ON WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet IPOs can still be lucrative _ as long as the company is
one helping to support the Internet and not merely trying to sell
things on it.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of discriminating exuberance was in evidence Friday,
as investors fell over themselves buying debut shares of
StorageNetworks Inc., a Waltham, Mass. company that seeks to make
data storage as handy as electricity or phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Shares shot up from $27 to $97.25 in first-day trading on
Nasdaq, more than tripling the value of the $243 million initial
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said StorageNetworks' show-stealing performance was a
sign of Wall Street confidence in firms that focus on
infrastructure niches, such as data storage, in contrast to
dot-coms or the latest e-retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a great future, that whole segment of the market,''
said John Webster of Illuminata Group, industry analysts and
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say if you want to host a number of applications for
your customers, rather than go out and buy the storage you need,
you got to StorageNetworks and say, `Build the storage utility
here.' And whenever you want capacity, you get capacity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   StorageNetworks is creating a fiber-optic network that will
allow companies to store a virtually unlimited amount of data to
which they will have access over the Web, according to the
company's Securities and Exchange filing.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street got a hint of the strong response when the price
range on the deal, underwritten by Goldman, Sachs, was adjusted
from $17 to $19 a share to $23 to $25. The company has 88.2 million
shares outstanding after the IPO, giving it a market capitalization
of more than $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight week that Massachusetts-based
companies were standouts in an otherwise sagging IPO market. On
June 23, Charles River Laboratories of Wilmington and
Manufacturers' Services Ltd. of Concord traded 25 percent higher in
their New York Stock Exchange debuts.
</P>
<P>
   StorageNetworks shares could see a pullback after the initial
enthusiasm subsides. The company has competitors, and there is some
uncertainty about whether businesses will trust their data storage
to another company through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The successful IPO was notable for other reasons, however.
Earlier in the week, SEC documents revealed a nasty dispute with
EMC Corp. of Hopkinton, Mass., including the possibility of a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   EMC makes the actual gear for data storage with its disk-drive
assemblies for big computer databases; StorageNetworks buys that
equipment and makes the capacity available remotely. Several former
EMC managers are now at StorageNetworks, including chief executive
Peter Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Although the StorageNetworks-EMC relationship was thought to be
complimentary, EMC accused StorageNetworks of misrepresenting its
investment in the company, stealing away employees, and
misappropriating confidential EMC data.
</P>
<P>
   Two other events colored the IPO:
</P>
<P>
   Bell and the chief technology officer, William D. Miller, both
sold millions of dollars worth of their shares in the company in
January, something that executives are usually hesitant to do
because it could show a lack of confidence in the business going
public.
</P>
<P>
   And in its prospectus, StorageNetworks had to correct statements
made by Bell in news media interviews during the run-up to the IPO,
on such topics as the company's jump on competitors and the
cost-savings its services can provide.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, StorageNetworks pulled far away from five other
firms that also went public.
</P>
<P>
   EXFO Electro-Optical Engineering Inc., a Canadian company, was
second-best, as shares rose 18.75 to 44.75.
</P>
<P>
   The others _ Precise Software Ltd., an Israeli software firm;
Mobility Electronics Inc., a portable communications technology
firm; the Russian cellular phone company Mobile TeleSystems; and
the Chinese Internet portal Netease.com Inc. _ had only modest
gains or losses.

CIPOLLINI'S BACKUP AWAITS HIS FATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ The good news for Daniel Atienza's fans _
all three of them _ is that the 25-year-old Spaniard is still in
the Tour de France. The bad news is that his status is shaky
because the race has not started yet.
</P>
<P>
   Atienza, a hewer of wood and bearer of water for the Saeco team
from Italy, is part of the nine-man team only because Mario
Cipollini is not.
</P>
<P>
   Cipollini, 33, the star sprinter and team leader, hurt some ribs
in a crash during a training ride two weeks ago. At first he
announced that he would not ride in the Tour de France, in which he
won four consecutive daily stages last year. But lately he has been
wavering.
</P>
<P>
   With hours to go before the team rosters are official, Cipollini
is still out, so Atienza is still in. Will the Italian, a master of
theatrics, appear in Futuroscope at the last minute for Saturday's
opening time trial, clad in the Julius Caesar toga he favors for
special occasions and oust his doppelgaenger?
</P>
<P>
   That question may be somewhat less than burning, but it is as
big as they come in the torpid countdown for the 20 teams preparing
for Saturday's start of the three-week, 2,274-mile race in
Futuroscope.
</P>
<P>
   A better question might be why Futuroscope? The technology theme
park, a shrine to the pocket-protector set, is a favorite with the
Tour de France, and not only because its owners, the Amaury
publishing company, are also the main shareholder in Futuroscope.
That deal went through on March 28, but the bicycle race has been
coming here to western France since 1986, a year before the park
officially opened. It was a wasteland then, a condition not notably
improved by the addition of the Lake of Images and Cyber Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   This visit did not have to happen. Another candidate for the
start was Guadeloupe, a prospect that stirred the blood. But, in
place of gentle Caribbean breezes and beaches of soft volcanic
sand, there will be guided visits to the Gyrotour and Our Friend,
the Radio Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Futuroscope is more practical, the organizers insist, with an
abundance of hotels and parking lots _ and no need to fly 180
riders and their entourage halfway around the world. Including the
start in 1990, the Tour de France has visited the park five times
before this weekend. The race has never been to Guadeloupe.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, back to the Futuroscope it is.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the pre-race festivities, the riders were assembled
Friday for an address by race officials about their
responsibilities toward the public and the sport itself. That
translated basically into a warning about drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who will take the risk of playing with fire and ruining his
reputation?'' Jean-Marie Leblanc, the head of the organizers,
asked. He called for ``a serene atmosphere with no suspicion, a
return to the friendliness of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to the widespread news media speculation
about drugs that has plagued the Tour de France since the Festina
scandal two years ago. The Festina team was expelled then for
systematic use of illegal performance-enhancing substances, notably
EPO, and several teams quit to protest police searches.
</P>
<P>
   Leblanc congratulated the International Cycling Union, which
oversees the sport, for its decision last week to freeze selected
riders' urine samples and test them for EPO once a new French
examination for the artificial hormone has been officially approved
_ supposedly a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
   Riders, Leblanc pointed out, thus face being disqualified and
penalized long after the race ends in Paris on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tour de France is a monument of cycling,'' he said, ``and
we have a duty to protect it. In three weeks, when the Tour has
finished, let us hope that the race's reputation has been
completely restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Many riders have publicly welcomed the testing decision, as did
Lance Armstrong, the defending champion, at a news conference
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of the myth of widespread doping in cycling, and it
really is a myth,'' Armstrong said. ``This sport has been singled
out and it's doing everything it can.''

 &HT;    LEAVE INSPECTIONS TO INSPECTORS, COURT RULES
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Inspecting animals headed to slaughter must remain
the sole responsibility of federal meat and poultry inspectors and
not left to plant employees as the Department of Agriculture has
done in some chicken plants, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by a three-judge panel, in response to a lawsuit
brought by the meat inspectors' union, sarcastically dismissed the
USDA's contention that having federal inspectors oversee the work
of plant employees on the slaughter line was sufficient to meet the
legal definition of an inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, the government believes that federal employees
fulfill their statutory duty to inspect by watching others perform
the task,'' Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph wrote. ``One might as
well say that umpires are pitchers because they carefully watch
others throw baseballs.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said the agency
couldn't comment until its ``officials and lawyers have had a
chance to review the judges' findings.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is the latest blow to the Agriculture Department's
massive effort to modernize food inspection in America by
introducing bacteria testing while moving many inspectors into
oversight roles where they primarily track results of the tests.
Last year a judge in Dallas refused to let the USDA close a plant
that had failed those tests.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ruling dealt with the inspection of animals at
slaughter houses but could nonetheless have a broad impact on the
Agriculture Department's modernization efforts, according to
industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision means that it may be impossible to modernize the
inspection system without modernizing the statutes,'' said Caroline
Smith-DeWaal, who heads the food safety division of the Center for
Science in the Public Interest.
</P>
<P>
   Smith-DeWaal said the decision focuses heavily on provisions in
federal law dating back 90 years that require an animal-by-animal
inspection at slaughter houses by officials of the Agriculture
Department. In a pilot program set up in about 15 chicken plants,
the department left much of that work to plant employees while
inspectors took random samples of carcass to see if the employees
were catching diseased animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent federal employees are doing any systematic
inspecting under the (pilot program), they are inspecting people
not carcasses,'' Randolph wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The American Federation of Government Employees, the arm of the
AFL-CIO that represents meat and poultry inspectors and filed the
suit, delighted in the ruling and its tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's reflective of the skepticism that the court
brought, and rightfully so, to the argument the government made,''
said Anne M. Wagner, the union's assistant general counsel for
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner said meat and poultry inspectors favor the use of
bacteria testing but would like to see the tests used in
conjunction with traditional government inspections. Wagner said
that's what consumers expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now people believe when they buy meat that somebody has
actually looked at the carcass,'' she said. ``We don't really
accept the fundamental philosophy that (the modernized inspection
program) mandates the elimination of inspectors.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges sent the case back to the U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C. Wagner said she did not know how quickly the court
will enforce Friday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot program in slaughter houses was the subject of a Cox
Newspapers investigation earlier this year, which revealed that
high percentages of diseased chickens were getting through the new
inspection system at two Gold Kist, Inc. plants in Alabama. The
revelations triggered an investigation by the Agriculture
Department's office of the Inspector General, which confirmed many
of the findings of the Cox report but declared there to be no
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Tucker Foreman, who ran the food inspection operation
under President Carter, echoed the comments of Smith-DeWaal that
the latest ruling could require a rewrite of meat and poultry
inspection laws as part of the modernization effort.
</P>
<P>
   But Foreman, who now works with the Consumer Federation of
America, said she wasn't upset by Friday's ruling even though her
group has endorsed the pilot inspection program. She said she's
withholding judgment because results of the bacteria testing
haven't been made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say we've lost something important here because I just
don't know if that's the case,'' she said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURG, Texas _ Five years after the Clinton administration
and the Republican Congress began an enormous law enforcement
buildup along the Mexican border to fight the war on drugs and
illegal immigration, federal and state courts are buckling under
the strain of the resulting criminal caseload.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented numbers of new drug and immigration
indictments are inundating the five federal judicial districts
along the nearly 2,000-mile border that stretches from the mouth of
the Rio Grande in Texas to San Diego. Those five districts now
handle 26 percent of all federal criminal filings in the United
States. The other 74 percent of the filings are spread among the
country's remaining 89 district courts.
</P>
<P>
   Federal judges along the border are struggling with caseloads
double to quadruple the national average. Judges on senior status
who otherwise would have retired are hearing clogged dockets, while
visiting judges are being brought in from as far away as Vermont.
In border cities like Del Rio, Texas, and Las Cruces, N.M., the
caseload is nearly twice the national average, yet neither city has
a sitting federal district judge.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Friday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers
announced an emergency appropriation of $12 million to compensate
state district attorneys along the border who have seen their
dockets and their jails clogged by smaller drug cases handed off by
federal prosecutors. District attorneys in Texas, who represent
some of the poorest counties in the nation, had threatened to
refuse all federal drug cases as of July 1, unless the government
began reimbursing them for the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The clogged courts further illustrate the difficulty and
complexity of policing the Mexican border, which remains the
primary entry point for drugs and illegal immigrants into the
United States. The strategy of building up federal law enforcement
along the border has brought increases in drug seizures and in the
arrests of illegal aliens, but the flow of both is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994 the number of U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and
Naturalization Service personnel has nearly doubled. This
heightened presence has created a dramatic spike in criminal cases
along the border, from 6,460 in 1994 to 14,517 in 1998. But the
size of the court system has remained essentially the same;
judicial resources in the five border districts have increased by
only 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about the war on drugs,'' said U.S. Rep.
Silvestre Reyes, a Democrat representing El Paso who has pushed for
more resources. ``They want to put in additional border patrol
agents, INS agents and customs agents without giving any thought to
what happens to a case when it's generated.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the situation reflects a historical reluctance
by Congress to expand the judiciary, said Eric E. Sterling,
president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, a Washington
group that studies issues like drug policy. He said Congress has
traditionally been eager to finance drug enforcement efforts but
less enthusiastic about creating new judgeships because they are
powerful, politically appointed positions.
</P>
<P>
   And members of Congress have often complained of judges'
building opulent courthouses with taxpayer money, Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Congress seems to be taking notice of the problems on the
border. Last fall, Congress authorized three new judgeships in
Arizona, though the positions remain unfilled. In June, a
bipartisan group of border-state U.S. senators, including the
Republicans Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Kay Bailey Hutchison of
Texas and the Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California, introduced
legislation to authorize 13 more judgeships along the border. The
bill provides for eight permanent and five temporary positions, and
sponsors are trying to insert the measure in the regular
appropriations bill for the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone on both sides of the aisle acknowledges that this is
a crisis,'' Hutchison said. ``We've just got to have help.'' She
said courts are just one part of a growing crisis on the border,
where in recent weeks frustrated ranchers in Arizona have begun
rounding up illegal immigrants trespassing on their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has been too little, too late,'' the senator said.
``We've had a very difficult time getting control of what's
happened on the border.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Here in Hidalgo County in south Texas, where the Border Patrol
presence along the Rio Grande has increased dramatically, state and
federal courts are inundated. George P. Kazen, chief judge of the
Southern Judicial District of Texas, said the border town of Del
Rio has more than 1,000 criminal cases every year, but no sitting
district judge. Visiting judges from Louisiana have been called on
to reduce the caseload.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that there is no sense to having a huge influx of
law enforcement officers if you're not going to pay corresponding
attention to what you're going to do with offenders after you pick
them up,'' Kazen said.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of new cases has created friction between federal and
state prosecutors in Texas. Immigration cases fall solely under
federal law, but state prosecutors are handling more and more drug
arrests made by federal agents. Federal prosecutors usually
prosecute the larger seizures and refer smaller cases to state
courts. In south Texas, U.S. Attorney Mervyn Mosbacker said, his
office refers about 500 cases a year to state prosecutors, most of
them involving marijuana seizures of less than 60 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of prosecuting those cases provoked a rebellion by
district attorneys on the Texas border, who had threatened to stop
taking federal cases on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo County's district attorney, Rene A. Guerra, estimated
that such cases cost taxpayers in his county about $1 million
annually. His criminal caseload has risen from 2,233 indictments in
1995 to 3,246 last year. Jaime Esparza, the district attorney in El
Paso, says his office spends more than $2 million. And
increasingly, Esparza says, his office is handling offenders
arrested with more than 100 pounds of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Friday of the emergency $12 million, which is
expected to become law soon as part of a larger military
appropriations bill, put an end, for now, to the plans for the
boycott. But Esparza emphasized in an interview earlier this week
the burden placed on El Paso and other border areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect these border counties, which are some of the
poorest counties in the country, to continue to pay these costs,''
Esparza said. ``It's like double taxation. No other place in the
country has to shoulder these costs, and it's only because of our
proximity to the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the lack of jail and prison space. There are
no federal detention centers along the Southwest border, so federal
detainees are held in local jails. In vast west Texas, defendants
are often bused hundreds of miles to jails with space. In New
Mexico, Chief Judge John Edwards Conway said, the federal courts
pay local jails $18,000 a day for 300 beds. Overall, Judge Conway
said, the number of federal criminal defendants in New Mexico rose
from 800 in 1998 to 1,700 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most judges disputed any suggestion that the volume of cases
diminished the quality of justice meted out. But Carolyn King,
chief judge of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes
Texas, did express concern about the caseload. ``What you worry
about,'' she said, is defendants who get shorter sentences than
they deserve ``because the court simply has to move the case,'' she
said.

TERRA PARENT TO UNDERWRITE BERTELSMANN INVESTMENT IN LYCOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lycos Inc. isn't taking any chances with its new German content
provider, Bertelsmann AG.
</P>
<P>
   In its agreement to be bought by Terra Networks, the Waltham,
Mass. company has arranged for Terra's parent to make up most of
the difference if Bertelsmann doesn't come through with a promised
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, Bertelsmann and Spain's Terra Networks said in May the
German publishing giant would buy $1 billion worth of advertising
and services from a new company to be formed by the merger of Lycos
and Terra. Executives have described the revenue as a key
competitive advantage for the new company, Terra Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   But in a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission
this week, Terra Networks disclosed that its majority owner,
Telefonica SA, has agreed to pay for up to two-thirds of the total,
$675 million, ``if necessary,'' if Bertelsmann doesn't put up the
full amount over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann is only ``obliged'' to pay $325 million for ads and
other services during the first two years of the agreement, the
filing states.
</P>
<P>
   All sides say Bertelsmann hasn't reduced its commitment to buy
the full $1 billion worth of advertising and e-commerce services.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Lycos chief executive Bob Davis said he
insisted Telefonica back up Bertelsmann's role before he agreed to
the merger. Davis said he worried Bertelsmann could reduce its
commitments over the five-year course of the agreement. ``Five
years is a long time,'' Davis said. ``This is a little more
assurance.
</P>
<P>
   A Bertelsmann representative in New York said the details of the
agreement were consistent with the company's previous statements.
Terra declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann's participation in the agreement is seen as central
to the success of Terra Lycos because the German publishing giant
would supply the new company with content ranging from its Stern
magazine in Germany to its big stable of American authors, movie
studios and record labels.
</P>
<P>
   The material could help Terra Lycos attract viewers from the
likes of America Online Inc., which is buying Bertelsmann
competitor Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' deal with Terra was worth $12.5 billion when it was
announced May 16, but shares in Terra have slipped since then to
make the agreement worth around $10 billion, based on Terra's
closing price Friday of $36.469 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   A chief concern has been the role of Telefonica's controversial
chairman, Juan Villalonga, who has alienated many in Spain's
government and faces a reopened insider-trading inquiry by
regulators there. He and Telefonica deny wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga enjoys support from investors, however, and earlier
this week Telefonica's board of directors declined to act against
him. Lycos shareholders must still approve the merger, at a special
meeting expected in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Terra's filing also gave details about the company's financial
outlook and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the document, Terra had an operating loss of $86.3
million, last year on revenue of $47.7 million. Lycos had an
operating loss of $67 million on revenue of $138.5 million during
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Terra said, it expects its losses will continue ``for the
foreseeable future,'' and that expenses will exceed the combined
company's revenue for at least the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Lycos would have to pay Terra
Networks a termination fee of $347.6 million if its shareholders
don't approve the merger in most circumstances, chiefly if a rival
bidder emerges for Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Terra's filing also includes a section titled ``Risks Related to
Being Part of the Telefonica Group.'' Among other things, Terra
noted that other Telefonica companies ``could compete with us, and
they may pursue their own Internet-related bsuiness or operational
strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Telefonica's Argentine telecommunications unit also
runs a Internet portal targeting the same home users Terra Lycos
aims to attract, the filing said.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk is that Internet use in Latin America may grow more
slowly than expected. Terra said it received 73 percent of its
revenue from Latin operations. And Terra warned its free-Internet
access offerings in Spain, Brazil, Mexico and other countries could
prove costly.
</P>
<P>
   Terra also outlined new five-year employment agreements for
senior Lycos executives including Davis, who would be chief
executive of the new venture. He would get a base salary and bonus
of $500,000, plus a $5 million payment in case of severance. He
would also receive options to acquire 2 million Terra Lycos shares.

 &HT;    Gay Georgians look to Vermont for validation
 &HT;    By Jill Young Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The passionflower climbing a fence in their yard is in
bloom. The roses are a healthy pink. A waterfall spills into a
round, stone pool where lilies grow.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Deeb and Jerry Gonzalez built the garden, behind their home,
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of work on it,'' says Deeb, 35, a physician. ``It
doesn't just happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Deeb and Gonzalez, 29, a marketing engineer, tend their
relationship as carefully as their garden _ which is saying a lot,
considering the sweat they poured into a once swampy back yard with
dead trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we go to bed, we pray together, and we thank God for
what we have,'' Gonzalez says.
</P>
<P>
   And for what they're about to get: hitched, Vermont-style.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Saturday, gay men and lesbians who live in or visit
Vermont may enter into legal arrangements that are same-sex
marriages in almost everything but name. Such unions are something
new, unique in American history. Deeb and Gonzalez are planning
their trip for September, to mark the two-year anniversary of their
Georgia commitment ceremony, which has no legal standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important step forward for us as a family,'' says
Gonzalez, sitting on a beige love seat and holding hands with Deeb.
``We're doing everything we can to protect our family. That's what
it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   The men met four years ago at a country and western bar in
Atlanta. At first they were ``kind of like any other couple that's
infatuated,'' Deeb says. ``Then, when reality finally sets in, you
start talking about the difficult core issues of values. We talked
about religion and politics and honesty and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Their values matched. Two years ago in September, Deeb and
Gonzalez, wearing black tuxedos, stood before a minister at their
Decatur church and exchanged gold bands and vows of love in front
of about 100 family members and friends. Then they took a honeymoon
in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been married for two years,'' Gonzalez says. ``It's not
recognized by the state or the federal government, but it's
recognized before God and before our families and our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Photos from the ceremony and Hawaii decorate the walls of their
four-bedroom house. But the men won't officially be ``next of kin''
until their civil-union ceremony. Even that status will probably
apply only in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's law confers on same-sex couples the rights and
responsibilities enjoyed by married couples, from health insurance
benefits to inheritance rights. The federal government isn't
expected to recognize such unions for income tax calculations,
Social Security benefits, immigration rights or other matters. And
it's unclear whether Vermont civil unions will hold any sway in
Georgia or other states.
</P>
<P>
   But for Deeb and Gonzalez it's a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change takes time,'' Deeb says. But the couple isn't willing
to wait forever: They've spoken with lawyers and say they may one
day challenge Georgia's opposition to same-sex unions in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lead our lives like any other couple who goes to work every
morning,'' Deeb says. ``Take out our trash, take care of our yard
and everything else. But it becomes an issue when we don't have the
same legal rights and benefits that other legally married couples
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Gonzalez: ``Something as basic as hospital visitation
rights. If something were to happen to Ray, I wouldn't be able to
visit him because I'm not next of kin.... That's something pretty
ridiculous, that I wouldn't be able to see the most important
person in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and Deeb know one other couple from metro Atlanta going
to Vermont for a civil-union ceremony, two women from their church,
Christ Covenant Metropolitan Community Church. The women, who
declined to participate in this article, are going to Vermont this
month, and the men are eager to hear how it goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're picking a small town because they don't want any
publicity,'' Gonzalez says. ``We're doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Deeb: ``There are gay-friendly justices of the peace and
town clerks who don't have a problem with it. We'll probably find a
town where they will welcome us. We'll chose our town carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they'll come home and watch their garden grow.

 &HT;    INS STRUGGLES TO DEAL WITH A FLOOD OF IMMIGRANTS
 &HT;    910&AMP;add. With IMMIGRANTS-CITIZENS and IMMIGRANTS-DATA. For
release Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mexican-born Vianey Cano is the kind of
hard-working scholastic star who would make any parent proud. From
humble roots, she immigrated to Los Angeles nine years ago,
perfected English, earned a merit scholarship to college and
graduated last year from Occidental College with honors.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a migrant farm worker, Cano, 25, now has her
sights set on a master's degree, then a doctorate, with the aim of
becoming a college professor.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one hitch in this American success story. Despite
her efforts, Cano is not an American and not likely to become one
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Her life is on hold, just like more than 2 million applicants
for citizenship and legal residency caught in a bureaucratic
backlog of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).
</P>
<P>
   Cano is on a two-year waiting list for an interview for her
application to become a permanent legal resident. Once obtained, by
law it is another five-year wait to apply for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she is unable to continue her studies because student
aid is unavailable until she acquires her legal status. For Cano,
tuition in California would be assessed at an international student
rate, roughly $10,000 a year more than she would pay as a state
resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is a citizen, but I must wait 25 months before I can
be interviewed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of immigrants, America represents the promised
land. That is, if they can survive what one member of Congress has
dubbed ``the agency from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, the INS has been working to reduce a mountainous
backlog of applications from immigrants hoping to become
naturalized as American citizens, amid the biggest wave of
immigration to the United States since the unprecedented surge from
Europe between 1900 and 1920.
</P>
<P>
   On average, waiting times for naturalization cases have been
reduced from 28 months to 12 months, according to the INS. The
agency's goal is to pare the wait to six months by October. The INS
claims to have cut its record backlog of nearly 2 million
naturalization cases in 1998 down to about 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't solved its problems. Critics charge that by
diverting resources to draw down the naturalization case load, the
waiting times are increased for immigrants seeking legal permanent
residency, working papers and other status changes. Another backlog
is building, they warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are deep problems with the system and it needs to be
reorganized,'' said Judith Golub of the American Immigration
Lawyers Association. ``After all, what's more important to this
country than helping people become citizens, reuniting families and
helping American businesses who need workers get workers?''
</P>
<P>
   America's foreign-born population has climbed to a record 25.8
million, or about 9.7 percent of the country's total population,
with 9 million naturalized citizens and 16 million noncitizens.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the agency's total budget for enforcement and
immigrant services has tripled, with planned spending for 2001 to
total $4.8 billion. The INS has more than 29,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The INS readily acknowledges its shortcomings and asserts it has
made progress toward reducing the backlog.
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said the agency, which still
relies on paper files in this era of computerization, hopes
Congress will finance a three-year plan to automate the agency.
``The institutional machinery simply could not handle the pressure
of the workload,'' she said at a briefing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has opened a toll-free national customer service
center and built a national repository for files in Missouri to
increase its efficiency in handling cases. It is also stressing to
its workers the need to make the agency more responsive. ``That
cultural transformation is arguably the hardest to bring about,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet INS officials also say they are coping with factors beyond
their control, including economic forces that entice immigrants to
America and policy changes enacted by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an easy task. Managers in the field have had the
tough job of balancing all their resources,'' said INS spokeswoman
Elaine Komis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for many immigrants the worst part of the process is
simply not knowing where their applications stand.
</P>
<P>
   It a fit of outrage, New York immigration lawyer Ted Ruthizer
sent the INS a terse letter in April 1998 after the agency informed
him that it was ready to interview his client. The client could not
attend the naturalization interview, Ruthizer wrote back in a
poignant, single-sentence letter, ``as he died waiting for his
(interview) date to be scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   Such embarrassing examples prompted the INS to put in place a
two-year plan to eradicate the backlog, with the help of
supplemental spending from Congress and a huge hike in the cost of
applying for citizenship, from $95 to $225.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the agency say the INS has gained ground in
recent months simply because the large fee increase has resulted in
fewer applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason things have eased is that there are fewer
applications, particularly among low-income families,'' said Harry
Pachon, president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, a
California-based research group on Hispanic affairs. ``We're
pricing citizenship out of the reach of many immigrants, and that a
disturbing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the agency's management snafus continue.
</P>
<P>
   A government audit recently found that the INS lost files on
about 44,000 applicants in the Los Angeles area and 4,000 in the
Chicago area as it was computerizing its files in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many families are still waiting to hear if they will be
granted citizenship?'' asked Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Ill., who
prompted the Government Accounting Office to investigate the
missing cases. ``We cannot expect people to put their lives on hold
because the INS cannot keep track of their paperwork.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are sharp political differences on Capitol Hill over
how and whether to allow more immigrants into America, there is a
bipartisan bad opinion of the INS.
</P>
<P>
   At a congressional hearing in February, Rep. Lynn Woolsey,
D-Calif., called the INS ``the agency from hell'' in reference to
the case backlog.
</P>
<P>
   In withering comments in April, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas,
chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, suggested that
taxpayers should hire remedial math tutors for the INS after the
agency mistakenly allowed more high-tech workers into the United
States. ``It would cost less than hiring a big-name accounting firm
every time the agency must count past 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, joined the bandwagon last week, joining
others in proposing to split the INS into two agencies, one to
enforce immigration laws and the other to provide services to
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS is everyone's favorite punching bag. It has a
difficult job, but it continues to disappoint. It is everybody's
concern,'' said Larry Gonzalez, Washington director of the National
Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. ``When
people out there in the community hear there are attempts on
Capitol Hill to restructure the INS, they say: 'Here's the match.
Where can I light the bomb?' ``
</P>
<P>
   For Cano, the California scholar awaiting her INS interview, it
is a nervous time. Her now-retired father, who came to America in
1978 to pick crops in Georgia, Texas, Florida and California before
landing a factory job in Los Angeles, became a naturalized citizen
last year. But his health is failing and he needs a liver
transplant. Should he die before her scheduled interview, it could
ruin her chances to become a citizen. By law, he must be physically
present at the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the INS's job is not likely to get easier anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   America's high-tech industry continues to clamor for approval to
bring in thousands more tech workers from abroad on temporary visas
to fill skilled jobs that Americans cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Census Bureau predicts a growing need for immigrants to
fill the U.S. work force as baby boomers reach retirement age. The
most pressing need will occur between 2020 and 2030, according to a
recent study, which could return immigration levels to the highs of
the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The projections are not lost on the INS, which offers no
guarantees of future performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've hit the peak and we're coming down in the
number of applications,'' said Komis, the INS spokeswoman. ``It is
such an iffy thing, because our workload depends on so many policy
issues and so much of what's going on in our country. We're making
progress now, but it is difficult to predict. Who knows when the
next avalanche might come?''

 &HT;    FEWER IMMIGRANTS ARE BECOMING CITIZENS
 &HT;    With IMMIGRANTS and IMMIGRANTS-DATA. For release Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America has more immigrants, but fewer are becoming
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Only about one-third of the nation's immigrants have obtained
citizenship, the smallest proportion in the past century. The
phenomenon was detailed in a U.S. Census Bureau report released
late last year that sparked a debate over the reasons for the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, only 35 percent of foreign-born people in the United
States were naturalized citizens, compared to 64 percent in 1970.
During the major wave of immigration in the early 20th century,
about half of all immigrants became citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Immigration and Naturalization Service say the
decline was caused by policy changes that made it more difficult
and more expensive to become a citizen. The huge backlog of
naturalization cases also has discouraged many immigrants from
applying, said Harry Pachon, president of the Tomas(cq) Riviera
Policy Institute, a research group on Hispanic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Other social analysts question whether the numbers indicate an
growing unwillingness among immigrants to assimilate to life in
America.
</P>
<P>
   The large proportion of immigrants from Mexico _ 28 percent of
the foreign-born population in the United States _ could have much
to do with the decline. In 1990, about 22 percent of the
Mexican-born population had become naturalized citizens. By 1997,
the number had fallen to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many immigrants from nearby Mexico may be less willing to seek
U.S. citizenship than those from Europe and Asia. Immigrants from
Asia increased their citizenship rate from 40 to 44 percent between
1990 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   People with higher levels of education also are more likely to
seek citizenship than those who have not completed high school, the
report said.

ALFRED ULMER, 83, OFFICER IN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Fla.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfred C. Ulmer Jr., a former official of the Office of
Strategic Services and the CIA, died on June 22 in Virginia Beach,
Va. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Ulmer did intelligence work in the Navy in World War II and then
joined the OSS. He served in Turkey, Egypt, Italy and Austria,
overseeing intelligence operatives who were gathering information
about the German military in North Africa and the Balkans, his
family said.
</P>
<P>
   The service was disbanded by President Truman late in 1945, and
Ulmer joined the CIA not long after it was founded in 1947. He
retired in 1962 and received the agency's Intelligence Medal of
Merit.
</P>
<P>
   In his CIA years, he was stationed in Madrid, Athens, Paris and
Washington. He ran the agency's Far East operations from 1955 to
1958.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, we had fun,'' he said in a 1994 interview. ``We went all
over the world and we did what we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Powers wrote in his book ``The Man Who Kept the Secrets:
Richard Helms and the CIA'' (1979) that in 1956 Frank Wisner, a
senior CIA executive, told Ulmer, ``It's time we held Sukarno's
feet to the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Sukarno was Indonesia's leader. Powers wrote that
the director of central intelligence, Allen Dulles, and his
brother, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, ``did not want to
overthrow Sukarno exactly, just force him to suppress the PKI'' _
Indonesia's large Communist Party _ ``send the Russians packing and
get on the American team.''
</P>
<P>
   So the agency aided anti-Sukarno rebels, but they were
confronted successfully by Sukarno's forces and, Powers wrote,
Allen Dulles decided that the rebels must be told that the United
States had to disengage. ``The result,'' Powers said, ``was a
humiliation for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In a major covert operation in Japan, the agency spent millions
of dollars in the 1950s and '60s to support the conservative party
that dominated the country's politics for a generation, the Liberal
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Ulmer was born in Jacksonville, Fla., and graduated from
Princeton in 1939. After the CIA, he worked in the financial world.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Doris Gibson Bridges ended in divorce. He is
survived by a son, Nicholas, of Geneva; a daughter, Marguerite
Ulmer Power, of Virginia Beach; five grandchildren; a brother; and
two sisters.

OLD BARNUM MUSEUM IS REBORN ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a combination zoo, museum, lecture hall, wax
museum, theater and freak show, a Museum of Un-Natural History
that, according to one historian, was ``a central site in the
development of American popular culture.'' It burned in July 1865,
was rebuilt a few blocks away, and burned again in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, P.T. Barnum's American Museum opened once again, on
the World Wide Web, a medium perhaps well suited to the
circus-meister's fantabulous claims.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars and producers at the Center for Media and Learning and
the New Media Lab, both part of the City University of New York
Graduate Center, have rebuilt the five-story museum in virtual
space on a Web site. The Web address is
http://web.gc.cuny.edu/ashp/lostmuseum.
</P>
<P>
   Supported in part by a grant from the National Endowment for the
Humanities, the site will provide students and history buffs with a
full archive of information about the museum and relevant
19th-century subjects. It will eventually include a variety of
investigative paths to take through the five-story building, for
those wanting to play detective and figure out who set it on fire
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Barnum, who believed that every crowd had a silver lining and
that a sucker was born every minute, reveled in the museum's claim
of being the most visited spot in America. He reported that the
museum, which was open 15 hours a day, six days a week) often had
up to 15,000 visitors a day (that would be more than 16 suckers per
minute), though an accurate guest count might have been beyond his
capacities.
</P>
<P>
   Signs in the museum, which was at Broadway and Ann Street,
reportedly pointed enthusiastically toward a magnificent,
not-to-be-missed attraction, ``The Egress,'' which was actually an
unmarked exit. Those rushing to see said egress would find
themselves outside, needing to pay another 25-cent admission fee.
</P>
<P>
   Those two bits bought visitors the chance to see Tom Thumb, the
midget; Anna Swan, the giantess from Nova Scotia, whom Barnum
dressed in 100 yards of satin and 50 yards of lace; the Fejee
Mermaid (supposedly a mummified maiden, but actually the desiccated
head of a monkey and the body of an orangutan, attached to the back
of a fish); and the wax museum figure of Jefferson Davis, the
Confederate president, wearing a woman's dress, in accordance with
rumors that he tried to escape from Union forces in drag.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of the original attractions were saved from the
fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``A red-shined fireman seized with either hand Franklin Pierce
and James Buchanan by their coat-collars, tucked the Prince
Imperial of France under one arm and the Veiled Murderess under the
other, and coolly departed for the street,'' according to an
article in The New York Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some one had stuck a cigar in General Washington's mouth, and
thus, with his chapeau crushed down over his eyes and his head
leaning upon the ample lap of Moll Pitcher, the Father of his
Country led the van of as sorry a band of patriots as not often
comes within one's experience to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of the exhibits, however, left behind only
their legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot to work with,'' said Joshua Brown, director
for the Center for Media and Learning/American Social History
Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of guessing,'' he said. ``Part of the problem is
it's Barnum, so a lot of it is humbug.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Peter Buckley, an associate professor of history at Cooper Union
and a Barnum scholar, worked as an independent reviewer of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at the little things that they've had to do to
reconstruct it,'' he said of the online museum. ``They had to try
and get the right texture for the floorboards and walls, so they
had to go down to an old building in the South Street Seaport and
take photos of old pine boards, hoping that was close to the
original texture, and then mapping those textures throughout the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet surfers can see a film about Barnum, visit the main
salon in the museum, zoom in on pictures on the walls, open exhibit
drawers to read archival documents, and read contemporary accounts
of the fire and of Davis' escapades.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Brier, a co-director of the New Media Lab, said, ``It's
a way of imagining the past, and we practice it in an
unconventional way, so instead of writing monographs, we produce
films and CD-ROMs, and now we're working on the re-creation of a
space that no longer exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Ades Vasquez, the lab's managing director, said, ``We'd
like it to be a model, for solving different mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Internet, which provides free admission to a
wide variety of curiosities of varying authenticity, is an apt home
for Barnum. In any case, he provides a fine lens on the era in
which he lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe what's uniquely American about Barnum was this effort _
he called it democratic, but it might be something else _ to bring
everybody together, regardless of class background,'' Buckley of
Cooper Union said. ``It was the whole period of the 1840s when I
believe it's possible to say that a distinct American popular
culture was developed, and the museum is central, and Barnum is
central, to that development.''

COURT RULING SEEN AS WEAKENING RAPE VICTIMS' PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a decision women's activists say will cause rape
victims to choose between privacy and prosecution, the state's
highest court has held a rape crisis center in contempt for
refusing to turn over telephone hotline records sought by lawyers
for an accused rapist.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court's 20-page ruling represented an
unusual splintering of opinion, with two of the high court's three
females members, Chief Justice Margaret Marshall and Associate
Justice Ruth Abrams, dissenting and Justice Judith Cowin writing
the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-2 ruling against the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center,
which faces civil fines as a result of the decision, the high court
acknowledged that ``there is no longer a need for the records to be
produced'' because the defendant pleaded guilty to assault charges,
closing the case against him.
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion, however, Cowin says that the communications
between the counselor and the victim should have been made
available for possible release to the defense because there was
some question whether the counselor convinced the victim she was
raped.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the information confidential would have denied the
defendant ``a right to learn whether the young woman's
conversations with the counselor are consistent with her
accusations against him,'' Cowin writes.
</P>
<P>
   But Abrams warns that the majority opinion overrules an earlier
SJC decision that set up strict standards governing the release of
records from rape crisis centers. She cautions that the opinion
will result in virtually ``automatic'' review of some privilege
material by judges.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams argues that the victim's contacting a rape counselor
before reporting the incident to police ``should not provide the
reason for being forced to disclose her privileged communications
with a counsellor she turns to for advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and victim's advocates sided with Abrams saying the
ruling will make it easier for confidential rape counseling records
to be obtained, while defense attorneys contend there are already
strict rules in place to protect the privacy of rape victims.
</P>
<P>
   Boston lawyer Wendy Murphy, who represents the rape crisis
center, called the decision ``extremely disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends the message that if you become a crime victim, you
have to choose between prosecution and privacy, between justice and
healing,'' said Murphy, who is considering a federal appeal. ``That
is not a fair choice. It's an outrageous choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Geoffrey Packard, president of the Massachusetts Association
of Criminal Defense Lawyers and a senior trial counsel for the
Committee for Public Counsel Services, called Murphy's argument
``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense lawyers have to go through a very difficult process in
order to look at these records,'' he said. ``The bar is set very
high, and judges aren't just turning them over willy nilly.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the SJC has established stringent rules for gaining
access to rape counseling records, including proof from the
defendant that there is a specific and legitimate need. Even then,
the records must be turned over to a judge who reviews them in
private before deciding what, if anything, may be released.
</P>
<P>
   The high court created those rules after overturning a 1985
state law that cloaked rape counseling records in the same level of
confidentiality reserved for priests and penitents, saying that an
absolute bar to the release of such records was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Craig Neumyer, the Lynn man accused of the rape, had
argued that the alleged victim's counseling records contained
evidence crucial to his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Packard and other defense attorneys also said they believe the
decision is limited in scope, and is unlikely to have far-reaching
impact.
</P>
<P>
   They also noted that the SJC in 1996 vacated contempt charges
against the director of a Worcester rape crisis center who was
ordered jailed after she refused to release counseling records of a
client, suggesting that Neumyer's lawyers had more valid reasons to
seek the counseling records.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling preserves a defendant's ability, in narrowly
limited circumstances, to have access to information that bears
meaningfully upon his guilt or innocence,'' said William Leahy,
executive director of the Committee for Public Counsel Services,
who represented Neumyer.
</P>
<P>
   But John Zanini, a prosecutor with the Suffolk District
Attorney's office, which submitted an amicus brief advocating that
the records remain confidential, said the high court's ruling
``tilts the balance in favor of defendants rather than victims like
this girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Neumyer was charged with raping the 18-year-old victim after
they drank and smoked marijuana together for several hours in 1996.
The woman contacted the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center the next
day, saying she was uncertain whether what had happened to her was
rape. A counselor told her that it was rape and the victim
contacted police, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in what the center's attorneys say was a violation of her
privacy rights, the victim disclosed her contact with the center
during a probable cause hearing, opening the door for Neumyer's
attorneys to ask for the records.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Cowin in the majority were Justices Neil Lynch, John
Greaney, Roderick Ireland, and Francis Spina.

flat fees for the two-week loans disguised annual rates as high as
250 percent. Plaintiffs' lawyers filed a host of class action
lawsuits. Block is on the verge of resolving the litigation this
month without admitting any wrongdoing. But critics of the proposed

 &HT;    Small gains close dismal quarter
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stock market ended its worst quarter in two years
on Friday with broad but anemic gains as investors concentrated
mostly on the sector that suffered the biggest setback in the past
three months _ technology.
</P>
<P>
   All the major stock market indexes posted losses in the
April-June period, but the technology-loaded Nasdaq composite
experienced the biggest drop in 10 years, falling just over 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three of every four stocks in the Nasdaq 100 _ an index
of the 100 largest and most active Nasdaq stocks _ suffered losses
vs. 43 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Among the losers were some of the best-known technology stocks,
including Novell, down 68 percent; Qualcomm, 61 percent; Compuware,
51 percent; and Amazon.com, 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That was a far cry from the beginning of the year, when demand
for Internet and so-called dot-com stocks prompted some analysts to
talk of a new era for the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite, which didn't close above 4,000 until Dec.
29, surged another 1,000 points in the next two months to a closing
peak of 5,048.62 on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Then a combination of events, including extreme caution by many
analysts, a setback in the biotech sector and unexpected profit
weakness in some high-profile companies, triggered a sell-off that
eventually sent the Nasdaq tumbling 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The index has rallied since its May 23 low, but its decline in
the second quarter was its worst slump since the 1990 bear market,
when the index fell more than 25 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for investors is that the biggest losses occurred
early in the latest period, prompting many analysts to believe the
worst of the stock market's correction that started in the spring
is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is expected to be more volatility, but the technical
structure now in place suggests that the low has been seen and that
the stage is set for an eventual move higher,'' said Prudential
Securities technical analyst Ralph Acampora.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday not to raise
interest rates was viewed by investors as a reason for optimism,
tempered however by the Fed's suggestion that further rate hikes
are likely since inflation is still a threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates six times since June 1999 to cool what
it regards as an inflationary economy.
</P>
<P>
   With the next Fed meeting not until Aug. 22, investors will turn
their attention to second-quarter earnings reports in July,
according to Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst David Kim.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near term, the market will also focus on the June
employment report, still a week away, and the June producer and
consumer price data in a little over two weeks,' said Kim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both reports have the potential for major bearish surprises,
especially with the Fed's focus on labor market conditions, and the
recent oil run-up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's trading, the Nasdaq composite was the market leader,
rising all day to close at 3,966.11 with a gain of 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indexes would have posted losses except for late buying
that produced narrow gains: 0.5 percent for the Dow Jones
industrial average, to 10,447.89, and 0.9 percent for the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500, to 1,454.60.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date, the Dow is the biggest loser, falling just over 9
percent, with the S&AMP;P-500 dropping 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Nasdaq composite's 37 percent plunge at the worst
point of its second-quarter sell-off, that index finished the first
half down only 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The second quarter was the worst period for the stock market
since the July-October stretch in 1998, when Asian currency
problems and a Russian debt default sent investors searching for
safe havens in bonds and blue chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The losses by the Nasdaq, the Dow and S&AMP;P 500 since the end of
1999 make the first six months of 2000 the worst half-year period
for the broad market since 1994. That was the last time the Federal
Reserve raised interest rates multiple times, also in an effort to
combat inflation.

MARKET INSIGHT: BYRON WIEN OF MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time flies when you're having fun. Zip-zap, and suddenly the
year is halfway over. Trouble is, for most investors the last six
months have not been a lot of laughs. All three major market
indexes are under water for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that happened was in 1994, according to Birinyi &AMP;
Associates, a stock market research firm. The midyear tally stands
in sharp relief to the first six months of 1999, when the Dow Jones
industrial average was up nearly 20 percent, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 was up almost 12 percent and the Nasdaq gained 22.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that's old news. The issue now is what happens from here to
New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Byron R. Wien, chief U.S. investment strategist for Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, took some time last week to revisit the recent
past and to talk about the next six months. Following are excerpts
from the conversation: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did the market pan out in the first half as you thought it
might?  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. From the beginning of the year, I thought the market was
going to have a rough time of it. The first six months haven't been
as rough as I thought they would be, but it has been a difficult
market. This is the first year in the last six that it has had a
difficult time.
</P>
<P>
   I also thought that people would begin to take a tougher look at
technology stocks. And I anticipated that the price of oil would go
up to $30 a barrel and stay there. I thought that would benefit
energy and oil and service stocks, and it has, but not as much as I
thought. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some people think the Fed is about done tightening, and that
the market is poised to do better when it stops. Do you agree? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it is naive to think the economy will slow down
enough for the Fed to indicate publicly that they are done.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed might move to a neutral policy position. The economy is
clearly slowing as it responds to a deceleration in money supply
growth, and that will take some near-term pressure off interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think a recession is anywhere in sight, but I do think
we are going to have slower growth and a deceleration in profit
growth. But inflation is going up. So I don't think the Fed will
tell investors to relax. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does that mean the market will remain under pressure for the
balance of the year?  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Since the market's performance in the first half was a bit
better than I had anticipated, it means the second half will be a
little worse than I had hoped. By the end of the year, I expect the
major averages will be within 10 percentage points of where they
finished in 1999. Basically, this is not going to be a big
money-making year.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you expect more market volatility? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know if conditions will be as volatile as they were,
but I expect volatility to stay high.
</P>
<P>
   The volatility we have seen is not due to the Fed, which is
doing what is expected. It has to do with the fact that people are
trying too hard. They are used to making a lot of money in the
stock market, and they are impatient. They tend to migrate to where
the action is, which is what creates the volatility. But there will
not be a lot of discernible trends over the next six months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has the correction we have seen in technology stocks made
them attractive buys?  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I own a lot of technology stocks, and I like a lot of
technology stocks, but it is hard for me to say there are a lot of
outstanding values here. Even the technology stocks I bought
recently, JDS Uniphase and Brocad, are not cheap. Intel, another
favorite of mine, is not cheap. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there stocks you think should do well over the next six
months or more? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I still think energy stocks will do well. I think there are
some opportunities in old-economy stocks, including financials.
Biotechnology and health care companies intrigue me. Hospital
management companies are undervalued, even though they have come
back a bit.
</P>
<P>
   As far as individual names are concerned, in hospital management
I like Columbia/HCA (HCA _ the Healthcare Co.), Tenet Health Care
and Health Management Associates. Immunex is a biotech company I
like. And in energy I like Tosc, Exxon Mobil and BP Amoco. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will the results of the November election matter to the stock
market? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The only way the election could have an impact is if the same
party wins control of both the White House and Congress. If that
happens it would be bad. The status quo has been fine for financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   It would be bad because if Gore wins and the Democrats take the
House, his spending programs will be negative for the market. And
if Bush wins and the Republicans keep control in Congress, his tax
program will go through. But it will be too stimulative and result
in additional tightening.

 &HT;    SBC gets to go the distance, FCC says
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ SBC Communications, the largest of the remaining
regional Bell companies, has become the second Bell to win the
right to offer long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission announced Friday that it
has voted to permit the San Antonio-based Bell to offer
long-distance service in Texas, about seven months after giving
similar approval to Bell Atlantic in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The decision helps set the ground rules that Atlanta-based
BellSouth and Denver-based U.S. West will have to meet to also
enter the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Edward E. Whitacre Jr., SBC chairman and chief executive
officer, shrugged off the current price war in long-distance and
touted the FCC decision as key to a future in which customers look
to one company for all their communications services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-distance rounds out our full-service bundles and is key
to capitalizing on our company's single biggest growth opportunity
and new core business _ data,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's approval is effective July 10. SBC said Friday it will
launch service that day under the name of its corporate forebear,
Southwestern Bell.
</P>
<P>
   When the seven ``Baby Bells'' were created in the 1984 breakup
of AT&AMP;T, each was forbidden from offering long-distance service on
its home turf. But the Telecommunications Act of 1996 permitted
entry for any Bell that could persuade regulators that its own
local market was open to competition.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth had for a time hoped to be the first Bell into
long-distance, only to be repeatedly stymied. BellSouth did win
state approval in South Carolina and Louisiana, only to be rejected
by the FCC. But in its home state of Georgia, the company's efforts
have been beset by complaints of rivals and concerns of the Public
Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said BellSouth systems could not handle the large shifts
of customers to new carriers that will likely follow approval. For
nearly a year, those systems have been undergoing tests monitored
by consultants at KPMG.
</P>
<P>
   The PSC will start looking at the KPMG tests Wednesday to see if
this time the company has made the grade _ especially in the light
of Friday's FCC decision. If BellSouth passes the KPMG tests, it
would ask the PSC to endorse long-distance approval in Georgia, and
an application to the FCC would follow that.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Vice Chairman Jere Drummond congratulated SBC and FCC
Chairman William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   ``(They) deserve praise for bringing a meaningful choice for
long-distance service to Texas consumers. In
</P>
<P>
   August, BellSouth plans to seek approval to offer consumers a
true choice for long-distance service in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC's application applies only to Texas, but the systems
involved are used through its region, so other approvals are
expected to follow. BellSouth on Friday saw its stock drop $1.56 a
share to $42.63.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's on Friday lowered its long-term ratings on
BellSouth, a move spurred by December's news that BellSouth would
provide up to $8 billion to help fund acquisitions by Dutch-based
KPN Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's also affirmed its short-term ratings on
BellSouth Capital Funding Corp. and BellSouth Telecommunications
Inc.

 (ATTN: Ohio, Mich., Britain)   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By RUTH LA FERLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sight of the couple draped across the bed engaged
in cozy pillow talk was more than a little disconcerting. Stumbling
on the scene, one wasn't sure whether to eavesdrop, look the other
way or join the lovebirds on the sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing as it was, this slice of life was in fact a
performance, enacted by models and staged at a party last Wednesday
night at the Apartment, a strenuously hip fashion and home
furnishings store masquerading as a private residence.
</P>
<P>
   A 3,000-square-foot duplex at 101 Crosby St., where SoHo meets
NoLIta, the Apartment is a showcase for furniture, cooking
equipment and bathroom units by European design specialists like
Boffi and Duravit. But it's also a site for vanguard fashions and
accessories by the British label Not Tom Dick and Harry, and the
French design team Marithe &AMP; Francois Girbaud.
</P>
<P>
   The store, which feels like an animated version of Wallpaper,
the British shelter magazine, represents the latest variation on
retailing as theater, one in which the shop is a stage, the
products props and the shopper both performer and spectator.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of themed, interactive retailing was pioneered in
the '90s when innovative retail operations like Niketown started
staging multimedia happenings, and Recreational Equipment Inc., or
REI, in Seattle, offered a trail loop for bicycle test drives and a
``rain room'' to try out Gore-Tex slickers.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the Apartment, Stefan Boublil and Gina Alvarez,
who are married to each other, took the idea of consumer
participation and refined it into an art form. Every item in the
store, from the Phillipe Starck notepads on the desks and the
Girbaud suede slippers at the foot of the bed to the bed itself, a
walnut platform priced at $5,900, will be for sale July 1, when the
store opens to the public.
</P>
<P>
   At the preview party, visitors were encouraged to try things out
on the spot, including the Boffi shower.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the wares seemed incidental, playing a supporting role
to the action unfolding throughout the store. In the bathroom, some
people removed their shoes, massaging their soles on the pebbled
floor. In the kitchen, a chef from Le Gamin, a cafe in SoHo,
flipped crepes in a pan. Across the room, a pair of actors staged
an all-out brawl, hurling invective, along with papers and objects,
to lend the evening, one supposed, a touch of gritty naturalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea,'' said Boublil, a Parisian who also maintains a
career as an independent filmmaker, ``was to introduce the idea of
voyeurism right from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apartment has a Web site where with a click of the mouse one
can rearrange furniture on a small floor plan or look in on Chloe
and Rebekka, fictional residents. But Boublil and Alvarez
envisioned the store less as a partner of an Internet site and more
as a variation on so-called reality entertainment. It was modeled,
they said, on popular television shows like ``Cops'' and ``The Real
World,'' whose protagonists are ordinary people living their lives
in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   With its interactive, imitation-of-life approach to retailing,
the store recalls _ and improves on _ the static model rooms of the
1970s created by Bloomingdale's and other stores to help customers
envision products in a context. But in some ways the Apartment has
more in common with theme parks and restaurants in exploiting
consumers' fascination with simulated reality. Sniffing, tasting
and touching the wares, chatting with staff and other customers,
the shopper becomes an actor.
</P>
<P>
   When you walk into such a store, ``you take on a role in front
of other individuals who are now watching you,'' said B. Joseph
Pine II, the co-author with James H. Gilmore of ``The Experience
Economy'' (Harvard Business School Press, 1999). The book,
subtitled ``Work Is Theater &AMP; Every Business a Stage,'' argues that
in the future consumers will likely place greater value on the
experience of shopping than on goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating an experience, by encouraging customers to act out
their fantasies in a store, much as they would at a Renaissance
fair, draws the customer right in,'' Pine said.
</P>
<P>
   Some designers and merchants view the Apartment as altogether
novel. But Lee Peterson, the creative director of retail strategies
at Chute Gerdeman, a Columbus, Ohio, retail design company,
explored the notion of store as stage a year ago, before Boublil
and Alvarez dreamed up the Apartment.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Wolverine World Wide, the maker of Hush Puppies and
other footwear brands, asked for a fresh concept for UP Footgear,
its new mall-based stores. Chute Gerdeman responded with a Web
concept called ``I See Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Peterson explained, is that you can watch yourself
walk into the door of the store on the computer screen. ``What's
more,'' he said, ``you can call up your friends, they can open the
Web site at home, and there you'll be.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is evidently aimed at a generation for whom nothing
is real until it is on television. The store's design serves to
heighten the sense of reality. UP Footgear's prototype, at the new
RiverTown Crossing mall in Grandville, Mich., is a loft-like
setting complete with sofas, chairs, framed photos and a breakfast
bar, a place that the cast of ``Friends'' or ``Real People'' might
call home. ``This setting goes beyond conventional lifestyle
retailing,'' Peterson said. ``It perfects the illusion that you are
already living the life.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiment seems to be working. Blaine Jungers, the
president of Hush Puppies' retail division, said, ``At the
Grandville mall, UP Footgear, one of eight shoe stores, ranks third
in sales, just behind value-oriented retailers like Payless.''
</P>
<P>
   The store, he noted, ``encourages people to congregate.'' At a
second store, scheduled to open July 22 in Grand Rapids, the
checkout area will be in the kitchen. ``That's where people
gravitate at parties,'' he said. ``We want them to hang out, just
the way they would at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Boublil and Alvarez would like customers to feel just as comfy
at the Apartment. ``We want this to be a meeting place
absolutely,'' Boublil said, ``where people lose track of the world
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Apartment party, people did just that. One couple
became so absorbed in checking out the merchandise, watching other
guests and being watched themselves, they seemed to forget they had
left a stroller parked outside just beyond the plate-glass window.
In it, their twins slumbered peacefully, attended by a security
guard.
</P>
<P>
   So inclined were guests to dream and loiter, one wondered how
the store might shoo them out. ``We're working on a strategy for
that,'' Boublil said. Until they have perfected it, the owners say
they'll fall back on a time-honored ploy for disposing of guests.
``I'll just tell them,'' Alvarez said brightly, ``that I'm going to
take a shower.''

ARMSTRONG, HAMILTON SIT ATOP US POSTAL TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no question that Lance Armstrong, last year's winner of
the Tour de France, is the designated leader of the American-based
US Postal Service team.
</P>
<P>
   There's also little question about the identity of his strongest
teammate: Marblehead, Mass. native Tyler Hamilton, who will be
riding in his fourth Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's win last month at the Dauphine Libere stage race in
southwestern France proved that. Armstrong finished third, 36
seconds behind. The winner credited Armstrong for helping him get
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Lance, I never would have won, because with him, I was
able to stay in control,'' said Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was leading the race, but halfway through one stage,
Hamilton got word on his radio headset from team director Johann
Bruyneel that Armstrong was feeling ``a little subpar and I was
given the green light.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was only fair, since Hamilton aided Armstrong in his Tour
win last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's Tour, Hamilton and a dozen other riders were set
back six minutes after crashing during the second stage. But
despite another crash a week later, Hamilton stayed with the
leaders and finished in 13th place. He placed fifth and third in
the time trials.
</P>
<P>
   It was his third Tour, and ``definitely opened my eyes to my
potental,'' said Hamilton, 29.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hamilton said there's no doubt whom the entire team will
work for in the Tour, which starts Saturday and finishes in Paris
July 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus this year is on Lance and on getting him to Paris in
the yellow jersey,'' said Hamilton, adding that the victory by the
American was a surprise to both participants and spectators in the
European-dominated race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we were the underdogs and this year we're the
favorites,'' he said. ``I think we proved a point last year.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be three other Americans riding on the nine-man team:
Frankie Andreu, Kevin Livingston, and George Hincapie. Christian
Vande-Velde, of Boulder, Colo., was slated to ride his second Tour,
but dropped out after suffering a spider bite and possible
infection last week and has been replaced by Denmark's Steffen
Kjaergaard.
</P>
<P>
   Four other Americans will be competing, two each for Credit
Agricole and Italy's Mapei.
</P>
<P>
   Although Armstrong, 28, is the favorite, based on his win last
year and his strong spring, nothing is assured in the 23-day,
2,254-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   The 180 riders will cover seven mountain stages in the Pyrenees
and the Alps, with just one day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Armstrong, riders that bear watching include two
former winners wo missed last year's Tour: Germany's Jan Ullrich
(1997) and Italy's Marco Pantani (1998). Also keep an eye on
Switzerland's Alex Zulle, who has twice finished second, and
France's Laurent Jalabert and his teammate, Spaniard Abraham Olano,
who have both finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Then there France's Richard Virenque, who was expelled from the
Tour in 1998 for doping charges and grudgingly accepted into last
year's race.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of drugs were still prevalent last summer. Some of the
French press dubbed Armstrong ``Superman'' and doubted that he
could ride so well after a bout with cancer without the help of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was on the US Olympic teams in 1992 and 1996, but in
October 1996 contracted testicular cancer, which spread to his
lungs and brain.
</P>
<P>
   He resents the criticism and said at a press conference this
week that he welcomes moves to stamp out illegal drug-taking and
that cycling has been unfairly targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of this myth of widespread doping in cycling,''
Armstrong said. ``Because that's just what it is: a myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was world champion in 1993 and proved from the start of my
career that I was one of the best. So why the detractors? Why the
surprise? At some point it's just got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Cycling Union ruled last week that urine
samples from race participants would be frozen and tested for the
banned substance EPO, when a method of detection has been
perfected.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said his win last year has raised his standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've won the Tour once, you can't come back and say
honestly that you hope to finish in the top five,'' he said. ``I'm
going back to the Tour to win it, and if I don't, it will be a big
disappointment.''

ELATED BY ANTITRUST TRIUMPH, DOCTORS TAKE CASE TO SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Miss., Texas, Mich., La.)   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elated by a big victory in the House, doctors
opened a campaign Friday to persuade the Senate to give them an
exemption from antitrust laws so they could bargain collectively
with insurance companies over fees and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he would
stand in their way.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a bill to exempt doctors from major provisions
of the antitrust laws early Friday. The final vote, at 2 a.m., was
276-136, with a two-thirds majority heeding the doctors' pleas for
relief.
</P>
<P>
   The chief sponsor of the bill, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., and
his allies at the American Medical Association said the lopsided
vote in the House would give them momentum in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott expressed opposition to the bill, saying: ``I don't
think we need more lawsuits in America. And I don't think we need
more, you know, labor unions in America. And that's basically what
they're trying to do. So I certainly don't look on it favorably.
And I won't be trying to find a way to pass it, I'll tell you
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's position reduces the chances that the bill will get
through the Senate this year. No senator has introduced such
legislation, though Campbell and the AMA are trying to find a
senator, preferably a Republican, to take up the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders are in no hurry to help the
association. Indeed, the Republican leaders are upset with the
group because doctors have worked closely with President Clinton
and with Democrats in Congress to pass a Democratic bill defining
patients' rights in a much more expansive way than Republicans
want.
</P>
<P>
   The Campbell bill would exempt health care professionals from
provisions of the antitrust laws when they negotiate with health
maintenance organizations and insurers over fees and contract
terms.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years, doctors have often been accused of
violating the seminal antitrust law, the Sherman Act of 1890, which
prohibits contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of
trade. The law applies to doctors as it applies to vitamin
manufacturers and road construction companies.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical case, the Federal Trade Commission asserted that
patients and employers had been forced to bear more than $1 million
in increased costs because of a price-fixing conspiracy by surgeons
in Austin, Texas, in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who are employees _ at hospitals, for example _ can join
labor unions and collectively negotiate with their employers under
existing law. The House bill would grant similar immunity from the
antitrust laws to independent doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said they needed more leverage to negotiate on working
conditions, the quality of care, the number of patients they must
see in a day and similar issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill helps doctors help their patients _ nothing more,
nothing less,'' Campbell said Friday. ``Medical professionals
should be allowed to provide care for their patients as they think
best, and today Congress empowered them to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   House passage of the Campbell bill has set off a titanic battle
of lobbyists that mirrors the struggle between doctors and
insurance companies to control patient care.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA has a formidable team of lobbyists. Dr. Donald J.
Palmisano, a trustee of the association, said he sent e-mail
messages to hundreds of doctors in the course of the House debate,
and they flooded congressional offices with phone calls urging
passage of the Campbell bill.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail sent to doctors at 3:15 a.m. Friday, Palmisano
said: ``Wow! We had an impressive win. Now on to the Senate and the
president. We must continue to push hard and not accept the
naysayers' view. They have been 100 percent wrong so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies, HMOs and business groups like the Chamber
of Commerce have waged an even bigger campaign against the bill.
They said they would press their arguments next week in meetings
with senators home for the Fourth of July recess.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is opposed by groups representing nurses, nurse
practitioners and midwives, who fear doctors will demand that
health plans restrict the role of such nonphysicians.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the
Justice Department also opposed the Campbell bill, saying it would
enable doctors to raise their fees. As a result, the officials
said, employers and individual purchasers of health insurance would
have to pay higher premiums, and spending for Medicare and Medicaid
would increase.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have
filed numerous cases alleging that doctors boycotted HMOs, tried to
fix prices or conspired to thwart the cost-control efforts of
managed care organizations. Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the
commission, said the Campbell bill would legalize such conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Federation of America opposed the bill. But dozens
of liberal Democrats, who take pride in being consumer advocates,
voted for it, saying the bill would correct the imbalance of power
between doctors and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip and a staunch
ally of organized labor, said the bill ``reinforces the value of
collective bargaining in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said they needed the Campbell bill so they could serve
more effectively as advocates for their patients in negotiations
with insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Travis B. Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer
Federation of America, said, ``When doctors express such concerns,
it's often merely an attempt to improve their economic position in
the guise of quality of care.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmisano, a surgeon in New Orleans, said: ``You cannot divorce
fees from quality care. In California, some managed care companies
pay pediatricians as little as $10 per child per month, for care
that costs over $40 a month on the average. More than 100
California physician groups have gone bankrupt or closed. Five
giant health plans dictate the health care of 90 percent of insured
Californians.''

   The Campbell bill does not give doctors any new right to strike,
or to withhold services from patients. But Mr. Pitofsky said it
would give doctors ``coercive power'' because they could back their
demands for higher fees by collectively refusing to deal with
certain health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is running for the Senate against incumbent Dianne
Feinstein, a Democrat. She has not taken a position on the bill,
but has suggested that patients would be better served if Congress
simply passed the patients' bill of rights.

 &HT;    No easy answers in affairs of heart
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   British novelist Joanna Trollope thrives on casting a literate
light on the domestic circumstances of ordinary people. Her
characters face contemporary crises that force them to re-examine
entrenched middle-class values and hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marrying the Mistress'' focuses on the love problems of three
generations of men in the Stockdale family. Guy, a sixtysomething
judge, decides to leave Laura, his wife of 40 years, for his
mistress. Far from being a bimbo, Merrion, more than three decades
Guy's junior, is an established attorney. Their love has an
unassailable rightness and depth, their affair has lasted seven
years, and Guy's decision to break up his home late in life is
painfully, carefully reached.
</P>
<P>
   Laura manipulates son Simon into acting as her divorce attorney,
and makes demands on him that nearly destroy his marriage to
Carrie, who has always found her mother-in-law to be disapproving
and intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Simon and Carrie's teenage son, Jack, falls in love
with a willful schoolmate who dumps him. Simon's brother Alan,
happy as a clam in a gay relationship, seems to be the only
Stockdale man not to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous
Eros.
</P>
<P>
   Trollope writes with her usual humor, mixing slang and proper
British terminology to great effect. Early on, one court official
confides to another about Merrion: ``What's gone past is not just
an advocate, any old lady advocate. What's gone past is His Honor's
babe.''
</P>
<P>
   And Trollope, once again, paints from a deft psychological
palette, carefully constructing Guy's long avoidance of his
marriage problems and Laura's maniacal manipulation, showing how
variations are passed on to son and grandson. It makes for nuanced,
riveting reading.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the book's resolution disappoints. Few would argue with
Trollope's reaffirmation of the need to get out of a bad marriage
or work on a good one. But Simon's epiphany and rededication to his
marriage is contrived, and the fate of Guy and Merrion's
relationship seems predetermined by middle-class values and
violates their carefully constructed characters.
</P>
<P>
   Trollope seems to be saying that May-December relationships will
not work, signified by Guy and Merrion's inability to envision a
life together. Such vision is rare these days, the province of
retirement ads in which gray-headed couples walk hand in hand on a
sunset-lit beach, all thanks to their good investments.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, in literature more than in life, we have to gamble on
love and the stock market. After all her careful construction, one
wishes Trollope had allowed His Honor and His Honor's babe to go
for it.

 &HT;    Poets' words gain meaning when they read them aloud
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By Dionisio D. Martinez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the first days of the Colonies, the United States has been
something like a mutt in search of its pedigree. Nothing
illustrates the point more clearly than our poetry. What's more
American: W.S. Merwin's ``The River of Bees'' or Langston Hughes'
``The Negro Speaks of Rivers''? We struggle for tradition,
convinced that it has something to do with time. Some countries, we
tell ourselves, have thousands of years of tradition. But, in fact,
tradition starts from zero, and what many of us miss is that we're
in the process of creating a uniquely American voice.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I was in my senior year of high school, I had
discovered a number of American poets. Having fallen in love with
their words on paper, I came across recordings of these men and
women reading their poetry. There was Archibald MacLeish, with his
very delicate voice, something like a trout stream in spring,
reading epics swelling with history, reading love poems to the wife
he loved madly until the end, helping me understand that there
could be a synthesis between form and the imagination's
recklessness. There was Robert Frost, with his shattered but
determined voice that worked on so many levels: Geographically, it
often began in New England; philosophically, it was boundless. Anne
Sexton came to me with her matter-of-fact poems, her throaty voice.
She was the Tom Waits of those days.
</P>
<P>
   Above them all was T.S. Eliot, his New England accent coated
with a pseudo-British hue. Though much of his work was over my head
at the time, I was too intrigued to turn away. His voice lingered
long after I returned those scratched albums to the library. What
we see on the page and what we hear from the poet are two very
different things. These records would irrevocably change my
approach to poetry, my view of it.
</P>
<P>
   Harper/Caedmon recently released ``T.S. Eliot Reads T.S.
Eliot,'' 2 1/2 hours of the Nobel Prize winner reading his work.
Unfortunately, it is available on cassette only. In these sessions
from 1947 and 1955, Eliot's voice is finely tuned; the cocky
attitude, the impeccable timing, the unexpected pauses are all lost
in the poor definition of a cassette.
</P>
<P>
   Mediocre sonics aside, this is T.S. Eliot, the blueprint for so
many contemporary poets. His reading of ``The Waste Land'' is a
riveting juggling act in which all the voices come in with their
idiosyncrasies. This is probably how an ancient Greek play would
sound if it were written for a single actor, someone competent
enough to handle every character and chorus.
</P>
<P>
   In a live reading of ``Macavity: The Mystery Cat,'' Eliot is
obviously playing to the amused audience but never stumbles. His
delivery of ``The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock'' is
heartbreaking at the very least: One hears a formal voice breaking
loose in the more mundane passages of the poem. Contrary to what
most of us were taught, Eliot is not a difficult poet detached from
the world. On the contrary, in his own way, he painted everyday
life as well as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   We still ask ourselves: ``And would it have been worth it, after
all, / Would it have been worth while, / After the sunsets and the
dooryards and the sprinkled streets, / After the novels, after the
teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor _ / And this,
and so much more?'' The tapes are replete with these questions.
Maybe that's part of the attraction: We claim we want answers but
are really in search of someone who can articulate questions that
curl and cling to the throat, refusing to make themselves audible.
Ranging from ``Ash Wednesday'' to ``The Four Quartets,'' from
``Preludes'' to excerpts from two of his plays, the works on these
tapes are a capsule of contemporary Western thought _ our triumphs
and disappointments, our doubts, our certainties.
</P>
<P>
   For an overview, ``The Caedmon Poetry Collection'' was also
recently released. It compiles 3 1/2 hours of some of the greatest
recorded poetry in the English language, along with a brief piece,
in Spanish, by Pablo Neruda. The collection includes two rare
recordings of W.B. Yeats (``The Song of the Old Mother,'' ``The
Lake Isle of Innisfree''); Dylan Thomas with his dramatic,
heartbreaking voice (``A Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a
Child in London,'' ``Fern Hill,'' ``Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good
Night''); the pure American English of William Carlos Williams
(``The Seafarer''); and the almost hypnotic reading of ``Epistle to
Be Left in the Earth'' by Archibald MacLeish.
</P>
<P>
   Irony, one of the most misused words in our language, is
applicable here. All at once, I approach the patience of middle
age, my hearing falters, and my listening skills begin to sharpen.
These are the same poems I heard in my teens, but now some of the
mysteries clear up, the ideas and images often coming quite close
to life as I see it now. I wouldn't mind being around a quarter of
a century from now, reading and hearing these poems again, looking
back and thinking of how much I missed when I was merely 44.

CLINTON TWEAKS GOP; `TRUTH SQUAD' TAKES AIM AT BUSH

<P>
   CLINTON TWEAKS GOP
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in Philadelphia on Friday that
Republicans will talk a good game when they arrive for their
convention in late July but are not eager to to point out the
serious differences that divide the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have the awfullest time trying to figure out what the
differences are,'' Clinton told a group of union members. ``They're
going to love everybody and help everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a gathering of the American Federation of Federal,
State, County and Municipal Employees, Clinton recited a litany of
issues on which Democrats and Republicans diverge, from the
patients' bill of rights to the minimum wage to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also questioned Texas Gov. George W. Bush's commitment
to Hispanics, saying he had not urged Republican senators to
confirm Enrique Moreno, a Texan whom Clinton nominated as a federal
judge. ``If he had asked them to give him a hearing, they would
have done it,'' Clinton said of Bush. ``He didn't say a word.''
</P>
<P>
   TRUTH SQUAD TAKES AIM AT BUSH
</P>
<P>
   The city where Gov. George W. Bush will be nominated for
president has been chosen by a ``Texas Truth Squad'' _ made up of
union members from Bush's home state _ for the beginning of a
national speaking tour intended to besmirch the governor's record.
</P>
<P>
   The squad, consisting of a teacher, a prison guard, a food
worker and a social worker, made its debut on Thursday at a union
luncheon in Philadelphia presided over by John J. Sweeney, the
president of the AFL-CIO, which has endorsed Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Squad members asserted in a series of short speeches that during
Bush's two terms as governor, Texas has consistently ranked near
the bottom in providing health insurance for children, retirement
pensions, environmental protection and pay for state workers.
</P>
<P>
   Taking special aim at Bush's claim to be an education reformer,
the group said he had diverted money from public schools and tried
to raid teacher retirement funds at a time when the state ranked
45th in the College Board test scores. The squad is scheduled to
make at least a dozen appearances around the United States before
Election Day.

 &HT;    Gender issues bending military readiness?
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By Timothy Furnish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a Nixon could go to China. Only a Clinton could criticize
Sister Souljah. And only a Stephanie Gutman, a civilian and
(obviously) woman journalist with liberal credentials from The New
York Times and The New Republic, could write a book suggesting that
the presence of women in the U.S. military might hinder the
nation's ability to win wars.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman makes a compelling argument that for the past decade
America's civilian and military leadership has foisted upon the
military, with the notable exception of the Marines, a physical and
psychological double standard that sacrifices war-fighting
capability on the altar of a spurious gender equivalency.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman judiciously mixes empirical data with an impressive body
of anecdotal evidence drawn from her observations at Fort Jackson
in Columbia, S.C., the Great Lakes Naval Training Center near
Chicago and on board the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis, as
well as interviews with male and female military personnel. What
she found is best summed up by one female Army recruit: ``There was
this double-
</P>
<P>
   think with women being both excellent warriors, ready to kill
the enemy, and delicate wallflowers who had to have gender-normed
grading and different (physical training) tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Women are, on average, physically weaker and slower than men.
Such politically incorrect facts have been documented by civilian
scientists in studies at the Army Research Institute of
Environmental Medicine. Specifically, they have determined that a
woman has 55 percent to 60 percent the upper body strength of a
man, a greater fat-to-muscle ratio, lighter bones that break more
easily and less cardiovascular capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The military attempts to camouflage such differences with
different physical training test standards. For example, the Army
requires 17- to 21-year-old men to do 42 push-ups and run two miles
in less than 16 minutes, while women of the same age category need
perform only 18 push-ups and get three minutes longer for the run.
</P>
<P>
   The most ludicrous example of the danger of gender-norming is
the grenade test. Since the majority of female trainees could not
throw a live grenade the 35 meters required to get themselves out
of the blast radius, the Army mandated extra throwing practice for
women, right? No. The brass changed the test so women merely had to
drop the grenade into a concrete bunker.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of this issue is psychological. Male trainees
understandably bristle at the blatant double standards and
Orwellian cloud of denial that makes even broaching the issue a
career-killer. But even more harmful to the military's mission is
the inescapability of biology: Young men and women pair off
romantically, undermining unit cohesion and distracting them from
their duties. The converse of erotic involvement is ``fem fear'':
drill sergeants afraid to touch a female recruit even for
instruction, enlisted men reluctant to look at a female peer for
fear of sexual harassment charges, commanders unwilling to give
female officers mediocre evaluations lest they be accused of
lingering Neanderthalism.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the military is just lying in its own tawdry bed of
sexual recrimination, self-made at the 1991 Tailhook and 1996
Aberdeen scandals. These Navy and Army imbroglios could not have
occurred at a worse time _ amid the armed services' scrambling to
justify their post-Cold War budgets; ever-mounting pressure from
the National Organization for Women and its congressional allies to
allow women in combat; and the fawning, distorted media coverage of
``Sgt. Mom'' going off to serve in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman takes a different tack, however, attributing Tailhook
more to media propaganda and a civilian culture unable to fathom
that drunken bacchanalias are the price we pay for young men
willing to go in harm's way at supersonic speeds, and ascribing
Aberdeen to the Army's total prostration before the extreme
feminist shibboleth that ``all sex is rape.'' Her apologetics are
unconvincing here, however. Natural though it may be for warriors
to indulge their testosterone around women, lasciviousness in the
defense of America is still vice.
</P>
<P>
   That questionable interlude aside, there is little to criticize
Gutman for, other than erroneously calling the Pentagon the
``Puzzle Palace'' (that's actually National Security Agency
headquarters at Fort Meade, Md.) and an irritating fixation on male
soldiers' physiques as ``hunky'' and ``Chippendalelike.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutman's book is a crucial contribution to the debate about our
21st-century military. Particularly insightful are her proposed
solutions to gender-based problems: among them, emulating the
Marines' gender-segregated basic training; standardizing physical
training requirements; implementing job-specific strength tests;
and eliminating gender quotas in recruiting. She admits these
suggestions would reduce the number of women in the military from
its current 15 percent, but asserts that's the price to pay for
women strong enough to do their jobs. Let the debate begin.

 &HT;    Bryson's hearty g'day from Down Under
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one would mistake Bill Bryson for the Crocodile Hunter. On
TV, the khaki-shorted Steve Irwin pokes at man-eating reptiles and
crawls under houses looking for deadly snakes. In his latest
travelogue, the tweedy, bearded Bryson visits a secondhand
bookstore and picks up a volume about crocodile attacks and tells
us the horrifying tale of an American model who was standing under
a waterfall in western Australia when she noticed a half-submerged
snout swimming toward her. She was last seen being dragged beneath
the surface, a startled look on her face.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson tells this story as he sits in a comfortable pub with a
book and a cold one. If he personally saw a live crocodile during
his Australian travels, he doesn't mention it.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the thing: It doesn't matter. Bryson is such a good
storyteller _ scary and funny in all the right places _ that you
don't much care if he never left his bar stool.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson has become an enormously popular travel writer by coming
off as the most literate, humorous tour guide you never had. He
weaves research and chance encounter into an entertaining narrative
sprinkled with self-deprecation. The formula worked nicely in his
previous books about England (``Notes From a Small Island'') and
the Appalachian Trail (``A Walk in the Woods'').
</P>
<P>
   Australia, one of the most eccentric places on Earth, seems
tailor-made for his drollery. It's distant, exotic, barren for
great stretches, yet it feels familiar to someone who grew up in
the States and lived in Britain for 20 years, as Bryson did. He
always imagined Australia as an amiable mingling of the two
cultures _ ``Baywatch'' with cricket, as he puts it. He found it
was much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   With the Olympics approaching in Sydney, this is a highly
exceptional year for Australia. Usually, Bryson notes, the world's
interest in the land down under doesn't go much past Nicole Kidman
and Mel Gibson. He checked The New York Times index for 1997 and
found only 20 articles predominantly about Australia. The globe's
sixth-largest nation ranked ahead of bananas but behind ice cream
in importance.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, it seems, simply doesn't draw attention to itself. It
doesn't start wars, overfish international waters, grow large
amounts of illegal narcotics. It truly is a ``no worries'' kind of
place.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson sets out to redress this attention deficit by taking us
along on three trips to the country. He rides an Indian Pacific
train across the Outback. Gets lost walking around a Sydney suburb.
Descends into the Great Barrier Reef in a semisubmersible. Visits a
combination pet supply/pornography shop outside Canberra. Braves a
really bad hotel in Darwin, which is worth mentioning only because
it occasions one of those comeback lines you wish you could snap
off on command. The desk clerk, who doesn't seem to have heard a
word of Bryson's complaints, blithely tells him to come again as he
checks out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would sooner have bowel surgery in the woods with a stick,''
the author replies.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson is particularly fascinated by Australia's menagerie of
dangerous animals. The island continent and its surrounding waters
contain the world's deadliest snakes, most venomous insects, most
toxic and tooth sea creatures. Like a camp counselor spinning ghost
stories around the fire, Bryson delights in confronting us with
most of them _ from great white sharks to funnel-web spiders _
often as he regards their stuffed specimens in a climate-controlled
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Take the box jellyfish, whose tentacles pack so much toxin that
people who have been stung keep screaming in agony after they've
been given morphine. Bryson saw one in a large glass cylinder at
the Northern Territory Museum, next to displays of stingrays,
scorpion fish and 30 types of sea snakes, all found in nearby
coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonder to me that anyone goes within a hundred feet of
the sea in northern Australia,'' writes Bryson, who doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Just thinking about all that poison is enough to make you order
another round.

 &HT;    An enigmatic survivor amid reality's illusions
 &HT;      What I Think I Did: A Season in Survival
 &HT;    in Two Acts. By Larry Woiwode. Basic Books. $25.
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The voice at the other end was firm yet guarded.
</P>
<P>
   I introduced myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes?'' Larry Woiwode said.
</P>
<P>
   A distance of 1,000 miles is not always bridged in a single
telephone call, and Woiwode is not an expansive man. He is among
the least well-known of America's major writers, his talent worthy
of comparison to anyone of his generation. But it is not a name
immediately recognizable. He came to prominence early on, with
poems and stories in The New Yorker under the slightly mysterious
byline ``L. Woiwode,'' then with his first novel, ``What I'm Going
to Do, I Think,'' in 1969. It was not only widely praised, here and
abroad, but was even a best seller, an intensely lyrical story of a
couple in the first years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his next novel, ``Beyond the Bedroom Wall,''
published in 1975, that seemed to establish Woiwode (pronounced
WHY-woody) as a writer of uncommon gifts. A finalist for the
National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award,
``Beyond the Bedroom Wall'' was the evolving story of a prairie
family and of a mother's death. From its incantatory opening
paragraph through the mature years of those who would survive her,
``Beyond the Bedroom Wall'' was told not in sequential narrative
but in a series of stopped moments, as in a family album. Critics
not given to overstatement called it one of the great American
novels of the second half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   And then something happened. More novels and story collections
followed _ ``Poppa John,'' ``Born Brothers,'' ``Silent Passengers''
_ but the reviews were mixed and sometimes worse. With his wife and
children, Woiwode had moved from New York back to his native North
Dakota. He had also become unapologetically religious, and serious
writers _ serious artists of any kind _ become suspect once they
admit to religious belief. In Woiwode's case, autobiographical
parallels had always been evident in his fiction and in time they
became darker. ``I wonder how the parallels in my own life inform
the fiction,'' he once told Publishers Weekly. ``I only construct a
fiction in a way that I feel will work _ and the devil take the
hindmost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I Think I Did'' is neither autobiography nor fiction, but
rather a memoir in the form of meditation, with past and present
changing into one another like the colors of a chameleon. One act
describes Woiwode and his family trapped in a blizzard during the
winter of 1996-97, the other his life as a young man in New York
when he hung around with an aspiring teenage actor named Robert De
Niro and caught the eye of William Maxwell, a revered editor at The
New Yorker. The one is often hypnotic in its imagery (``... a wind
hits and streaks of snow revolve to the horizontal and double in
volume, a white-out''), the other a recollection of another life
and another world entirely. Of De Niro he writes: ``When he's
unhappy his parents come up, and he turns on himself, somberly
angry, as if the responsibility he takes for keeping in touch with
them, in order to keep in touch, identifies him as their cause for
being apart. An only child's trial.''
</P>
<P>
   But between these two acts, both told in the present tense, is
an Intermission that might as easily be called a credo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time,'' Woiwode writes, ``is the lesser compatriot to language
and so time, whom most of us revere, bows to language. It is
helpless before language. Language is greater, omniscient. With
language people arrange adornments that endure, while time merely
passes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Woiwode is speaking here of his response to reading Joseph
Brodsky, who had read W.H. Auden's ``In Memory of W.B. Yeats.''
Reading Brodsky, he came to a realization both aesthetic and
religious. But the formulation of the idea seemed to me to have got
things backward, and so I called him at his farm in North Dakota.
If people arrange adornments through language, doesn't that in
itself imply an order of priority? If they are only that _
adornments _ wouldn't that which they adorn be the truer, more
enduring reality?
</P>
<P>
   His voice has a gravelly edge, and his manner of speaking
conveys a resistance to changing his mind easily _ changing it, at
least, whenever some stranger from Atlanta calls. ``What we call
real does not endure,'' he says. ``Trees die and flowers wither.''
Language alone, he goes on, survives our own mortality and enables
us to construct versions of what we call reality. The words of the
psychologist Erik Erikson, used a quarter-century ago as an
epigraph in ``Beyond the Bedroom Wall,'' suddenly are crystallized:
```Reality,' of course, is man's most powerful illusion; but while
he attends to this world, it must outbalance the total enigma of
being in it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Woiwode himself is an enigmatic writer, enormously gifted and
yet trapped, it sometimes seems, within private furies. He writes
of North Dakota farmers tying ropes around their waists when they
check on their livestock in a storm, tethering themselves to
something solid so they can find their way back. Even then, some
have not. The burden of Woiwode's work is testimony to his will to
survive storms of another kind, and evidence of a resoluteness more
impressive even than the gifts that brought him a passing world's
fickle attention.

 &HT;    Atlanta's urban music industry in full swing
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid's departure _ and the subsequent
downsizing of 11-year-old LaFace _ is unquestionably the biggest
blow Atlanta's music scene has been dealt. His was the most
successful imprint based in this city. And it was Reid and LaFace
that attracted other labels, other performers, producers and
executives here.
</P>
<P>
   And primarily because of that, he leaves behind a local urban
music industry that is well on its way.
</P>
<P>
   Grammy-winning producer Dallas Austin is strongly established in
his '50s-like drugstore/playground/studio off Northside Drive,
where he's been working with artists like Michael Jackson and
Madonna and his own personal projects, TLC and Monica, about as
long as LaFace has been around.
</P>
<P>
   Off Piedmont Road, in the industrial gray and black office of So
So Def Records, Jermaine Dupri is running a 7-year-old,
multimillion-dollar-selling label that just put out its first
soundtrack (``Big Momma's House''). He's also planning a follow-up
to his platinum rap debut, and he continues to watch artists _ for
whom he writes and creates music (Da Brat, Jagged Edge) _ climb the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three members of TLC continue to call Atlanta home,
as do Usher, Monica, Kelly Price, Montell Jordan, Outkast, Blaque
and Ideal. Grammy-winning songwriters Kandi Burruss and Tameka
``Tiny'' Cottle and the hitmaking collectives at Noontime (who have
produced songs for Toni Braxton and Jim Crow) and Organized Noize
(TLC, En Vogue) are here, too.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those waiting in the wings. Here are five
Atlantans to watch:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Johnte Austin, 19, Stockbridge, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   By age 17, Austin had already written his first hit record and
gotten a royalty check so big he bought his family a house.
</P>
<P>
   The song, R&AMP;B ballad ``Sweet Lady,'' established dancer, MTV
host and Guess model Tyrese as a singer and won an American Music
Award and a Grammy nomination for male R&AMP;B vocal performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnte and those guys basically gave me the song that will
probably, proudly, be my signature,'' says Tyrese.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the ingratiatingly bashful Atlanta-born teen put off
being a singer, temporarily, and went full blast with his pen.
Austin has since helped write Top 10 Billboard hits for Aaliyah
(``I Don't Wanna'') and Ideal (``Get Gone''), and the new release
from Toni Braxton (``Just Be a Man About It'').
</P>
<P>
   ``After doing talent shows since I was 12, trying to be a
singer, I kind of didn't know this is the direction I would take,''
he says. ``I'm blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shakir Stewart, 25, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   This 1995 graduate of Morehouse College claims he really didn't
start his education until a year after school. That's when Reid
asked the Oakland, Calif., native to work for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only has he been teaching me the aesthetics of a hit
song,'' says the energetic Stewart, who can appear as if he's
speeding even as he sits at his desk, ``but more importantly, he's
taught me about being a black man in this world, not just in this
business.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, as the recently promoted vice president and general
manager of Reid's publishing arm, Hitco, the former party thrower
is in charge of a multimillion-dollar company whose
writers/producers include She'kspere (on Sinead O'Connor's new CD)
and Beyonce of R&AMP;B quartet Destiny's Child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I'm the hook-up man,'' he explains. ``I do whatever
I need to do to enhance the correct exposure for my client. But I'm
also part Les Brown, motivational speaker. I energize my clients to
do their best work.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Joi, 29, East Point, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Joi is already a star, she just hasn't found her place in the
constellations yet. Vocally, her sensual electricity roars up there
with such '70s soul sirens as LaBelle. Few in the Nashville
native's peer group of mostly video-only performers can ignite a
crowd the way she does. All Joi's needed since her longtime
friend/producer Dallas Austin's label folded three years ago was a
record deal. And as of February, that's taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think this will finally work this time,'' says Joi,
who has been with two record labels _ both of which closed _ since
her 1994 debut (``The Pendulum Vibe''). ``Now I'm with a
well-oiled, large machine (Universal Records/Crazy World). I have
more control over things, and I've learned all the proper lessons
so this can be the thang it needs to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, she started working on an album due in January
2001. ``I would be done if I wasn't preparing for this wedding (to
Big Gipp of Atlanta rap act Goodie Mob) and getting the kitchen
remodeled.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ian Burke, 34, Grant Park, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Burke is the human line that links many of this city's biggest
acts. He put TLC together when they were Second Nature, but passed
them along to more connected management before they became best
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   He was the manager of the hip-hop act Arrested Development.
``But I was green, and I knew I couldn't take them to the next
level,'' he says. The next level turned out to be a Grammy-winning
debut.
</P>
<P>
   He had rappers Outkast as well. But he left to work with the
group's producers. Outkast went on to get a Grammy nod.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly this Mount Vernon, N.Y., native has a knack for spotting
music talent. Now he's hoping to be around when millions of others
notice it as well. Burke runs his own Greenhouse Management Co.
(rock band Edith's Wish, rapper Sole) and the new production
company/label Wish Recordings, with TLC's Lisa ``Left-Eye'' Lopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, I feel, will be the moment I finally see an act from the
early stages to the big success. Seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kawan ``KP'' Prather, 27, Jonesboro, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by his usual three or four hours of sleep, Prather is
doing five or six jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He is vice president of A&AMP;R at LaFace Records. ``I pick the
producers and songs for our artists,'' most recently Usher and his
4 million-selling CD ``My Way'' and Pink's gold debut, ``Can't Take
Me Home.'' He also helps ``find the direction of the album.
Something that makes everyone happy. Easy, huh?'' he smirks.
</P>
<P>
   He is also CEO of LaFace's subsidiary label, Ghet-o-vision,
which signed Atlanta rap duo the Youngbloodz (``U-Way'') and just
co-released the ``Shaft 2000'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   When the Atlanta native leaves his Buckhead office, it could be
to record something as a member of rap trio P.A.; or he could be
out of the sound booth and behind the board as producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you forgot the other two things I am,'' he adds
enthusiastically. ``I'm a father and husband. And with all I do, my
(3-year-old) son really knows me. That's what I'm really proud
of.''

 &HT;    LAFACE TIME LINE
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  October 1989. With a five-year, $20 million joint venture deal
with Arista Records in hand, Reid and Edmonds leave Los Angeles and
launch LaFace Records (a combination of their nicknames). It
actually started in Reid's former Country Club of the South home
(which LaFace singer Usher now owns) but soon moved to a Norcross,
Ga., office.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1991. TLC is formed when Reid's then-wife, R&AMP;B singer Pebbles
(``Mercedes Boy''), puts her back-up dancer, Rozonda ``Chilli''
Thomas, together with Tionne ``T-Boz'' Watkins and Lisa
``Left-Eye'' Lopes, then in a trio called Second Nature.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  July 1993. Reid and Edmonds unveil the husky singer they've
deemed the First Lady of LaFace, Toni Braxton. Her self-titled
debut album sells more than 7 million copies and earns her best new
artist and best R&AMP;B artist/female Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  September 1993. Edmonds finally confirms that the rumors are
true, he and Reid would split as a production entity. Neither has
really said why, until now:
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of reasons,'' Reid says. ``No. 1 was, I think
I used to (upset him) because I would sit in the studio and be on
the telephone. (Husky laugh). No. 2: I started to have a true love
of the business and working with other artists. No. 3: In some
respects, Kenny might have felt like Kenny needed to grow as a
writer and producer and he needed to do it by himself... And I
supported that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Aug. 30, 1994. After catching Reid's younger brother Bryant's
attention at an Atlanta talent search, 15-year-old R&AMP;B singer Usher
Raymond releases his self-titled debut on the label. Producer Sean
``Puffy'' Combs guides the artist and album.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  November 1994. TLC's ``CrazySexyCool'' is released and goes on
to sell more than 13 million copies, making TLC the best-selling
female group in the country. Reid and Edmonds are profiled in Black
Enterprise as two of the 50 top black entertainment power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 7, 1995. LaFace announces that it has renewed its
agreement with Arista Records and parent company BMG, at an
estimated value of $100 million over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sept. 23, 1997. LaFace releases the ``Soul Food'' soundtrack,
followed a week later by the movie. Executive producer Edmonds'
$7.5 million baby earns $11.4 million its first weekend in
theaters, making it No. 2 in box office totals to George Clooney's
``The Peacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  November 1999. The Recording Industry Association of America
names ``CrazySexyCool'' the best-selling hip-hop album of the 20th
century (odd, since the songs aren't really rap).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Late November 1999. The Los Angeles Times suggests that
founding Arista Records President Clive Davis _ who's responsible
for signing Whitney Houston and helping to revive the career of
Santana _ will be replaced by Reid.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 10, 2000: Backstage at Arista Records' 25th anniversary
party, Davis tells The New York Times that he'll step down when his
contract expires June 30.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  May 3, 2000: Reid is named Davis' successor as president of
Arista Records. That same day, BMG announces that Edmonds has a new
joint venture with Arista to form his own label.

 &HT;    The man who built Atlanta's urban music scene opens up about his
move to New York
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's only after talking for hours, first in his black Mercedes
and then in his Dunwoody home, that Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid starts to
worry, just a little, about what he's said.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in loose linen rather than his standard tailored
business suit, he seems more relaxed than usual, a man comfortable
with his success and in control of his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really feeling like a change,'' Reid offers.
</P>
<P>
   He's even volunteered to lay out on the floor for photographs.
But his slight self-consciousness _ was he too relaxed, too chatty?
_ hints at just how odd and new all this attention feels to him.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Reid never talks this much. In part, because people only
recently began asking him to.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly because the 44-year-old has spent most of his career
behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't know how strange this is for me to be the
focus,'' he says in a voice as calming as the soft jazz coming from
the stereo. ``I'm used to helping stars. Not being treated like
one.''
</P>
<P>
   This week he takes the helm as president of Arista Records, one
of the largest pop labels in the country. And the move into the
spotlight, which follows a tumultuous power struggle between Arista
founder Clive Davis and parent company BMG, seems a natural
progression.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years ago, Reid created LaFace Records with partner
Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds and built it into a major R&AMP;B and rap
label. For nearly a decade, LaFace _ and a handful of other
Atlanta-based labels and producers _ have dominated the popular
music charts with such R&AMP;B artists as TLC and Toni Braxton and rap
groups Outkast and Goodie Mob.
</P>
<P>
   LaFace was a partner with Arista from the beginning. And with
Reid running the day-to-day operation, LaFace became a very
lucrative property for parent company BMG. In the last fiscal year,
Arista made about $500 million (10 percent of which came from
LaFace revenue). With his new job comes a higher public profile.
For Reid it will be an adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'80s the Cincinnati native made his professional
debut with the R&AMP;B group the Deele as the drummer. He was visible,
but barely, sitting way in the back of the group's ``Two
Occasions'' video, in oversize shades, his Jheri-curled head often
bowed over his kit.
</P>
<P>
   In career No. 2, Reid was part of the multi-Grammy-winning team
that produced more than 25 No. 1 pop and R&AMP;B singles from the
mid-'80s until it split in 1993. (Still, noted cultural critic
Nelson George remembers people referring to Reid as ``the other
guy.'' As in: ``Who set the all-time record for consecutive No. 1
singles on the R&AMP;B chart with `Baby, Baby, Baby' by TLC; `End of
the Road' by Boyz II Men; and `Humpin' Around' by Bobby Brown?
Babyface and the other guy.'')
</P>
<P>
   And as co-president of LaFace Records, he was the rare executive
in urban contemporary music who didn't show up in his artists'
videos. You could have missed that Reid helped develop TLC, the
best-selling female group in the country. Or that he signed Usher,
the closest thing R&AMP;B has had to a teen pop idol since Michael
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   His talent has been finding talent and creating crossover stars.
Now, he's charged with bringing a contemporary edge to Arista,
which has long relied on pop stars such as Whitney Houston, Aretha
Franklin and Annie Lennox.
</P>
<P>
   Reid insists he's not leaving LaFace or Atlanta behind. He has
not named a new president; he says he will continue to direct the
label. He's keeping his house here, too _ he'll spend weekdays in
New York, weekends in Atlanta with his three children. His new
wife, though, 30-year-old Erica Holton, will probably leave her
substitute-teaching days behind.
</P>
<P>
   But still, he worries. As the first black man in recent memory
to run a major, all-genres record label, he's about to take center
stage. His words will carry more weight. So he wonders, did he get
too relaxed, too chatty, in his first substantive interview since
being named?
</P>
<P>
   You decide.

 &HT;    Moldable hats have buckets of supporters
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   J Crew calls them crushers. Eddie Bauer describes them as
buckets. The Gap refers to them as cargo headgear.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into summer, they're cool hats for hot days, sported by
such celebs as rappers Jay-Z and Da Brat as well as Los Angeles
Lakers guard Kobe Bryant and Indiana Pacers guard Reggie Miller.
Basically, this topper is a soft, relaxed shape, with a brim that
can be crushed down and worn low on the forehead. You can find them
in cotton twill, linen, denim, seersucker and open-weave nylons and
polyesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it's not a new shape, it's a comfortable hat to
wear,'' says Casey Bush, director of the Millinery Institute in New
York. ``And, since most styles are washable, they are economical.
Prices range anywhere from $10 to $30.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Bauer reports it has carried the bucket shape for years _
for men, in terry cloth. The store brought it back for women this
season and has sold quite a few, in twill.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Carolyn Tanner has been wearing this crusher style a
good many years and numbers a dozen in her closet. ``I love to wear
a hat when I have a bad hair day,'' says Tanner, an accessory
designer. ``Also, this style protects my complexion from the sun
and frames my face, I think, in the best light.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready-to-wear designer and painter Anthony Liggins wears his
comfy bucket hat every day. ``It gives me an attitude,'' says the
Atlanta designer. ``Right now, accessories are such a big deal. And
since I travel quite a bit, this type of hat packs like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   And the best part of a bucket hat for Liggins? ``People don't
recognize me in it.''

 &HT;    Novelist helps Virginia town cling to its past
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRUNDY, Va. _ Novelist Lee Smith has been proving Thomas Wolfe
wrong for years, going home again and again to the tiny coal mining
town where she was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved coming back,'' Smith says on a recent visit,
navigating her SUV through downtown Grundy. Passing a sign proudly
proclaiming her as a native daughter, she slows down and laughs.
``Isn't that something?'' she says in a Southern twang any country
music singer would die for. Then she turns off the main road and
pauses behind the building that once housed her father's Ben
Franklin five-and-dime store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent many wonderful hours there,'' says Smith, 56.
``Sometimes my father would bring me to his office and let me sleep
on a pallet while he worked on the books through the night.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in that office on the second floor that Smith would sit
and peer through a two-way mirror to observe the everyday
minidramas unfolding in the store below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I witnessed not only shoplifting, but fights and embraces as
well,'' she says. ``Thus I learned the position of omniscient
narrator, who sees and records everything yet is never visible. It
was the perfect early education for a fiction writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's beloved dime store is gone now, converted to a teen
center where coal miners' daughters and sons play video games and
laser tag, shoot pool and sip sodas.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, soon will be gone, along with the two movie theaters
where Roy Rogers and Trigger appeared live onstage and Lash LaRue
demonstrated his prowess with a bullwhip. Gone, too, will be the
string of stores, most empty now, that hug the banks of Slate
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   After a century of enduring devastating floods every 20 years or
so, downtown Grundy is being moved to higher ground. Everything
along the creek will be demolished for a U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers flood control project scheduled over the next eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everything you've been connected to is literally going
underwater, it's galvanizing,'' says Smith, who now lives in
Hillsborough, N.C. ``That town where we grew up and went to school
and came to pay our taxes, where we got a marriage license or
bought our son a bike for Christmas, will be gone forever. The only
thing left of it will be our memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. Smith and 30 high school students, along with
high school English teacher Debbie Raines and Buchanan County
librarian Pat Hatfield, have launched an oral history project to
record these memories in a book. The project is being funded by
grants from the Virginia Arts Commission and the Virginia
Department of the Humanities. Smith plans to publish the
coffee-table book this fall and to host an autograph party and
reunion of the students who worked on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose our memories so gradually we don't realize it. This
book will help us to remember,'' Smith says as she maneuvers the
SUV back onto the main drag, which is dotted with a Pizza Hut,
Wendy's and other fast food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there is my old stomping ground,'' she says, nodding
toward a row of neat white houses with perfectly maintained yards
and flower beds. ``I lived in this neighborhood and delivered
papers. This is the house where I grew up, right here. It won't be
affected, but some will be raised on stilts and the rest will have
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, like the young people she is working with on the book,
admits she couldn't wait to leave Grundy. ``I felt closed in
because of all the mountains around us. I was also completely
surrounded by relatives on eerie side. I didn't like everyone
knowing what I was doing. Later, I realized what a wonderfully safe
and blessed childhood I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith would have written the oral-history book herself, but when
she got the idea two years ago, she was just starting a novel,
``The Last Girls'' (due out next year), and working on a musical,
``Good Ol' Girls'' (performed last year at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill). There was no time to spend months in her
hometown conducting and transcribing interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I thought, maybe Debbie's students would love to do
this,'' says Smith, who had held several writing workshops with
Raines' classes in the past. ``I like to work with high school
students, so I coerced her into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after agreeing to help with the project, Raines was
hesitant. ``Did Lee realize what she was asking, or had she simply
lost touch with reality?'' Raines recalls. ``Was it really possible
that a detached Generation Y would suddenly think it `cool' to
listen to adults?''
</P>
<P>
   What happened next was both surprising and rewarding, Raines
says. Equipped with tape recorders and a list of questions, the
students were sent to interview the old-timers about what Grundy
was like when they were teenagers and the town was booming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were terrified at first,'' Smith says of the students.
``They practiced interviewing their families and went out in teams
of two. One could maintain eye contact and the other one could see
that everything was working. After a few disasters, they started
taking two tape recorders. They were sure that people would not
talk. And toward the end they were sure that people would never
shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years, Raines watched in amazement as the kids
grew more confident and returned with fascinating tales about their
neighbors. ``Yes, Lee knew exactly what she was doing,'' Raines
says. ``It just took me a while to catch on.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories they recorded were about the people of Grundy in
particular, but they are universal in nature. They are the stories
of thousands of other small towns where the young people leave in
droves every year in search of jobs or adventure. In Grundy, the
kids have few choices. Most of the coal that everyone said would
last a hundred years has already been mined. A few companies are
still operating, but the Saturdays when the downtown overflowed
with miners and their families are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South _ pockets of the South like this area _ is changing
enormously,'' says Smith, who has written about the Appalachian
people in ``Oral History,'' ``Black Mountain Breakdown,'' ``Fair
and Tender Ladies'' and other novels. ``First television, and now
the Internet. Everything is becoming so much more standardized.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other small towns, Grundy has its share of fascinating
characters and stories. It was the site of the last hanging in
Virginia, an 1897 event that drew 3,000 spectators, some with
picnic lunches, to watch John Hardin die. It is the home of the
late Francis Gary Powers, the U2 pilot who was shot down over the
Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most famous person still living in the area is Smiley
Ratliff,'' Smith says. ``He's a kind of wildcatter, a real
maverick, a coal miner who made an incredible amount of money
during the big boom in the '70s. He's flamboyant, and he lives on
this baronial estate and raises cattle. He's the second-largest
cattle owner east of the Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Pruitt, who interviewed Ratliff with Leah Boardwine, was
fascinated with the eccentric entrepreneur. In a final workshop at
the teen center, where Smith reviewed the students' work and
double-checked names, Pruitt describes her visit to Ratliff's
palatial home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at pictures of his ancestors and heard the history
of the Ratliff name,'' Pruitt says. ``I listened intently but could
not help being distracted when I saw the Ming vase filled with bags
of tobacco, or the solid gold doorknobs on all the doors. But the
most amazing thing was when he said he was an alien from outer
space. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Others residents who were interviewed remembered the devastating
floods. In her interview with students Reece Hale and Jennifer
Lester, store owner Inez Ramey described how she used to hide her
money under the linoleum. When the last flood hit in 1977, she
barely had time to retrieve her money before the building was swept
away by floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   Smith recalls going down to the basement of her father's store
after one of the floods and finding a huge fish flopping on the
steps.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Hahn, who interviewed his grandfather, learned some
fascinating details about life when coal was king. ``Every Sunday
he would go to the Morgan Theater, where every seat was filled,''
Hahn says. ``Mostly they climbed mountains and went to the movies
for entertainment. About the only time you could get a radio
station was after 11 or 12 at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Smith learned some things about the town she didn't know _
including family secrets that had long been hidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman said that her father was a famous counterfeiter who
had a silver mine. People are still looking for the engraving
plates he used in counterfeiting. And another girl discovered she
was related to John Hardin _ the man who was hanged. Her mother had
known about it but never told her.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Smith, Raines and Hatfield expressed their
appreciation to the parents and students at a farewell banquet
celebrating the completion of the interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this project helped bring the community together,''
Raines says after the families had filled their plates with mashed
potatoes, roast beef, turkey, dressing and broccoli casserole and
their glasses with iced tea or Mountain Dew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had so many older people stop me in stores and say,
`Thank you for having those young people come and visit.' I think
it made them feel important to have someone want to hear their
stories. It gave them a sense of worth.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the students, most of whom will end up living elsewhere,
Raines says the experience will have a lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when young people are reeling from broken homes,
broken relationships and broken promises, oral history enables them
to discover their roots. They have learned about their history and
who they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they'll be able to tell their children and keep these
stories alive when the town's long gone.''

 &HT;    An officer, a gentleman, and a scrambled dog ...
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock and Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ga. _ It's Saturday at Dinglewood Pharmacy. And it
seems like everybody in Columbus _ even folks in Jaguars from
Alabama _ has scrambled dogs on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Like its maker _ 68-year-old Lieutenant Charles Stevens, this
Army town's favorite grill sergeant and soda jerk_ the scrambled
dog is a local institution. It's the Holy Grail of hot-dog lore,
the Rolls Royce of the weiner world and a much-ballyhooed hangover
cure.
</P>
<P>
   But frankly, when all is said and done, it's just a souped-up
weenie on a bun.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the bad boy so fine is the way Lieutenant _ his given
name and what everyone calls him _ dresses it down and gives it its
marching orders. After deftly chopping the beef-pork-and-red-dye
hot dog into fat pink links, he ladles on more than a cupful of his
secret-recipe chili (``often imitated, never duplicated,'' the menu
says). He then tops it with sliced dill pickles, chunks of American
cheese, onions if you like, and the signature fistful of oyster
crackers. Some people squiggle it with mustard and ketchup.
Everybody eats it with a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing it's in a drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   The concoction, says Dinglewood owner Terry Hurley, was created
by then-cook Sport Brown, using a chili recipe devised by a
pharmacist's wife in about 1930. When Brown got sick in the early
'50s, Lieutenant moved up in rank from nighttime cook to daytime
commander. Now his little-changed formula (he omitted the salt) has
survived Dinglewood's four owners and three locations. Lieutenant's
caricature graces mugs, T-shirts and greeting cards. He has a
resume, a business card and a photo of him with the late ``Good
Times'' actress Esther Rolle, who stopped by one day.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken man who's neither bark nor bite, Lieutenant works
``practically every day'' for a crowd that just can't get enough of
the doggone things. Most weekdays, the throwback fountain goes
through 20 gallons of chili. Saturdays, though, can require 60
gallons to top 500 dogs and fill to-go orders, especially for
families heading to Florida. ``They freeze it and take it with them
so they can have the same hot dogs while they're there,''
Lieutenant says.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. George Busbee used to send a Highway Patrol car by
to pick up a gallon. Lieutenant also has catered to Prince Charles
at the governor's mansion and to President Carter at Washington
brunches.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it looked as if Lieutenant's scrambled dogs might
fade as his health declined. But now he's feeling better and thanks
President Clinton for allowing ``retired'' workers to earn more
while they accept Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sit down, you go down,'' he figures.
</P>
<P>
   And though his doctor doesn't recommend it, Lieutenant eats one
scrambled dog a week. He just takes his medication first.
</P>
<P>
   Dinglewood Pharmacy is at 1939 Wynnton Road, Columbus.
706-322-0616. Closed Sundays.

 &HT;    N.C. landscaper expands folks' concept of `normal'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Even among people who have never met him,
Marty Ravellette is unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Past the initial shock, it is amazing to watch the 60-year-old
landscaper as he earns a living, without arms.
</P>
<P>
   Ravellette, the owner of Hands on Landscaping, once tore down
houses in Oregon with a hammer and crowbar. In another job, he
drove a truck across the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11 years since he arrived in this university town, he's
become well-known. A year and a half ago he and his wife, Maree,
rescued an elderly woman from a burning minivan, earning a guest
appearance on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' and collecting several
prizes for heroism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not too many I know of in this day and time who have
managed life the way he has managed life,'' says Chapel Hill
jeweler Ken Jackson, 54.
</P>
<P>
   Ravellette already has a title _ but no publisher _ for his life
story: ``With These Hands.'' He met recently with a Las Vegas
promoter in hopes of becoming a motivational speaker. He believes
he has something special to say, blending bluntness and humility in
recounting how he's managed a relatively normal life. He can cast a
fishing line, light a cigarette or crank a chain saw, all with his
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at the counter of Sutton's Drug Store, where he's a
breakfast regular, Ravellette hooks the big toe of his left foot in
the looped handle of the creamy white coffee mug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have learned to accept myself,'' he says simply. ``You
should be able to accept me.''
</P>
<P>
   One morning, after Ravellette had left Sutton's, people sitting
at a table complained that his foot had been on the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to clean it just like I'll clean after you,'' grill
manager Don Pinney told them.
</P>
<P>
   Maree Ravellette, 58, says she used to get angry at people's
insensitivity to her husband's disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand now that other people don't understand,'' she
says. ``I am just proud to be with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty and Maree have been married for 10 years. In the morning,
he drives her to Durham, where she's a waitress at Shoney's. He
picks her up in the afternoon. During the day, he works.
</P>
<P>
   He drives a GMC van, steering with his left foot and operating
the accelerator and brake with his right foot. He has a North
Carolina driver's license and no special equipment on his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   For him, driving is just another mundane task. Before mowing
grass, he picks up stubborn sticks and leaves with his toes. When
he starts a lawn mower, he clutches the handle of the crank rope
with his toes. Balancing on his right foot, he hurls his left leg
straight back, as quick and powerful as a horse's kick. He pushes
the mower with his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finds an alternative way to do almost everything,'' says
Chuck Stone, a journalism professor at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill who has known Ravellette for nine years. He
invites Ravellette to speak to his students every semester, hoping
they'll learn something about diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students need to see somebody who does not fit in the normal
pattern of their lives,'' Stone says.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ravellette's closest friends, Ray Estes of Chapel Hill,
sees him as a role model for people with all sorts of disabilities,
or who suffer from stereotyping by society, or lack self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty has always looked at beating the system set up for
people with two arms,'' says Estes, 60, who met Ravellette in 1959
when they lived in the same San Diego boardinghouse. ``He sees it
as an adventure to show that there is more than one way to
accomplish something.''
</P>
<P>
   When Estes first saw Ravellette, he was performing stunts _
handling a razor blade and combing his hair _ for boardinghouse
residents sitting around and getting drunk. Later, Estes told him
he was getting laughs but no respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty was trying to prove his manhood,'' says Estes, a
believer in Bahai, a worldwide religion that originated in Persia
and essentially teaches that all people are equal. ``I told him ...
he had nothing to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravellette embraced the faith and began to focus not on what he
doesn't have, but on what he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``God gave me a wonderful gift,'' he says. ``He said, go out and
serve mankind with your gift, not yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravellette attends Bahai worship services in Chapel Hill, part
of a routine that keeps him in touch with a small circle of
friends.
</P>
<P>
   He's been married before, to a woman who also was born without
arms. They married in 1963, after a cross-country introduction. She
read in the newspaper about police stopping an armless motorist
driving 85 mph on the San Diego Freeway. She wrote to Ravellette,
and they married three months later.
</P>
<P>
   They divorced in 1974, after their 4-year-old son, Marcus, died
after falling from the back of a pickup Ravellette was driving in
Eugene, Ore. He says his wife couldn't forgive him for the
accident, and they split up.
</P>
<P>
   Ravellette met Maree in the late 1980s when he was working in
Paramus, N.J. He did landscaping work at a Dairy Queen where her
two daughters worked. After Ravellette moved to Chapel Hill in
1989, Maree visited him, and they married a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Her two daughters now live in North Carolina, and Maree's three
grandchildren often visit the couple's apartment in Carrboro.
Ravellette also has befriended William Lawrence, a 12-year-old boy
in Durham who was born without arms. Ravellette is teaching him to
fish, to ride a bike and to think of himself as ``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has shown William that despite your disabilities, you can
be as independent as you want to be,'' says the boy's mother,
Lillie Cozart, 33.
</P>
<P>
   Ravellette's disability affects an estimated 2,000 people in the
United States, according to the National Center of Health
Statistics. When he was born in Goodland, Ind., in 1939, his
parents quickly decided they couldn't raise him properly. They sent
him at 3 weeks of age to the Good Shepherd orphanage in Allentown,
Pa. Nurses taught him to hold a bottle with his tiny feet.
</P>
<P>
   Ravellette learned to read and write on his own, entitling him
to attend public schools in Allentown. He lived in the orphanage
for 16 years, afterward returning to his parents' farm, where many
viewed him as retarded.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, he didn't sign up for a class ring. ``Where are
you going to wear it, your big toe?'' somebody asked.
</P>
<P>
   Such taunts drove him to excel. He learned to throw a baseball
and swim. At 14, he won a bronze medal in a diving competition. He
tagged along with other kids. He slicked back his hair and dressed
in black leather, like Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a tough kid,'' he says. ``I lost most of the fights, but
that wasn't the issue. Standing up was the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He attended college for two years in Bay City, Mich., and moved
around, working in California, Oregon, Idaho and New Jersey before
moving to Chapel Hill. His jobs ranged from driving a delivery
truck to doing custodial work at a community college.
</P>
<P>
   As a driver for Estes' company, which designs shoe stores,
Ravellette drove from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, across the Rockies to
Missoula, Mont. He made the treacherous trip in a blizzard one
night in 1972, peering through a quarter-size clearing in the
windshield and keeping an eye on the roadside reflectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one extraordinary thing about Marty a boy with no
arms,'' Ravellette told a UNC journalism class last fall. ``I saw
somebody that was normal. ... I thought I could do anything. ... My
fearlessness pushed me.''
</P>
<P>
   One student, Colleen Kenny, was so moved that she wrote to
Ravellette.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the very best kind of teacher _ the kind who teaches
through living example.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravellette keeps that letter as a reminder that some people can
look past his disability. ``If I can be that kind of example,'' he
says, ``then I have been blessed.''

 &HT;    Sci-fi fans find others of their world
 &HT;    By Kirk Kicklighter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The downtown Hyatt Regency was awash in a sea of black T-shirts
and Klingon garb Thursday morning as ``Star Trek'' fans waded
through the lobby. In the corner atrium bar a Xena princess
look-alike shared a gin and tonic with a vampire. And everywhere
phasers and light sabers were holstered in a peaceful celebration
of the joys of sciencee screening of a recent documentary film,
``Trekkies,'' that pokes fun at the ``Star Trek'' faithful. The
film depicts the extremes of Trekkie devotion, from people who
enroll in summer camps to learn the Klingon language to a
middle-aged man who dresses in Star Ship Enterprise garb for weekly
trips to the supermarket. At one point in the film, Brent Spiner,
the actor who played the android Data on ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation,'' observes: ``I don't think I've ever met anyone, `Star
Trek' fan or not, who wasn't peculiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, perhaps, the audience cheered. ``Who has seen
someone very close to themselves in the movie so far?'' asked Eric
Watts as he led a group discussion of the film. A few hands were
raised. ``We know that people are apt to make fun of us, and that's
part of what the movie is about,'' said Doug Cassell, 30, of
Spartanburg, S.C. ``We're not stupid. What's stupid is watching
baseball night after night on TBS.'' The ``Star Trek'' shows always
communicated the universal truth that it doesn't take an alien land
to make one feel like an alien. Trekkies and their science-fiction
brethren at DragonCon have long known they don't quite fit in at
the office or at home, but they feel at home with one another
through ``Star Trek.'' In the end, say the Trekkies, their fandom
is more about community than about weirdness. As Trekkies
themselves are quick to point out, most people are drawn to
something that just grabs them. Is a panel discussion dissecting
the minutiae of ``Star Trek Voyager'' any more bizarre than an
academic symposium on asceticism in early 19th-century New England?
</P>
<P>
   Watts, 38, a crew-cut graphic designer from Marietta, has been a
``Star Trek'' fan since 1977 and has helped organize the ``Star
Trek'' programming for DragonCon since 1993. This year's convention
offers 25 ``Trek''-oriented events, including a panel discussion on
writing ``Star Trek'' episodes and serialized novels, a Miss
Klingon Empire Beauty Pageant and a conversation with actor Walter
Koenig, who played Pavel Chekov in the original series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year we were here at DragonCon we had a seminar
called `Get a Life _ the Deranged Trekkie,'''said Watts. ``The
truth is, 98 percent of all sci-fi fandom is relatively normal.
It's the other 2 percent that gets all the press attention.''
</P>
<P>
   For Watts, ``Star Trek'' does what all good art as entertainment
does: shed light on real life. ``The original `Trek' always had a
moral in each episode and actually made commentary on social
issues,'' said Watts. ``Like the famous early episode where Frank
Gorshin played an alien who was half black and half white ... that
was `Star Trek' tackling race, and in the '60s no less.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek,'' despite decades of change, still teaches that
there really is a right way to do things, that humans and aliens
have to communicate to understand each other, and that honor and
bravery still count for something in a cruel, impersonal galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this might sound strange, but `Star Trek' helped me
learn how to calm myself down when I'm really upset,'' said Mirrani
Houpe, 22, a preschool teacher from Chapel Hill, N.C. ``Because in
the episodes, you learn that losing your cool only leads to
trouble.''

   Houpe left Chapel Hill at 3 a.m. on Tuesday to reach Atlanta in
time for the DragonCon volunteer orientation. Like many younger
Trekkies, she has been a fan all her life, taking over the Trekkie
mantle from her parents. ``When I was an infant, they would put me
in front of `Star Trek' on TV to keep me from crying,'' she said.
``I started taping episodes when I was in first grade.'' But being
a Trekkie hasn't always been a smooth ride for Houpe. ``I had a
really hard time in school. I wore (`Star Trek') T-shirts and had
my notebooks decorated with all this stuff,'' she said. ``And, of
course, kids made fun of me. But it was part of me. Now my
co-workers are like `Why?,' and I say, `Look, you go home and you
take care of your kids or whatever you do, and I'll do my ``Star
Trek'' thing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Houpe said being among Trekkies is like being in a parallel
world where everyone can exchange their everyday masks for a
Trekkie cloak. ``These people don't try to be cool. They're not
interested in being cool ... or respected,'' she said. ``They're
interested in being with each other.''
</P>

   DragonCon runs through Sunday in the Hyatt Regency at Peachtree
Center. Tickets are available from Ticketmaster, 404-249-6400, or

 &HT;    Led by their spry, personable president, Mormons are moving into
the religious spotlight'

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Gordon Hinckley is a pixie of a prophet
determinedly leading his people into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   A small, wiry man with a mischievous gleam and a self-effacing
humor, Hinckley serves as president, seer and ``revelator'' of
almost 11 million Latter-day Saints worldwide. He is considered the
latest successor of Joseph Smith, who reported having a vision in
1823 of an angel named Moroni who led him to a hill in New York
state where he was shown goldlike plates engraved with ancient
records that were pulled together as the Book of Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   Today, from this future Olympic city dominated by a temple with
a shining gold Moroni on its spire, Hinckley has become a public
persona in a faith whose elderly leaders have often seemed as
somber and standoffish as Cold War Soviet premiers.
</P>
<P>
   One week ago, Hinckley stood on a stage in his church's new
state-of-the-art Conference Center with purple, pink and white
fresh-flower leis around his neck and welcomed a crowd of 21,000
ecumenical leaders and faithful members of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints to his 90th birthday party. Hundreds of
Mormons lined the wall around Temple Square, hoping for admission.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was a tribute to the evening's entertainment, which
featured a constellation of stars that included Mormon convert and
Atlanta native Gladys Knight, Pip-less on this night _ and to
Hinckley himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so much a man of the people. He's so endearing, church
members just adore him,'' said Carolyn Moore, 26, a Mormon eating
lunch in Temple Square the day of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's very influential not just inside the church but
outside the church as well,'' said Jed Rogers, 21, who recently
returned to Utah from a two-year mission in Costa Rica. ``I do know
that he's a prophet of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The party, described by Hinckley as his ``gift back to the
community,'' was just another in a long list of ways Hinckley is
adding new openness to this American-born faith.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming president in 1995, he's addressed the National
Press Club and the Religion Newswriters Association, chatted twice
on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' and been grilled by the legendary Mike
Wallace of ``60 Minutes.'' Wallace was so impressed that he wrote
an introduction to Hinckley's new book, ``Standing for Something''
(Times Books, $24). It hit the best-seller list of Publishers
Weekly, the trade magazine of the book industry, on his birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My `60 Minutes' colleagues and I learned, from the time we
spent with Gordon Hinckley and his wife, from his staff, and from
other Mormons who talked to us, that this warm and thoughtful and
decent and optimistic leader of the Mormon Church fully deserves
the almost universal admiration that he gets,'' Wallace wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ostling, formerly of Time magazine and now a religion
writer for The Associated Press, compares Hinckley to Pope John
Paul II. ``Both men have strengthened their office by taking it
worldwide and raising the profile of the office,'' said Ostling,
who with his wife, Joan, wrote ``Mormon America,'' published last
year by HarperSanFrancisco ($26).
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley is ``by far the most-traveled president ever,'' Ostling
said. Hinckley has dedicated Mormon temples in Hong Kong, Alaska,
Mexico, Spain, England, Colombia, Canada, Hawaii and Bolivia, and
toured New Zealand, Australia, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Zimbabwe,
South Africa, Indonesia, the Pacific Rim and many American cities,
including Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Atlanta,'' he said, ``but we don't always love that
airport.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems to draw strength from the people he visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Darwin, Australia, and there were about 250 people at
the airport,'' he said in a birthday interview with The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. ``They're not visited very often by
authorities of the church. To be there with them and see their
steadfast devotion becomes a very moving thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the church, Hinckley will probably be remembered for his
vast building program, Ostling predicted. Besides the new
21,000-seat Conference Center, Hinckley has announced new temples
around the globe, including several smaller temples in various
degrees of completion in the Southeast _ Nashville; Birmingham;
Memphis; Columbia; Raleigh-Durham; Baton Rouge, La.; and
Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Rites of the faith
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Mormons from across the Southeast traveled to
the Atlanta temple in Sandy Springs, dedicated in 1983, to perform
the sacred rites of the faith _ the ``sealing'' of marriages so
that, according to Mormon theology, the relationship of husband,
wife and children will last through eternity, and the baptism by
proxy of the dead, who are believed by Mormons to be able to decide
after death to become part of the church.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning behind the temple building boom is simple,
Hinckley said: ``To get the temples near the people so they don't
have to travel so far.''
</P>
<P>
   In another effort to take the faith to the people, Hinckley
established a presidency office in Atlanta _ the first in North
America outside Salt Lake City. It serves a portion of the United
States that includes about 280,000 church members and the
Caribbean, where Mormonism is growing rapidly. Metro Atlanta itself
has 54 congregations, with about 25,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done this as an experiment to see how it would work,''
he said. If the Southeast office is deemed successful, other
regional U.S. presidencies will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Two-pronged approach
</P>
<P>
   Jan Shipps, a United Methodist scholar who has studied the
Latter-day Saints for 40 years, sees larger implications in the
decentralization of the church. By placing temples in more
communities, she said, Hinckley is reminding Mormons of their
distinctiveness from traditional Christians while also emphasizing
their commonalities.
</P>
<P>
   Shipps points to the church's logo, changed by Hinckley a few
months after he took office, to make the words Jesus Christ in the
church's name much larger than ``The Church of'' or ``of Latter-day
Saints.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The implications are extraordinary,'' she said. ``Not only is
it bringing Mormons into the Christian fold, it represents a shift
in what is in church publications.''
</P>
<P>
   Latter-day Saints magazines and newsletters used to emphasize
the Mormon pioneers and church leaders, who fled harassment and
persecution, going from New York to Ohio, then Missouri, Illinois
and finally, after Joseph Smith was executed by a mob, to Utah.
Now, said Shipps, ``instead of stories about early Mormons, they
have stories about (Jesus') disciples. That's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Through aggressive proselytizing, Mormons have swelled their
rolls with converts from traditional Christian groups who are
comfortable with the church's direction, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Hinckley wanted to make sure that the core
of Mormon theology was not diluted.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons reject ``original sin,'' the idea that mankind inherited
sin from Adam and Eve, the first human beings. They teach that the
Book of Mormon is sacred scripture. They recognize a Mother God as
well as a Heavenly Father, but they do not pray to her.
</P>
<P>
   Their doctrine says that all humans existed as spirits before
their earthly conceptions, that they came to Earth to fulfill a
divine plan, and that they can eventually become gods and goddesses
if they know the right signs, rituals and passwords, which are
taught in special temple rites.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are welcome at regular Sunday church services held in
neighborhood ``wards'' or churches, but the temple is open only to
Mormons in good standing whose leaders have issued a ``recommend''
affirming that they tithe and live by the social regulations of the
church. To enter, they dress in white _ including their
``garments,'' special underwear worn next to the skin as a reminder
of their faith. Once issued the garments at the temple, they wear
them for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   If Mormons did not have temples to remind them of these things,
``I think there would have been a drift to have Mormons move into a
sort of pan-Protestantism,'' said Shipps.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with their strong emphasis on the traditional family,
prohibition of abortion and disapproval of homosexual
relationships, they have a great deal in common with the
evangelical Protestants who are their loudest critics
theologically. Some groups that call them a cult are lobbying
beside them for the same causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we can work with other people on many causes of great
importance to all of us without in any way giving up our other
beliefs and standards,'' said Hinckley. ``We can disagree without
being disagreeable.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversial past
</P>
<P>
   Mormons are not helped in the traditional Christian world by
their church's history _ which included the practice of polygamy in
the church's earliest days, now prohibited, and its refusal for
years to allow black men into a priesthood open to all white men
but no women. While bringing new attention to some of the church's
historic sites in New York, Illinois and Ohio, Hinckley has been
quick to distance the church from the more controversial aspects of
its past.
</P>
<P>
   He is aided in his efforts by his understanding of public
relations and of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley was born June 23, 1910, in Salt Lake City, the son of
Latter-day Saints and the descendant of a governor of the Plymouth
Colony.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment of epiphany shortly after he was ordained a deacon,
as is customary for a Mormon boy of 12, ``there came into my young
heart a conviction that's never left me'' of the truth of Joseph
Smith's teachings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Climb up the ladder
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, he carried newspapers for the Deseret News, a Salt
Lake City daily owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day
Saints; went on to the University of Utah, did missionary service
in Great Britain, and married his high school sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Salt Lake City, in the mid-1930s, he was
immediately drafted by then-church President Heber Grant to
organize what became the church's public affairs department. For 20
years, he directed all the church's public communications. Moving
up the church ladder, he was called to the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles _ the church's top body of leaders _ in 1961. He served as
a counselor to past presidents of the church from the early 1980s
until 1995, when he succeeded the late Howard Hunter, who lived
only a short time after becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Senior management
</P>
<P>
   Because of the church's system of making the senior apostle its
president, its top leader is often infirm or has a very short
tenure, said Shipps. ``There's not an extended period of time when
you can be an effective leader.''
</P>
<P>
   As a bright and vigorous man despite his age, Hinckley served as
a sort of shadow leader to several previous presidents, she said.
``He could hit the ground running as president of the church
because he knew everybody and he had been able to see what was
happening in the church.''
</P>
<P>
   His personality contributed to his effectiveness, she said.
``He's a wonderful, interesting person, a charming man.''
</P>
<P>
   While adding a new openness to some aspects of the church, he
has toed the line on its conservative social positions and, under
his leadership, some dissident scholars and miscreants have found
themselves excommunicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our doctrine is clear-cut,'' said Hinckley. ``It's clean. It's
straightforward. We know what's good and what's bad, what's right
and what's wrong. If people run seriously afoul of that doctrine,
we discipline them _ but always in a spirit of love.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic showcase
</P>
<P>
   With people of many religious backgrounds and ethnicities coming
to town for the 2002 Winter Olympics, Salt Lake City will be on
display as never before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope in the natural process of that great event, people will
have the opportunity to observe the church, to see its programs,''
said Hinckley. ``We want to be good hosts.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to be around in 2002 and long afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Basking in the smashing success of his 90th birthday bash,
Hinckley exclaimed, ``What a birthday party this has been! There's
never been one like it before. I don't think there'll ever be one
like it again unless I can make it to 100.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd applauded and cheered.

 &HT;    Whitehouse gets new `do' for 200th birthday
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mary Trevor steps through the spiked iron gate into
Pennsylvania Avenue and the noontime sauna of a D.C. summer. She
has just toured the White House, and the president's place met with
her approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't too formal, and yet ... dignified,'' says the
Clevelander, accompanied by a son-in-law and two grandchildren.
``I've seen many of the palaces of Europe, but this was something
really different. Very American.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the White House _ celebrating its bicentennial with
special lectures, exhibitions and festivities _ is even more
American in its style of operation than its decor. Because ``it
belongs to you, the people'' (as President Clinton says in a
documentary film at the White House Visitor Center, a separate
building a couple of blocks away), the house is more open to public
view than any national leader's residence in the world. Tours are
free.
</P>
<P>
   Never to return, of course, is the down-home hospitality of
Andrew Jackson _ who in 1837 placed a 1,400-pound cheese in the
grand foyer for all Washingtonians, dooming several carpets _ but
you can still get an intimate sense of the people who lived here.
Gazing at their portraits, strolling through immaculate rooms that
seem to have arrived by time machine a minute earlier, scanning the
18-acre grounds that soothe the city's center like a cool cloth on
a fevered forehead, you take a little voyage into the past.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps even get a clearer focus on what America is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House is the nation's common homestead; we're all
drawn there,'' says William Seale, the house's official historian.
``It has constantly changed, and yet Lincoln would have no trouble
finding his way around. Even for George Washington (who approved
the building's plans but never got to live there), the house would
be the one thing in the city he'd recognize.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every American recognizes the image, too, and yet the
house itself surprises you. It's beautiful in a way different from
what you'd expect: not the gleaming snow-white temple of power seen
in photographs but a real house for real people, with a creamier
color, softer glow. Looking between the brooding elms, ashes and
beeches on the front grounds, you see the time-roughened texture of
the sandstone walls and realize that this place is old. Fragile,
even.
</P>
<P>
   And yet ready for its 1.25 million annual visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house,'' Seale says, ``is probably in its spiffiest
condition ever, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   'Twas not always so. The White House has had its spells of chaos
as well as splendor.
</P>
<P>
   It was designed, on the model of English country houses, by the
Irish-born James Hoban, who spent his early career in Charleston,
S.C. His design beat the proposal by an anonymous architect
believed to be Thomas Jefferson. The house that Washington
approved, of which John Adams became the first occupant on Nov. 1,
1800, was only a fifth as large as what Hoban originally designed,
but would remain the nation's largest residence until after the
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The house was gutted by a fire set by British troops in 1814;
only a miraculously timed rainstorm saved the stone shell. James
Monroe's rebuilt interior was stately. But the house's style varied
widely with the tastes of presidents and first ladies. Says Seale,
``Some of them were not interested in a showplace. In the pictures
you see rocking chairs, straw mats _ downright tatty.''
</P>
<P>
   When Union troops clogged the city, Lincoln let some flop on the
East Room floor. Grant and Hayes slathered the place with heavy
ornamentation derided as ``Steamboat Gothic.'' Chester A. Arthur
set Louis Tiffany loose in the house, but few of the designer's
contributions remain.
</P>
<P>
   It was Theodore Roosevelt in 1902 who made the most additions
(including the West Wing, with its Oval Office and executive work
rooms, not on the tours) and the most sweeping renovations to date.
He set the simple but elegant tone that remains today. ``T.R.'' _
who added the lamp that hangs beneath the north portico like a
magnificent pendant at a queen's throat _ is vividly captured in
the John Singer Sargent portrait in the East Room.
</P>
<P>
   The house was gutted again in 1948 _ on purpose. Truman moved
his family out for four years to restore the badly aging interior
and reinforce the walls with steel because, in Seale's words,
``Harry was very conscious of The Bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the style and upkeep kept fluctuating is that
the house's budget ``is inadequate for its needs and has always
been a political football,'' says Neil W. Horstman of the White
House Historical Association (a private nonprofit educational group
nurtured by Jacqueline Kennedy at its founding in 1961).
</P>
<P>
   From Monroe's French furniture to Nancy Reagan's china, White
House expenditures attract bitter jibes from Congress and the
press. So Mrs. Reagan established an endowment fund, a nonprofit
subsidiary of the association, which now stands at $30 million. In
recent years, the sumptuous refurbishment of the Blue Room in
Monroe's original choice of Empire style, and a new dining table
for the State Dining Room, were paid for by the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest changes in life at the White House involve security.
How could the cheese-doling Jackson in 1837 have foreseen some nut
flying his plane into the South Lawn? Visitors on the tour must
laboriously pass through metal detectors, though tour rooms are
remarkably free of visible security agents. (The great majority of
the 3,000 people who work in the White House daily are involved in
security, many stationed in underground rooms.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, tours are set up so that you can't hope for even
a distant glimpse of the president and his family. It's a far cry
from 1889, when Caroline (Mrs. Benjamin) Harrison complained of
``the circus atmosphere'': visitors wandering uninvited into the
family quarters (which occupy the top two floors) to gawk. Though
these private quarters and related rooms (including a bowling
alley, putting green, dentist's office and beauty parlor) are off
limits to tours, Seale says you're not missing much: ``Imagine a
high-end but fairly typical 1920s hotel,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Tour guides, then, try to provide some sense of the living
executive presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president came down just a few minutes ago, for meetings
in the West Wing,'' says the amiable Secret Service guide leading a
recent early-morning tour. ``He'll receive Mr. Arafat at noon in
the East Room, so that room won't be included on the tour today.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the grim business of presidential safety is more
evident. In 1995 the Secret Service closed Pennsylvania Avenue on
the north and E Street on the south to traffic for a block on
either side of the White House. Though pedestrians can still walk
right up to the spiked iron fence (kids love to hang on it) to
shoot pictures, the area has become depressingly ugly. Police
barriers of concrete and orange plastic make it look like a war
zone. There is a plan to transform these blockaded areas into
beautiful pedestrian malls, but it's stalled in political wrangling
and is not expected to get moving until a new adminstration takes
power next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dose of reality when you come out of that beautiful
house,'' says Kevin Trimble of Stockton, Calif. ``A sad commentary
on our world today.''
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, as a motorcade was assembling on the closed
section of Pennsylvania, Secret Service agents could be seen in the
open back of a van, wearing riot gear and holding M-16 rifles.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, at other oments, the White House's essential
timelessness shines through.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in the late twilight of summer, with the
pedestrian traffic winding down and the chandeliers twinkling
softly through the tall windows, one imagines the life inside, down
through the years. T.R. chasing his kids through the hallways.
John-John peeking from beneath JFK's desk. Nixon, and later
Clinton, tensely hunkered, waiting for news of possible
impeachment. ...
</P>
<P>
   And over there, on the northwest corner of the lawn, is an odd
sight: a collection of tall, bent, canvas-covered objects. They're
the lighting scaffolds for the TV correspondents who pose in front
of the White House, covered against a misting rain.
</P>
<P>
   And there, hopping to and fro among the steel stanchions _
oblivious of who's in, or out, of the big old house _ are
squirrels.
</P>
<P>

   &QR;  East Colonnade: As visitors file down this airy passage, they
view the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, featuring Hillary Rodham
Clinton's arrangement of 20th century American sculpture. Guests
continue into a holding area that might be called the Hall of Jowls
for its grand portraits of presidents Fillmore, Arthur and Taft.
One may buy souvenirs (glittering White House Christmas ornaments:
$11) while waiting to be led by guides in groups of 25.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ground-floor corridor: Edith (Mrs. Theodore) Roosevelt decreed
that first ladies' portraits be placed here. Nancy Reagan looks
sleek and thoughtful in scarlet; Rosalynn Carter, soulful in
lavender.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Library: Used as a laundry room by Abigail Adams, converted to
a library in Theodore Roosevelt's 1902 renovation. It's a cozy,
gray and rose, Federal-style room, but you sense that no one's
cracked a book here since Woodrow Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  China Room: Quick: Know anything about Rutherford B. Hayes?
Now you do: His 1879 china, painted with such American fauna as
wild turkeys, is the house's most flamboyant.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Diplomatic reception room: Gold-and-white Federal decor. Scene
of FDR's fireside chats (there are 28 working fireplaces in the
house). Entrance/exit for the Marine 1 helicopter pad on the South
Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  East Room: The House's largest room, gold and white, scene of
receptions and musicales. The Gilbert Stuart portrait of Washington
(model for the dollar bill) is the last remaining object from the
original 1800 house. Seven presidents lay in state here. Check out
the chunky, Deco-ish eagles supporting the 1938 Steinway grand
piano.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Green Room: It's been green ever since the Monroes rebuilt the
house and made this their card room (favorite game: whist) in 1817.
Several fine early-1800s pieces by Duncan Phyfe, the Scottish-born
cabinetmaker.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Blue Room: An oval reception room recently returned to the
French Empire style chosen by the Monroes in 1817. Chandelier is
removed to make room for the first family's Christmas tree. In
Rembrandt Peale's portrait, Jefferson's eyes glitter with benign
intelligence, while the third prez's domed memorial can be seen
through the windows, across the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Red Room: Empire style; carved lions, dolphins, lyres. Used
for teas, the room has a velvet-backed fireplace shield that was
used to keep ladies' wax-based makeup from melting.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  State Dining Room: Dominated by the 1869 portrait of a
contemplative Lincoln. Arranged with up to 14 tables set for 10
people each. (Additional guests must settle for the vice president
in the Red Room).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Grand foyer, Cross Hall: English cut-glass chandeliers from
1775; marble walls and floors from the Truman renovation. First
family descends the Grand Staircase on state occasions. This
impressive space is also what might be called the Hall of Mediocre
Portraits: likenesses of Ford, Bush and Reagan that seem to be the
work of disgruntled Democrats. The warmth of Jimmy Carter, however,
is well-captured in Herbert E. Abrams' portrait.

<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ A late summer morning and the sun was already
harsh on the dusty high school football field. The shirtless blond
19-year-old in shorts stained with sweat kept dropping back to
pass, his hands at times so wet it was hard to grip the ball. He
was throwing to a friend, working ``up the ladder,'' as it is
called, starting with short passes and ending long.
</P>
<P>
   But his mind wasn't totally on his receiver. He could feel the
eyes of the man in the dark glasses who sat in a car on the other
side of a chain-link fence, a hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
   The boy knew the man was watching. It had been subtly arranged.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association does not allow
tryouts, but if a college coach happens by a field where kids
regularly throw the ball around, well, a coach may argue, where's
the harm?
</P>
<P>
   At that time, in July 1996, Southern University, a football
powerhouse among black colleges, desperately needed a quarterback,
and the boy, Marcus Jacoby, badly needed a place to play
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   After half an hour, the man in dark glasses, Mark Orlando,
Southern's offensive coordinator, had seen enough and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   It had gone well. The boy was invited to the coach's apartment,
where after a short visit he was offered a full football
scholarship. The coach explained that the boy had a shot at the
starting job, that the presumed starter had flunked off the team
and that the two remaining backups did not have the coaches'
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds good,'' said Jacoby, who had been a star at Catholic
High, one of Baton Rouge's schoolboy powers. ``But I have to think
about it _ talk with my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Jacoby was unaware that if he accepted the scholarship,
he would be the first white to play quarterback for Southern
University. And he would be the first white ever to start at
quarterback in the 76-year history of the black Southwestern
Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby had grown up in Baton Rouge, and yet he knew practically
nothing about Southern, had never even been to the other side of
town to see the campus. Until that July day, he had spent his life
surrounded by whites.
</P>
<P>
   THE BUSINESS OF HOW TO SUCCEED
</P>
<P>
   In three his years as Southern's head coach, Pete Richardson had
turned a laughingstock of a program into a national force. Southern
won 11 of 12 games his first year, 1993, and two years later it was
the No. 1 black college in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy for a black man to become a head coach. Despite
his record, Richardson, 54, has never had an offer from a Division
I college; only three of those 500 institutions have black head
football coaches. Instead he worked his way around the black
college circuit, serving as an assistant in Texas and Arkansas,
then taking the head coach's job at Winston-Salem State in North
Carolina, and finally, in 1993, getting his big break at Southern,
the largest historically black college in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and Marcus' parents, Glen and Marian Jacoby,
discussed everything from Southern's rich athletic tradition to the
engineering courses that interested Marcus, but for a long while
they didn't mention the thing that worried the parents most. The
quarterback is the team leader. Would a black team accept a white
leader? Would the black campus?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it will be that big a deal,'' said
Richardson. ``Sure, there will be some adjustments from all sides.
But Marcus will have the backing of the administration as well as
the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson pointed out that there were other minorities on
campus. He meant that of the 10,500 students, 5 percent were not
black, but what Mrs. Jacoby kept thinking about was how it would
feel to be in a stadium with her husband and 30,000 black fans.
</P>
<P>
   The coach didn't say it to the Jacobys, but no one knew better
than he about the strain that Marcus would feel being a minority.
As a successful black man, Richardson was used to the stares of
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   When he coached at Winston-Salem, he had a state government car.
``Whites look at you and ask you what you're doing driving the
state's car,'' he said. ``You pull over to get some gas and people
will address you the wrong way or policemen will look at you
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach thought he could make this Jacoby thing work. He
wasn't sitting there fretting whether Marcus could learn to be a
minority. There was no time for that. The first game was six weeks
away. As he would say later, his first-string quarterback had
flunked out and he didn't have ``ample time to find another black
quarterback.'' Marcus would have to do what all good football
players did, what Richardson himself had done: suck it up.
</P>
<P>
   To reassure the Jacobys, the coach told them about his staff. Of
six assistants he had hired when he started in 1993, two were
white, one Asian. He was told that Southern fans would never stand
for that. But after his 11-1 debut season _ the year before they
had been 6-5 _ a popular T-shirt on campus featured a photo of the
integrated staff, with the words ``In Living Color.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning, Richardson knew, often made problems go away. ``I don't
care what color Marcus is,'' Richardson said. ``If I believe he can
help our football team, I want him.''
</P>
<P>
   HARD WORK OR PRIVILEGE?
</P>
<P>
   From the Jacobys' home, in the upper-middle class white Tara
section of Baton Rouge, Southern was a 20-minute car trip,
literally to the other side of the tracks. As Marcus drove to the
first practice, he began imagining himself playing a game, he
recalled. ``Would I see a white face?''
</P>
<P>
   Southern's decision to sign a white quarterback made headlines,
first locally, then nationally, and the reaction of some whites he
knew startled him. When Jacoby called his girlfriend to talk about
it, her mother answered. ``The niggers over there will kill you,''
he recalled her saying. ``There are bullets flying all over the
place. It's a war zone.'' When his girlfriend got on the phone, she
said, ``Marcus, I don't want you to call me again.''
</P>
<P>
   To many on the white side of town, who had never visited this
campus bustling with middle-class black students on the bluffs of
the Mississippi, it was as if Jacoby had voluntarily moved to the
ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern coaches were impressed with Jacoby's arm and had
never seen a quarterback learn Richardson's complex offense so
fast. The other quarterback hopefuls would leave practice at 6, but
Jacoby stayed to do extra throwing and often studied game films
well past midnight. Within days of arriving, he was first-string.
</P>
<P>
   That sparked anger among many of his new black teammates. For
more than a year they had been friendly with the two quarterbacks
now relegated to backup, and they resented the newcomer,
complaining that he had not earned his stripes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several felt the decision was racial. ``It just became the fact
that we were going to have this white quarterback,'' said Sam
George, a quarterback prospect who was academically ineligible that
year. ``It wasn't about ability no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the coaches, Jacoby was isolated. In the locker room,
he recalled, ``I would walk around the corner and people would just
stop talking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day at lunch,'' he said, ``I'd sit down at a table full
of guys without being invited and they would continue their
conversations as if I wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the huddles there was dissension. Scott Cloman, a
Southern receiver, recalled: ``The minute Marcus was like,
`Everybody calm down, just shut up,' they were like: `Who are you
talking to? You're not talking to me.' You know, stuff like that.
If it was a black person it wouldn't be a problem. They all felt
that `I'm not going to let a white person talk to me like that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His entire time at Southern, Jacoby kept his feelings about all
this inside, sucking it up, repeatedly telling the stream of
inquiring reporters what a great experience it was being exposed to
a new culture. ``As soon as I signed and walked onto the campus,''
he said to one interviewer, ``I felt like part of the family. I
definitely feel at home here.''
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL AND STUDENTS IN STEP
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, 1996, six weeks after Jacoby arrived, Southern
opened its season away, at Northwestern State, with him at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Morgan, a supervisor at the local Exxon plant who attended
Southern in the 1960s, is one of many middle-aged black men who
rarely miss a practice, let alone a game. His wife, his mother and
his aunt graduated from Southern, too, as did 25 other relatives.
And now, his son Jabari, a drummer, who had dreamed of being in the
famous Southern band since he was a little boy, was out there
marching for the first time, a freshman living out his fantasy on
that same September day.
</P>
<P>
   Families like the Morgans were fiercely proud of their school
and its role in helping generations of blacks into the middle and
professional classes _ even if the state had long treated it as
second-rate.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern had become the flagship of the nation's largest
historically black public university system, with 15,000 students
on three campuses.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, change was brewing. The year before Jacoby
arrived, Southern and LSU settled a 20-year-old federal
desegregation lawsuit. LSU pledged to double its black enrollment;
Southern pledged to double its nonblack enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni like the Morgans worried. Would Southern soon become just
another satellite campus of LSU? Were black public colleges facing
extinction? Was the white quarterback the beginning of the end?
</P>
<P>
   But Jabari could not have cared less, he was so consumed with
the band. It didn't matter to Jabari if Jacoby was purple, as long
as Southern won and people came to see the halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   A MUTINOUS BEGINNING
</P>
<P>
   Southern lost its first two games. The team was young _ 10 of 11
offensive starters were new _ but what people remembered was the
11-1 record from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   During the second loss, Jacoby recalls, ``I heard the entire
stadium booing me.'' Fans were yelling, ``Get the white boy out!''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Williams, a Southern offensive lineman, believed that the
opposing team hit Jacoby harder because he was white. Cloman
recalled that after one Southern loss, opposing players said,
``That's what you all get for bringing white boys on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby was hit so hard and so often the first game that he was
hospitalized with a concussion. In the school paper, a columnist
wrote about the ``Jacoby nonblocking scandal'': ``Someone should
validate or refute the current rumor that Southern's offensive line
(or some of its members) purposely missed blocks.'' But Jacoby
still believes that it was just the mistakes of an inexperienced
line.
</P>
<P>
   After Southern's second straight loss, an angry fan confronted
Jacoby and threatened him. A coach had to jump between them. For
the rest of his career, Jacoby would have a police escort at games.
</P>
<P>
   WINNING WORKS WONDERS
</P>
<P>
   Southern won six of its next seven games, beating the two
top-ranked black colleges, and was invited to the Heritage Bowl in
Atlanta, the black college championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't getting booed nearly as much,'' Jacoby said. Some
teammates began warming to him. ``Things had changed,'' he said,
``to the extent that some of the players were calling me `the
man.'''
</P>
<P>
   He felt he was developing real friendships with several
teammates and Southern students. When Cloman needed a place to stay
for a month, Jacoby had him to his parents' home and the two grew
close. ``Marcus was the first white person I ever really got to
know,'' recalled Cloman. ``I always felt a lot of tension around
whites. I'd go into a store and I could just feel the tension.
Sometimes you just feel like, `I can't stand white people.' I
didn't understand them. I really didn't want to be near them.
</P>
<P>
   ``His parents treated me like a son,'' said Cloman. Some players
now joked when they saw Cloman, ``Where's your brother?'' ``And
some,'' he said, ``called me `white lover.' Didn't bother me. I had
come to understand the Jacobys. A lot of times people fear what
they can't understand. Because of being around the Jacobys my
attitude toward whites in general changed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Heritage Bowl that first year, on national television,
Southern took a 24-10 halftime lead against Howard University, then
fell behind, 27-24. In the closing minute, Southern drove to
Howard's 15-yard line. On third down, with 42 seconds left, Jacoby
dropped back, and under pressure, threw off the wrong foot,
floating a pass into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the crowd gasp,'' he said. ``I couldn't believe this
was happening.'' He'd been intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dragged myself off the field and sat on a bench and buried
my head in my arms,'' said Jacoby.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby said a few people came by and patted him on the back, to
be encouraging. ``But I heard, `You screwed up real bad this time,
whitey.' And: `You're as dumb as they come.' It was the lowest
point of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Orlando, the defensive coordinator, who is
white, received an anonymous call: ``If Jacoby ever plays for
Southern again, we'll kill him _ and you.'' He said he had been
averaging a threat a week that season. A few weeks later as Orlando
and Jacoby left the locker room and headed to their cars, Orlando
pointed to several trees. Jacoby could see a yellow rope hung from
each tree. The ropes were tied in nooses.
</P>
<P>
   THE EYES OF SOUTHERN ARE UPON HIM
</P>
<P>
   On campus, Jacoby struggled with all the daily irritations that
go with being the minority. As a white who grew up among whites, he
was used to being inconspicuous. Here, he always felt on display.
``I hated that,'' he said, ``because it was like I had become just
a novelty act.''
</P>
<P>
   College is a place where young people are confronted with new
ideas _ sometimes only partially understood _ and encouraged to
speak out about them. And yet Jacoby felt that when he did, he was
criticized. At first, in his African American history class, when
slavery was discussed, he said he tried to be conciliatory. ``I
would say something like, `I kind of feel for you.' And it was
like, `Quit Uncle Tomming.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then he worried he wasn't being true to his white roots. ``I
felt that I had lost my pride and the respect of friends that I had
grown up with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For one oral report, he decided to speak his mind and said that
it was unhealthy for blacks to dwell too much on past racial
violence. ``There have been tragedies like slavery throughout
time,'' he said. ``I don't think one is more important than any
other.'' When he finished, he recalled, ``there was an eerie
silence and I saw at least three or four people glaring at me.''
</P>
<P>
   COMEBACK AND COMPETITION
</P>
<P>
   What got Jacoby through his second year at Southern was a
determination to avenge that Heritage Bowl interception, to show
everyone he could be a champion. He moved through the 1997 season
with a passion.
</P>
<P>
   Again, he was first string, but he had competition. Sam George
had returned from academic probation. George was a popular figure
on campus, known for his hard-partying ways. Though he was only
5'7,'' he had a strong arm and terrific speed. He excited fans with
his scrambling derring-do. ``And,'' said Scott Cloman, ``he was
black.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jacoby started, Richardson liked bringing in George when
the team seemed flat and needed a spark. Both quarterbacks saw race
as the true reason behind Richardson's substitutions. Jacoby was
convinced the coach was giving the black quarterback playing time
in order to pander to black fans; George was convinced Richardson
was starting the white quarterback as part of Southern's promise to
be more diversified.
</P>
<P>
   George wound up playing in 5 of 12 games. By Southern's third
game, against Arkansas Pine-Bluff, both quarterbacks were bitter.
After winning their first two, Southern was losing to Pine-Bluff
7-6 at the half, when Richardson decided to bring in George. Jacoby
was devastated; he felt he was a proven winner and shouldn't be
yanked for one bad half.
</P>
<P>
   George threw a last-ditch 37-yard pass on a scramble play that
tied the game, and threw another touchdown in triple overtime for a
36-33 Southern win.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, come Monday practice, Jacoby was the starter again.
George was frustrated and perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   Southern had a 9-1 record going into its two final games. A win
in the next game _ the Bayou Classic, against archrival Grambling _
would assure a return to the Heritage Bowl and a chance for Jacoby
to redeem himself.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando suggested that if Jacoby played a little more like
George, sometimes scrambling out of the pocket, he might be more
effective. Jacoby felt that he was being told to become something
he was not, but he was so desperate, so worn down and nervous about
being yanked, he followed the coach's advice. He ran as he rarely
had before, and it worked. In a 30-7 win against Grambling, Jacoby
threw three touchdowns and played the entire game. He was named the
Bayou Classic's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   A month later he achieved his football redemption, throwing the
winning touchdown pass in a 34-28 Heritage Bowl victory over South
Carolina State, capping an 11-1 season that earned Southern the
black national championship. ``I was happier than I had ever been
at Southern,'' he recalled. On the trip back from Atlanta he slept
soundly for the first time in months.
</P>
<P>
   THE GOING GETS TOUGH
</P>
<P>
   The more you achieve, the more that's expected. After that 11-1
season, the talk on campus was that Southern would go undefeated in
1998. But in the opener, trailing 7-0 at the half, Jacoby was
pulled for Sam George. Southern lost anyway, 28-7.
</P>
<P>
   In practice on Tuesday, Jacoby overthrew a pass to one of his
ends, John Forman, and Forman yelled at him in front of everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Forman would say later that it was just the frustration of
having lost the opener, but to Jacoby it was so much more, the
final straw. Forman was Sam George's roommate. He was sure Forman
was trying to subvert his control of the team to help George. He
was sure it was race. ``It was like I was right back where I had
started two years before, with a lot of the same attitudes against
me. I felt I had lost the team.''
</P>
<P>
   He quit, football and Southern.
</P>
<P>
   NO MORE APOLOGIES
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was surprised and asked Jacoby to stay. But more
recently, he said, he understood Jacoby's decision. Because of
``the type person he is,'' the coach said, ``it was the best thing
for Marcus because it would have killed him.'' Richardson meant
Jacoby just wasn't emotionally equipped to continue being the
solitary white.
</P>
<P>
   When Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers wanted to break major
league baseball's color line in 1947, he chose Jackie Robinson, not
simply because he was a great black ballplayer _ there were greater
black stars. He knew Robinson had experience inside white
institutions. Robinson was 28 that first year in the majors, a
mature man who had graduated UCLA and served in the U.S. Army.
Jackie Robinson knew what it was like to be the minority.
</P>
<P>
   When Richardson went after Jacoby, he was just looking for a
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters hounded Jacoby to find why he left, but until now, he
has never spoken openly about it. He had never mentioned race. In
brief interviews, he told them he was burned out, and in a sense
this was true. He had burned out on being the minority. And as a
white, he didn't have to be. ``You kind of look over your shoulder
and see your old life and you say, `I could go back.'''
</P>
<P>
   A white quarterback at Southern did make people think. Mo Morgan
had been against it at the start, but after watching Jacoby at
practices, he changed. ``I looked at the three quarterbacks that
were there and he was the best at the time. I'm just telling you
straight out. It wasn't his ability and I'm not saying he was
brighter than the other kids. He just put in the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby moved on to attend LSU, majoring in finance, but his
Southern experience still unsettled him. At times, he talks about
being lucky to have experienced another culture, but at other
moments, he describes it as ``two and a half years of a personal
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he appreciates walking around anonymously on the
mostly-white LSU campus. ``I got burned out as far as being
somebody,'' he said. ``At LSU, I've just enjoyed being a part of
the crowd.''

   COVER STORIES
</P>
<P>
   PATRIOTIC-SONGS (Undated) _ Kate Smith introduced ``God Bless
America'' on her radio show on Armistice Day, Nov. 11, 1938. It was
an instant sensation. Within weeks, the song was ubiquitous:
crackling across radio airwaves, sung in churches, schools and
ballparks, championed by many as a replacement national anthem for
Francis Scott Key's ungainly ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' But not
every American took solace in the skyward-striving strains of ``God
Bless America.'' In the winter of 1940, Woody Guthrie was bedeviled
by the song: everywhere he went, Kate Smith's belting seemed to
follow him; the more he heard the song, the angrier he got. Soon
came ``This Land is Your Land,'' offering a folksier reverence.
This call and response between revered troubadours is one of the
most piquant episodes in American pop music. By Jody Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   STRANGE-FRUIT-MUSIC (Undated) _ ``Strange Fruit'' may not have
been on the soundtrack as the Freedom Riders boarded buses or
college students registered black Mississippians or marchers
marched from Selma to Montgomery; ``We Shall Overcome,'' more
optimistic and upbeat, better fit the zeitgeist. But it was the
song which, by confronting racial injustice in the starkest
possible terms at a time when it simply hadn't penetrated popular
culture, inspired many to march in the first place. By David
Margolick.
</P>
<P>
   FILM
</P>
<P>
   PATRIOT-FILM (Undated) _ ``The Patriot,'' the new movie starring
Mel Gibson, will prove to many a satisfying way to spend a summer
evening. It's got big battles and wrenching hand-to-hand combat, a
courageous but conflicted hero and a dastardly and totally
guilt-free villain. There is just enough brain bran to keep the
post-film discussions from being dominated by people who want to
focus on how cool it was when Mel hit that guy with the hatchet.
Why, some may think it's the best Revolutionary War movie ever
made. Which brings us to our point: it is also one of the very few
Revolutionary War movies ever made. By Jamie Malanowski.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   FILM-MUSIC (Undated) _ The history of cinema parallels the
history of recorded music in that both have been concerned, since
the necessary technical discoveries were made at the end of the
19th century, with composing in time: composing images, and later
sounds, in film; composing sounds alone where music is concerned.
With a grand inevitability, therefore, Jean-Luc Godard's video
``Histoire(s) du Cinema'' presents itself also as ``Histoire(s) de
la Musique,'' and it is fitting that the soundtrack alone should be
available. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL-MUSIC (Undated) _ If the news is true, the record
business is not being nice to classical music. The Washington Post
reports that such respected labels as RCA Red Seal, Deutsche
Harmonia Mundi and Melodiya, all owned or distributed by the
international giant BMG, will be either shunted aside as minor
activities of the American, pop-oriented RCA label or put out of
business altogether. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-EUROPE-MUSIC (Undated) _ The book is called ``Kein' Angst,
Baby!'' (``Don't Worry, Kid!''), and it has a voluptuous Valkyrie
sizzling on the cover. Written for opera singers by opera singers
and first published in 1992 by the New York Opera Newsletter, it is
a guide to auditioning in Germany. American singers long regarded
the German audition tour as a useful _ indeed, essential _ career
move, and this book helped the uninitiated negotiate everything
from writing a letter to a German agent to dealing with German
telephones and money matters. But things have changed. German
theaters are not hiring singers as they used to. By Anne Midgette.
</P>
<P>
   SUPREMES-MUSIC (Undated) _ For a teenager living in the suburbs
of Detroit in 1964, the royals of AM radio were alarmingly obvious:
The Beatles were the imported kings of rock 'n' roll and Aretha was
the native Queen of Soul. Then along came the pop princess Diana
and her ladies in waiting, the Supremes. By David A. Keeps.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   CHAUTAUQUA-DANCE (Undated) _ In 1983, Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux,
recently retired as a principal dancer with the New York City
Ballet, was asked to take charge of the summer ballet school at the
Chautauqua Institution, a gated community of 225 acres along the
shore of Chautauqua Lake, in the northwest corner of New York
state. Bonnefoux accepted the offer and, 18 years later, can be
justly proud of his achievements. Summer by summer, he has
transformed the school into one that attracts some of the country's
best ballet students. By Roslyn Sulcas.
</P>
<P>
   ABT-DANCE (New York) _ Hats off to American Ballet Theater for a
heroic season. The repertory looked better on stage than on paper
and a clever Band-Aid approach kept performances at a high standard
despite an inordinate amount of illness and injury among the
dancers. It was the season of the unexpected. By Anna Kisselgoff.
</P>
<P>
   BOULDER-DANCE (Boulder, Colo.) _ Far from the Eastern shores of
the American Dance Festival and Jacob's Pillow, a multiplicity of
summer dance gatherings in Colorado illustrates the surprising
cultural vitality of the Rocky Mountain state as well as tensions
affecting arts presenters nationwide. Three festivals Blazing a
trail along a risky frontier is Boulder's Colorado Dance Festival,
one of America's few dance-only presenters and widely considered
one of its top three dance festivals. By Daniel Gesmer.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   STAR-TV (Los Angeles) _ Darren Star is not only one of the most
successful writer-producers on television, but also one of the most
prolific. By the fall season, he will have three shows on the air:
``Sex and the City,'' the hit comedy series that seeks to offer a
candid view of sex and relationships among some beautiful women in
Manhattan; ``The Street,'' about successful and handsome young
turks on Wall Street; and the suddenly controversial ``Grosse
Pointe,'' which is Star's tongue-in-cheek look at a teen-age
television soap opera that's very much like ``Beverly Hills,
90210.'' By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   BEGGARS-TV (Undated) _ Although Brandon Tartikoff, the legendary
NBC programming chief, did not live to see his series idea reach
the air, Showtime's ``Beggars and Choosers,'' an hour comedy about
the embattled president of a fictional flagging network, fulfills
his vision. By Hilary De Vries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   CROATIA-NIGHTSPOT (Zagreb) _ The Factory is a noisy place. By
9:30 on a Tuesday night, trails of moisture slither down the
paint-splattered walls and a fat belly of smoke hangs in the air
inside. But as crowds of fashionably dressed young Croatians gather
expectantly outside the drab, inconspicuous entrance, work could
not be further from their minds. The Factory, one of Zagreb's
trendiest nightspots, has even more to offer than bottled beer and
ubiquitous techno music: it has become one of the city's most
popular theaters. By Chloe Veltman.
</P>
<P>
   ART/ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   FLIGHT-POSTERS (Washington) _ The little-known role of posters
in popularizing flight in the early 20th century is the focus of
``Looping the Loop: Posters of Early Flight,'' the first museum
exhibition on the subject in this country, on view at the National
Air and Space Museum here through July 9. The show, which will
travel through 2002, moves next to the Thames Science Center in
Newport, R.I. (July 22 to Oct. 8), and then to the Virginia Air and
Space Center in Hampton (Oct. 29 to Jan. 7, 2001). By Rita Reif.
</P>
<P>
   INDIAN-PRINCESS-ART (Undated) _ Long before the Greco-Roman
specter of Lady Liberty arrived in New York Harbor in 1886, another
woman symbolized the United States. Sometimes known as L'Amerique,
or the Indian Princess, she was a Native American figure who first
appeared on maps in the 16th century. Wearing a feather headdress,
accompanied by a parrot and perched on an alligatorlike reptile,
she represented continental America alongside female allegories of
Europe, Asia and Africa. This early character, along with Liberty
and the lesser-known Columbia, is the subject of ``The Changing
Face of Liberty: Female Allegories of America,'' at the New-York
Historical Society through Sept. 3. The exhibition comes at a time
when native women have seen renewed popularity. By Sarah Bayliss.

<P>
   TRAVEL-IOWA-MASON-CITY (Mason City, Iowa) _ Often it seems time
has stalled in 1912, year of `The Music Man,' in Meredith Willson's
hometown, Mason City. By Douglas Martin.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-ECUADOR (Undated) _ Ecuador switches to a dollar
currency. By Larry Rohter.

   ON THE SECTION FRONT
</P>
<P>
   RENAULT (Paris) _ Louis Schweitzer is, in short, the very model
of French establishment probity. Yet he now finds himself as
chairman and chief executive of the auto giant Renault, which likes
to boast that it was built on a bet. By John Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;R-BLOCK (Undated) _ The carefully constructed image of H&AMP;R
Block as America's trusted tax preparer was marred a decade ago,
when consumer advocates accused the company of marketing advances
on customers' tax refunds at usurious interest rates. Critics said
flat fees for the two-week loans disguised annual rates as high as
250 percent. Plaintiffs' lawyers filed a host of class action
lawsuits. Block is on the verge of resolving the litigation this
month without admitting any wrongdoing. But critics of the proposed
settlement call it a sham, saying Block has effectively hired
lawyers to sue it on the company's own _ extremely favorable _
terms. By David Cay Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-WATCH (Undated) _ While all eyes are on the disappointing
action in many big-name, large-capitalization stocks, the enviable
performance of a wide swath of the stock market has been ignored.
That is the large group of stocks made up of lesser-known,
medium-sized companies with market values of between $1 billion and
$10 billion. These are known as mid-cap stocks.

   INSIDE THE SECTION:

   PROFILE-TERRY-MOLLNER (Undated) _ Profile of Terry Mollner, a
father of socially responsible investing. By Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-DINER-CONFERENCE (Providence, R.I.) _ The diner business
rarely makes owners feel as good as their customers. In fact, the
rewards of running a diner are often more sentimental than
financial. By Jane Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRONIC-BILLPAYING (Undated) _ Electronic billpaying can be a
nifty convenience, but it is fraught with consumer-protection
pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   INVESTING
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-INSIGHT-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Time flies when you're having
fun. Zip-zap, and suddenly the year is halfway over. Trouble is,
for most investors the last six months have not been a lot of
laughs. Byron R. Wien, chief U.S. investment strategist for Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, took some time last week to revisit the recent
past and to talk about the next six months. By Kenneth N. Gilpin.
</P>

burn through cash. By Sara Robinson.

<P>
   INVEST-MEDICINE (Undated) _ The deciphering of the human genome,
announced last week by public and private rival teams, promises to
change the practice of medicine in profound ways in the years and
decades to come. But for investors in medicine, whose focus may be
a bit more short term, surprisingly little changed last week. By

   FINANCIAL COMMENTARY
</P>
<P>
   CONTRARIAN-COLUMN (Undated) _ If there's a sure-fire way to sell
something these days, it's to say the thing is natural. The Natural
used to be Roy Hobbs, Bernard Malamud's mythic baseball player, but
now it's an obsession that all of us seem to share about a life we
have somehow lost. By Daniel Akst.

   STRATEGIES-COLUMN (Undated) _ Investors who follow hot-handed
investment advisers may get burned.

<P>
   SENIOR-COLUMN (Undated) _ The demographics of Madison Avenue are
increasingly out of synch with those of consumer buying power, and
it shows in how little marketing is done to the 50-plus crowd. In
and over. By Fred Brock.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY-MEDICINE-COLUMN (Undated) _ Money &AMP; Medicine: Report on
doctors who turn their backs on managed care, and what becomes of
them. By Jennifer Steinhauer
</P>
<P>
   ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ It is no secret that the rivalry between
the software leaders, Microsoft and Oracle, is bitter. Still, the
acknowledgement last week by Oracle that it financed a series of
escapades intended to embarrass Microsoft provided some lively
summer entertainment _ especially a Keystone Kops caper in which
private investigators offered office cleaners $1,200 for the
contents of a pro-Microsoft trade group's wastebaskets. By Steve
Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   AUTOS
</P>
<P>
   BOSS-HOSS (Undated) _ Monte Warne is a down-home Renaissance
man, a Michelangelo of machinery: A licensed aircraft and
airplane-engine mechanic, an aircraft designer, a licensed private,
commercial and crop-duster pilot, a lifelong motorcyclist and a
former motorcycle and car racer. So whatever possessed him to build
the outrageous Boss Hoss, a motorcycle with a Corvette V-8 engine?
By Jim McCraw.

   CAMPAIGN-COOKIES (Washington) _ Most of this year's presidential
campaign has dealt with the candidates' positions on campaign
financing, Social Security and helping the uninsured. Now it is
time to deal with what really matters _ whose wife bakes the best
cookies. You know, family values. And the 2000 presidential cookie
contest pits chocolate chips, pecans and coconut against ginger and
molasses. The odds favor the ones with the chocolate chips; with
recipes. By Marian Burros.
</P>
<P>
   PUSH-UP-BRAS (Undated) _ Six years ago, when the British-made
Wonderbra was introduced in this country, push-up bras accounted
for about 3 percent of the $4.6 billion bra business; today that
figure is closer to 10 percent. Underwear makers are rolling out
push-up bras with the sort of hoo-ha usually reserved for movie
openings, and their arrivals in department stores are being
attended with the frenzy of a Meet-The-Beatles tour. By Penelope
Green.
</P>
<P>
   DOCTORS-MARKETING (Undated) _ Like hair colorists, fashion
designers and chefs, more and more doctors are seeking publicity to
build their businesses. Freed of legal constraints that prohibited
them from advertising and faced with shrinking incomes in the age
of managed care, they are aggressively marketing themselves as
experts on beauty and health in magazines like Vogue, Harper's
Bazaar, Elle, Self and Good Housekeeping and on television shows
like ``Today,'' where they reach millions who are willing to pay
for elective medical treatments. By Anne Jarrell.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Maybe there's an up side to the
climate change that spells warmer, drier weather for the East
Coast: lavender. By Anne Raver.
</P>
<P>
   DUMMY-FILMING (New York) _ The tale of Steven Schoichet, a
maladroit suburbanite whose life is transformed when he comes into
possession of a ventriloquist's prop, ``Dummy'' is the kind of
movie Charlie McCarthy might have starred in if Michael Ovitz had
been his agent. Nearly everyone else in the film is a client of
Ovitz's firm, Artists Management Group, a noncoincidence that helps
explain how a script by an obscure writer with a budget that
wouldn't buy a two-bedroom in Manhattan happened to get this far.
By Guy Trebay.
</P>
<P>
   NY-APARTMENT (New York) _ The sight of the couple draped across
the bed engaged in cozy pillow talk was more than a little
discomfitting. Stumbling on the scene, one wasn't sure whether to
eavesdrop, look the other way or join the lovebirds on the sheets.
Convincing as it was, this slice of life was in fact a performance,
enacted by models and staged at a party at the Apartment, a
strenuously hip fashion and home furnishings store masquerading as
a private residence. By Ruth La Ferla.

<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-TERM-REVIEW (Washington) _ It was a Supreme Court term of
surpassing interest, rich in symbol and substance, a vivid reminder
of the court's power to scramble settled expectations, put old
questions to rest and, ultimately, to have the last word. By Linda
Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-AIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ How much would it cost to contain
the global AIDS epidemic? The answer is: How much would it cost to
banish ignorance, to deaden lust, to shame rape, to stop war, to
enrich the poor, to empower women, to defend children, to make
decent medical care as globally ubiquitous as Coca-Cola _ in short,
to get rid of all the underlying causes of the epidemic in the
Third World? By Donald G. McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL-LYING-REVIEW (Undated) _ What is it about legal
proceedings and particularly those pre-trial sworn interviews known
as depositions that turn sophisticated people into quibblers,
dissemblers or amnesiacs? Why can't they just respond to the
questions posed as people respond in everyday conversations? By
Adam Liptak.
</P>
<P>
   SKIMPY-CLOTHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Blame ``Sex and the City'' or
blame the decline of the ozone layer, but skin is in. American
women are wearing less than ever before. Summer itself is hotter.
And over the past decade, the proliferation of the Wonderbra
coincided with global warming so that just as cleavages became more
pronounced, shorts became shorter. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   GENOME-PROGRAM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Just as surely as any
shrink-wrapped Microsoft disk, the human genome is a program, a set
of precisely coded instructions that evolution has written for the
design, operation and unfortunately rather limited maintenance of a
person. That people should be operated by such a specific script is
as amazing as it would be to find that robots have souls. By
Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY-CELEBS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some statements from
celebrity women who have explained why they chose to appear nude in
Playboy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-BLUES-REVIEW (London) _ Britain is endlessly wondering
``How'm I doing?'' But unlike Ed Koch, the self-congratulating
former mayor of New York, Britain rarely expects a positive answer.
And lately, a nation that is always sensitive about perceived
slights to its international status has found more than usual to be
upset about. And now along comes ``The Patriot,'' a film about the
American Revolution that presents the English as effete war
criminals with snobby accents who herd families of fledgling
Americans into barns and set them on fire, just for fun. To Britons
sick of being pushed around, this obnoxious affront to
retrospective pride may be the last straw. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ All of Mexico's
presidential candidates call themselves democrats, but the voters
will really be choosing between two sharply different ways of
political life. The longtime ruling party, known as the PRI, offers
its tradition of top-down control and doing what it takes to stay
in power. The opposition comes from a contrasting wellspring of
grass-roots struggles for citizens' rights and the fight for the
balance of powers. The opposition is democratic, in the way that
most Americans understand the term. The PRI is not. Yet Mexicans
are clearly torn about this choice. By Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ANTIMISSILE-REVIEW (Beijing) _ It's hard to find any
foreign-policy expert here, in or out of government, who believes
the stated U.S. rationale for a continental anti-missile defense:
That it's merely intended to stop the likes of North Korea or Iraq.
Even Westward-leaning scholars here think the new push for missile
defense in Washington reflects an underlying conviction that the
United States must better prepare for battle with China. By Erik
Eckholm.

MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SPAR IN LIVELY TV DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The race for the Mexican presidency was a show
like Mexico has never seen. The leading candidates slugged it out
on television, calling each other names and wrangling fiercely over
the merits of change in a country ruled by the same party for 71
years.
</P>
<P>
   But when the dust settled, it was hard to find much difference
on the major issues between the two leading candidates, Francisco
Labastida of the governing party and Vicente Fox of the
right-of-center opposition, who are neck to neck in the last days
before Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
   On economic issues, the most deeply felt by Mexicans, the two
were so close that they used the same slogan: ``An economy with a
human face.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates downplayed the nationalism which used to be a
campaign mainstay and favored good relations with the United States
_ although they did not say it too loudly. They even agreed on what
not to bring up, so the crucial national security issue of
narcotics was largely absent.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates reflected a consensus among Mexican voters, who
have embraced the global economy but want a fairer share of it, and
seek better government through peaceful, orderly reform. And with
Mexico linked to the United States more firmly than ever, its
politicians room to maneuver is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   A leftist contender, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, contrasted with his
rivals, calling for a renegotiation of the North American Free
Trade Agreement and more confrontation with the United States. But
the most recent polls show that although Mexicans admire Cardenas'
honest zeal, they will not elect him president.
</P>
<P>
   Both Labastida and Fox were strong supporters of NAFTA, which
has transformed Mexico into an export powerhouse, creating millions
of jobs in sectors that supply the booming U.S. market. Both were
critical of government policies that catered to the markets but did
little to close the widening rift between rich and poor and between
northern Mexico, where the export industries are based, and the
south, where unemployment is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, which has ruled Mexico for seven decades, distanced
himself from President Ernesto Zedillo, even though the
government's tight fiscal policies have generated a recovery and
growth surge, without which the PRI campaign would have been
doomed. The PRI candidate criticized his party's president for
neglecting the purchasing power of working-class Mexicans. He
proposed to double or triple current subsidies to Mexican farmers
in regions hurt by U.S. competition through NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   Fox stood on his experience as a former Coca-Cola executive and
his record of boosting Mexican entrepreneurs when he was governor
of Guanajuato state. He said he would create a cabinet ministry,
separate from the Finance Ministry, to create jobs through private
investment, promote ``aggressive policies'' on behalf of small
businesses and send ``massive resources'' to the poorest regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one among the analysts can make out whose proposals are
better,'' said Damian Fraser, the head of Latin American research
for UBS Warburg. ``Labastida has more experience in government and
represents continuity. Fox has a somewhat greater commitment to
free market polices.''
</P>
<P>
   The final polls showed Labastida and Fox in an even tie, with
Cardenas well behind. Fox is from the moderate conservative
National Action Party, known as the PAN, but spearheaded a diverse
group of Mexicans who want a change from the ruling system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the similarities, Labastida did score one propaganda
coup against Fox. In a much-commented-upon television commercial,
he showed a video clip of Fox speaking in English during a visit to
the United States, describing a program he set up in Guanajuato to
train gardeners for skilled jobs in the United States. At end of
the commercial, Labastida appears and says that he plans to create
jobs for Mexicans in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Even though relations with the United States have never been
closer, Mexicans retain a gut wariness of their neighbor.
Nationalism was unusually dormant through much of the leading
campaigns, but in the final days the PRI revived it with
accusations that Fox received illegal donations from across the
border. Fox denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates both promised a harder line in defense of
Mexican immigrants. Fox stressed a proposal to make a free labor
market in the hemisphere in the coming years to parallel the free
trade market, opening the border to the millions of Mexican
migrants who now risk their lives to cross it illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Education was another hot-button issue, where Fox and Labastida
diverged. Fox made a risky pitch to Catholics, who are more than 90
percent of the population, suggesting he would make more room for
the Catholic Church in public education. The floater drew a furious
response from the PRI, whose anti-clericalism and commitment to
non-religious public schools dates back to its founding. It was not
clear how the overture played among the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida also gambled, with a nationally broadcast radio
commercial saying he would bring English and computer courses to
all public schools. The opposition ridiculed the proposal as
impractical and elitist. But PRI media analysts found that the ad
was a hit with working class voters and they extended its stay on
the air for an extra two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The issue too explosive for either candidate to dwell on was
Mexico's number one national security concern, the narcotics trade.
One PRI state governor, Mario Villanueva, is on the lam and wanted
by Mexican authorities for drug money-laundering. But Fox's party
also had a bleak record for combatting traffickers in Baja
California and Chihuahua, two borders states it governed in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates said they would fight crime and corruption by
overhauling the justice system. Labastida said he would dissolve
the attorney general's office, the central federal justice
institution, and create a new justice system more like the United
States, where the fight against drugs would be isolated in one
agency, federal prosecutors in another and federal police in a
third.
</P>
<P>
   Many sparks in the campaign flew from the friction between two
very different men. Labastida is an institutional man who served 37
years in government without making a big wave or a big mistake. Fox
handily outperformed him in both debates because Labastida seemed
noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's forcefulness and populist informality both helped and hurt
him. In a survey by Consultores y Marketing Politico, public
opinion research firm, more of those interviewed liked and trusted
Fox, but thought Labastida had ``the personality to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   The split that made the contest so intense is over the record of
the PRI, tarnished by corruption and repeated economic crises. Fox
appealed to Mexican voters to abandon their deepset risk aversion
and throw off a system of rule which has dominated their entire
lives.
</P>
<P>
   From a podium high above a huge crowd in Mexico City's central
square, Fox boomed out the slogan that summarized his crusade:
``Don't stop now, Mexico!''

SENATE APPROVES $11.2 BILLION EMERGENCY SPENDING BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to tighten, reorganize and rewrite)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Without dissent, the Senate approved on Friday an
$11.2 billion emergency spending bill whose centerpiece is an aid
package to equip and train Colombia's security forces, who are
battling drug traffickers and their rebel allies.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes about $2 billion to finance the
Pentagon's peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, as well as millions of
dollars of disaster aid for flood and forest fire victims in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the House overwhelmingly approved the measure, the
Senate endorsed the aid package by voice vote and joined the House
in adjourning for the weeklong July 4 recess. President Clinton is
expected to sign the bill soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even as lawmakers agreed on the broad package of international
and domestic assistance, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, vowed to block a House Republican measure to allow the
limited sale of food and medicine to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans tried to attach the Cuba provision to the
emergency aid package, but Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois
backed down in the face of a threatened filibuster by Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., that would have delayed the entire
package.
</P>
<P>
   Lott told reporters he would fight against tacking the Cuba
amendment onto any other bill. ``I oppose both, and if I can find a
way to kill them, I will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuba amendment would bar public and private American
financing for the sale of food and medicine, and it would turn into
law the current regulations that restrict which groups can visit
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The aid to Colombia was a top priority of the administration and
Hastert. More than 90 percent of the cocaine entering the United
States comes from Colombia, and supporters of the $1.3 billion aid
package say American assistance is important not only to stabilize
a vital ally, but to curtail the flow of drugs into this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a landmark vote, striking the drug war at ground zero
_ Colombia,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga..
</P>
<P>
   But critics warn that the plan is a dangerous escalation of
American involvement into a decades-old civil conflict. Opponents
have also complained that much of the aid will be going to the
Colombian army, which has a poor human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes 18 Blackhawk and 42 Huey II helicopters
that will be used to ferry special Colombian army battalions to the
rebel-controlled south, the heart of the narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This critical assistance will help the government of Colombia
respond to the drug emergency and support its democratic
institutions,'' said Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the director of the
White House office on drug control policy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the international aid, the package also includes
$661 million to repair damage caused by the fire in Los Alamos,
N.M., two months ago.

JAPAN SAVES RETAILER WITH TAX FUNDS; $6 BILLION IN DEBT TO BE
WRITTEN OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese financial authorities bailed out a highly
indebted department store company Friday, averting a major
corporate bankruptcy but reigniting concerns about Japan's economic
future just as it is showing signs of breaking out of a decade-long
malaise.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Reconstruction Commission, the agency charged with
overseeing reform in the banking system, said the government would
spend 97 billion yen, $924 million at Friday's exchange rates, of
taxpayer money to help rescue the store chain, the Sogo Co.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement paved the way for Sogo's other bankers to forgive
more than 630 billion yen in loans, roughly $6 billion. The banks
had wavered for weeks on whether to grant Sogo's request for the
debt forgiveness, one of the largest loan write-offs in Japanese
bank history.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement may have created far bigger problems for the
government, which is facing heightened scrutiny of its use of
taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to rescue the company _ and ease pressure on the
banks to which Sogo owes a total of $16 billion _ raises questions
about where the government will draw the line on the use of public
money. The precedent set Friday could mean that thousands of
companies will press for debt forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the government's decision casts doubt upon its
commitment to an overhaul of the economy, which has yet to
decisively rebound from a decade of decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests that every time the Japanese government looks over
the precipice and sees what it means to clean up this economy, it's
just too scary,'' said Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz
Securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is not the first country to aid a private company. The
United States rescued the Chrysler Corp. 20 years ago, and South
Korea used public money to prop up businesses during its economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan has taken the concept farther. The government here has
spent at least 7.7 trillion yen, more than $80 billion, to restore
the banking system. The government has offered small and mid-sized
businesses 30 trillion yen in loan guarantees to keep them afloat _
only to see a large number of them fail anyway.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the banking crisis in early 1998, the Bank of
Japan bought corporate debt securities to keep companies from
suffering a short-term cash crisis. The Japan Development Bank was
permitted to extend emergency credit lines to struggling companies
like the Nissan Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   But Sogo is not Nissan, never mind Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is sensible to forgive some debt as we go through
the process of restructuring the economy here, but is this the
right company?'' asked James Fiorillo, senior banking analyst at
ING Barings in Tokyo. ``I think not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sogo's restructuring plan envisions a return to positive net
worth more than a decade from now. And there is widespread doubt
over whether Sogo can entice shoppers back into its dowdy stores.
</P>
<P>
   The government had hoped to avoid a public bailout of a private
company. But it was pushed into that position by Shinsei Bank, the
former Long-Term Credit Bank, which the government sold last year
to a private group led by an American investment firm, Ripplewood
Holdings LLC. Under the terms, the government must buy back any
loans made by Long-Term Credit Bank whose book value falls by 20
percent or more for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Sogo's loans fell into that category, and on Wednesday, Shinsei
asked the Deposit Insurance Corp. to buy back 97 billion yen of the
200 billion yen Sogo owes it. Shinsei had already set aside 103
billion yen in reserves against a potential default on the loans.
Once it became clear that the government would be holding the
loans, not Shinsei, Sogo's other large creditors threatened not to
forgive Sogo debts unless the government did the same.
</P>
<P>
   While the government was worried about destroying Sogo and
putting its 9,900 employees out of work, it was more concerned
about the impact of Sogo's failure on the banking system, according
to officials.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Sogo's creditors had not adequately reserved against
potential default.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the government must still worry about the
stability and soundness of banks that have already received public
assistance and are supposedly in the process of seriously reforming
their business practices suggests that the financial crisis is not
really over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in crisis management mode in Japan,'' Fiorillo
said.

FRENCH RALLY BEHIND A NEW HERO WHO VANQUISHED A MCDONALD'S
</HEADLINE>
  By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILLAU, France _ Fearing that the trial of Jose Bove would turn
their quiet little town into an actual battleground for the forces
of anti-globalization, most store owners kept their iron gates
closed Friday. The McDonald's restaurant, which Bove is charged
with ransacking last year, was blockaded by two dozen police
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But as the trial opened, the atmosphere seemed more like a
French Woodstock than a Seattle. Thousands of teen-agers with green
hair, middle-aged men with pony tails, retirees wearing T-shirts
that said ``The world is not merchandise and I'm not either'' and
others set up tents and strummed guitars in the streets in support
of Bove, the sheep farmer who has become something of a national
hero with his fight against multinationals and what he calls the
industrialization of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Bove, who has a likable grin under his handlebar mustache, added
to the carnival air by riding into Millau's main square with his
nine co-defendants on a cart pulled by a tractor _ a not-so-veiled
reference to the way the condemned went to the guillotine.
</P>
<P>
   And, when he finally climbed the courthouse stairs, he stood at
the door with his fist raised long enough for the pack of news
photographers to get a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the courtroom, the defendants, dressed in sports shirts,
laughed and made jokes as the charges were read and they were asked
to respond to them. One, accused of spraying the premises with
orange paint, said he was only sorry he had not used green paint.
</P>
<P>
   Bove, however, was more serious. At one point he compared
himself to Gandhi, saying that Gandhi too, had been accused of
``violence'' in his day. ``The dismantling of McDonald's was a
strong action, symbolic and nonviolent,'' Bove told the court,
saying the fast food giant's arrival in Millau was a provocation.
</P>
<P>
   Bove was a little known farmer and union official until last
August, when he and the nine other men took a tractor, pick axes
and buzz saws to the local McDonald's. Bove declared at the time
that he was incensed by what he believed an unfair tax imposed by
the United States on French delicacies like Roquefort and pate de
foie gras in retaliation for Europe's decision not to import
hormone-treated American beef.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Bove has become a national celebrity. He has a
packed speaking schedule, a more prominent job with his union and
dinner invitations from high level government officials, including
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who set up their tents in the fields around this
town and then boarded shuttle buses to the courthouse said they had
come to pay homage to a hero, a man who was willing to stand up to
the forces of globalization and the arrogance of the American
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tax decision was outrageous,'' said Arianne Gurreau, a
schoolteacher who was camping with her boyfriend. ``I think the
judge needs to see that there are all these people who think what
he did was correct. We are fighting for values here, for the right
to care about what we eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Many came with their own fights inspired by Bove. ``What
prompted us to come is the problem of water,'' said Giselle Joffre,
a retired government worker who had made the trip with her husband,
Roger. ``In our town it is terribly expensive because we are
working with a big company. It is the same with all these
multinationals doing what they want. It all comes back to the same
thing. We have to support each other.''
</P>
<P>
   This was clearly not what many Millau residents had braced for.
Most had seen pictures of protesters, including Bove, at the World
Trade Organization meeting in Seattle and feared that this
demonstration too would turn violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were so scared,'' said Christianne Chazal-Martin, a
gift shop owner who decided to stay open. ``First one got talking
and then another and they went on and on about how bad it was going
to be. A lot of people really resented this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bove's attack on the McDonald's here last August was only one of
a number of attacks on the fast food chain, which is often a target
of anti-American sentiments. But Bove became instantly famous when
he was thrown in jail for it and then refused to pay bail for three
weeks in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he did pay the bail with money supplied by a group
of supporters, many of them American.
</P>
<P>
   His trial is expected to last two day. Bove faces charges that
could result in a fine of as much as $70,000 and up to five years
in jail. But it is considered unlikely that he, or any of his nine
co-defendants will serve any jail time for the vandalism, which
resulted in $110,000 worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Bove's lawyers, including a former president of a prominent
human rights organization, have lined up more than a dozen
witnesses, most of whom are also prominent farming advocates from
other countries. But much of the first day was spent arguing about
pictures of the McDonald's after the ransacking.
</P>
<P>
   Bove's lawyers pointed out that some of the windows were not
smashed.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the demonstration had hoped to gather 30,000
people for the opening of the trial, though police officials said
they believed the number was closer to half that. With speakers, a
farmers market and a free rock concert in the evening, however,
there was plenty to do. Many said they came as much to have fun as
to make a political statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came first for the party,'' said Michael Phelippeau, 16,
who came with his friend Dennis Roulleau and was wandering from
booth to booth with his sleeping bag under his arm. ``But my father
is a farmer and I am here representing my family too. We believe in
what Mr. Bove believes in. We don't want the multinationals to tell
us what to eat. ''

 By ANNE JARRELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. David Bank desperately wants to be a celebrity
dermatologist. So desperately that for the last three years he has
paid a publicist $3,000 a month and given away thousands of dollars
in free services to journalists to get his name in magazine
articles and to appear on television shows, where he offers medical
advice on everything from laser surgery to sunscreen protection.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of getting his name out has been worth it, he said. The
dermatology practice at his clinic in Westchester County has grown,
and so also has the caliber of his patient roster. Blythe Danner
and Chevy Chase are celebrities he boasts of tending to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm one of the best doctors out there, and I want to
get the word out,'' Bank, a Columbia medical graduate, said. To do
that, he often invites writers and editors of leading women's
magazines to visit his clinic in Mount Kisco, N.Y., where he
performs laser treatments, chemical peels, botox injections,
liposuction and other high-priced procedures free _ with the
understanding that they will write about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good working relationship,'' he said, though sometimes,
he said, ``it can bite you.'' About a year ago, he related, he
treated an old skiing scar on the knee of Lauren Purcell, who was
then an editor at Mademoiselle, using a pulse dye laser to repair
the mark, a procedure that normally costs $300 to $800. He said
that Purcell promised to write about her free treatment, but never
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' Bank said. ``It's part of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Purcell, now the articles editor at Self magazine, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Like hair colorists, fashion designers and chefs, more and more
doctors are seeking publicity to build their businesses. Freed of
legal constraints that prohibited them from advertising and faced
with shrinking incomes in the age of managed care, they are
aggressively marketing themselves as experts on beauty and health
in magazines like Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Elle, Self and Good
Housekeeping and on television shows like ``Today,'' where they
reach millions who are willing to pay for elective medical
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   But where does this leave the interests of readers and viewers?
Are they receiving accurate, unbiased information about medical
procedures that can profoundly affect their health and appearance?
Are magazines making household names of the best doctors _ or the
ones with the best publicists? Most pointedly, when journalists
accept free services from physicians, are they obligating
themselves to deliver favorable coverage, in effect serving as
shills?
</P>
<P>
   More than journalistic ethics are at stake. Every time a
doctor's name appears in a health or beauty article, a reader is
likely to take that as an endorsement and go under the knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, women make more decisions based on the
magazines than their doctor referrals or friends combined,'' said
Dr. Debra Jaliman, a Manhattan dermatologist.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that accepting free treatment is
widespread at women's magazines, where most articles about the
booming fields of cosmetic surgery and dermatology appear, and that
it leads to mostly positive coverage. Dr. Patricia Wexler, a
much-quoted Manhanattan dermatologist who has achieved the
celebrity status to which Bank aspires (patients wait months to see
her), said: ``All the time I give free botox, collagen, chemical
peels to journalists who will write about it. They quote me as if I
were George Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Beraka, a Manhattan plastic surgeon, who also gets a
lot of press, said: ``Absolutely all the time, doctors give writers
free services to get them to write about it. Free face-lifts, even
that, sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laurie Polis, a dermatologist who directs the SoHo
Integrative Health Center, a sleek, Zen-theme clinic, said: ``I
feel strong-armed. I don't want to barter services for mentions,
but I can't bite the hand that feeds me.''
</P>
<P>
   Polis described how a contributing editor for More, a beauty and
fashion magazine for older women, recently had a free day of
treatments, including ``botox, a facial, a dermabrasion peel,'' and
met with the clinic's staff for free consultations. Shortly after,
Polis said, the reporter called and requested full-body laser
treatments with a Cool Touch laser, a new machine. ``My jaw was on
the floor,'' Polis said, adding that when she balked, the reporter
``threw a hissy fit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people are so entitled,'' she said. ``Laser
treatments are expensive, and what she wanted would have taken six
treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   The More writer, Lynn Schnurnberger, said that Polis had
promised her the laser treatments, then reneged. ``I was angry with
her because she offered me something and then didn't come
through,'' Schnurnberger said. Her day of beauty, she said,
consisted of a ``short, 20-minute dermabrasion peel'' and free
consultations; no botox or facial, as Polis maintains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything wrong with taking free services
as long as you say in your article it was free,'' the writer said.
She said she is still working on the article and expects it to run
next year.
</P>
<P>
   About receiving free treatments in the course of reporting,
mainstream journalistic practice is clear: it is a conflict of
interest for reporters and editors to accept products or services
of value from those they cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally unethical, and any journalist at a respectable
publication would be fired for it,'' said Judy Foreman, who writes
a health column for The Boston Globe. ``Anyone can't help but be
influenced by free treatment. Even for a moment, assuming they're
not, there's still the appearance of a conflict. The publications
should pay for services they want to write about.'' (MORE)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Even if reporters disclose that a treatment was free, something
rarely done, experts in medical ethics are skeptical that the
interests of the reader can be well served. ``Of course getting a
free service influences'' journalists, said George Annas, the
chairman of health law at the Boston University School of Public
Health. ``It's just as disingenuous and self-serving for them to
say otherwise as it is for doctors to say they aren't influenced by
the drug companies who hand out freebies.''
</P>
<P>
   But most women's magazines operate under different rules from
daily newspapers. Just as magazine fashion editors take gifts of
$1,000 Prada handbags or 25 percent discounts on Jimmy Choo shoes,
maintaining that it is a professional courtesy that does not
influence their decision about what to put in their pages, magazine
beauty editors and writers receive spa and medical treatments and
say the same thing. (The New York Times prohibits journalists from
accepting gifts from news sources.)
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Myers, editor in chief at Elle, said her magazine allows
its writers to accept free treatments related to articles they are
writing. ``I can see why it looks suspicious, but the proof is in
the piece,'' she said. ``We do not feel obligated to write
positively about a doctor, whether we paid or not.'' Cynthia Leive,
the editor in chief of Self, said her magazine had no clear-cut
policy on writers and editors accepting free treatments. ``We
grapple with this issue all the time,'' she said. Later she called
back and added, ``Of course this is against journalistic policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Wells, the editor in chief of Allure, said her magazine
pays for any services it writes about. ``My policy is that we
always pay,'' Wells said. ``If someone is violating my policy, I'll
have to see it and deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers of health and beauty articles in women's magazines know
that the same doctors' names appear over and over. These physicians
have often achieved their status because they have publicists who
send journalists mass mailings and sometimes set up meetings and
appointments for free treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the writers never visit the doctors' offices, they know
the physicians will interrupt appointments to return calls and
offer sound bites. But health experts say readers form an
inaccurate impression about these often-quoted doctors. ``Obviously
the average consumer thinks that when he reads Doctor X's name over
and over again in the magazines, he's the best,'' said Ross
Frazier, a spokesman for the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fierce appetite among some cosmetic surgeons and
dermatologists to have their names in the press. Foreman of The
Boston Globe said that at a conference last year of the American
Society of Plastic Surgery, where she sat on a panel, physicians
clamored to know how to get quoted and whether they should hire
publicists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't understand the difference between advertising and
journalism,'' she said. Foreman said most of what she writes about
is derived from research and scientific studies. She considers it
``a total turnoff'' if a doctor hires a publicist.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy Behrman of Behrman Communications in New York, who
represents the often-quoted Dr. Helen S. Colen, a Park Avenue
plastic surgeon, said, ``It's so competitive out there that doctors
feel they have no choice but to hire a publicist to put them in
touch with the media.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``It's a fact: women are inclined to go check out
doctors they read about over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1982, when the Supreme Court upheld an order by the
Federal Trade Commission requiring the American Medical Association
to permit doctors to advertise, the association's policy has been
neither to encourage nor to discourage medical advertising, said
Dr. Herbert Rakatansky, the chairman of its council on ethical and
judicial affairs. Hiring publicists to get exposure for services
they offer is tantamount to advertising, he said. Doctors are now
subject to false advertising and fraud claims under consumer laws,
and their ads must be truthful, he added.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the procedures that doctors discuss in the press
are accepted practice, some treatments have no scientific backing
or are too new to have a history.
</P>
<P>
   ``No consumer should ever take the word of a doctor they read in
the magazines,'' said Dr. David J. Goldberg, a dermatologist and a
former president of the American Society for Laser Medicine and
Surgery. ``My clinic is one of a handful in the country that does
all the major testing for the government, but my name almost never
gets quoted. Why? Because I don't spend the money to get my name in
the magazines.'' (MORE)

 &HT;    Rudolph nowhere to be found, or talked about
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the name of Eric Robert Rudolph fades from the lips
and minds of the people in Western North Carolina, law enforcement
remain convinced the accused bomber still is hiding under their
noses, even as federal investigators all but end their presence in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to believe he's not here,'' said Capt. Bob
Scott of the Macon County, N.C., sheriff's department, which
polices much of the search area for the elusive Rudolph. ``There
have been no other bombings and it was the last place he was
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, federal agents had cut their staff to about a dozen
and completed their move from a large vacated Andrews, N.C.,
textile plant to space at the National Guard Armory. The manhunt
once had involved upwards of 200 federal agents, Georgia
Corrections officers and GBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's forgotten about,'' said Peggy Ellison, owner of the
Lake's End Grill in the Nantahala. ``Nobody mentions it anymore,
unless tourists come in and see my sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign _ ``We Survived the Rudolph Manhunt 1998-1999- 2000?''
_ is the last reminder in the restaurant that was once the central
gathering place for searchers and reporters. Many people think
Rudolph, who is charged in four bombings including the Centennial
Olympic Park explosion in Atlanta in 1996, is long gone. ``He's
probably living in an apartment in Paris,'' joked Bob Allmond, a
Cumming, Ga., man who is building a log cabin on Lake Nantahala,
just about ground zero for the manhunt. Local authorities have been
asked to report to federal agents any break-ins, no matter how
small, and any reported sightings, no matter how strange. Scott
said his department has an operations plan that will kick in ``if
we have another sighting.'' It is a ``first reponders'' plan that
will enable them to react quickly and guides them through a list of
agencies to notify, he said. ``We would handle it just like any
other dangerous fugitive,'' Scott said. ``Some people speculate
that wherever he is, he may have booby-trapped it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph slipped into oblivion on Jan. 30, 1998, a day after he
was allegedly seen shedding a blond wig and jumping into his pickup
truck moments after a bomb exploded at an abortion clinic in
Birmingham. He was last seen that July when he approached an
acquaintance seeking supplies.
</P>
<P>
   While federal agents tracked the pickup truck registration to an
Asheville address a couple of hours away, then-Cherokee County
Sheriff Jack Thompson learned Rudolph was renting a trailer in his
county. ``We checked and he had a post office box rented,'' said
Thompson, who lost a re-election bid last year. ``We checked power
and he had power. We called a neighbor who said he had seen him
come in about 5 o'clock that evening (of the Birmingham bomb).''
But Thompson said they didn't have a warrant and at the time,
Rudolph had not been charged with a crime and he feared someone
would get killed trying to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back this week, Thompson said, ``I wish I had gone out
there and set up road blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   When investigators arrived at the trailer Rudolph was renting in
Murphy, N.C., the movie, ``Kull the Conqueror,'' a fantasy about
barbarians fighting in caves, was still in his VCR. Books about
``tunnel rats'' in Vietnam and aerial photographs of the area were
also found, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Mine and cave expert Darren Freed of Hendersonville, N.C., has
been looking for Rudolph since September 1998, and the federal
government is paying his expenses. Freed has documented more than
1,000 gold, silver, sapphire and ruby mines in the area _ most of
which remain unsearched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll be another D.B. Cooper,'' Freed said. ``I
think he will eventually be found, and this will eventually be a
movie. I just wish it had closure.''

NEW YORK: the magazines.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Joann Moroz, 62, a nurse who lives in Briarcliff, N.Y., said
she went to Bank, the Mount Kisco dermatologist, for laser eye
surgery last October after seeing his name in magazines and on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Using an erbium laser, he operated on her to remove crow's feet,
but her face never healed properly, she said, and she had ``welts
and scars'' around her eyes. When she complained, Bank injected her
with cortisone, prescribed a scar-healing cream and assured her
things would be fine, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she was not satisfied and in January visited Dr. Roy
Geronemus, a Manhattan laser specialist, to seek treatment for the
scars.
</P>
<P>
   About Bank, Moroz said: ``It really infuriates me that I see his
name everywhere. I went to him because I thought he had to know
what he was doing: he's in every magazine in the country, he's on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Moroz said she had not complained to Bank but intended to seek
reimbursement of the $2,000 she said she had paid, plus the cost of
Geronemus' work.
</P>
<P>
   Geronemus said he would not comment on a patient under his care.
Bank also declined to comment about Moroz, citing patient
confidentiality. But he said: ``With any procedure there's always a
small number of patients who have complications. It doesn't
necessarily mean that anything was done wrong on the part of the
physician.'' Bank said he had been using the erbium laser to
perform eye surgery since 1992, and it's ``a routine procedure''
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be cautious about implying that there has been any
factual investigation here,'' he added. ``To report one person's
claim of a suboptimal result and to imply it is in any way the
physician's fault is thin at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors are disdainful of promoting themselves with
publicists. Dr. Vicki Levine, a physician in the dermatology
department at the New York University Medical Center, whose
specialty is laser surgery, frowns on the practice. ``It makes
medicine like haircutting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Duenwald, Harper's Bazaar's executive editor, said, ``I
wish the magazines would get together and ban all doctors who use
publicists.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems unlikely. Last year, Dr. Thomas Romo, a Manhattan
plastic surgeon, enjoyed a coup when he was featured in long
articles in two magazines within months. Both articles chronicled
face-lifts Romo performed at less than his usual fee with the
understanding they would be written about.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Biddle Barrows, the former Mayflower Madam, received a
full lift for an article by James Servin in Harper's Bazaar in
February 1999. (She plans to write a book about her experience.)
Then, Marie Claire ran an article about a face-lift Romo performed
on a patient he found for the magazine. A financial arrangement
``that's appealing for both the doctor and the patient'' was made,
said Susan Yaeger, Romo's surgical consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler, the high-profile dermatologist, does not have a
publicist. But in her climb to the top she has always given free
treatments to journalists writing about her. ``I did a $2,500 peel
on a Ladies' Home Journal editor,'' she said. ``I did collagen in
Michael Musto's lips, and he wrote about it in The Voice. I did
Candace Bushnell's collagen for a story in Vogue. I did an acne
consultation for a piece by Rebecca Johnson at Vogue, and I gave
Simon Doonan a free consultation for a column he did in The
Observer.''
</P>
<P>
   Musto said that Wexler solicited him at The Village Voice in the
early '90s through a publicist. ``It was a pioneering thing then,''
he said. ``Collagen was just starting to be widespread. She
proposed it to a number of writers, and I was the only one who took
her up on it. I spoofed the whole thing, called it the Paris Lip.''
He also made the rare disclosure in print that he received the $400
treatment at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Doonan, who wrote about his consultation in The New York
Observer of May 8, referred to Wexler as ``dermatological royalty''
but did not mention that her $350 fee for an audience was waived.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who received free consultations from Wexler and two
other dermatologists for her November 1996 Vogue article, said that
receiving no-cost services ``in no way affects how I write about a
doctor.'' She added that Vogue, where she is a contributing editor,
generally does not publish negative accounts of treatments because
its focus is on ``celebrating this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Astley, Vogue's beauty director, confirmed that writers and
editors are often ``comped'' _ given complimentary services _
including more than $5,000 worth of cosmetic dentistry that Julia
Reed, a senior writer, received from Dr. Larry Rosenthal in the
course of profiling him in the November 1998 Vogue. But Astley
insisted this practice did not affect the objectivity of her
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel any obligation to report on services that may
have been comped and we don't think are good, whether it's as
simple as a manicure or more elaborate like a dermatological
peel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vogue doesn't run negative criticism of books or movies or
usually even of fashion collections or of beauty products or
services or professionals,'' she said. ``Our overall message is
very positive and upbeat. For us a negative review is simply to not
include it in the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   One detail that escaped Reed's glowing profile of Rosenthal, her
dentist: his license was suspended for six months in 1987,
according to the New York State division of professional licensing,
which would not disclose the reason. Rosenthal explained in an
article in The New York Times on Jan 31, 1999, that he had been
disciplined for misusing prescription forms to obtain sleeping and
diet pills, but he said another person had stolen the forms and
used them.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for a women's magazine article to criticize or even
question the treatments proffered free to writers. So rare that
Bank, the Mount Kisco dermatologist, was surprised when an article
in the April issue of Mirabella presented a dissenting view of his
hyperbaric oxygen treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, Holly Millea, the writer, described being zipped
into a sleeping-bag device and flooded with oxygen for 45 minutes,
a procedure that Bank says slows aging, relieves migraines, fights
depression and helps with weight loss. Millea quoted two other
doctors who called the procedure clinically untested and suggested
it was, well, snake oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only time that has happened to me,'' Bank said,
adding that In Style did an article on the same treatment, and
``their writer liked it.''

LOSING THE BATTLE FOR BEN &AMP; JERRY'S; WINNING THE WAR FOR
RESPONSIBLE INVESTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Neb., Mass., Vt.)   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ For Terry Mollner, a pillar of socially
responsible investing who made a run at acquiring Ben &AMP; Jerry's
Homemade this spring, the triumph of the United States and its
economic system remains incomplete. ``It's been more than 10 years
since the end of the Cold War, and there's been no bright light
shone on how to improve capitalism,'' he said in a recent interview
on the upstairs porch of his frame house here. ``It's about time we
got around to it.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, the answer is to make capitalism more cooperative.
Instead of rival corporations, he envisions a business world in
which companies band together to push for legislative changes and
to raise standards _ for workers, for the environment. For many
people, Schumpeter or Adam Smith are economic role models; Mollner
brings up Mahatma Gandhi. ``We live in denial that a strong
cooperative context is essential in our society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's is a rare example of a company that cares about
such things, says Mollner, a onetime Jesuit seminarian who is now
president of the Trusteeship Institute, an economic think tank in
this Massachusetts college town. For him, trying to rescue the
company from the capitalist maw wasn't a business decision or an
ego move. It was a mission. Though he failed to buy it, he still
won a seat on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Mollner led a late-starting charge to preserve the company and
all that it stood for beyond Cherry Garcia. Mollner wanted to hold
on to the socially responsible aspects of the company _ ideals like
helping the world's disenfranchised by making them suppliers or
partners _ that he feared might disappear if Ben &AMP; Jerry's was
consumed by a large corporate suitor.
</P>
<P>
   When he heard that the company was considering offers, he swung
into action. With bids from ice-cream behemoths like Unilever and
Dreyer's, already being considered, Mollner thought an alternative
was needed. ``I heard the board was going to vote to sell the
company to Dreyer's,'' he recalled. ``I had to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   No latecomer to the world of finance, Mollner was born in 1944
in Omaha, Neb., where his father ran a butcher shop on the south
side of town as Warren E. Buffett's father was running one on the
north side. He helped formulate investing strategy for the Calvert
family of mutual funds and remains a director of two funds.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a notoriously nervy basketball player, with a style
that epitomizes his willingness to embrace huge odds. Seth Goldman,
who worked with Mollner at Calvert before becoming a co-founder of
Honest Tea, a two-year-old iced-tea company in Bethesda, Md.,
recalled one game. ``He would make these shots from beyond the
three-point line, almost midcourt,'' he said. ``And they went in
more than they went out. Mollner began his quest to buy Ben &AMP;
Jerry's by appealing directly to Ben Cohen, a co-founder. Then,
with Cohen's blessing, he put together a group of investors that
included Anita Roddick, president of Body Shop, and Bob Barton,
chief executive of the Catalyst Financial Group, a Vermont venture
capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Wicks, vice chairwoman of the Social Venture Network, a
group of entrepreneurs and investors concerned about social justice
and the environment, was the first person Mollner called. ``Terry
has an exceptional ability to bring people together around shared
values and move toward a common goal,'' Wicks said. ``He can see
and articulate the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Unilever, Cohen and Meadowbrook Lane, as Mollner's
group became known, joined to offer $38 a share for Ben &AMP; Jerry's.
Ben &AMP; Jerry's board members viewed Mollner's group variously as a
white knight or a fly in the ointment, but the board approved the
offer. Then came complaints and lawsuits from shareholders, who
felt that money had been left on the table in the interests of
perpetuating the Ben &AMP; Jerry's way. Finally, on the night of April
7, all the competing groups were told to put their best offers
forward. Mollner and his group, gathered around the huge conference
table in Unilever's New York headquarters, decided they were
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a beautiful moment when I said, it's an auction, and
we can't compete,'' Mollner remembers. ``We called our partnership
the Hot Fudge Family. So I said, `Let's all put our hands on the
table and let go of the Hot Fudge Family.' And we did. The
partnership was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Unilever agreed on April 12 to pay $326 million for the company.
Although Ben &AMP; Jerry's partisans, especially Cohen and Jerry
Greenfield, his co-founder, feared they had sold out their
principles, all was not lost. Unilever offered seats on the board
to Mollner and another person, still to be named, from the
Meadowbrook Lane partnership. Cohen and Greenfield will remain on
the board. Unilever is setting aside money to help develop
minority-owned businesses, and Cohen has been put in charge of
conducting ``social audits'' of Unilever's businesses worldwide.
That job got a lot bigger with the company's $20.3 billion purchase
last month of Bestfoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in this together,'' said Mollner, who feels that he
lost the battle for Ben &AMP; Jerry's but won part of a larger war.
``Cooperation is fundamental. You can't not be doing it.''

 &HT;    Georgia governor's wealth drops $2 million
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Roy Barnes remains by far one of Georgia's wealthiest
governors. But since taking office, he has seen his personal
fortune dwindle by almost $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney and his wife, Marie, were worth $9.5 million at the
beginning of 1999. Now, the Barneses' net worth is reported at $7.7
million, according to personal financial disclosures and tax
returns released by his office Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The governor continued to post handsome earnings by most
standards _ more than $722,000 this year, much of it from
inestments. But it's far less than the nearly $2 million in income
he declared in tax returns last year.
</P>
<P>
   And the Barneses' paid about half the taxes in 1999 _ $227,685 _
that they paid for the year before taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes reported his personal assets _ including a list of
investments in his blind trust _ in advance of the July 1 deadline
for state-mandated disclosure for elected officials and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, an attorney representing the blind trust had
argued that listing the individual assets would undercut the
purpose of the trust _ namely to keep an official ``blinded'' to
his own investments so they can't color his decisions in office.
The attorney asked state officials for an opinion on how much the
governor had to disclose.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Thurbert Baker responded earlier this
month, ruling that a blind trust is not exempt from state reporting
requirements. Barnes, he said, would have to list the trust's
assets the same as if he managed ithimself.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes complied, providing a nearly inch-thick stack of
documents, with some of them _ state and federal income tax records
_ going beyond state disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures show a considerable personal wealth hit by
recent stock market fluctuations _ bank stocks, in particular.
</P>
<P>
   The value of Barnes' largest single asset going into 1999,
Alabama National Bankcorp, plunged by almost 30 percent from the
year. The trust, which held nine bank stocks and securities,
dropped in value from about $7 million when the governor
established it upon taking office, to about $5.8 million at the end
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the first time Barnes' personal wealth has fluctuated.
While running for governor in 1998, Barnes reported a net worth
approaching $11 million, which also was influenced by bank stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   A review of the trust's assets shows Barnes is still invested in
bank stocks, Alabama National Bankcorp and at least three others.
</P>
<P>
   But the Atlanta attorney managing Barnes' trust apparently has
opted for a more conservative strategy, buying an undisclosed
amount of state and local municipal bonds, according to the
disclosure. The trust holds at least 15 bonds, including some
issued by the state of Georgia. All are valued over $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also continues to hold in trust 10 real estate properties
in his home county of Cobb, three of them with other investment
partners.
</P>
<P>
   His income tax records show more than $476,000 in income poured
into the trust during 1999, most of it in legal fees from cases
before he took office.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes reported nearly $111,500 in income from a partial year's
salary as governor. In addition to the rental and office
properties, he and his wife own a home and 13 acres in Mableton
valued at $400,000. They have retirement accounts worth $1.3
million. Both of those assets are held outside the trust.
</P>
<P>
   Their only financial liability is a $19,362 mortgage on their
home.
</P>
<P>
   Income tax returns show the Barneses gave $55,373 to charities
last year, most of it to their Methodist church in Cobb County, and
to education funds.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' chief of staff, Bobby Kahn, said that despite questions
over the blind trust disclosure, the governor has no plans to push
for a change in state law to exempt him from the state ethics in
government act. Kahn said Barnes has no plans to dissolve the blind
trust.
</P>
<P>
   While the head of Georgia Common Cause had argued against
Barnes' disclosure of his trust assets, Robert Pregulman, program
director for the Georgia Public Interest Research Group, applauded
the move Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know more about where our political leaders have their
money invested,'' he said, ``you have a better chance to watchdog
them to be sure they do the right thing.''

NORTH AND SOUTH AGREE TO PLANS TO REUNITE SEPARATED FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Adds 3 new grafs near end of story. They begin ``The
prisoners were ...,'' ``The South Korean government ...,'' and ``In
recent years ...'')

<P>
   TOKYO _ Red Cross officials from North and South Korea signed an
agreement Friday to begin reuniting families separated by more than
50 years of conflict on the Korean peninsula. The accord, an
outgrowth of breakthrough reconciliation talks between the two
countries two weeks ago, also provides for the return of North
Koreans who were imprisoned in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Under Friday's agreement, about 100 South Koreans will travel to
the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to meet with relatives, while
100 North Koreans will meet with family members in Seoul. These
initial reunions are scheduled to take place over four days,
beginning on Aug. 15, according to South Korean media reports from
North Korea, where the agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the deal is expected to reunite thousands of Koreans
who were separated from relatives when the peninsula was divided at
the end of World War II. South Korean officials estimate that there
are nearly 8 million people in the South, about 660,000 of them
over 60 years old, who have relatives living in the North.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean War broke out 50 years ago last month, and although a
1953 armistice suspended the fighting, North and South are
technically still at war, and only a handful of separated families
have been allowed to take part in officially sanctioned reunions in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   For reunions, Red Cross officials agreed to set up a permanent
visitation center where separated families can meet. The officials
said they had not yet decided where to establish the center.
However, they mentioned as possible candidates scenic Mount
Kumgang, on North Korea's east coast, and Panmunjom, the village in
the heavily armed demilitarized zone along the two countries'
border.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached after four days of talks between
representatives from the Red Cross of both Koreas at Mount Kumgang.
</P>
<P>
   ``This South-North agreement is the first concrete result
following the summit meeting, and it means that we have entered the
realization phase in dealing with the separated family issues,''
said Park Ki-ryun, secretary general of the South Korean Red Cross.
``We will try our best to insure that exchanges will occur without
complications.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his expectations for the family reunions were, Choi
Seung Chul, the head of North Korea's Red Cross, said: ``Things
will work out very well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The agreement also calls for the return of all North Koreans who
served prison terms in the South who want to return home. The North
Koreans, most of whom were convicted of spying for the North, would
be allowed to go in early September.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners were kept in South Korea for several reasons: Most
refused to denounce communism; the two countries were still at war;
and the South sought to use them as bargaining chips in
negotiations with the North.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean Defense Ministry has said that 50 of the 88
former prisoners, who are mostly elderly, have indicated that they
want to return to North Korea. There was no mention in the
agreement of South Korean soldiers who may still be behind bars in
the North.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean government says that hundreds of its soldiers
taken prisoner during the 1950-53 war are still being held. North
Korea has denied this.
</P>
<P>
   To facilitate meetings between separated family members, North
and South Korean officials will trade lists of 200 separated
relatives and begin checking to see whether the individuals on the
list are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The visitation center will not be set up until the North Korean
prisoners are returned, the reports said. The center is expected to
identify hundreds of separated family members a month and bring
them together.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, an unofficial trade in family meetings has
sprung up in the border region with China, where South Koreans
often pay thousands of dollars to handlers who arrange reunions
with their relatives. Many of the encounters take place on islands
in the Yalu River, where Koreans meet long-lost relatives or learn
of their deaths.

U.S. TO END UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S SECURITY ROLE AT 2 NUCLEAR
LABS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced Friday
that he planned to strip the University of California of its
responsibility for security at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore
national laboratories in the aftermath of a series of major
security lapses at the troubled Los Alamos laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California, which has held the government
contract to manage Los Alamos since the laboratory opened during
World War II to develop the atomic bomb, will continue to run the
scientific and research aspects of both Los Alamos and Lawrence
Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson said he would immediately seek to renegotiate the
university contract and would find a different organization to
handle security and facilities management at the two laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The University of California's performance in managing
security at our weapons laboratories is unacceptable and must be
immediately addressed,'' Richardson said Friday. ``Safeguarding
security at our nation's weapons laboratories warrants nothing
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he has asked Gen. John A. Gordon, the director
of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the new,
semi-independent agency that oversees the government's nuclear
weapons facilities, to handle the contract renegotiations with the
University of California and to recommend a new organization to
handle lab security by Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding an effective way to improve the security and
management at the laboratories without compromising the strength of
their cutting-edge science and research will be one of my top
priorities,'' Gordon said in a statement Friday. Gordon met with
the provost of the University of California on Thursday to inform
him of the decision to change the management of lab security.
</P>
<P>
   University of California president Richard C. Atkinson offered
only a cautious statement in response to Richardson's actions.
``The U.S. Department of Energy has advised us that it will explore
ways in which additional expertise might help address security
issues,'' he said, adding:``The University welcomes the opportunity
to work with DOE in this effort and to create a path forward that
meets all security needs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The University of California's contract to manage the two
weapons labs has been under scrutiny since last year, following the
Wen Ho Lee case. Lee was fired from Los Alamos in March 1999 for
security violations uncovered in connection with the government's
investigation of allegations of Chinese espionage at the lab. After
he was fired, investigators discovered that he had downloaded vast
amounts of secret nuclear data from the classified computer network
at Los Alamos and copied it onto portable tapes, some of which are
now missing. He was arrested in December on charges of mishandling
classified material. He has not been charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the University of California's management has
increased over the past month following the discovery that computer
hard drives containing nuclear secrets had disappeared from a vault
at the Los Alamos lab. The two hard drives were found by a lab
employee, but the FBI is now conducting a criminal investigation at
the lab to determine who removed them.
</P>
<P>
   Lax security at Los Alamos has become a major issue in Congress,
and lawmakers have repeatedly questioned Richardson about whether
he would hold the University of California accountable and end its
long hold on the lab contract.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the University of California's status as lab
contractor has also raised broader issues about the inherent
conflict between science and security in weapons development.
Scientists at the national weapons labs believe strongly that an
open exchange of ideas is needed to achieve the best science, even
in the national security area. The scientists cherish the notion
that one of America's premier universities manages the labs,
fostering an academic environment. But to protect U.S. military
advantages, the government wants to keep secret the advances
achieved at the weapons labs. The result is an endless tug of war
between the scientists and security and counter-intelligence
officials that dates back to the wartime Manhattan Project.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California's contract does not expire until
2002, but Richardson said in an interview today that the security
crisis at Los Alamos has convinced him that he must renegotiate the
agreement now, and has already decided to take security matters
away from the university. ``We want to keep UC's assets, basically
providing a good environment for science, and get rid of their
liabilities, basically security,'' Richardson said. ``There is no
reason why we should keep their weak management and security
components.''
</P>
<P>
   While UC runs both Los Alamos and Lawrence-Livermore, Sandia,
the nation's third nuclear weapons lab, is managed by Lockheed
Martin Corp.

   SPA WORKERS FIND USES FOR VASELINE
</P>
<P>
   A jar of Vaseline has been a skin-care staple for years. So
Vaseline invited America's fancy spas to create ``Spa in a Jar''
formulas using petroleum jelly. The spas created their recipes in
exchange for a donation made to Cancer Care Inc., a national
charity for cancer patients and their caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   _ This one is from Helen Famulare, esthetician at Elizabeth
Arden Red Door Salon and Spa in New York City:
</P>
<P>
   For an after-sun skin soother, mix 2 tablespoons of aloe vera
(plant form) with 1/4 cup of Vaseline before bedtime. Apply with
light massage to sunburned areas until absorbed. Mix a fresh batch
for each use. Designed to keep skin moist and fresh and to calm
sunburn.
</P>
<P>
   _ This recipe is from Carla Stoehr, massage therapist at the
Golden Door in Telluride, Colo.:
</P>
<P>
   For a foot scrub, fill a bathtub with warm water. (You'll soak
your feet in the tub 10-15 minutes before applying the mixture
you're about to make.) Briefly warm 1/4 cup Vaseline in a bowl (a
double boiler is best _ do not microwave). Test to be sure it isn't
too hot. In a larger bowl, mix 1/4 cup Epsom or sea salts with two
to four drops of your favorite essential oil. Add warm Vaseline to
the mixture and mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Soak your feet in the tub to soften them. Then exfoliate feet
with the Vaseline mixture and finish with a steamed cloth scented
with your favorite oil.
</P>
<P>
   _ This recipe is from Meghan Brady, head spa technician at The
Spa at the Sporting Club in San Diego:
</P>
<P>
   For silky smooth legs, mix 1/4 cup Vaseline Petroleum Jelly with
1/2 cup Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion. After shaving in the
shower, apply mixture to legs.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moments before boarding the chartered jet that
would whisk him and his son Elian back to their Cuban homeland last
Wednesday, Juan Miguel Gonzalez faced the microphones and cameras
to bid the United States a heartfelt farewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has allowed me to meet very beautiful and brilliant
people in this country,'' he said of the weeks he had spent here
working for Elian's return. ``And I hope in the future, this same
impression I took from this country can become true between Cuba
and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He may soon get his wish.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Elian left, House Republicans hammered out a
proposal for easing four decades of Cold War sanctions against
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, slated to be taken up by the House of
Representatives and the Senate toward mid-July, would permit the
export of American farm products to Cuba and expand sales of U.S.
medicine there.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative's sponsor, Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., sees
it as the first step toward gradually ending the crippling economic
embargo, and eventually tearing away the estrangement, that divides
the United States and its impoverished neighbor 90 miles away
across the Florida Strait.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first brick out of the wall,'' Nethercutt said in a
telephone interview with Cox Newspapers. ``It is a finger out of
the dike, and the water's coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   More holes could soon come unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   There are two other bills pending before Congress aimed at
overhauling U.S. policy meant to isolate the island nation and
strangle the repressive regime of its Communist leader Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   That approach, critics contend, has failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a policy that hasn't worked for 40 years,'' said Rep.
Marshall Sanford, R-S.C., who introduced a bill last May to end
U.S. restrictions on travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to re-evaluate,'' said Mark Seigel,
spokesman for Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., author of a bill to end the
U.S. embargo against Cuba. ``Cubans, 11 million people, are no
better off today than they were 40 years ago when the embargo took
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight Eisenhower imposed an economic embargo on Cuba
in 1960, after Castro set up a totalitarian dictatorship in Havana,
seized American-owned farms and refineries across Cuba as part of
his self-styled Marxist revolution, banned religious activities and
political dissent and cozied up to the Soviet Union, the arch-foe
of U.S. interests at the time.
</P>
<P>
   One of Eisenhower's final acts in office was to break diplomatic
ties with Cuba in January 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, President John F. Kennedy tightened the
embargo, and later prohibited U.S. travel to Cuba, forbade American
banks to finance Cuban undertakings and froze Cuban-owned assets in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   It was the right policy for its time, contends Julia Sweig,
deputy director of Latin American programs with the Council on
Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``On strategic grounds, you can make the case that we won,''
said Sweig. ``Our foreign policy goals during the Cold War, of
reigning Cuba in and keeping the Soviet Union out of this
hemisphere, have been achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   The secondary objective _ bringing down Castro _ is a different
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has that succeeded? Evidently not,'' said Sweig. ``Has it
succeeded in giving the Cuban people a reason to withdraw what
support they do give to Castro? No. Have we had the Velvet
Revolution there? No. It's pretty hard, in terms of evidence, to
say that it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, U.S. policy toward Cuba has become an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   A hallmark of President Clinton's foreign policy, after all, has
been a commitment to engagement, the notion that U.S. trade and
investment, exposure to American practices and ideas, could be
strong engines for change in places like China, Russia, Vietnam
and, as of early June, even North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's instincts, he said last week, are to reach out to Cuba
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I think that anything we can do to engage the Cuban
people, to get them involved in the process of change, to get them
to look outside the world, to get them to look beyond the present
system they have, is a positive thing to do,'' he said at a White
House news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1996, in fact, Clinton was trying to do just
that, by gradually widening provisions for American academicians,
journalists, athletes and others to visit Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The thaw ended abruptly, though, in February 1996, when Castro
ordered Cuban MiG fighters to shoot down two unarmed civilian
airplanes owned by the Miami-based Cuban exile group Brothers to
the Rescue. As they neared Cuban air space on a mission to drop
anti-Castro leaflets over Havana, the planes were destroyed. Three
Cuban-Americans and one Cuban national were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deliberate decision to murder those people changed
everything,'' said Clinton. ``And it made me wonder whether Mr.
Castro was hoping we never would normalize relations, so then he
could use us as an excuse for the failures of his regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The embargo has powerful supporters in this country as well,
including Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms,
R-N.C. He joined with Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., in 1996 to pen
legislation that elevated the embargo from a presidential order to
a federal law. Clinton signed it three weeks after Cuba downed the
Cessnas.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ending or easing the embargo requires an act of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many members of Congress have deferred to colleagues
of Cuban origin or descent _ such as Florida Reps. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, both Republicans _ to take
the lead in formulating U.S.-Cuba policy. With the strong backing
of the country's most powerful anti-Castro lobby, the Miami-based
Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), these members have
sustained the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doing a lot,'' said CANF executive vice president Dennis
Hays, who insists that retaining the embargo maintains pressure on
Castro. Easing it, he said, would only provide access to resources
that could strengthen him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with the regime is counter-productive for our
purposes,'' Hays said, ``and for the cause of allowing the Cubans
to form a normal government.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Cuban-Americans support the embargo, however, and few
strategic analysts think it serves the best interests of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no question that it should end, in terms of a
rational view of the situation,'' said Montclair, N.J., historian
Jane Franklin, author of Cuba and the United States: a
chronological history.
</P>
<P>
   Said Franklin, ``You just can't keep holding American policy
toward Cuba hostage to the most right wing of the Cuban-American
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven-month saga of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez has done
something no policy wonk has yet managed to pull off. It has put
U.S. policy toward Cuba on the radar screen for a lot of Americans
_ and their Congressional representatives _ who paid little
attention up to now.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Nethercutt, is creating a congressional consensus for
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's put a human face on Cuba,'' Nethercutt said, ``a face
other than a bearded one.''

Representatives and the Senate toward mid-July, would permit the
export of American farm products to Cuba and expand sales of U.S.
medicine there.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative's sponsor, Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., sees
it as the first step toward gradually ending the crippling economic
embargo, and eventually tearing away the estrangement, that divides
the United States and its impoverished neighbor 90 miles away
across the Florida Strait.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first brick out of the wall,'' Nethercutt said in a
telephone interview with Cox Newspapers. ``It is a finger out of
the dike, and the water's coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   More holes could soon come unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   There are two other bills pending before Congress aimed at
overhauling U.S. policy meant to isolate the island nation and
strangle the repressive regime of its Communist leader Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   That approach, critics contend, has failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a policy that hasn't worked for 40 years,'' said Rep.
Marshall Sanford, R-S.C., who introduced a bill last May to end
U.S. restrictions on travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to re-evaluate,'' said Mark Seigel,
spokesman for Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., author of a bill to end the
U.S. embargo against Cuba. ``Cubans, 11 million people, are no
better off today than they were 40 years ago when the embargo took
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight Eisenhower imposed an economic embargo on Cuba
in 1960, after Castro set up a totalitarian dictatorship in Havana,
seized American-owned farms and refineries across Cuba as part of
his self-styled Marxist revolution, banned religious activities and
political dissent and cozied up to the Soviet Union, the arch-foe
of U.S. interests at the time.
</P>
<P>
   One of Eisenhower's final acts in office was to break diplomatic
ties with Cuba in January 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, President John F. Kennedy tightened the
embargo, and later prohibited U.S. travel to Cuba, forbade American
banks to finance Cuban undertakings and froze Cuban-owned assets in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   It was the right policy for its time, contends Julia Sweig,
deputy director of Latin American programs with the Council on
Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``On strategic grounds, you can make the case that we won,''
said Sweig. ``Our foreign policy goals during the Cold War, of
reigning Cuba in and keeping the Soviet Union out of this
hemisphere, have been achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   The secondary objective _ bringing down Castro _ is a different
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has that succeeded? Evidently not,'' said Sweig. ``Has it
succeeded in giving the Cuban people a reason to withdraw what
support they do give to Castro? No. Have we had the Velvet
Revolution there? No. It's pretty hard, in terms of evidence, to
say that it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, U.S. policy toward Cuba has become an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   A hallmark of President Clinton's foreign policy, after all, has
been a commitment to engagement, the notion that U.S. trade and
investment, exposure to American practices and ideas, could be
strong engines for change in places like China, Russia, Vietnam
and, as of early June, even North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's instincts, he said last week, are to reach out to Cuba
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I think that anything we can do to engage the Cuban
people, to get them involved in the process of change, to get them
to look outside the world, to get them to look beyond the present
system they have, is a positive thing to do,'' he said at a White
House news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1996, in fact, Clinton was trying to do just
that, by gradually widening provisions for American academicians,
journalists, athletes and others to visit Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The thaw ended abruptly, though, in February 1996, when Castro
ordered Cuban MiG fighters to shoot down two unarmed civilian
airplanes owned by the Miami-based Cuban exile group Brothers to
the Rescue. As they neared Cuban air space on a mission to drop
anti-Castro leaflets over Havana, the planes were destroyed. Three
Cuban-Americans and one Cuban national were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deliberate decision to murder those people changed
everything,'' said Clinton. ``And it made me wonder whether Mr.
Castro was hoping we never would normalize relations, so then he
could use us as an excuse for the failures of his regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The embargo has powerful supporters in this country as well,
including Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms,
R-N.C. He joined with Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., in 1996 to pen
legislation that elevated the embargo from a presidential order to
a federal law. Clinton signed it three weeks after Cuba downed the
Cessnas.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ending or easing the embargo requires an act of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many members of Congress have deferred to colleagues
of Cuban origin or descent _ such as Florida Reps. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, both Republicans _ to take
the lead in formulating U.S.-Cuba policy. With the strong backing
of the country's most powerful anti-Castro lobby, the Miami-based
Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), these members have
sustained the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doing a lot,'' said CANF executive vice president Dennis
Hays, who insists that retaining the embargo maintains pressure on
Castro. Easing it, he said, would only provide access to resources
that could strengthen him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with the regime is counter-productive for our
purposes,'' Hays said, ``and for the cause of allowing the Cubans
to form a normal government.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Cuban-Americans support the embargo, however, and few
strategic analysts think it serves the best interests of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no question that it should end, in terms of a
rational view of the situation,'' said Montclair, N.J., historian
Jane Franklin, author of Cuba and the United States: a
chronological history.
</P>
<P>
   Said Franklin, ``You just can't keep holding American policy
toward Cuba hostage to the most right wing of the Cuban-American
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven-month saga of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez has done
something no policy wonk has yet managed to pull off. It has put
U.S. policy toward Cuba on the radar screen for a lot of Americans
_ and their Congressional representatives _ who paid little
attention up to now.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Nethercutt, is creating a congressional consensus for
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's put a human face on Cuba,'' Nethercutt said, ``a face
other than a bearded one.''

NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT BLOCK'S LUCRATIVE TAX LOANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Texas, Mo.,   Ill.)   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The carefully constructed image of H &UR;  &LR; &AMP; &UR;  &LR; R Block as America's
trusted tax preparer was marred a decade ago, when consumer
advocates accused the company of marketing advances on customers'
tax refunds at usurious interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said flat fees for the two-week loans disguised annual
rates as high as 250 percent. Plaintiffs' lawyers filed a host of
class action lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Block is on the verge of resolving the litigation this month
without admitting any wrongdoing. But critics of the proposed
settlement call it a sham, saying Block has effectively hired
lawyers to sue it on the company's own _ extremely favorable _
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The court proceedings have brought to light details of Block's
business practices that the supreme courts of two states, and other
judges, found sufficiently egregious to warrant trials on whether
the company had betrayed its clients' trust.
</P>
<P>
   A Maryland state judge, for example, found that Block
deliberately confused customers by training its tax preparers to
never use the word loan and instead to sell ``two-day refunds.''
Company documents and testimony by Block officials in various
lawsuits show that Block, whose 9,000 offices prepare one in seven
income tax returns each year, was far more deeply engaged in the
high-cost loan business than its customers or even its critics
realized.
</P>
<P>
   Block, for example, has always emphasized that rather than make
the loans itself, it helps customers obtain them from lenders _ now
exclusively Household Bank, and before that mainly Beneficial
Finance, which Household's parent company bought last year. Federal
law prohibits income tax preparers from making loans to customers,
a rule intended to prevent collusion between taxpayers and tax
preparers.
</P>
<P>
   But the court records show that Block since 1992 has had an
ownership interest in the loans; last year, it retained a
49.9999999 percent interest _ ownership, in other words, of just
one penny shy of half of every $10 million in loan profits. By
holding less than a 50 percent interest in the loans, Block
complies with the anti-collusion rules.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers say that stake, which was not disclosed to
customers until earlier this year _ when Block began acknowledging
an unspecified interest in the loans _ may explain why the company
did not solicit bids for lower rates on its clients' behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the costs increased starting in the 1995 tax year, when
the Internal Revenue Service, worried about fraud tied to refund
loans, suspended its system of providing early notification to
lenders on whether it would honor a taxpayer's refund request. That
increased the risk of unpaid loans, Block says, forcing the company
to raise fees to as high as $89, from what had been as little as
$29, depending on the size of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Effectively, that increased the interest rate on many refund
advances to more than 500 percent on an annualized basis _ roughly
what Mafia loan sharks in New York charge their best customers,
according to a senior official in the New York Police Department.
In some cases, processing delays raised the effective cost of loans
to as much as 1,500 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with the IRS again providing early indications on
refunds, Block says that loan fees were cut by 40 percent over all,
and that it experimented in a few areas with no-fee loans.
</P>
<P>
   The court records show some customers receive their loan
proceeds only a few days faster than if they had waited for the IRS
to deposit the money directly into a checking account _ at no
charge.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the lawsuits, Jenny Lillis, a Block executive who at
the time was in charge of placing advertising, testified in 1995
that ``it's the client's choice, any individual's choice, to spend
whatever amount of money they want in order to get their refund
money back from the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides its undisclosed half-interest in the loans, Block also
secretly collected fees from its banking partners on each loan,
according to the court records, beginning at $3 in 1989 and rising
to $9 by 1997. That year, the company began disclosing the $9 fee
in fine print, after a Texas court ruled that the banks' payments
to Block, if hidden, could violate the state's commercial bribery
statutes.
</P>
<P>
   The refund loans produced 8 percent of Block's total profits
last year, their peak contribution in the three years that the
company has broken out such results. Block, based in Kansas City,
Mo., reported net income of $19.1 million from the loans _ a profit
margin of 21.1 percent. Refund loans accounted for 3.5 percent of
1998 profits and 5.5 percent of 1997 profits.
</P>
<P>
   Block says it always acted properly in arranging the refund
anticipation loans. Clients, many of them repeat borrowers, have
taken out 30 million of the loans since 1989 _ proof, the company
says, of customer satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The court cases, the company added in a statement, ``are
typically driven by a small group of aggressive lawyers, not by
dissatisfied customers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Block has defended itself aggressively, too, and the company
has never lost a lawsuit over the loans.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, its chief litigator, N. Louise Ellingsworth of the
Bryan Cave law firm in St. Louis, obtained court orders barring
lawyers in one case from sharing knowledge with the lawyers in
other cases, which meant long delays as testimony was taken and
re-taken from the same Block and Household executives.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ellingsworth and a spokesman for her law firm repeatedly
declined to comment on any aspect of the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, efforts began to settle the litigation _ but
not with the lawyers who had been in hot pursuit of the company.
</P>
<P>
   That month, testimony shows, lawyers for Beneficial met with
three Chicago area attorneys, one of whom was suing the lender over
refund advances it made for clients of Jackson Hewitt Tax Services,
a Block competitor that was subsequently acquired by the Cendant
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, these lawyers filed two new lawsuits, one
against Beneficial and Block, the other against only Beneficial.
The cases against Beneficial went nowhere, and in January 1999,
Block's lawyers persuaded Judge William B. Zagel of the U.S.
District Court in Chicago to dismiss the suit against it.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, though, Block and Beneficial resumed talks with the
Chicago lawyers. None of the lawyers on either side would say what
prompted the conversations, but they occurred soon after a series
of decisions against Block.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important were rulings by the supreme courts of
Maryland and Texas that loan customers' claims could be tried as
class actions. Ellingsworth had argued that each customer should
have to sue Block individually _ a procedure that would have
discouraged lawyers from pursuing the cases, because filing fees
alone would exceed the damages that could be recovered by any one
customer.
</P>
<P>
   A New York judge ruled that Ellingsworth had engaged in
``patently deceptive'' and manipulative conduct that obstructed
judicial proceedings. Block's lawyers had to pay almost $41,000 in
damages to lawyers suing the company for time they spent fighting
this conduct; later, a New York appeals court barred Ellingsworth
and a colleague from representing Block in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Ellingsworth argued that she had always acted in good
faith and that the actions that offended the New York judges were
Block's, not hers. (MORE)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   By last July, Block and Beneficial had reached agreement with
the Chicago lawyers on the outlines of a settlement intended to
resolve the refund loan cases around the country. One of the
plaintiff's lawyers, Daniel Harris, agreed to revise his pending
case to serve as the vehicle for the agreement _ though Block,
which had been dismissed from that suit, had to ask the court to
reinstate it as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Harris sent a copy of his draft to Ellingsworth. She
faxed him a response, saying she would be making her revisions in
red ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck me as out of line for her to do that,'' said Harris,
who described the sequence of events as ``kind of weird.''
Nonetheless, he said, he adopted some of his adversary's changes _
though Ellingsworth, he added, complained that he had not
incorporated them all.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Zagel gave preliminary approval to the
settlement. In February, he issued an order freezing all the other
cases around the country, several of which were about to go to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed settlement, Block and Household each have
agreed to put up half of a $25 million fund that would pay $15 to
each individual or married couple who took out a refund loan, so
long as no more than 1.67 million claims were filed. If there were
more claims, the size of each payment would be reduced. Any
unclaimed money would revert to Block and Household.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than one million claims have been filed, though
lawyers critical of the settlement say the number would be greater
if the window for filing claims was not restricted to a period when
most people are not thinking about taxes: from April 17, the last
day of the most recent tax filing season, till Dec. 17, which is
before the next season begins.
</P>
<P>
   Block and Household also agreed to pay a total of $4.25 million
to Harris and the three other law firms that ultimately negotiated
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Zagel has scheduled a hearing for July 11 to hear objections to
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Of the lawyers with suits pending against Block, at least 13 are
opposing the settlement, arguing that the company had essentially
hired counsel to sue on the terms it wanted.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Roger Kirby, a New York lawyer with cases pending against Block
in Brooklyn and Manhattan, said the company ``held a silent auction
with only one bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward M. Carstarphen, a Houston lawyer with a class action case
awaiting trial in Texas, said that under the state's commercial
bribery laws, Block was at risk for $1.2 billion in his case alone.
Block lawyers dismiss such figures as wild fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   John C. Coffee, a Columbia University law professor retained as
an expert by the lawyers opposing the settlement, calls the
proposed deal ``pathologically flawed'' and contrary to two recent
U.S. Supreme Court rulings on fairness in class action settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee, in an affidavit, said that since Block had won dismissal
of an earlier lawsuit brought by Harris' three co-counsels, those
lawyers were not hired guns representing clients but instead had
been ``disarmed to the point that they resembled pacifists.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagel has said he sees no merit in Coffee's argument.
</P>
<P>
   Household Bank, in court papers, has said that the proposed
settlement resulted from ``extensive and difficult arms-length
negotiations that spanned nine months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These protracted negotiations, conducted in utmost good faith,
entailed considerable give-and-take on both sides,'' said the bank,
a unit of Household International of Chicago, ``and ultimately
yielded a settlement that confers a substantial benefit on the
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Block, in a statement, said the settlement is a good deal both
for its shareholders and its refund anticipation loan customers,
because it ``will include all RAL customers, end all current RAL
litigation and discourage future litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Harris, the Chicago lawyer, twice refused to be
interviewed about his discussions with the company's lawyers. ``I
have to ask Block,'' he explained each time. Then Harris called a
reporter back and said he wanted to be interviewed about the
reasons that the settlement ``is a good deal'' for refund loan
customers, given ``how weak the claims are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This litigation has been going on for years, and it has not
been very successful,'' Harris noted.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client, DeCarlo Turner, a municipal worker in
Dolton, Ill., was wronged when she was told that a refund loan
would cost $29 and Beneficial later tacked on a $20 paperwork fee
at the loan closing. ``It was a bait-and-switch,'' Harris said. But
he added that it was unclear how many people were damaged in this
way and if they could be identified _ which made pursuing a class
action case problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, he said, was it clear that Block had done anything wrong by
collecting fees from the banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it illegal for Beneficial to pay Block a portion of the
finance charge?'' Harris said. ``Is that a kickback? That
depends.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.S)
</P>
<P>
   As for other lawyers who pressed the argument, ``it was an issue
that was frequently, often, generally, lost, because it is about a
relationship between Block and its customers,'' he asserted. ``It
is not a lawyer-client matter that is a fiduciary relationship as a
matter of law, so trying to prove that on a classwide basis would
be kind of impractical.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said there were other weaknesses in the plaintiffs'
cases, too, including questions about whether some cases were too
old to be eligible for recompense. But he acknowledged that until
Beneficial initiated the settlement discussions, he had not
questioned anyone under oath about the refund loans and had not
examined any internal bank documents.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The settlement of the lawsuits over refund advances would come
as Block is trying to transform itself into a full-service
financial company selling investment advice, retirement plans and
accounting to the mainly working-class and middle-class Americans
who are the prime market for its tax preparation services.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Block acquired Olde Financial, a brokerage firm,
along with a mortgage company and the nation's seventh-largest
accounting firm. The company's chairman and co-founder, Henry W.
Bloch, 77, plans to retire in September; active leadership of the
company is scheduled to fall to its president, Mark A. Ernst, a
former American Express executive who has championed the
full-service strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The refund loan business, Block has said in securities filings
and court papers, is aimed at low-income people. While Block and
its banking partners describe the loans as a benefit to their
customers, an internal memo filed in court showed that at
Beneficial, at least, there had been debate about the propriety of
the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Kuntz, who at the time worked for Beneficial, recounted
in the 1995 memo how she had dressed down a colleague for
describing the refund anticipation loan clients as ``one step above
pond scum.'' The true picture, she wrote, was of a person ``one
step away from financial disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire concept of this RAL program is appealing to the
poor, the destitute and the desperate,'' Kuntz wrote. ``Even the
most desperate customers I have interviewed have expressed dismay
at the prices'' charged for the loans, ``but they have resignedly
acquiesced because of their financial plight.''
</P>
<P>
   Household Bank said it had no comment on the memo.
</P>
<P>
   Kuntz wrote that the ``average fiscally sound person'' would not
take out a high-interest loan to get his own money back from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The refund loan business depends on people ignoring a truism of
financial planning: Avoid tax refunds, because they represent
interest-free loans to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Documents in the court records show that when President George
Bush lowered payroll withholding rates in 1992, Block contacted its
refund loan customers to show them how to increase their
withholding back to the old levels. Linda MacDougall, a Block
spokeswoman, explained that many customers want large refunds,
regarding them not as a lost opportunity to use their money sooner,
but as ``their annual bonus check'' from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Lillis, the Block advertising executive, testified in one of the
lawsuits that Block's research found that many customers judged the
company's competence by the size of their refund.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Block has continued looking for ways to increase profits from
its refund loan customers.
</P>
<P>
   This year Block began its Refund Rewards program, offering a
prepaid Mastercard to customers due tax refunds. Refund Rewards
also offers discounts on automobiles, air travel and other goods
and services that MacDougall, the Block spokeswoman, described as
``valuable benefits'' to help people stretch their tax refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Like debit cards, the prepaid charge cards allow customers to
draw down their refund loan proceeds as they make purchases. But if
the balance slips below $50 for 60 days, Block closes the account
and refunds the balance _ after deducting a $19.95 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of
America, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington, said the prepaid
card was a bad deal and appeared to be designed to create status
for people who could not otherwise qualify for a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be far more sensible for taxpayers to take the refund
and deposit it in a checking or savings account,'' he said, ``than
to let Block earn interest on their money.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Big wave of flag sales arises from South Carolina debate
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRAWFORDVILLE, Ga. _ Soren Dresch's home-based company is to the
flag business what L.L. Bean is to polo shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Need a skull and crossbones? Use your credit card and order it
from the Ruffin Flag Company catalog. You'll find the rising sun of
Japan, the red maple leaf of Canada, the Red Cross, the St. Andrews
Cross, the flag of every U.N. nation, the flag of every state.
</P>
<P>
   Even South Carolina has called.
</P>
<P>
   Today, South Carolina will remove the controversial Rebel flag
from its Statehouse dome and raise a square version at the
Confederate Soldiers Monument in front of the capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Both heavy cotton banners are stitched by Ruffin seamstresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in a position to make the type of Confederate flag
in the time we needed,'' said Michael Sponhour, spokesman for the
South Carolina Budget and Control Board, the state agency
responsible for coordinating today's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only could they supply what we needed,'' Sponhour said,
``but they had the best price.''
</P>
<P>
   Dresch, 36, sold South Carolina 50 square battle flags for $30
each. The next lowest bidder offered flags for $71 each.
</P>
<P>
   Dresch started the company a decade ago, ultimately moving it to
this rural town an hour west of Augusta, Ga. He named the company
for Edmund Ruffin, the man thought to have fired the first shot of
the Civil War at Fort Sumter off the coast of Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen Apostolic Lutheran seamstresses in Michigan and
Wisconsin comprise the backbone of the company's staff. They piece
together premium, custom-ordered flags in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not exactly like the Amish, but they're good with
sewing machines,'' said Dresch, an Ohio native. Because Ruffin is a
mail-order outfit, Dresch could run the business from anywhere. He
wanted a small-town location near metro Atlanta and found two
houses for sale in Crawfordville.
</P>
<P>
   It is only happenstance, Dresch said, that the business is
located across the street from the A. H. Stephens State Park, named
for a former Georgia governor _ and the vice president of the
Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know who Stephens was,'' said Dresch.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's enduring flag controversy has caused a boom at
Ruffin, run out of a 1,400-square-foot cottage with wooden floors
and a tin roof. Four rooms are cluttered with flags, license
plates, key chains, ties and Confederate coffee packaged with the
slogan, ``The Taste That Secedes.'' Outside, Confederate flags
flutter on the porch and on two poles outside.
</P>
<P>
   The family business barely can keep in stock 3-foot-by-5-foot
Confederate naval jacks, familiar rectangular banners with a blood
red background and a sea blue ``X'' marked by 13 white stars _ one
for each state of the Confederacy. Dresch estimates he's lost
nearly $10,000 in sales because they can't make enough battle
flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently, the demand has kept us stressed out,'' said Dresch,
a communications and advertising graduate from the University of
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffin made 5,000 battle flags at the beginning of May, selling
them all in about a month. The company made 10,000 more and has
rushed out more than a thousand of them to market.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Ruffin has supplied Confederate battle flags to
members of the South Carolina General Assembly, who sell the flags
to the general public. Legislators stopped taking orders in May.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Dresch has backed yellow Penske rental trucks up to
the granite South Carolina state house and delivered boxes upon
boxes of flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants one because of the South Carolina situation,''
Dresch said. ``Whenever you drive off the interstate (in South
Carolina) or go on a state highway, you see them everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Dresch is concerned the Rebel flag uproar has pigeon-holed his
company as a Dixie-only company. To broaden Ruffin's image, he's
promoting the company through an additional Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Dresch's clients include Jamaica, which ordered flags for a new
international airport on the island, and the Vermont Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the Elian Gonzalez saga, a Miami flag dealer
called and wanted 100,000 Cuban banners made in a week _ a demand
Ruffin just couldn't meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just so unrealistic,'' Dresch said.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, black lawmakers have asked Dresch to reproduce the
Peach State's flag from before 1956, the year the Legislature added
the Confederate battle emblem to the state banner. Friends who
support Georgia's Rebel insignia have asked Dresch not to make the
pre-1956 version.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be hypocritical if I didn't make it,'' said Dresch.
``We're a flag business. We're not a political entity. If I
attached a political significance to everything, I wouldn't make
anything and I'd be out of business.''

AT&AMP;T MAY SPIN OFF ITS LONG-DISTANCE UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes ``44 cents'' to ``31 cents'' in 3rd graf. Changes
``$27.02'' to ``$33'' in 7th graf, which begins ``In recent years
...'') 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is considering spinning off its long-distance telephone
operation, the largest in the United States, as a separately traded
tracking stock, people close to the company said this week.
</P>
<P>
   No such plan has yet been presented to AT&AMP;T's board by its
management, the people said. AT&AMP;T declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   One reason AT&AMP;T may want to issue a new stock to track the
long-distance unit is that the shares have languished recently.
Shares of AT&AMP;T hit a new 52-week low during trading Friday and
closed at $31.8125, down 31 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company's management is eager to bolster the stock price and
may believe that issuing a new stock could boost AT&AMP;T's share
price.
</P>
<P>
   If the shrinking consumer long-distance unit were made separate,
the remainder of the company would show faster growth. Those
remaining units would include the operation that sells
communication services, as well as data services, to business
customers, and AT&AMP;T's cable television operation, the largest in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's consumer long-distance operation generates about $20
billion a year in revenue, but is shrinking. In the first quarter,
that unit reported $5.1 billion in revenue, down 5.6 percent from
the comparable period of 1999. The consumer long-distance business
is shrinking, because many other companies compete against AT&AMP;T in
the long-distance business and prices have come down quickly in
that market.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many companies have offered new shares that are
meant to track the performance of specific units in those
companies. Tracking stocks do not, however, represent any actual
economic interest in the unit that they represent. In April, AT&AMP;T
offered new shares meant to track the performance of its
fast-growing wireless business. Those shares of AT&AMP;T Wireless Group
were offered to the public at $29.50 on April 27 and closed Friday
at $33.
</P>
<P>
   Companies generally offer tracking stocks for their units that
are growing quickly. Because AT&AMP;T's consumer long-distance unit is
shrinking, however, it is unclear what investors would be willing
to pay for such a stock.
</P>
<P>
   While it is shrinking, AT&AMP;T's consumer long-distance unit does
generate a lot of cash for the company. In the first quarter, that
unit generated $2 billion in earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, up 4 percent from the comparable
period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people own AT&AMP;T's stock, making it one of the most
widely held in the nation. For decades, AT&AMP;T enjoyed a monopoly in
the long-distance telephone industry, but that monopoly began to
crumble under assault from the government and from competitors like
MCI in the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Since the old American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph Co. was broken up
in 1984, the remaining long-distance company has lost share in the
long-distance market every year. It has been very hard for AT&AMP;T to
compete against smaller companies that have lower costs, according
to analysts and industry experts.

SECOND QUARTER SEES SLOWDOWN FOR BUSINESSES RAISING CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Wall Street, the second quarter roared in like a
wildfire then fizzled to a campfire.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp downturn in the Nasdaq stock market in April doused the
market for new issues of stock that had been strong in the first
quarter. By late June, dozens of companies had shelved plans to go
public, and some that tested the market were sorely disappointed.
Rising interest rates depressed the market for all sorts of new
corporate bonds, especially those from companies with poor credit
ratings, which are known as junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The total amount of money raised in the United States by
investment banks _ $451 billion _ was down 24 percent from the
second quarter of 1999. The total number of stock and bond
offerings in American markets fell to 3,823 in the second quarter
from 5,047 in the second quarter of 1999. Last quarter ranked
eighth in terms of amounts raised by quarter in the United States
capital markets, according to Thomson Financial/Securities Data in
Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The slump hit investment banks just as they were rushing to hire
new bankers, and raising pay and improving benefits to keep their
employees from leaving for Internet start-ups. Disclosed fees for
underwriting new issues sank about 45 percent, to $2.64 billion,
from $4.8 billion in the first quarter of 2000, and about 20
percent from $3.29 billion in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first quarter was as heady a market as we'd ever seen,''
said Jeff Edwards, co-manager of stock capital markets at Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. But after the stock market swooned in mid-April, he
said, ``there was a general pullback of all investors, retail and
institutional.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the newfound reluctance of investors to buy shares
of untested companies, underwriters managed to float some landmark
new issues. Most notable was the $10.6 billion spinoff of shares in
AT&AMP;T Wireless, the biggest initial offering by an American company.
</P>
<P>
   The $9 billion of that total raised in the United States
accounted for more than one-third of the $24.5 billion raised
through first-time stock offerings in the quarter, and it accounted
for the bulk of the initial offering proceeds raised by two of the
biggest investment banks, Merrill Lynch and the Salomon Smith
Barney unit of Citigroup. Each of those firms was a lead manager,
along with the Goldman Sachs Group, of the AT&AMP;T Wireless offering,
and received credit for one-third of the proceeds from the United
States, or about $3 billion. Aside from that deal, Merrill raised
about $900 million in initial offerings and Salomon raised about
$750 million, according to Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   An initial offering is the most lucrative type of underwriting,
leaving investment banks with as much as 7 percent of the money
raised from investors. Goldman Sachs again was the leading
underwriter of initial offerings and all issues of common stock,
commanding about 25 percent of the market so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman managed several huge offerings during the rockiest
period of the quarter in April, including the $4.6 billion initial
offering of the insurer MetLife and the $3 billion spinoff of the
T-Online subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back over the quarter, Mark Tercek, a managing director
of Goldman's stock underwriting business, said: ``While market
conditions were more difficult, we were still able to get a lot of
deals done for companies of all stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, investors are taking a more disciplined approach
than they were during the IPO frenzy that ran through much of last
year and into the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very ebullient, extraordinary period of time and it
largely is over,'' Tercek said.
</P>
<P>
   After a weak May, the market for new stock started to recover in
June and companies rushed back in to sell stock. Still, the market
for new stocks was significantly stronger than the market for debt
issued by corporations. As the Federal Reserve continued to raise
short-term interest rates, investors were wary to buy bonds,
especially those that mature in 10 years to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors showed a distinct aversion to risky bonds promising
high yields. There were only 66 junk-bond offerings in the quarter,
down almost two-thirds from 178 in the second quarter of 1999. They
raised just $7.5 billion, down from $32.2 billion the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual shutdown of the junk-bond market came at the worst
time for many young Internet companies that found that they could
not finance their growth plans either by issuing stock or by
borrowing in the public bond markets. That situation left some
Internet retailers and other electronic-commerce companies no
choice but to sell out or go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   For blue-chip companies, the borrowing was easier at the end of
the quarter, after the Labor Department's report on employment in
May eased fears of further rate increases by the Fed. After that
report hinted that the economy might be cooling, investors showed
more interest in high-grade corporate bonds that mature in 10 years
or more, said Randy Snook, managing director of corporate bond
underwriting at Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the year has been unusual in that the amount of
short-term issuance has been quite high,'' Snook said. ``You can
count the number of 30-year bonds issued from corporations on two
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwriters were encouraged by the reception for a $9.5 billion
sale of bonds in the United States by Deutsche Telekom, which was
split almost evenly among 5-year, 10-year and 30-year notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not expecting an avalanche of activity,'' said Snook.
But, he said, ``We feel we have entered a period of much better
market conditions than we've had in much of the first and second
quarters.''

FLIGHT TESTS BY IRAQ SHOW PROGRESS OF MISSILE PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo NYT17 is being sent to NYT photo clients.

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eighteen months after U.S. and British warplanes
badly damaged its missile factories, Iraq has restarted its missile
program and flight-tested a short-range ballistic missile, Clinton
administration and U.S. military officials said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The tests _ eight in all, including one on Tuesday _ have
involved Al Samoud, a liquid-fueled ballistic missile that could
carry conventional explosives or the chemical and biological
weapons that Iraq is still suspected of hiding, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Because its range is less than 150 kilometers, or under 95
miles, the missile does not violate U.N. restrictions imposed on
Iraq after the Persian Gulf War in 1991. But the flight tests show
that production plants and research labs destroyed in four nights
of U.S. and British strikes in December 1998 have been rebuilt and
have resumed work, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The missile's range, shorter than that of the Russian-made Scud
missiles that Iraq fired at Israel and Saudi Arabia during the war,
does not pose a significant threat to Iraq's neighbors or U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But they view the testing as evidence that Iraq is still working
to perfect its ballistic missile technology, which could be adapted
to missiles with a longer range.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's program has intensified fears within the administration
and the Pentagon that in the prolonged absence of international
weapons inspectors, President Saddam Hussein may already be
covertly working on, though not testing, longer-range missiles.
Such work would violate the U.N. restrictions and would confront
the United States with the difficult choice of how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see things up and functioning,'' Gen.
Anthony Zinni, the commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf
region, said in an interview on Monday, before the most recent
missile test. ``What he learns from these tests, the technological
developments and the other things he picks up, are transferable to
longer-range missiles. I mean it's not a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain attacked Iraq in 1998 to punish
Hussein's government for halting all cooperation with international
inspectors searching for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,
as well as the missiles that can carry them. Iraq agreed to forsake
those weapons as a condition for the United States and its allies
ending the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A significant number of the targets struck in the 1998 raids _
12 of 100 overall _ were industrial and military factories involved
in Iraq's missile program, including one in the Taji military
complex north of Baghdad and the nearby Ibn Al Haytham missile
research center, where the Al Samoud is made.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acknowledged earlier this year that Iraq had
managed to rebuild many of the structures damaged or destroyed, but
the extent of its missile program and its continued testing has not
previously been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never claimed it was permanent,'' a senior defense official
said of the damage done 18 months ago. ``Whatever you can build,
you can rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Al Samoud did not yet appear ready for
deployment. They said their analysis of the tests _ monitored by
U.S. satellites, radars and aircraft patrolling the ``no flight''
zones over northern and southern Iraq _ found significant problems
with the missile.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have all kinds of problems with it,'' an official said.
``They can't get the guidance to work right. They can't get the
engines to work right. It's not close to going into production, but
they are persistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, Iraq had many missiles, so presumably it still
has the technology to build them, even though for a decade it has
been proscribed from working on longer-range missiles, and from
buying equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the missiles tests comes at a time when the
administration's policy toward Iraq has faced intensifying
diplomatic criticism and international concern that the sanctions
are punishing the Iraqi people, not Hussein's government. The
administration's policy is also emerging as an issue in the
presidential campaign between Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word policy is probably an overstatement in describing the
administration attitude toward Iraq,'' Richard Perle, a former
assistant secretary of defense and now an adviser to Bush's
campaign, said to a Senate subcommittee on Wednesday. ``Paralysis
is probably more appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the attacks in 1998, there have been no international
inspections of Iraq's weapons programs _ and for months before
there was little meaningful monitoring because of Iraq's refusal to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the United States joined the other members of
the U.N. Security Council in approving a new inspection system, but
the system's new director, Hans Blix, has moved slowly to assemble
a team of inspectors. And despite an offer to ease sanctions if the
new inspections find no evidence of weapons programs, Iraq has
insisted it will not cooperate with any new inspectors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Iraq began work on the Al Samoud _ which, in Arabic, means
resistance _ after the Persian Gulf War. The missile is believed to
be a variant of the Soviet-era SA-2, the type of surface-to-air
missile that shot down the U-2 flown by Francis Gary Powers over
the Soviet Union in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq first tested the missile in 1997 under supervision of the
previous team of international inspectors, known as UNSCOM, which
sought to ensure that the missile remained within the proscribed
range.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. and British strikes in 1998, Pentagon officials
said they set back Iraq's missile program one to two years.
However, the damage to the missile centers now appears to have
derailed the program far less significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Flight tests resumed as early as May 1999, when Iraq fired a
test into the desert west of Baghdad. Since then Iraq has conducted
seven more tests, including the one on Tuesday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the missile flights have stayed within the U.N. limits,
they said. ``They are being very careful,'' one said. ``They are
not giving us any reason to go clobber them.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous U.S. reports, including one by the State Department in
1998, have said that Iraq imports missile parts and other needed
equipment through ``clandestine procurement networks,'' and the
officials said that Iraq was still seeking to acquire parts on the
international arms market.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence experts also believe that Iraq still has 20 to
40 longer-range Scud missiles that it has hidden since the end of
the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni and officials in Washington declined to publicly discuss
the Al Samoud tests in detail, but one administration official who
closely follows Iraq said the Iraqi program was vigorous and
persistent. This official said the effort served as ``a kind of
surrogate for their longer-range programs.''

REPORTS OF AIDS CASES JUMP IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash.)   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A small but sharp rise in new infections with the AIDS virus has
been detected among gay men in San Francisco over the last three
years, San Francisco health officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated number of new infections in San Francisco nearly
doubled to 900 last year from about 500 three years ago after
having stabilized following aggressive prevention campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The rise is deeply troubling because it was seen in San
Francisco, one of the principal centers of the AIDS epidemic that
was first detected in 1981. Thus, the rise could signal a new wave
of infections there and elsewhere, San Francisco health officials
said. San Francisco, New York City and Los Angeles were the three
cities where AIDS was first recognized. An estimated 6,000 new
infections with HIV, the AIDS virus, occurred in San Francisco at
the peak of the epidemic there in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco health officials linked the rise to a trend toward
riskier behavior that has been noted in a number of cities over
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael H. Katz, the director of the San Francisco
Department of Public Health, said his was the first city to make
such a link directly. ``One might have assumed it,'' Katz said,
``but until this report, it was not documented by data.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald O. Valdiserri, an AIDS expert at the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said his agency had
not reviewed the San Francisco findings. But, if confirmed, the
findings ``are very serious and important,'' Valdiserri said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Valdiserri said he did not ``want to be alarmist about a
national resurgence'' of HIV. But, he went on, ``we have been
trying to sound the alarm about the misperception that the AIDS
epidemic is over and not an issue any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta diseases centers, which are responsible for tracking
AIDS nationally, estimate that about 40,000 new infections with HIV
will occur this year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The new information from San Francisco ``is very sobering and I
hope it gets the attention of policy-makers,'' Valdiserri said.
</P>
<P>
   The rise was detected by using a new test, developed by the CDC
that allows health workers to distinguish between recent HIV
infections and those that were acquired months to years ago, San
Francisco health officials said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When San Francisco health officials learned about the new
testing strategy, they moved quickly to apply it in a number of
testing sites, said Dr. Willi McFarland, the head of infection
surveillance for the San Francisco Department of Public Health.
They are known as anonymous testing sites because they provide
testing without identifying individuals. McFarland said that his
team used the new test among individuals found to be infected at
these sites each year.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy involves testing the infected blood twice, using
both a sensitive and less sensitive method. The body forms
antibodies against HIV and other infectious agents, and such
antibodies tend to be elevated in the blood during the first few
months after infection. Thus, individuals infected recently are
likely to react positive on a sensitive test but negative on a less
sensitive test.
</P>
<P>
   The test is becoming a powerful new tool for epidemiologists
tracking the AIDS epidemic, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities are using the test in various ways. San Francisco
apparently is the only city that has applied the testing strategy
in a series of years so as to detect trends, Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the San Francisco team published an article in the
Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes showing the
validity of the method for such purposes. However, tests of
infections detected from 1996 through 1998 did not show a worrisome
trend.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when the team tested the 1999 cases and analyzed the
information to focus on gay men, that the researchers saw the trend
toward higher HIV incidence, Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Infection rates from earlier than 1996 could not be obtained
because samples had not been stored for such purposes, Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   The HIV incidence among gay men at the anonymous testing sites
nearly tripled to 3.7 percent per year in 1999 from a low of 1.3
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The rise was seen only among gay men, McFarland said, noting
that his department has not detected a single new HIV infection in
a male heterosexual and only one new infection in a female and a
small number of injecting drug users.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have noted a decline in reported use of condoms
on a consistent basis; an increase in reported unprotected anal
sex; and an increase in sex with multiple partners.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rates of other sexually transmitted infections like
gonorrhea and syphilis are at or near record lows, they have risen
in certain areas. Syphilis rates have increased in San Francisco
and Los Angeles, and gonorrhea rates have increased in Seattle, the
health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what makes this important,'' Katz said. ``it is the
first report to link new infections to higher unsafe sexual
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The new information is scheduled to be presented at the 13th
International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa, on July 11,
but it was released Friday because a news blackout had been broken,
Katz said.

IN SAUDI ENCYCLOPEDIA, DESERT KINGDOM UNVEILS ITS PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for better hed)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a culture of silence, words can be weapons. In perhaps no
contemporary state has the written word proved more threatening
than in Saudi Arabia, where sins, sources of shame and sometimes
even accomplishments tend to be hidden away.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with a determined lack of fanfare nearly a decade ago
that Prince Khaled bin Sultan, the Saudi media baron and former
co-commander of the military coalition against Iraq in the Persian
Gulf war, opened a front in the cultural war against silence in his
country, even as he prepared to lead the multinational forces into
battle to free Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1990, the prince quietly agreed to finance an
ambitious project by a group of Saudi scholars to document the
country's rich cultural heritage and traditions before they
disappeared. Ten years and several million dollars later, the
Encyclopedia of Folklore of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a
12-volume, Arabic-language compendium of a vanishing way of life,
has just been printed in Belgium. Its authors say that the series,
which includes 5,000 drawings, illustrations and graphs, is the
largest body of secular scholarship ever produced in Saudi Arabia.
It includes separate volumes on topics like historical and
archaeological sites, traditional medicine, geography, even
children's games. And there is an entire volume devoted to the
camel.
</P>
<P>
   While the prince said he had contemplated such a project for two
years before the gulf war, the conflict was the project's main
catalyst. ``The widespread ignorance of Saudi Arabia and its
cultural heritage, not just among foreigners but among younger
Saudis made me determined to try and document and preserve our
traditions before it was too late,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to oil wealth, life styles have changed faster and more
dramatically in Saudi Arabia than in almost any other country.
Fifty-year-old Saudis can recall baked-mud hovels, with neither
electricity nor running water, in which most of them were raised,
but young Saudis today can barely imagine life without the
Internet, cellular telephones, vacations abroad, air-conditioned
suburban homes, sport utility vehicles and fancy shopping malls.
Few have ever even ridden a camel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Saudi contributors to the volumes say that a work of this
nature could probably not have been undertaken as long as tribal
and regional divisions continued to plague the kingdom.Oil wealth
has helped unify Saudis politically and culturally, said Sa'ad
al-Sowayan, an anthropologist with a doctorate from the University
of California at Berkeley and the encyclopedia's chief editor.
Until Saudis spoke the same Arabic dialect and tribal and regional
cultural differences diminished, a project examining the country's
heritage would have been too contentious to be approved by the
censors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he observed, until recently many Saudi scholars
viewed folk culture as academically dubious. They believed that
attention to traditional ways of life emphasized backwardness. But
after the gulf war, Sowayan said, ``people realized that our old
civilization was dying out, and that we had a limited window to
capture what was being lost, mostly through memory. It gave us a
renewed sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 75 leading Saudi scholars and writers contributed to the
encyclopedia. Their texts were then vetted by older, often
uneducated Saudis who still remembered many of the nearly extinct
customs.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the 547-page volume on the camel. The volume notes that
it was the domestication of this amazingly adaptive, aggressive,
often crotchety creature that made Bedouin nomadic life possible.
Saudis rarely tired of extolling the camel's endurance,
forbearance, fortitude and other virtues in chants, conversation,
lore and song. Bedouin poetry likens the swishing of the camel's
tail to the swaying of the unbraided plaits of a beautiful young
woman dancing on her wedding night. Without the camel, Sowayan
said, nearly a third of the Arabic language would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that the Arabs stole camels from the Jews. Because
in Saudi lore the Jews are said to be still longing for their
animals, the Bedouins describe any false hope by likening it to the
hope of the Jews for the camels' return.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the volume asserts, the camel was superseded as the
major symbol of Arabia by the palm tree, the emblem of the
sedentary farmers, merchants and traders who were the Muslim
prophet Muhammad's first and most enduring followers. This
community, which loathed and feared the warring Bedouins, imposed
its written, settled culture on nomadic culture, said Abdulaziz
Fahad, a lawyer and an early champion of the project. As a result,
Saudi society remains deeply ambivalent about the desert and the
traditional Bedouin life.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that traditional culture has vanished beyond memory and
retrieval. The encyclopedia, for instance, includes no volumes on
folk songs or traditional dancing because Sowayan could not find
qualified authorities to write them. Nor is there a volume on Islam
or any of Arabia's pre-Islamic religions.Religion is not folk
culture, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the volumes may stir controversy among some of the
kingdom's more rigid, literal-minded clerics. As one contributor
said, conservatives won't like the discussions of ``un-Islamic''
traditions and beliefs, or the books' many representational
photographs and drawings, which they say are prohibited by Islam.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the encyclopedia has had no problem winning official
blessing. Because the Saudi government decided some two decades ago
that any genuine encyclopedia would not be censored, the Ministry
of Information, which routinely blacks out with felt-tipped pens
magazine photographs considered too licentious, approved the
encyclopedia with its pictures and drawings in less than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This work will not only help us preserve our vanishing past,
but by examining the past, will emphasize our new cultural and
political unity,'' Sowayan said.``In that sense, it is a truly
nationalist project.''

 &HT;    GORE FIRES UP LATINOS OVER CONFIRMATION FLAP
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore sought to shore up his
standing with Hispanic voters Friday night with a speech that
included subtle reminders of the Latino community's political
differences with the Republican leadership of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to one of the oldest Latino political organizations,
Gore stoked the anger of hundreds of Latino activists over the
GOP-controlled Senate's refusal to confirm Enrique Moreno, an El
Paso lawyer, to a federal judgeship in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to call upon the Congress to stop playing politics
with judicial nominations and confirm Enrique Moreno,'' Gore said
during the final proceedings of the national convention of the
League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a terrific nominee,'' Gore added. ``And I do not
understand the delay. I do not understand the excuses that are
offered.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton nominated Moreno to the 5th Circuit Court of
Appeals last September, but the nomination has languished in the
Senate. Texas's two Republican senators, Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey
Hutchinson, have blocked the nomination, saying Moreno is too
inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   But LULAC National President Rick Dovalina, said Moreno ``could
not be more qualified.'' Moreno, a graduate of Harvard Law School,
has been in private practice since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Moreno judicial appointment was one of several issues Gore
mentioned that have driven Hispanic voters away from the Republican
Party since the 1994 GOP takeover of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He also cited the GOP's past opposition to bilingual education,
federal hate crime legislation and the appointment of Bill Lann Lee
to head up the Justice Department's civil rights division.
</P>
<P>
   And in an apparent reference to anti-immigrant measures pushed
during Pete Wilson's term as governor of California, Gore said, ``I
also don't understand why some have been so vitriolic in their
discrimination against immigrants because I believe in an America
where we recognize our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   To further underscore his differences with the Republican
leadership of Congress, Gore brought with him Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson, who has been under fire on Capitol Hill for security
lapses at Los Alamos nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, the highest ranking Hispanic in the Clinton cabinet,
received a standing ovation as he arrived on stage to introduce
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, did not
mention his likely Republican opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
But his criticism of the Republican leaders in Congress underscored
Bush's political dilemma of distancing his own brand of
``compassionate conservatism'' from the harsher, anti-immigrant
rhetoric that, until recently, has been a hallmark of the GOP
takeover of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's targeting of the GOP congressional leaders comes as polls
show Bush making inroads with Hispanic voters, a key voting bloc
for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has a wide lead over Bush among Hispanic voters,
the Texas governor is getting much more support than Republican
presidential candidates usually do.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a national poll of Hispanics this week by the
Knight Ridder news organization showed Gore leading 50 percent to
34 percent. But that was less than the 71 percent of Hispanic votes
Clinton got in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a survey released this week by Miami pollster Sergio
Bendixen showed Gore ahead among Hispanics by 22 percent
nationally, but showed Bush running ahead by 75 percent to 16
percent among Cuban Americans, who are concentrated in Florida and
New Jersey, two of the most important states in the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics make up only about 5 percent of the overall
electorate, but they have much bigger percentages of voters in the
four biggest states: California (13 percent), Texas (20 percent),
New York (9 percent) and Florida (12 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In California, the most populous state, recent polls have showed
Gore leading 2-1 among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush will be in California next week to address the
national convention of the National Council of La Raza, another
influential Hispanic organization.

STOCKS DOWN SHARPLY IN 2ND QUARTER, LEAVING ALL INDEXES LOWER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks plunged in the second quarter of the year,
leaving all the major indexes down for the first half as the
Federal Reserve continued to try to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index lost 13.3 percent in the quarter, its
first loss since the third quarter of 1998. The decline more than
wiped out its January-March advance and left it down 2.5 percent
for the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average declined 4.3 percent in the
second quarter and is now down 9.1 percent so far this year. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index slumped 2.9 percent in the
quarter and closed out the first half down 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also decided that many high-tech and Internet shares
were overpriced and it was time to cash in some profits, sending
many issues plummeting. Amazon.com, the cyberspace retailer, closed
midyear at 36 5/16 after trading as high as 106 11/16 during the
Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly did deflate a good portion of the speculative
bubble called the Internet,'' said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment
strategist at State Street Global Advisers in Boston. ``A number of
investors finally recognized that there is risk in the risk-reward
equation.''
</P>
<P>
   But investment money has to go somewhere and this time the
beneficiaries tended to be drug and other health-care companies,
real estate investment trusts and utilities. Stocks of
semiconductor companies also climbed.
</P>
<P>
   And technology was not a one-way street. After hitting a record
5,048.62 late in the first quarter, March 10, the tech-dominated
Nasdaq composite fell as low as 3,164.55 on May 23 before
recovering to 4,064.01 on June 21 and then tailing off again. It
closed Friday at 3,966.11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve's 50 basis-point tightening was a bit of a
watershed,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager for
Dreyfus Corp., referring to a May 16 increase of a half percentage
point in the overnight lending rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In mid-May, things suddenly reversed'' in the stock market, he
added. ``Interest-rate sensitive stocks went out of favor and tech
came back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors shied away from fledgling companies, many of
them with no profits and scarcely any revenue. A flurry of 18
initial public offerings reached the market this week to lift the
quarter's total to 104, but this was far short of the 141 companies
that went public in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world changed,'' said Richard Peterson, market analyst at
Thomson Financial Securities Data, which tracks initial public
offerings, noting that 52 of the 104 deals were marketed at prices
below the range projected in their original filings. In the first
quarter 91 of these issues were priced above the filing range.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the quarter's biggest Nasdaq stars were technology
companies, led by Ixys Corp., a semiconductor company based in
Santa Clara, Calif. With a 3]-point surge Friday to 53], the stock
nearly quadrupled from its March 31 price of 13 9/16. Adept
Technology, up 6 11/16 Friday, ended the quarter at 46}, up from 12
on March 31. The biggest loser, excluding companies that filed for
bankruptcy, was Fidelity Holdings of New York, which lost 94
percent of its value, closing at 1\.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Keithley Instruments, which
makes electronic measuring equipments, soared 264 percent followed
by Lilly Industries, up 142 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Entrade, a Northfield, Ill., business-to-business Internet
company, plunged 77 percent, to 7 1/16. The Chyron Corp. Dynex
Capital also lost more than 70 percent of their market value.
</P>
<P>
   The average technology mutual fund fell about 13 percent during
the quarter, according to Christopher Traulsen, an analyst for
Morningstar. This contrasted with an 18 percent advance in the
first three months of 2000. Last year, the average tech fund soared
135 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some flight to quality, into bigger, steadier
companies'' within the technology stock group, Traulsen said.

 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for Sunday.
 &HT;    Most agree that driving and using cellphone is dangerous
according to Texas study
 &HT;    By Samantha Sommer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As more than 94 million wireless phone users are
taking to the road nationwide, a new poll shows Texans fear that
chatting drivers are a big risk at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted May 22 to June 16 by Scripps Howard Data
Center, surveyed 1,000 Texans by telephone in a systematic random
sample. The margin of error is 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, 42 percent of Texans polled own cellular
phones. Of those, 55 percent use the phones daily and 27 percent
use them daily while driving, but only 20 percent use hands-free
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, 92 percent of those asked said driving and talking
on the phone is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of legislation, 59 percent polled said they would
support state legislation banning talking on the phone while
driving and 56 percent said they would support a similar measure by
their local city government.
</P>
<P>
   The survey results point to drivers growing frustrations with
cellular phone users distracted at the wheel, said State Rep. Paul
Moreno of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have observed a lot of people driving and using a cell
phone. It seems like it is every other person,'' he said. ``It
creates a danger _ not only to themselves, but to me as well.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past session, Moreno proposed a bill to limit
cellular phone usage while driving to only when the car is stopped
or with hands-free equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The bill died in a transportation subcommittee, but Moreno said
it had widespread support in the House and that he most likely will
bring it up again at the next session in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Just how dangerous using the phone while driving is in Texas is
unclear. Most law enforcement agencies do not track cell phone use
in accidents. The Texas Department of Public Safety just started,
so no statistics are available yet, said spokesman Tom Vinger.
Before identifying wireless phone use as an accident cause, it fell
under the driver-inattention category.
</P>
<P>
   DPS officers will not pull over someone for talking on a
telephone while driving. But if the driver is not paying attention
or committing other traffic violations as a result, they will get
ticketed, Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   But cellular phones can be helpful when stranded or to report
drunken drivers to the police, Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that takes away from your attention to driving is
bad,'' he said. ``If it gets to that point, you've crossed the
line. But it is also a useful tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is not alone in trying to limit cellular phone use while
driving. During the past legislative session this year, 27 other
states introduced similar bills.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these propositions will probably die, said Melissa
Savage, a policy specialist for the National Conference of State
Legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Three states _ Massachusetts, Florida and California _ passed
mild laws on cell phone use. Massachusetts requires drivers to keep
one hand on the steering wheel and states that the phone cannot
interfere with driving.
</P>
<P>
   Florida mandates that one ear must be free and California says
that rental cars must include safe-use instructions for phones.
</P>
<P>
   Only three cities _ Brooklyn, Ohio; Hilltown Township, Pa.; and
Athens, Colo. _ have passed ordinances about limiting cell phone
use while driving.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless industry opposes such legislation, but it sends
safety tip cards with bills and places pamphlets at retailers, said
Lisa Ihde, a consumer educator for the trade group Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   Driver distractions, ranging from yelling at children to eating
to talking with passengers, remains the real problem, Ihde said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no established causal relationship between accidents
and wireless phone use,'' she said. ``The issue is not with phones
then. It is something else.''

COMMENTARY: VOYEURISM FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Orwell was a loser.
</P>
<P>
   As a friend observes, if Orwell could really see into the
future, he would have registered Big Brother as a brand. He would
have known that the ominous specter he raised in ``1984'' would, by
2000, become a crowd-pleasing entertainment franchise.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Big Brother,'' the latest CBS exercise in ``reality''
television, debuts Wednesday night, right after the latest
installment of the unstoppable ``Survivor,'' millions of us will
delight in spying on 10 Americans trapped in a house for 90 days
with two bedrooms, one bathroom, 60 microphones and 28 video
cameras. Far from being the triumph of totalitarianism that Orwell
brooded about, ``Big Brother'' will be yet another slam-dunk for
capitalism. The estate of the man who coined the phrase might have
had a cash cow to rival the one that T.S. Eliot's heirs have found
in ``Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS paid some $20 million just to obtain the rights to the ``Big
Brother'' TV format from the Dutch entertainment company, Endemol,
that originated the show. The network knows it will see a still
bigger profit, for in 2000, voyeurism moves the goods.
``Survivor,'' whose sponsors include the U.S. Army (and therefore
the U.S. taxpayer), forced ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
to flee from a competing time slot and vanquished even the NBA
finals in the Nielsens. ``Big Brother,'' which is to air five
nights a week (and 24 hours a day on AOL), threatens to bring the
country to a standstill. As for those spoilsports who don't want to
play Peeping Tom, Leslie Moonves, CBS's president, has politely
suggested they just switch channels. And he's right _ this is a
free country. It seems downright patriotic that CBS should bring
America together in a shared affirmation of our freedom to peep (or
not to) on the night after the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, politicians and journalists loudly attacked their
local versions of ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother'' for sadistically
turning their players into cutthroat rats in a maze, especially
after one castaway voted off the island in the Swedish ``Survivor''
subsequently committed suicide. In America, no one cares how the
people on these shows are treated _ the only protest has been from
PETA over the ``unethical'' treatment of actual rats, which were
eaten on ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   There has also been some grumbling by press watchdogs, including
CBS's own Andy Rooney, that the network is blurring the line
between news and entertainment by using its morning newscaster as
the official voice of Big Brother and by stuffing its news shows
with interviews of ``Survivor'' survivees. But it seems laughable
to single out CBS when, as Howard Kurtz reported in The Washington
Post this week, journalists from his paper, CNN and The Wall Street
Journal are leaping to play ``themselves'' in a fictional Showtime
movie starring James Garner.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the phenomenal appeal of ``Survivor'' and
``Big Brother''  &UR; is &LR;  the news right now _ perhaps not
coincidentally at a time when the shows' promos bleed into amateur
videos of real-life wilding in New York's Central Park and
Americans are said to be alarmed about Internet invasions of their
privacy. We may learn more about the country from these TV series
than we will from the political parties' version of ``reality''
television (the infomercial conventions, which will get far less
network air time). ``Survivor'' has already held up a mirror to the
demographics of American Social Darwinism, 2000: The first 2 of the
16 ``castaways'' voted off the island were two of the oldest. Next
to get the boot was another despised species, a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Not that all the news from ``Survivor'' is bad. When Regis' game
show briefly ruled, we feared that Americans were driven by greed.
Now we learn, with relief, that money isn't everything after all,
because it's the desire to be famous, more than the infrequent cash
prizes, that are driving thousands to compete to expose themselves
on ``Survivor,'' ``Big Brother,'' MTV's ``The Real World'' and the
many clones on the way. (NBC may adapt the Dutch ``Chains of
Love,'' in which a woman is chained to five men simultaneously.)
``It's basically an audition for fame,'' says John de Mol, the
Dutch originator of ``Big Brother.'' Even the losing contestants on
``Survivor'' become talk- and news-show fixtures _ sometimes
sharing the spotlight with Darva Conger, whose one-night fling on
the scandal-tossed ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' has
blossomed into a (so far) five-month career as a TV celebrity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Donald Trump if rampant prosperity might have made
get-rich-quick game shows pale next to ``Survivor'' in the buzz
sweepstakes, he theorized: ``Making money is easier than making
fame, so fame might be more desirable _ though I'd still go with
the money myself.''
</P>
<P>
   What's harder to explain is why supposedly privacy-conscious
Americans are so eager to audition en masse for these shows or to
gleefully spy on others by watching them. But Jeffrey Rosen, whose
new book, ``The Unwanted Gaze,'' is the definitive text on privacy
perils in the digital age, feels sanguine about ``Big Brother.''
It's ``silly to huff and puff about wanting to watch lurid
television,'' he says. ``It's a human impulse.'' He adds that the
exhibitionism of the contestants, even at the price of being
humiliated in prime time, is also understandable in the
post-Monicagate era. ``Being on TV is now seen as more important
than being a good citizen,'' he explains. ``Bill Clinton showed
that in a culture of exposure, shamelessness is a self-defense; no
amount of bad behavior is embarrassing as long as you continue to
be on television. The distinction between fame and infamy has been
eradicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Also eradicated, apparently, is the distinction between reality
and unreality. The only viewers who could think ``Survivor'' is
real are those who thought ``The Blair Witch Project'' was a
documentary. It's every bit as fixed as game shows were in the time
of Charles Van Doren. Contrary to the show's opening announcement,
no one on screen was ``forced to abandon ship'' or ``marooned'';
the participants are volunteers living on what is essentially a
movie location, complete with product placement, pseudo-``Lord of
the Flies'' makeup and dozens of unseen cameramen and technicians,
publicists and prop men (who provide ``Robinson Crusoe''-esque
fonts for the parchment island maps). CBS isn't about to let anyone
fall ill, break the law or go hungry. Instead of threats from
actual natives, the castaways are dogged by canned tribal chants
that seem to be piped in from a road company of ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Survivor'' is for its participants a
theme-park experience: an attenuated sleep-over version of
Disneyland's Adventureland rides, with actual wildlife instead of
audioanimatronics. Watching it on TV is no more partaking of
``reality'' than is watching Hollywood's ``The Perfect Storm.'' Nor
is ``Big Brother'' likely to be more real: CBS and AOL promise that
we'll see no sex and hear no R-rated words, despite the ubiquity of
cameras and mikes in the tiny house (in the wilds of CBS's Studio
City lot).
</P>
<P>
   This would all be harmless were we certain that the line between
``reality television'' and actual reality is universally clear. But
TV's exploitation of the Central Park videos of packs of men
mauling dozens of women after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade
makes one wonder. Though the videos were broadcast over and over
for gratuitous titillation long after they ceased to qualify as
fresh news, the voyeuristic overkill aroused no more public protest
than the prospect of ``Big Brother.'' Nor did many question the
ethics of the amateur videomakers, most of whom, says Robert
Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, sold their tapes to
news outlets for cash, in a transaction emulating that between
``reality''-TV packagers and the networks. Since in this case,
unlike ``Survivor,'' people were actually being hurt, did any of
the cameramen at least report the crimes unfolding in their
viewfinders? ``Not one of them as far as we know ever called 911
and said you got to do something about this,'' says Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   Well, times change. When 38 onlookers couldn't be bothered to
call the cops as Kitty Genovese was stabbed to death in Queens in
1964, it was a cue for national soul-searching. Now those
eyewitnesses would not only escape censure but, if they had a
camera handy, could break into the hottest genre in showbiz.

   AT&AMP;T CONSIDERS SPINOFF OF LONG-DISTANCE BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is considering spinning off its long-distance telephone
operation, the largest in the United States, as a separately traded
tracking stock, people close to the company said this week.
</P>
<P>
   One reason AT&AMP;T may want to issue a new stock to track the
long-distance unit is that its shares have languished recently.
AT&AMP;T hit a new 52-week low during trading Friday and closed at
$31.8125, down 31 cents. Management is eager to bolster the stock
price and believes that issuing a tracking stock might accomplish
that if the shrinking consumer long-distance unit is separate.
</P>
<P>
   E-SIGNATURE BILL IS SIGNED INTO LAW
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton signed legislation giving legal weight to
electronic signatures. At a ceremony in Philadelphia, the president
used both the traditional felt-tip pen signature and the more
high-technology method of inserting a signature card into a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. APPROVES SBC'S TEXAS REQUEST
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications received approval to sell long-distance
telephone service in Texas. That is the second instance of a
regional Bell telephone company being allowed to provide such
service to its local customers.
</P>
<P>
   DOCTORS SEEK ANTITRUST EXEMPTION
</P>
<P>
   Elated with a victory in the House, doctors opened a campaign to
persuade the Senate to give them an exemption from antitrust laws
so they could bargain collectively with insurance companies over
fees and other issues. But the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott,
said he would stand in their way.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL SPENDING AND INCOME RISE
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending rose by 0.2 percent in May, the Commerce
Department reported, matching expectations. Americans' incomes,
which include wages, interest and government benefits, rose 0.4
percent in May, slightly more than expected.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND-QUARTER SLUMP FOR UNDERWRITERS
</P>
<P>
   The amount raised in the United States by investment banks in
stock and bond offerings _ $451 billion _ was down 24 percent from
the second quarter of 1999. Fees for underwriting new issues sank
about 20 percent from $3.29 billion in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   $765 MILLION INVESTMENT IN ITALTEL
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems and the private investment firm Clayton, Dubilier
&AMP; Rice agreed to acquire 80 percent of Telecom Italia's computer
network equipment unit, Italtel, for $765 million. The two
investors hope that by forging an alliance with Cisco and by making
the company independent from its Italian parent, they will make it
become more competitive. The investors said they hope to sell
shares of the new company to the public soon.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA EXERTS CONTROL OVER GAZPROM
</P>
<P>
   Russia's government strengthened its influence over Gazprom, the
natural-gas giant. Shareholders voted in a new board, tipping the
balance to favor the government, which controls 38.4 percent of the
company. The vote greatly reduced the influence of Gazprom's chief
executive, Rem Vyakhirev, who had wielded tremendous power.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN RESCUES A DEPARTMENT STORE
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Financial Reconstruction Commission, the agency charged
with overseeing reform in the banking system, said the government
would spend 97 billion yen, or $924 million, of taxpayer money to
help rescue Sogo, a highly indebted department store.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. MARKETS TO CLOSE EARLY
</P>
<P>
   The stock market and other financial markets in the United
States will close at 1 p.m. Monday and will be closed on Tuesday in
observance of the Fourth of July. Most overseas markets, however,
will be open both days. U.S. markets will reopen on Wednesday.

 &HT;    S.C. flag ceremony stirs both sides
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The Confederacy, dressed in the gray woolen
garb of its proud but beaten army, will come back to life as its
controversial battle flag is removed today from the Statehouse
dome.
</P>
<P>
   Just before noon, a pair of cadets from The Citadel will lower
the Rebel flag from the copper-clad dome.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, a battalion of Civil War re-enactors will
raise a battle flag at the Confederate Soldiers Monument on the
Capitol's northern grounds. Two drummers will snap off a cadence,
and the flag will be hoisted on a 30-foot pole surrounded by a
black iron fence. Demonstrators on both sides of the volatile issue
plan to converge. Backed by the Council of Conservative Citizens
and the Confederate States of America Historical Preservation
Society, a vehicle caravan dubbed the ``Million Rebel March'' will
protest the flag's removal.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP, which triggered today's events with its economic
boycott of South Carolina, will march in silent protest before the
formal ceremony. The NAACP complains the Rebel symbol is gaining a
more prominent position _ street level instead of hundreds of feet
in the air. ``It's going to be tense because there's concern how
the hard-nosed on both sides will react,'' said pro-flag state Sen.
Glenn McConnell (R-Charleston), who helped draft the compromise
passed this year by both chambers of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us who love the flag would have preferred it stayed on
the dome,'' said McConnell, who runs a Civil War memorabilia shop
in Charleston. ``But there would have been a tidal wave of
resentment if it had stayed up. . . At the same time, the state has
a responsibility to remember the lives of those who gave their
lives at the call of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials declined to estimate today's potential
crowd. But they're prepared to handle as many as 45,000 people.
That many marched Jan. 17 to observe Dr. Martin Luther King's
birthday and to protest the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Significant historical threads make the Civil War a significant
part of South Carolina's past.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were the first shots of the Civil War fired near
Charleston, but South Carolina _ the first state to secede from the
union _ also was the last state in the nation to stop importing
slaves from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The battle flag was raised over the Statehouse dome in 1962
during a Civil War celebration. At the time, the state was
resisting federal mandates for school desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War is still very much alive here,'' said Bernard
Powers, a professor of African American history at Benedict
College, a historically black school in Columbia. ``When you put
all of those things together, you see race has been a very
important issue in the unfolding of South Carolina history.''
</P>
<P>
   Unmoved by the legislative compromise, the NAACP is continuing
its economic boycott of the state's $14.6 billion tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
   When the state House approved legislation in May to remove the
battle flag, NAACP President Kweisi Mfume complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you once had to strain to see a flag 300 feet in the
air, it would now be 30 feet in the air, larger, with lights, and a
fence,'' said Mfume, head of the nation's largest civil rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But groups like the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce have
parted ways with the NAACP. The business community pressured
legislators to move the flag, which generated unwanted publicity by
the nation's media and late-night comedy shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned, it brings finality to the issue,''
said Deb Woolley, spokeswoman for the state chamber.
</P>
<P>
   However, Powers, the Benedict historian, said blacks are by and
large unappeased by the compromise. Gov. Jim Hodges will not attend
the flag-raising ceremony at the soldiers monument. However, he
will speak inside the Statehouse after the lowered flags are given
to an official from the State Museum. Owners of the Capitol
Restaurant, less than a block from the Statehouse, were unsure
whether they'd open this morning. They usually serve breakfast on
Saturday. But regulars have insisted they'll stay far away from
downtown today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be anywhere near here because it's going to
be a clash of two ideologies,'' 43-year-old trial lawyer Mark
Whitlark said over a cheese omelette and grits. ``What's happened
is that the rallies have galvanized people on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Said law partner Paul Ballou, ``We hope it's not going to be
ugly _ but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Two booths away, 80-year-old flag supporter Ryan Scott waited
for his coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our heritage, part of our hurting,'' Scott said.
``My great-grandfather fought in that war. He survived it. But a
lot of people didn't.''

FBI DECLASSIFIES REPORTS ON AMERICANS KILLED UNDER CHILE'S
PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI collected intelligence on an American
student living in Chile who was killed soon after Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's takeover of Chile in 1973, according to newly
declassified documents made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a December 1972 report from one informant, the FBI said that
the student, Frank Teruggi Jr., had attended a ``Conference on
Anti-Imperialist Strategy and Action'' held by former Peace Corps
volunteers who, the FBI said, ``espouse support of Cuba and all
Third World revolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly declassified documents did not indicate that the
information on Teruggi was shared with Chilean officials. Though
Chilean authorities have never confirmed that Teruggi was executed,
he was arrested at his apartment days after the coup and tortured
at the National Stadium, witnesses said. His body was discovered in
the morgue 10 days later, riddled with bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   The document on Teruggi was one of several hundred released
Friday, ordered by President Clinton last year as part of a major
declassification project on human rights abuses under Pinochet's
1973-90 dictatorship .
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's release, which represented the final government
disclosures on three Americans killed in Chile during the Pinochet
dictatorship, disappointed family members and human rights
activists.
</P>
<P>
   While the documents offered some details, they broke no new
ground as to the circumstances under which the Americans perished.
In addition to Teruggi, those killed were Charles Horman, an
American journalist whose plight was portrayed in the 1982 movie
``Missing,'' and Boris Weisfeiler, a mathematics professor who
disappeared in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA had released only six documents concerning Horman's
death. It released another dozen or so on the death of Teruggi, all
concerning the attempts of the dead man's father to see a document
the agency refused to release 24 years ago. The intelligence agency
continued to withhold that document Friday, arguing that its
information was provided by a foreign intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the release does not give us the complete picture,
it does add some more information that will help us complete the
picture eventually,'' said Peter Kornbluh, senior analyst at the
National Security Archive, a group that has worked to make public
American operations overseas. ``Our quest is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Horman, whose husband was killed at the age of 31, held up
documents no more than an inch thick, many with chunks of black
lines keeping whole paragraphs secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either they're withholding documents,'' she said, ``or they
really didn't do anything to protect an American citizen or to
investigate his detention in Chile at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   The only new insight Horman gleaned came from an informant who
approached the U.S. Embassy in 1987 to say that Horman had been
killed in the National Stadium for being a ``foreign extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   On learning that the man they had killed was an American
citizen, stadium officials panicked and had his body dumped on the
streets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But American Embassy officials had doubts about the informant's
credibility, and eventually lost contact with him.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the documents released Friday involved Weisfeiler,
44, who apparently was picked up by the military while hitchhiking
in Chile. His body has never been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   At her home in Newton, Mass., Weisfeiler's sister, Olga
Weisfeiler, spent Friday combing through the documents, and they
confirmed what she had gradually come to suspect since a Chilean
lawyer reopened her brother's case this year: that her brother had
been tortured and killed at a secretive concentration camp in the
Chilean countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case was closed by the Chileans after 60 days, without
evidence, without a body, without anything,'' she said. ``In our
minds, this case remained open.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there had been expectations of a final explanation of
Teruggi's death, the only information to emerge Friday involved the
FBI surveillance report. Though the report had been mentioned in
other documents, it had not been previously released.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the FBI, Tracy Silberling, said there would be
no comment on the bureau's surveillance of Teruggi. ``Generally,
with Freedom of Information documents, we let them stand on their
own, and at this stage we couldn't get someone to comment on
them,'' she said.

DONALD HENRY PARKER, INVENTOR OF COLOR-CODED READING PROGRAM, DIES
AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ga., N.C., Fla., Ohio)   By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Henry Parker, who invented a color-coded reading program
40 years ago that has been used by millions of schoolchildren
around the world, died on June 14 at his home in Carmel, Calif. He
was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's program, SRA Reading Laboratories, was one of the first
programs intended for remediation and encouraging students to learn
at their own pace. The program, which reached its peak of
popularity in the 1960s and '70s, permits individual students to
advance to increasing levels of difficulty, each level keyed to a
different color.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is desirable to provide a schooling situation in which each
learner may start where he is and move ahead as fast and as far as
his learning rate and capacity will let him,'' Parker said in his
book ``School for Individual Excellence'' (Thomas Nelson &AMP; Son,
1963).
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Cochrane, vice president-publisher of SRA/McGraw-Hill in
Columbus, Ohio, said: ``What's great about the system is that
students compete with themselves. They don't have to worry about
the other kid who was sitting next to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, a native of Syracuse, N.Y., was studying for a master's
degree in psychology and working as a reading teacher in Bradford
County, Fla., when he began to develop the program. As a teacher,
he noticed that the slower learners fell further behind their
classmates when he taught them all from the same textbook.
</P>
<P>
   So he created a system of folders and workbooks designed to help
students master one level before moving to the next. Working at
their own rates, students largely avoided comparisons with
classmates at higher or lower levels of competence.
</P>
<P>
   Parker later opened a reading laboratory at the University of
North Carolina and began work on a doctoral degree at Columbia
University. In 1957, he took the idea to Science Research
Laboratories, which marketed the curriculum to schools. The program
was eventually extended to science, vocabulary, literature and
spelling.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, a World War II Navy veteran, is survived by his wife,
Fritzi; a daughter, Dona Parker of Atlanta; a granddaughter and
three great grandchildren.

ARNOLD BLACK, VIOLINIST AND VERSATILE COMPOSER, DIES AT 77 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Mass., Pa., Md.)   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arnold Black, a violinist and a composer of concert
works, theater music and film scores who was also the founding
director of the Mohawk Trail Concerts chamber series in Shelburne
Falls, Mass., died on Sunday at his home in Charlemont, Mass. He
was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was undetermined, but he had had heart trouble in
recent years, his wife, Ruth, said.
</P>
<P>
   Born on May 2, 1923, in Philadelphia, Black was found early on
to have cerebral palsy. Treatment and therapy improved his
condition, but all his life he lacked mobility in his right side,
which made his decision to study the violin all the more
remarkable. He graduated from the Juilliard School having majored
in violin and composition. As a violinist he attained considerable
success, becoming the concertmaster of the Baltimore Symphony and
the assistant concertmaster of the National Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   But composing increasingly claimed him. In the early 1950s Black
was composer in residence at the Circle in the Square Theater,
where he worked with the director Jose Quintero and wrote scores
for some acclaimed productions, including ``Ulysses in Nighttown,''
based on the James Joyce novel and starring Zero Mostel.
</P>
<P>
   While in England in 1959 with a touring production of that play,
he met Ruth M. Lloyd, a Royal College of Music graduate, who became
his wife that year. In addition to his wife, their daughter,
Hilary, survives him.
</P>
<P>

INITIAL SENATE FUND-RAISING PROVES LUCRATIVE FOR LAZIO 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Rick Lazio has collected roughly $4.5 million in
donations since entering New York's U.S. Senate race six weeks ago,
benefiting from the same antipathy toward his opponent, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, that helped propel the fund raising of Lazio's
predecessor, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio took in almost as much as Clinton in the three-month
fund-raising period that ended Friday, even though he began
soliciting money only halfway through, according to figures
released by the two campaigns. Clinton collected $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very encouraged by the outpouring of support for
Congressman Lazio and his mainstream message,'' a campaign
spokesman, Michael Marr, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical Senate race, Lazio's total for such a short span
would be considered startling. But having entered the race very
late _ Giuliani dropped out on May 19 to focus on his treatment for
prostate cancer _ Lazio remains far behind Clinton in financing.
</P>
<P>
   That could hinder Lazio, who is not well known, as he seeks to
parry Clinton's attempts to use aggressive advertising to cement a
negative image of him.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether Lazio can continue reaping money at
this pace or merely had an initial burst of donations after
becoming the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $4.5 million that he has raised for his
Senate campaign, Lazio had $3.5 million in the account for his
House re-election campaign as of March 31. After spending $2.6
million, his campaign had $5.4 million in the bank as of Friday,
Marr said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It could not be determined whether the money was being spent as
quickly as it was being received.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns are required to report their fund-raising
statistics, including the identities of donors, to the Federal
Election Commission by July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is spending money as fast as she is collecting it. With
the figure reported Friday, Clinton has now raised $17.9 million.
She ended the last period on March 31 with $6.6 million, and
finished this one with $6.4 million, her aides said, meaning that
she spent slightly more than the $5.1 million that she raised in
the period.
</P>
<P>
   When he abandoned the campaign in May, Giuliani had just broken
the fund-raising record of $21 million set by a nonincumbent
candidate for Senate, Oliver L. North, a Republican who lost a
contest in Virginia in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The spending record for the Senate is a moving target: Jon S.
Corzine, a wealthy former investment banker, spent almost $35
million _ nearly all of it his own money _ to win the Democratic
Senate primary in New Jersey in June.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to spend much more in the general election
against Rep. Bob Franks.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani excelled at using direct mail to harvest money from
people around the nation who loathe Clinton. Lazio is seeking to
follow the same strategy.
</P>
<P>
   After pulling out of the race, Giuliani returned nearly $3
million in donations last week, enclosing a letter that asked that
the money be sent to Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman's aides said they hoped to begin receiving that
money in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani campaign has a few million dollars left, and the
mayor has not decided what to do with it. He is barred from giving
it directly to Lazio's campaign but could donate it to a Republican
committee that could help Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   With the release of the figures Friday, both the Lazio and
Clinton campaigns adopted the traditional stance of promoting their
successes while trying to lower expectations for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely strong filing, and we are very pleased,''
said the Clinton campaign manager, Bill de Blasio.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we expect that Rick Lazio and the national Republican
fund-raising machine will outraise us, we are very proud of the
support we have received.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Marr responded: ``Hillary Clinton's complaints about
the vast right-wing conspiracy continue. The fact is that the Lazio
campaign is up against the awesome power of the White House,
Clinton's Hollywood allies and various other special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Congressman Lazio will prevail in this race because his
mainstream record and message resonate with an overwhelmingly
majority of New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday the race drew in Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the former
presidential candidate, who had campaigned for the mayor. McCain
released a statement attacking Clinton and the Democrats for
spending the unregulated contributions known as soft money on
behalf of Clinton. McCain also promoted Lazio as a staunch advocate
of overhauling the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said, ``I
guess Senator McCain must not know that Rick Lazio is one of the
biggest soft money fund-raisers in Washington.''

WILLIAM J. GARRY, 56, EPICURE AT BON APPETIT MAGAZINE'S HELM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Macnab in last graf is cq)  
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI    
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William J. Garry, the garrulous editor of Bon Appetit magazine
whose editorial eye focused on both epicurean pleasures as well as
home entertaining, died on Thursday in Los Angeles, where he lived.
</P>
<P>
   Garry, who was 56, died of lung cancer, said Maurie Perl, a
spokeswoman for Conde Nast Publications, the publisher of Bon
Appetit.
</P>
<P>
   Garry edited Bon Appetit for 15 years and helped raise the
magazine's circulation to 1.2 million a month. His editor's letter
was a frequently discussed staple of the food business.
</P>
<P>
   Born in San Francisco in 1944, Garry graduated from Dartmouth
College and earned a master of fine arts degree at Columbia
University. Intrigued by the theater, he began his career as a
stage manager, actor and director.
</P>
<P>
   He soon shifted his focus to writing and editing, serving in
editorial positions at magazines as various as Epicure, several
spinoff publications of House Beautiful and a business magazine
called Free Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career at Bon Appetit in San Francisco as managing
editor in 1980, when the magazine was owned by Knapp
Communications. When Conde Nast bought Knapp Communications, which
also owned Architectural Digest, in 1993, Garry came along. The
magazine's business operations were moved to New York then.
</P>
<P>
   His approach to the epicurean arts was free wheeling. His
editor's letter in Bon Appetit's July 2000 issue, for example,
details Garry's park-bench dinner with an Elvis impersonator, at
which the impersonator ate a meal of fragrant, soulful barbecued
pork, and Garry, ``feeling fairly ridiculous,'' ate a hummus
sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   He was not afraid of ruffling feathers. Bored by food magazines'
seemingly predictable coverage of asparagus every springtime, Garry
proclaimed an April day last year ``Give Asparagus a Rest Day.''
Three years ago, Garry was so appalled by the food served at a
banquet for the National Magazine Awards, held at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, that he ordered room service.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, when the magazine first published a survey of great
American restaurants, rather than accentuate the painstaking
science behind the selection process, Garry told The New York Times
in an interview: ``I don't believe in polls. So we sat down and
threw a lot of food at each other and came up with the winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry is survived his wife, Mary Duncan Macnab.

GORE PRAISES `VALUES AND VIRTUES' OF HISPANICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mixing praise for Latin American culture with
appeals to Hispanic ``values and virtues,'' Vice President Al Gore
asserted Friday evening that his approach to education, health care
and the economy would ``unleash the promise of every brave young
Latino in this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The values and virtues that are at the heart of the Latino
experience _ honor and responsibility, faith and family, caring and
community _ are the same values that are most important in keeping
America strong,'' Gore said in a speech before the League of United
Latin American Citizens. ``I want to give all hard-working
Americans of all backgrounds the chance to live out their values
and reach for their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 30-minute speech liberally salted with Spanish phrases,
Gore made a handful of policy pledges specifically intended for
Hispanic voters, including affirming his support for bilingual
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to you tonight, todavia no han visto nada,'' Gore said.
``You ain't seen nothing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But he focused more heavily on the broad themes that are central
to his candidacy and that he repeatedly suggested have special
value for immigrants and their children: improving education,
safeguarding the booming economy, extending health care to all
children and strengthening the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can create a future where new Americans and all Americans
can open the doors to their own homes and swing open the
wrought-iron gates to education and opportunity and live out their
lives in peace and plenty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech came at the end of the organization's weeklong
convention, which opened on Monday with a speech by the vice
president's likely Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush. In a much
shorter address, Bush called for splitting the Immigration and
Naturalization Service into two agencies and for making it easier
for relatives of permanent residents to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
   The competition between Gore and Bush for Hispanic voters has
stepped up in recent days, when some recent polls have shown Bush
cutting into the Democrats' historic domination among Hispanic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll of 2,721 likely Hispanic voters released Friday by The
San Jose Mercury News, Gore was shown winning 50 percent of the
Hispanic vote, compared with 34 percent for Bush. In 1996,
President Clinton won over 70 percent of the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Hispanics are projected to represent 5.4 percent of
the electorate. But their numbers are significantly greater in the
states with the most electoral votes: Texas, New York and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said polls
showing Bush making inroads among Hispanic voters are meaningless
so early in the campaign. ``You can't compare poll numbers this far
out from an election with results of previous elections,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanic voters see that Al Gore is focused on issues they
care deeply about, like education and health care,'' he continued.
``And the more they learn about both candidates, the wider this
margin will grow.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore was accompanied Friday night by several Hispanic members of
the administration, including Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and
Aida Alvarez, the head of the Small Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not mention Bush in his remarks. But he criticized
Senate Republicans for holding up the nomination of Enrique Moreno
to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it is time to call upon Congress to stop
playing politics with judicial nominations and confirm Enrique
Moreno,'' he said, to loud applause.

CLINTON HELPS CORZINE RAISE CASH FOR REST OF SENATE BID 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, N.J. _ The small, immaculately catered luncheon that
drew President Clinton to a stately home here Friday was billed as
a benefit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But the
anticipated recipient of much of the more than $1 million raised
was the candidate who may have the least need for donations and the
president's fund-raising help: Jon S. Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, the Wall Street multimillionaire who broke all records
in spending nearly $35 million on his primary race, has been a boon
to Democratic candidates across the country, because he has made
heavy contributors out of wealthy friends in New Jersey and New
York who were previously uninvolved in politics. Many were here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, the chairman of the fund-raising
committee, who has begun to take a more direct hand in guiding
Corzine's campaign as well, missed the event because of a vote in
Washington on aid to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 40 people did show up, paying at least $20,000
apiece, in addition to about a dozen local politicians. Among those
who dined on medallions of poached Maine lobster tail under a
backyard tent were several former executives at Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co., where Corzine was co-chairman until he resigned last year, and
other investment firms.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine will be entitled to receive up to $829,000 from the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Although Torricelli has
told Corzine's associates to expect most of that in the fall, he
could opt instead to send it to candidates with thinner resources.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's guests found Corzine a deserving recipient. ``He
shouldn't be expected to have to pay for his entire campaign
himself,'' said state Sen. Raymond Lesniak, one of the top
Democratic rainmakers in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The host of the luncheon was Orin S. Kramer, a fund manager who
gave so much to Democrats last year that he was forbidden to donate
to any federal races this year. He introduced Corzine as ``the
single best-liked, most respected CEO on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine seemed to still be smarting from the primary. ``I
actually have found a couple of people who don't like me,'' he
said. ``Sometimes they write editorials for newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the president, Corzine said he was grateful to find
Clinton ``on this side of the river,'' given the ``magnetic draw
across the Palisades'' to New York and Hillary Rodham Clinton's
Senate race against Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The president's appearance, one Democratic official said Friday,
was as much a thank-you to Corzine for the money he has helped to
raise as an endorsement of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the reason that Jon has done so well,'' Clinton
said, ``is that it was, like, now here's this guy who could be off
making a gazillion dollars and laying around three days a week, and
he actually cares about whether poor kids get a decent education,
will their parents have a safe place to make a home, and all that
other stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here comes Jon riding in on his horse, the guy's never run for
office before, and he's actually committing the unpardonable sin of
saying exactly what he thinks, even when it gets him in trouble,
and trusting the people to get it right,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encouraged him once _ I knew he was getting a little weary
from the cost as well as the strain of the primary campaign,''
Clinton added. ``I said, `When the people have enough time and
information _ and they need both _ they nearly always get it
right.'''

MAGIC JOHNSON THEATERS OPEN IN HARLEM, CASTING A SPELL OF RENEWAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A milestone in what some people have called the
miracle of 125th Street was reached Friday when the long-awaited
Magic Johnson Theaters opened, bringing Harlem its first multiplex,
with amenities like stadium seating to rival any movie house in the
city. For the first time in many years, local residents will no
longer have to travel to the Bronx or the Upper West Side to take
in a first-run movie.
</P>
<P>
   But long before the first screening of ``Shaft'' Friday
afternoon, ripples from the nine-screen movie theater and the new
$66 million Harlem USA shopping and entertainment complex of which
it is a part were already spreading up and down the broad street
that serves as Harlem's main thoroughfare. The six-level shopping
center, at 125th and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, is home to
several national chain stores, including an HMV record store, a
Disney Store, an Old Navy and a Modell's Sporting Goods store.
</P>
<P>
   National chain stores, fearful of crime and skeptical of whether
enough buying power existed in low-income and minority
neighborhoods, have long shunned communities like Harlem. Now
retailers across the country are closely watching Harlem USA to see
if the ambitious project will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   One regional retailer that has responded to the new shopping
center is the aptly named Lazarus, a 40-year-old children's
clothing store one block east of the new shopping center. Last
year, the owners spent $500,000 to renovate the store, which has a
new multicolored sign, a brightly lighted interior and a clean and
up-to-date appearance. Harlem USA had a lot to do with the store's
make over, said George Adams, the general manager for the last 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The street came back alive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he is not worried about competition from Old Navy
because his store has catered to the same families for three
generations and emphasizes personal service.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of vitality are everywhere on 125th Street, from the
recently added bright red paint on the KFC outlet across the street
from Harlem USA to the new or spruced up clothing stores like
Ashley Stewart, Scheme and Avenue. Pedestrians crowd the sidewalks
and there are long lines at the cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   Some shoppers said they could scarcely believe the
transformation. ``I used to think, maybe it's all talk, talk,
talk,'' said Julie Duncan, a retired telephone service clerk who
has lived in Harlem all her 53 years, ``but then it came to
light.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacant spaces began disappearing and rents began climbing around
three years ago when it became clear that the shopping center would
actually be built, said Barbara Askins, the president of the 125th
Street Business Improvement District. Annual rents in the area
around the shopping center have doubled and now average $60 to $70
a square foot, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the new facades, no one would mistake 125th Street
for the shopping corridor along Third Avenue in the 60s in
Manhattan. Rhythm and blues and salsa music permeates the air and
street vendors peddle a wide range of goods _ from books and
compact disks to hand-painted tiles and flavored ices.
</P>
<P>
   After years of disappointments, development in Harlem is
proceeding with breathtaking speed, generating many hundreds of
jobs and changing people's lives in small ways as well as large
ones. For example, Askins said, Harlem residents previously had to
leave the neighborhood to find the weight-lifting equipment that
Modell's carries, or a gym like the branch of the New York Sports
Club that recently opened at Harlem USA.
</P>
<P>
   But not every recent development project in the neighborhood has
succeeded, however. East River Plaza, an East Harlem shopping
center that would be anchored by a Costco warehouse store and a
Home Depot, has stalled because of a lack of financing for a $30
million parking garage.

 &HT;    Former teammate Julich could prove tough challenge
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Four years ago, when former teammate Lance
Armstrong was battling testicular cancer, Bobby Julich seemed to be
the great American hope to win the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   Julich, born in Corpus Christi and raised in Glenwood Springs,
Colo., finished third in the 1998 Tour behind Marco Pantani and Jan
Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   But Julich has yet to return to that same form. He was forced to
withdraw from last year's Tour after the time trial in Metz, which
was won by Armstrong. Julich injured his chest and shoulder and
could not continue.
</P>
<P>
   He also was forced to pull out of the Tour of Spain in
September, when he suffered a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Julich has resumed racing this year, representing a new team,
Credit Agricole of France. If he returns to form, he can be a
formidable opponent to Armstrong because he is an excellent climber
and can hold his own in the time trials.

 &HT;    N.Y. ruckus over Rocker dying down
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This time, the fireworks were planned.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like a potentially lethal combination: The New York
Mets' long-scheduled ``Fireworks Night'' on Friday and Day 2 of
controversial Braves closer John Rocker's inflammatory visit to
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Yet things didn't feel as hot as they had Thursday, when, after
six months of waiting, 46,000 fans, 700 police and 300 media got
their first look at Rocker. Thursday's final line score: A 1-2-3
eighth inning from Rocker, countless boos and two arrests as Mets
fans made clear they hadn't quite forgiven him for his anti-New
York comments in a December magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   While many among Friday's crowd wore the now ubiquitous ``Rocker
Sucks'' T-shirt, even many who showed up early to jeer him during
his outfield wind sprints suggested the big Brave would have an
easier night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure it will be safer here tonight because everyone's had
a day to cool down,'' said Glenn Starkey of Parsippany, N.J.,
waving a sign at Rocker that described him as ``Forrest Chump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They got all the stress level out last night,'' agreed Steve
Fazio, 18, of New Paltz, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a T-shirt that proclaimed Friday ``John Rocker Battery
Night,'' Fazio swore he was ``unarmed.'' Even the normally
merciless tabloids pulled back a bit Friday, with the New York Post
labeling Thursday's performance ``Rocker's Revenge,'' and the Daily
News gave him points for his pitching and for ``apologizing to the
city'' in a statement broadcast on the scoreboard before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one believed things couldn't get bad again real fast
Friday. New York police still kept watch on some subway platforms
along the line Rocker had threatened to ride Thursday, and four
officers surrounded Rocker in left field when he autographed balls
for more than a dozen Mets fans.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking a beer and looking on, Joseph Giammarino called the
autograph seekers ``traitors'' and suggested the good feelings
might not last.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he gets lit up tonight,'' Giammarino said of Rocker,
``they'll be on him worse than ever.''

MESSIER AND LINDROS EXPECTED TO JOIN CLASS OF FREE AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the free-agency period ready to begin in the National
Hockey League Saturday, the Vancouver Canucks and the Philadelphia
Flyers had to make decisions Friday involving two significant
players.
</P>
<P>
   The players, Mark Messier of the Canucks and Eric Lindros of the
Flyers, could become members of the rebuilding New York Rangers,
who are under new management. But neither big center is the certain
and powerful force on the ice that he used to be. Coincidentally,
both players use their fathers as agents, which is unusual in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Team executives declined to disclose publicly Friday whether the
Flyers had decided to cut Lindros loose and whether the Canucks had
severed their ties with Messier.
</P>
<P>
   Messier, after three seasons with the Canucks, is 39 years old.
A popular captain who left the Rangers as a free agent in 1997
after six seasons, Messier could stay in Vancouver another season
if the Canucks picked up a $6 million option on his contract.
Should they decline, they would owe him a $2 million buyout and he
would become an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, it is unlikely we will exercise our
option,'' General Manager Brian Burke of the Canucks said this
week. In 66 games last season, Messier had 17 goals and 37 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Messier, Mark's father and agent, said Friday that the
Canucks had not extended his son's contract and that an extension
was not expected before Friday's midnight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   From 1984 through 1990, Messier played on five Stanley Cup
champions for the Edmonton Oilers. He added another ring with the
Rangers in 1994. Glen Sather, the general manager and coach of
those Oilers teams, is the new general manager of the Rangers. It
is expected that Messier will sign with Sather's Rangers, perhaps
for a lower salary, to finish his career in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There are hints of more movement along the Oilers-Rangers
pipeline. A report in The Hartford Courant on Wednesday said that
the Rangers would name Ron Low as coach. But John Rosasco, a
Rangers spokesman, said Sather would not name a coach until at
least July 8. Low is a former coach of the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' situation is more complex than Messier's. He will
either become a restricted or an unrestricted free agent Saturday.
Lindros, also a center, earned $8.5 million with the Philadelphia
Flyers last season, playing 55 games and compiling 27 goals and 32
assists. But he suffered four concussions during the season, the
last in the playoffs against the New Jersey Devils. And much
bitterness was evident in relations between the Lindros camp and
Bobby Clarke, the Flyers' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke had to decide whether to give Lindros another $8.5
million contract as a qualifying offer and keep certain rights
regarding him as a restricted free agent. By doing this, the Flyers
could trade Lindros and get value in return. Or they could allow
him to sign with another team and get up to five first-round draft
choices as compensation. They could also match any offer and keep
him on their team.
</P>
<P>
   But offering him another contract would obligate the Flyers to
pay Lindros even if he could not play because of post-concussion
symptoms. According to his agent and father, Carl Lindros, Eric is
still suffering some ill effects and does not have medical
clearance to resume training.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers could rid themselves of any obligation to Lindros by
declining to offer him the $8.5 million contract. That, however,
would make him an unrestricted free agent, able to sign with any
NHL team with no compensation to the Flyers. When Lindros, 27, is
healthy, he is considered one of the best players in the sport. He
was the league's Most Valuable Player in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said early Friday that the Flyers had not yet decided
what to do about Lindros, but would make their decision before
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Clarke said, when asked what the team would
do. ``Everything's a gamble. If someone wants him, it's a gamble on
their part. If we want to keep him, it's a gamble on our part. What
can I tell you? Something's going to have to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he thought the Flyers would do regarding his
son, Carl Lindros replied: ``I have no idea. Absolutely none. We're
just sitting and waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his son's health, Lindros said: ``He's progressing. He
still has symptoms.'' But he declined to be specific about what
problems persist.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, at the NHL draft in Calgary, Alberta, Clarke
said that the Rangers, the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Los Angeles
Kings had been given permission to talk with Lindros. The Dallas
Stars and the Carolina Hurricanes have also inquired about his
availability.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the Lindros family and the Flyers has
deteriorated. Carl and Eric Lindros have questioned the medical
treatment provided by the Flyers for the concussions and also for a
collapsed lung that Lindros suffered in the 1998-99 season. Clarke
has bitterly criticized Carl Lindros' involvement in Eric's career,
as well as that of Bonnie Lindros, Eric's mother.
</P>
<P>
   A similar rift, though less extreme, existed between the Rangers
and the Messier family in 1997. The friction involved Madison
Square Garden executives and Doug Messier. It is no longer thought
to be an obstacle to Messier's returning to the team.
</P>
<P>
   As a junior player, Lindros admired Messier and made no secret
of his desire to play alongside him with the Rangers. Although many
years have passed, those who know Lindros say he retains his
admiration of Messier and his desire to play with him.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Flyers grant Lindros free agency, his next contract
could be for considerably less money than he earned last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers led the league in payroll last season with more than
$60 million, and one of Sather's goals is to curb the escalation of
salaries. Last summer the Rangers spiked the pay scale by signing
several free agents, including Theo Fleury and Valery Kamensky.
Their poor performances last season _ the Rangers missed the
playoffs for the third consecutive year _ led to the dismissal of
Neil Smith as general manager and John Muckler as coach.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among the unrestricted free agents this summer are Vladimir
Malakhov and Claude Lemieux of the Devils, Matthieu Schneider of
the Rangers, Paul Coffey and Gary Roberts of Carolina, Shayne
Corson of Montreal, Lyle Odelein of Phoenix, Igor Larionov of
Detroit and Mike Eastwood of St. Louis.

   (NYT125) BATON ROUGE, La. -- June 30, 2000 -- RACE-SPORTS-6 --
Jabari Morgan, a recent graduate of Southern University in Baton
Rouge, La., played cymbals with Southern University's marching
band. Upon learning that the university had recruited a white
quarterback for it's football team, Morgan couldn't have cared
less, as long as Southern won and people stayed in their seats for
the halftime show. More famous than Southern's football team, it
had real power and importance on campus. ``The whole point of
letting the white guy dance is that we were saying to the world,
'Hey, you can learn our culture just like we can learn yours.'''

   (NYT124) BATON ROUGE, La. -- June 30, 2000 -- RACE-SPORTS-5 --
Jabari Morgan, flanked by his parents, Mo and Wanda Morgan. The
Morgan family is full of proud and passionate Southern University
graduates, including, most recently, Jabari, who played cymbals
with Southern's 180-piece marching band. Upon learning that the
university had recruited a white quarterback for it's football
team, Jabari couldn't have cared less, as long as Southern won and
people stayed in their seats for the halftime show. Mo Morgan felt
otherwise. ``I didn't like the fact that he was there.'' (Nicole
Bengiveno/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT123) BATON ROUGE, La. -- June 30, 2000 -- RACE-SPORTS-4 --
Pete Richardson, Southern University's head football coach,
recruited Marcus Jacoby, the first white ever to play quarterback
for the university. Richardson had turned a laughingstock of a
program into a national force. Richardson and Jacoby's family
discussed everything from Southern's rich athletic tradition to the
engineering courses that interested Marcus, but for a long while
they didn't mention the thing that worried the parents most. Would
a black team accept a white leader? (Nicole Bengiveno/The New York
Times)

   (NYT122) BATON ROUGE, La. -- June 30, 2000 -- RACE-SPORTS-3 --

Classic against Grambling University. In a 30-7 win against
Grambling, Jacoby threw three touchdowns and played the entire
game. Even though Jacoby was named the Bayou Classic's most
valuable player, he soon burned out on being the minority at
Southern, a football powerhouse among black colleges. (Nicole

</P>
<P>
   (NYT121) BATON ROUGE, La. -- June 30, 2000 -- RACE-SPORTS-2 --
Marcus Jacoby, who presently attends Louisiana State University,
had once struggled with all the daily irritations that go with
being a minority in college, while attending Southern University, a
football powerhouse among black colleges. Increasingly, being the
minority made him feel alienated. Jacoby eventually quit the team,
the campus, and football. ``I learned early on that I was a pioneer
in all this and no one else had gone through it and often the best
advice I could get was from myself. Because I was the only one who
knew the whole situation.'' (Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT120) BATON ROUGE, La. -- June 30, 2000 -- RACE-SPORTS-1 --
Marcus Jacoby, center, No.11, struggled on and off the field as
starting quarterback at Southern University, a football powerhouse
among black colleges. Jacoby was unaware that if he accepted a
scholarship to Southern, he would be the first white ever to play
quarterback for the university and the first white ever to start at
quarterback in the 76-year-history of the black South West Athletic
Conference. (Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times) LITE

who live in or visit Vermont may enter into legal arrangements that
are same-sex marriages in almost everything but name. Vermont's law
confers on same-sex couples the rights and responsibilities enjoyed
by married couples, from health insurance benefits to inheritance
rights. Jerry Gonzalez and Ray Deeb are planning to travel to
Vermont this September for a ``Civil Union'' ceremony, the closest
thing to a legal marriage for homosexual couples. (Cathy Seith/The

series of short-range flight tests, including one on Tuesday. The
tests come as the Clinton administration's policy is under fire

Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison to
a powerful Westchester County developer, have a vision of turning

of a ventriloquist's prop, ``Dummy'' is the kind of movie Charlie
McCarthy might have starred in if Michael Ovitz had been his agent.
Nearly everyone else in the film is a client of Ovitz's firm,
Artists Management Group, a noncoincidence that helps explain how a
script by an obscure writer with a budget that wouldn't buy a

February, thieves sawed off and nabbed the 200-pound bronze statue
of the determined duck matriarch from Robert McCloskey's ``Make Way
for Ducklings.'' They also made off with two of her flock, Lack and
Mack. That left Novodevichy Park with only five of the nine

 &HT;    Air cleanup isn't just for Atlanta
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As metro Atlanta faced its 11th ``smog alert'' of the
summer on Friday, Gov. Roy Barnes recommended adding eight metro
counties and Columbus, Macon and Augusta to the hit list of places
violating federal clean air standards.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agrees with the
state's recommendations, residents of those areas could face some
of the same restrictions _ including auto emissions testing and
stringent curbs on industries _ now imposed on 13 metro Atlanta
counties for exceeding ozone pollution levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Regional Transportation Authority also would extend
its jurisdiction _ which now covers only the 13-county Atlanta
region _ to include the new areas. GRTA is the superagency created
by the General Assembly last year to ease traffic congestion and
implement transportation plans to clean up the dirty air.
</P>
<P>
   The eight metro Atlanta counties that would be added to the list
are Barrow, Bartow, Carroll, Dawson, Hall, Newton, Walton and
Spalding. In addition, the counties of Richmond (Augusta), Bibb
(Macon) and Muscogee (Columbus) should be added, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the deadline for the nation's governors to submit
their recommendations for the EPA's list of areas that cannot meet
its tougher standard on ground-level ozone. Ozone is the chief
ingredient of smog, caused by emissions from automobiles,
factories, coal-burning power plants and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new rule _ the ``eight-hour standard'' _ is tied up
in the U.S. Supreme Court because of a legal challenge by trucking
groups and others who claim that the EPA overstepped its legal
bound.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes asked the EPA to hold off on making a final decision on
his recommendations until the court rules, probably by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials say it is unclear what strategy they
will pursue if the court rules against the EPA. However, the old
ozone standard _ which the 13-county metro area violates _ still
would be in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the governor's letter was in the mail Friday, his
recommendations were coming under fire. Wesley Woolf, director of
the Southern Environmental Law Center's Atlanta office, said Monroe
and Houston counties should have been included as part of the Macon
nonattainment area because of a major coal-burning power plant in
Monroe and sprawl and congestion in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the governor has recommended is minimal,'' Woolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the final outcome, it will take several years to
implement measures to clean dirty air in the newly designated
areas, said Ron Methier, air quality chief for the state
Environmental Protection Division.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning up the air in the Augusta, Macon and Columbus areas,
however, may not require major changes beyond those already being
mandated by state and federal authorities, Methier said. Those
requirements include tougher controls on coal-fired plants, the
removal of sulfur from gasoline and diesel fuels, and adding
emissions control devices on sport utility vehicles and some trucks
.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that those are the only requirements needed to bring
those areas into compliance with the new ozone standard,'' Methier
said. ``They may not need (transportation plans) such as those
required for metro Atlanta.''

   (NYT125) BATON ROUGE, La. -- June 30, 2000 -- RACE-SPORTS-6 --
Jabari Morgan, a recent graduate of Southern University in Baton
Rouge, La., played cymbals with Southern University's marching
band. Upon learning that the university had recruited a white
quarterback for it's football team, Morgan couldn't have cared
less, as long as Southern won and people stayed in their seats for
the halftime show. More famous than Southern's football team, it
had real power and importance on campus. ``The whole point of
letting the white guy dance is that we were saying to the world,
'Hey, you can learn our culture just like we can learn yours.'''
(Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT124) BATON ROUGE, La. -- June 30, 2000 -- RACE-SPORTS-5 --
Jabari Morgan, flanked by his parents, Mo and Wanda Morgan. The
Morgan family is full of proud and passionate Southern University
graduates, including, most recently, Jabari, who played cymbals
with Southern's 180-piece marching band. Upon learning that the
university had recruited a white quarterback for it's football
team, Jabari couldn't have cared less, as long as Southern won and
people stayed in their seats for the halftime show. Mo Morgan felt
otherwise. ``I didn't like the fact that he was there.'' (Nicole
Bengiveno/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT123) BATON ROUGE, La. -- June 30, 2000 -- RACE-SPORTS-4 --
Pete Richardson, Southern University's head football coach,
recruited Marcus Jacoby, the first white ever to play quarterback
for the university. Richardson had turned a laughingstock of a
program into a national force. Richardson and Jacoby's family
discussed everything from Southern's rich athletic tradition to the
engineering courses that interested Marcus, but for a long while
they didn't mention the thing that worried the parents most. Would
a black team accept a white leader? (Nicole Bengiveno/The New York
Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT122) BATON ROUGE, La. -- June 30, 2000 -- RACE-SPORTS-3 --
Marcus Jacoby, 11, playing for Southern University in the Bayou
Classic against Grambling University. In a 30-7 win against
Grambling, Jacoby threw three touchdowns and played the entire
game. Even though Jacoby was named the Bayou Classic's most
valuable player, he soon burned out on being the minority at
Southern, a football powerhouse among black colleges. (Nicole
Bengiveno/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT121) BATON ROUGE, La. -- June 30, 2000 -- RACE-SPORTS-2 --
Marcus Jacoby, who presently attends Louisiana State University,
had once struggled with all the daily irritations that go with
being a minority in college, while attending Southern University, a
football powerhouse among black colleges. Increasingly, being the
minority made him feel alienated. Jacoby eventually quit the team,
the campus, and football. ``I learned early on that I was a pioneer
in all this and no one else had gone through it and often the best
advice I could get was from myself. Because I was the only one who
knew the whole situation.'' (Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT120) BATON ROUGE, La. -- June 30, 2000 -- RACE-SPORTS-1 --
Marcus Jacoby, center, No.11, struggled on and off the field as
starting quarterback at Southern University, a football powerhouse
among black colleges. Jacoby was unaware that if he accepted a
scholarship to Southern, he would be the first white ever to play
quarterback for the university and the first white ever to start at
quarterback in the 76-year-history of the black South West Athletic
Conference. (Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times) LITE

   (NYT18) ATLANTA -- June 30, 2000 -- GAY-UNIONS-COX -- Gay men
who live in or visit Vermont may enter into legal arrangements that
are same-sex marriages in almost everything but name. Vermont's law
confers on same-sex couples the rights and responsibilities enjoyed
by married couples, from health insurance benefits to inheritance
rights. Jerry Gonzalez and Ray Deeb are planning to travel to
Vermont this September for a ``Civil Union'' ceremony, the closest
thing to a legal marriage for homosexual couples. (Cathy Seith/The

Eighteen months after American and British warplanes destroyed its

series of short-range flight tests, including one on Tuesday. The
tests come as the Clinton administration's policy is under fire

Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison to
a powerful Westchester County developer, have a vision of turning
this town in the Hudson Valley into one that draws throngs of

   (NYT13) CHICAGO -- June 30, 2000 -- MEXICO-ELECTION-U.S. 2 -- To

border. Mexican politicians are urging Mexicans from New York to
San Francisco to call their family and friends back home advising
them how to vote in Sunday's election. A mock election booth in

DUMMY-FILMING -- The tale of Steven Schoichet, a maladroit
suburbanite whose life is transformed when he comes into possession
of a ventriloquist's prop, ``Dummy'' is the kind of movie Charlie
McCarthy might have starred in if Michael Ovitz had been his agent.
Nearly everyone else in the film is a client of Ovitz's firm,
Artists Management Group, a noncoincidence that helps explain how a
script by an obscure writer with a budget that wouldn't buy a
two-bedroom in Manhattan happened to get this far. Inside the

February, thieves sawed off and nabbed the 200-pound bronze statue
of the determined duck matriarch from Robert McCloskey's ``Make Way
for Ducklings.'' They also made off with two of her flock, Lack and
Mack. That left Novodevichy Park with only five of the nine
original ducks that Barbara Bush had given the Soviet Union in
1991, a year after Raisa Gorbachev had admired the duck sculpture

   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ A man convicted of ordering the killings of
an 8-year-old murder witness and his mother was sentenced Friday to
life in prison without the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   A jury failed to agree last week on whether the man, Russell
Peeler Jr., deserved the death penalty, leaving the judge no choice
but to impose a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, G. Sarsfield Ford of State Superior Court, said
Friday that prosecutors had not met their burden of convincing the
jury that aggravating factors in the case warranted the death
penalty. On June 8, the jury convicted Peeler of murder, conspiracy
to commit murder and two counts of capital felony.
</P>
<P>
   The January 1999 killing of the witness, Leroy Brown Jr., and
his mother, Karen Clarke, outraged the public and prompted a swift
strengthening of Connecticut's witness protection laws. Prosecutors
said Peeler had directed his brother, Adrian, to carry out the
killings to prevent the boy from testifying against Peeler in
another murder case. Peeler, 28, was convicted in that case for the
fatal shooting of Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr., without
the boy's testimony. Prosecutors argued that the life sentence
imposed Friday added nothing to Peeler's punishment because he was
already serving life sentences for Snead's murder and conviction in
a drug case.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Peeler is awaiting a separate trial on murder charges. In
court Friday, Russell Peeler Jr. maintained his innocence, The
Associated Press reported. ``I feel for the family, but we didn't
have anything to do with it,'' the AP quoted him as saying. ``I am
not an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the court, Clarke's brother, Oswald, told Peeler
that he would suffer in prison. ``You will wish you had received
the death penalty,'' Clarke wrote.  &QL;

Armstrong remains inspiring Tourist
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The Tour de France is considered the single most grueling event
on the face of the earth, and there is no reason to attempt such a
feat of idiocy except that some people, which is to say people like
me, have a need to search the depths of their stamina for
self-definition. It's a contest in purposeless suffering.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Lance Armstrong &LR;  &QR;
</P>
<P>
   But suffer he must, so Lance Armstrong charges off again today
on another bicycle trip around France, with detours into Germany
and Switzerland. ``La grande boucle,'' they call it. ``The Big
Loop.'' It's big all right _ 2,000-plus miles of hard riding before
the ceremonial finish down the Champs-Elysees on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Pedaling as fast as he can, for all he is worth, Armstrong will
speed across marshlands, streak through rolling hillsides and churn
up winding Alpine roads that are challenging to automobiles. Legs
churning, always churning, his body alternately baking in the
summer sun and being pelted with freezing rain, he will pass
through some of the world's most beautiful landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   But he will see almost nothing but the riders around him, 179
similarly driven men who want what he has and couldn't care less
about what he represents.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, Armstrong is a flesh-and-blood miracle, a cancer
survivor and the reigning champion of the Tour de France, cycling's
Super Bowl. His story is arguably the most amazing in the history
of sport, any sport, considering how he should have been dead three
years ago and how hellishly difficult this 23-day test of one's
muscular and mental limits can be.
</P>
<P>
   The storied event, first contested in 1903, was nearly destroyed
by an insidious drug scandal in the summer of 1998. But Armstrong,
clean on all counts, free of his disease and filled with hope
instead of dope, single-handedly saved it in the summer of 1999,
when the Tour de France became the Tour de Lance.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the 28-year-old Texan didn't need to re-prove he could
defeat the skeptics, cynics and France's spectacularly diverse
topography one more time. But ride Lance must, because this is who
he is, and this is what he does.
</P>
<P>
   If last year was difficult, an Armstrong encore will prove a far
greater challenge. The field is exponentially tougher, with two
champions who preceded him, Germany's Jan Ullrich and Italy's Marco
Pantini, returning from an injury and a suspension, respectively,
and France's former world No. 1, Laurent Jalabert, back after
boycotting the '99 race. Also, the mountain stages are
hyper-difficult this year, and Armstrong is a marked man.
</P>
<P>
   Post-cancer, he's no longer the one-day sprinting wonder of his
youth, and his new celebrity, albeit deserved, has extracted a toll
on his workout regimen, as did the minor concussion he suffered in
a tumble during a May training session. Nonetheless, he returned to
form in June, and the U.S. Postal Service team's manager, Johan
Bruyneel, says of him: ``Physically, he is as good as last year,
and mentally he is stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started (1999) with a big motivation but only a dream of
winning. Now Lance has shown it is possible, and that makes a
difference in how you approach the Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, like cancer, can be a killer.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous unlucky gents have ridden off the dangerous
high-country roads with fatal consequences, most recently an
Armstrong teammate, Fabio Casartelli, in 1995. In 1967, England's
Tom Simpson died of asphyxiation, literally pedaling himself to
death on the grueling climb up Mount Ventoux in Provence, a
debilitating route the Tour returns to this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the autopsy, Simpson's body was found to be full of
amphetamines. Illegal drug use had long been the Tour's nasty
little ``secret,'' but during the dark summer of '98, a 30-year
veteran of the Tour, Willy Voet, was arrested for trafficking in
performance-enhancing drugs just days before the race. His public
revelations rocked the sport. Ultimately, six teams dropped out,
and another was expelled.
</P>
<P>
   But when you see firsthand what the Tour entails, you find
yourself asking, ``How is it possible to compete without using
drugs?'' Not surprisingly, Armstrong's daily triumphs were met with
increasing cynicism. Some went so far as to suggest the aggressive
cancer treatments, which pumped plutonium into his system five
hours a day, had turned him into a superhuman mutant. The French
media took to calling him ``The Martian.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lance didn't test positive for anything _ he never has _ and
none of the other riders did, either. The Tour's honor would be
restored, and as a bonus, Armstrong gave a measure of hope to a lot
of ill people. It would seem his suffering was hardly purposeless.
It's good he's back. Good for him and for many others.

   EDS: Embargoed for Sunday.

<P>
   Novelist helps Virginia hometown cling to its past
</P>
<P>
   By Don O'Briant
</P>
<P>
   GRUNDY, Va. _ Novelist Lee Smith has been proving Thomas Wolfe
wrong for years, going home again and again to the tiny coal mining
town where she was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved coming back,'' Smith says on a recent visit,
navigating her SUV through downtown Grundy. Passing a sign proudly
proclaiming her as a native daughter, she slows down and laughs.
``Isn't that something?'' she says in a Southern twang any country
music singer would die for. Then she turns off the main road and
pauses behind the building that once housed her father's Ben
Franklin five-and-dime store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent many wonderful hours there,'' says Smith, 56.
``Sometimes my father would bring me to his office and let me sleep
on a pallet while he worked on the books through the night.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in that office on the second floor that Smith would sit
and peer through a two-way mirror to observe the everyday
minidramas unfolding in the store below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I witnessed not only shoplifting, but fights and embraces as
well,'' she says. ``Thus I learned the position of omniscient
narrator, who sees and records everything yet is never visible. It
was the perfect early education for a fiction writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's beloved dime store is gone now, converted to a teen
center where coal miners' daughters and sons play video games and
laser tag, shoot pool and sip sodas.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, soon will be gone, along with the two movie theaters
where Roy Rogers and Trigger appeared live onstage and Lash LaRue
demonstrated his prowess with a bullwhip. Gone, too, will be the
string of stores, most empty now, that hug the banks of Slate
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   After a century of enduring devastating floods every 20 years or
so, downtown Grundy is being moved to higher ground. Everything
along the creek will be demolished for a U.S. Corps of Engineers
flood control project scheduled over the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everything you've been connected to is literally going
underwater, it's galvanizing,'' says Smith, who now lives in
Hillsborough, N.C. ``That town where we grew up and went to school
and came to pay our taxes, where we got a marriage license or
bought our son a bike for Christmas will be gone forever. The only
thing left of it will be our memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. Smith and 30 high school students, along with
high school English teacher Debbie Raines and Buchanan County
librarian Pat Hatfield, have launched an oral history project to
record these memories in a book. The project is being funded by
grants from the Virginia Arts Commission and the Virginia
Department of the Humanities. Smith plans to publish the
coffee-table book this fall and to host an autograph party and
reunion of the students who worked on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose our memories so gradually we don't realize it. This
book will help us to remember,'' Smith says as she maneuvers the
SUV back onto the main drag, which is dotted with a Pizza Hut,
Wendy's and other fast food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there is my old stomping ground,'' she says, nodding
toward a row of neat white houses with perfectly maintained yards
and flower beds. ``I lived in this neighborhood and delivered
papers. This is the house where I grew up right here. It won't be
affected, but some will be raised on stilts and the rest will have
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, like the young people she is working with on the book,
admits she couldn't wait to leave Grundy. ``I felt closed in
because of all the mountains around us. I was also completely
surrounded by relatives on eerie side. I didn't like everyone
knowing what I was doing. Later, I realized what a wonderfully safe
and blessed childhood I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith would have written the book herself, but when she got the
idea two years ago, she was just starting a novel, ``The Last
Girls'' (due out next year), and working on a musical, ``Good Ol'
Girls'' (performed last year at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill). There was no time to spend months in her hometown
conducting and transcribing interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I thought, maybe Debbie's students would love to do
this,'' says Smith, who had held several writing workshops with
Raines classes in the past. ``I like to work with high school
students, so I coerced her into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after agreeing to help with the project, Raines was
hesitant. ``Did Lee realize what she was asking or had she simply
lost touch with reality?'' Raines recalls. ``Was it really possible
that a detached Generation Y would suddenly think it `cool' to
listen to adults?''
</P>
<P>
   What happened next was both surprising and rewarding, Raines
says. Equipped with tape recorders and a list of questions, the
students were sent to interview the old-timers about what Grundy
was like when they were teenagers and the town was booming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were terrified at first,'' Smith says of the students.
``They practiced interviewing their families and went out in teams
of two. One could maintain eye contact and the other one could see
that everything was working. After a few disasters, they started
taking two tape recorders. They were sure that people would not
talk. And toward the end they were sure that people would never
shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years, Raines watched in amazement as the kids
grew more confident and returned with fascinating tales about their
neighbors. ``Yes, Lee knew exactly what she was doing,'' Raines
says. ``It just took me a while to catch on.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories they recorded were about the people of Grundy in
particular, but they are universal in nature. They are the stories
of thousands of other small towns where the young people leave in
droves every year in search of jobs or adventure. In Grundy, the
kids have few choices. Most of the coal that everyone said would
last a hundred years has already been mined. A few companies are
still operating, but the Saturdays when the downtown overflowed
with miners and their families are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South _ pockets of the South like this area _ is changing
enormously,'' says Smith, who has written about the Appalachian
people in ``Oral History,'' ``Black Mountain Breakdown,'' ``Fair
and Tender Ladies'' and other novels. ``First television and now
the Internet. Everything is becoming so much more standardized.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other small towns, Grundy has its share of fascinating
characters and stories. It was the site of the last hanging in
Virginia, an event that drew 3,000 spectators, some with picnic
luncheobacco, or the solid gold doorknobs on all the doors. But the
most amazing thing was when he said he was an alien from outer
space . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Others residents who were interviewed remembered the devastating
floods. In her interview with students Reece Hale and Jennifer
Lester, store owner Inez Ramey described how she used to hide her
money under the linoleum. When the last flood hit in 1977, she
barely had time to retrieve her money before the building was swept
away by floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   Smith recalls going down to the basement of her father's store
after one of the floods and finding a huge fish flopping on the
steps.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Hahn, who interviewed his grandfather, learned some
fascinating details about life when coal was king. ``Every Sunday
he would go to the Morgan Theater, where every seat was filled,''
Hahn says. ``Mostly they climbed mountains and went to the movies
for entertainm

 &HT;    Big Easy fishes for fun with finny art fest
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Something fishy is going on in the Crescent City
this summer. The place is swimming with fish _ more than 200 big
ones, creatively painted by Louisiana artists.
</P>
<P>
   Festival of Fins, the biggest public art show ever in the Big
Easy, is expected to reel in more than 420,000 tourists just to see
the fish _ not counting a million or so locals. That translates
into a $42 million splash in the economy by the time the displays
come down at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Chicago's extremely popular Cows on Parade last
summer, the art project brings an added dimension of whimsy to a
river town already known for rolling with the good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about smiles and fun,'' says John Hopper, executive
director of the Young Leadership Council, which organized the fin
fest, ``and our other two goals of providing accessible public art
and increasing tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   The fiberglass fish, designed by Mardi Gras float builders Kern
Studios, are 4 1/2 feet long and 5 feet tall. Sponsors, who paid
$3,000 for a fish, can keep them or donate them to a charity
auction in November.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming solo and in schools, the finny guys are scattered
throughout the central business district, the Garden District, the
French Quarter and the riverfront. They sport fanciful names such
as ``Sweet Gar Named Desire,'' ``Better Beaded Than Breaded,''
``Fin Fatale,'' ``Uncle Samon'' and ``Fin de Siecle.''
</P>
<P>
   Half the fun is seeing how many you can find.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss tourist Elisabeth Zahner was snapping pictures of the
cigar-chomping ``The Loan Shark'' in front of the Shell Oil
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love these fishes!'' she exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Ebling and her son Ford, 10, visiting from Bowling
Green, Ky., were making a game of spotting fish around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really fun,'' said Ebling, who couldn't resist adding,
``Much better than cows.''

LAKERS' SCRIPT FOR SUCCESS IS PURE HOLLYWOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dear Network Executive,
</P>
<P>
   Everybody from sneaker manufacturers to cereal packagers to the
local burger joint is about to capitalize on the nation's joyful
fascination with the Los Angeles Lakers, and I'm sure that you, a
creative artist in your own right, wish to share in the loot.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore I submit for your consideration this script for a
prime-time movie about the behind-the-scenes cliffhanger drama of
the Lakers' championship season. I envision Gregory Peck as Phil
Jackson and Shaquille O'Neal as himself (unless he is busy on
``Kazaam 2,'' in which case let's see if Jim Carrey is free).
Working title: ``Lakermania: Not the Lakers, but the Average Viewer
Goes for This Kind of Shlock.''

   Jerry Buss (bouncing blonde on knee, addressing bearded man): My
team's decade-long championship drought upsets me and leaves this
city neither emotionally healed nor economically enriched. It can
win the title in 2000 only if you agree to be its coach. Well?
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson: No.

   Buss: Here's a blank check. Please reconsider.

which symbolizes a quirky intellect unbound by the urban
materialism more common to NBA people.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson: Thank you. If we are to win the championship in the
upcoming season, you've got to buckle down.

talked to like that, and he takes a step toward Jackson, towers

 &HT;    Absent a strong political party, observers say, lobbyists rule
roosts at state capitols
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, S.C. _ Stroll the marble _ or, depending where you are,
reinforced concrete _ walls of any Southern capitol in this
turn-of-the-century year, and you will notice many things that
appear untouched by the new era.
</P>
<P>
   The past few decades have witnessed revolutionary changes in the
racial and gender makeup of Southern legislatures and the awakening
of the Republican Party in the South. A generation of Southern
governors _ often with the presidency as their ultimate goal _ have
pushed impatiently to modernize their state governments.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the chambers where an increasing share of the most
important decisions affecting the region are made, those who make
the laws and those who would have the laws made their way still
engage in a familiar mating dance. In many states, a seasoned
observer can tell you in what corner of a capitol hallway a certain
kind of deal might be cut, based on which lobbyist stands there
every day and which legislator passes by.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South has always been the region where (interest) groups
have predominated, probably because of the weakness of any
countervailing force like strong political parties,'' wrote
academics Clive S. Thomas and Ronald J. Hrebenar in an article for
State Legislatures magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the splintering of power _ between Republicans and
Democrats, blacks and whites, governors and their increasingly
independent legislatures _ appears only to have strengthened the
hands of the lobbyists. At the same time, the number of those
waiting in the halls to catch a legislator's ear has exploded all
around the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alabama is a dream state for lobbyists,'' said Milo Dakin,
whose clients include several gaming interests. The Legislature
gives itself such flexibility, he said, that there is virtually no
certainty what is going to happen from day to day _ ``an ideal
climate for a lobbyist.'' The governor no longer has a controlling
hand, and a skillful lobbyist who can influence 30 or 40 votes is
``just as likely to have a majority as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I registered here in 1978, you could put all the
lobbyists in the Capitol on a school bus,'' Dakin said. ``Now you
couldn't get them all on an Amtrak train.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW ECONOMY, NEW LOBBYING
</P>
<P>
   It was easy for Calvin Kytle and James A. MacKay to frame the
question in their landmark 1947 study, ``Who Runs Georgia?'' In
those days, Georgia Power Co., a few businesses and the state's
agricultural interests were the only players in the Legislature's
yearly power struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, the answer Kytle and MacKay came up with _ ``a
few executives in a few corporations, together with a few skilled
politicians'' _ still sufficed for much of the South. But as the
new economy begins to affect the region, the old system is
beginning to mutate in interesting ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who runs North Carolina? There are a lot more answers than
there used to be,'' said Ran Coble, executive director of the North
Carolina Center for Public Policy Research.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, the center has polled North Carolina legislators,
Capitol reporters and lobbyists to rank the 50 most influential
lobbyists in Raleigh. It's not a fool-proof measure of political
influence. Some of the most effective lobbyists, after all, are
those who attract the least notice. But the ranking does give some
indications of how things are changing.
</P>
<P>
   There used to be more lobbyists on the list who worked
exclusively for one or two big clients, winning the favor of key
committee members and weighing in as the voice of the company when
its interests were at stake.
</P>
<P>
   These days, some of the most effective lobbyists are
free-lancers brought together temporarily to work as a team on a
specific issue. That mirrors Alabama, where it is not unusual,
according to Dakin, for a lobbyist to hire another lobbyist on a
spot contract for a day, simply to win the vote of a specific
legislator with whom that lobbyist has close ties.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer lobbyists from the old trio of tobacco, textiles and
furniture are showing up on the North Carolina list, and there are
more lobbyists for health care, hogs and homebuilders _ a
reflection of the state's changing economy.
</P>
<P>
   More public interest lobbyists and women have been ranked in
recent years, and lobbyists representing a growing number of new
companies such as those that have sprung up around the Research
Triangle near here. With the new economy, observed Ferroll
Guillory, director of the Southern politics program at the
University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, has come an interest in
issues _ ``livability,'' sprawl, day care _ the Old Guard was not
much concerned with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that a relatively small number of companies and
the Farm Bureau carried the political weight in this state. Today,
political power is spread out over a diverse group of individuals
and organizations and companies,'' said Don Beason, a lobbyist with
several major business clients who is ranked No. 2 on the center's
list.
</P>
<P>
   This trend has been widened by the increasing complexity of the
problems state legislatures grapple with, and the devolution
movement, which over the past decade has transferred an increasing
share of responsibility back to the states.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time a few years ago, observed Bobby Kahn, chief of
staff to Gov. Roy Barnes, when a committee meeting on health care
might draw only a lobbyist for the Medical Association of Georgia.
These days, with hospitals, nursing homes, medical specialties and
public interest groups looking to their own interests, the same
meeting might draw several lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Dakin, who has lobbied in several Southern states, traces the
proliferation back to the 1970s, when California, with its auto
emissions legislation, sent a message to national corporations that
they could no longer confine their efforts at winning influence to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   MORE MONEY IN STATE POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   Simply registering to lobby in a state is likely to trigger a
barrage of letters from legislators asking for campaign donations.
Just as much as the increased costs of campaigning, the enlargement
of the donor pool appears to be contributing to the staggering
increase in the costs of politics at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   The states don't have uniform reporting procedures, and it is
much harder to get comprehensive statistics about campaign finances
at the state level than the federal. But there are strong
indications the South's capitols have witnessed an inflation in
costs that rivals Washington.
</P>
<P>
   According to a public interest group, the North Carolina Forum
for Research and Economic Education, what the average winner spent
in a North Carolina Senate race rose from $36,301 in 1994 to
$82,161 in 1996 and $110,638 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And the spending figures don't tell the entire story. Much of
the money being raised from lobbyists and their clients is going
into the coffers of powerful legislators who have weak or often no
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the cases where their races aren't contested, they're
raising lots of money to chase away possible opponents and to
funnel money to their colleagues,'' said Bob Hall, director of
Democracy South, a public interest group based in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   A few states have attempted to contain campaign spending at the
legislative level, but this has proved difficult. Florida, for
instance, has a $500 cap on contributions to state races, but it
allows unlimited soft money contributions to the state parties,
which in turn have great flexibility in getting money back to the
candidates. For example, soft money contributions to the Florida
Republican Party, which now controls the Legislature, jumped from
$9.9 million in 1996 to $24.3 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by Florida Common Cause, health care
interests and the insurance industry each contributed more than
$442,000 to the two parties in the first three months of this year,
when the Legislature was about to consider a measure that affected
patients' right to sue their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure failed. So did legislation affecting the sale of
generic drugs, after pharmaceutical interests contributed more than
$79,000.
</P>
<P>
   The increased emphasis on political action committees and
campaign contributions does not sit well with Dakin, schooled in
the ``eyeball-to-eyeball'' approach. But, he says, ``the system
runs on revolving funds,'' and lobbyists understand they have to
open their checkbooks to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers the ``personal touch,'' which sometimes means
ordering carry-out dinner for 150 or 200 people in a committee room
without making a big deal about who picked up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing the game doesn't just mean campaign contributions.
Playing the game means being there all the time, every time,''
Dakin said.
</P>
<P>
   SHADOW SECTORS
</P>
<P>
   Along with money and personal contacts between powerful
executives, their lobbyists and the legislators, a traditional
source of power throughout the South has been the number of
employees _ and voters _ companies such as Carolina Power &AMP; Light
had in legislative districts throughout North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Guillory observed, these local powerhouses are
being outnumbered by companies, such as EDS, which are
headquartered out of the state, or, as is the case with
Glaxo-Wellcome, out of the country. These companies do not often
leave the same deep footprint in the Capitol corridors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the noticeable developments across the region is
the rise of what might be called shadow sectors: big business
interests that either can't, or choose not to, play the traditional
game of statehouse power politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling in Louisiana and tourism in Florida provide contrasting
examples of the effect shadow sectors can have.
</P>
<P>
   While observers detect a splintering of business interests
elsewhere, John Maginnis, who has written several books on
Louisiana politics, says the biggest change in that state's power
politics the last few years has been the unifying of business
interests under the banner of LABI, the Louisiana Association of
Business and Industry.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the business lobby hung together to defeat a proposed
oil and gas processing tax supported by Gov. Mike Foster, who
helped unify the business community to pass his tort reform
measures and has since been foiled by business in his attempt to
find new revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas gets off the hook, Maginnis said, because the
Legislature can always hang another tax increase on casinos and
video poker. The gaming sector spent enormous political capital to
gain entrance into Louisiana, and with its revenues skyrocketing it
has little influence to prevent its becoming a cash cow for the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louisiana's always been able to survive on other people's
money,'' Maginnis said. ``It used to be oil and gas, and now
gambling has started to fill the gap.'' But ``taxing Texans,'' as
they call it in Louisiana, only puts off the day when the state
will have to reckon with the shortcomings in its tax structure, he
contends.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Florida would describe the tourist industry as a
pushover at the Legislature, but it is subdued in the role it
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think Disney and some of the Central Florida
entertainment attractions would run the state. But Disney is a very
low-profile corporate citizen in Tallahassee,'' said Richard
Pinsky, a lobbyist and Republican campaign consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was directly affected, he noted, Disney didn't
flex any muscles when a proposal to tax cruise ships came up _
aware, perhaps, that the measure was going to fail anyway. But the
tourist sector also didn't speak up for itself this year, he said,
when the South Florida counties eliminated auto emissions testing,
a move that could lead to more pollution, tighter government
restrictions and fewer tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Southern states, which have been generous in
bestowing incentives to new industries, Florida has lost a number
of businesses to Arizona and other states. That is due in part,
Pinsky believes, to tourism, which brings revenue into the state
and has little interest in attracting more industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the changes being felt in the Southern economy are only
slowly being reflected in terms of influence in state legislatures.
The old giants still wield considerable power _ but they do so in a
more crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question tobacco has less clout today than 30 years
ago. There's also no question they still have a lot of clout,''
Coble said of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Similar things are said about oil and gas in Louisiana and
agriculture in Florida. The old powers still ply the statehouse
halls, seeking to wield influence. But the halls are a lot more
crowded these days.

A BIG WEEKEND COMING FOR SPARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif _ Los Angeles Sparks coach Michael Cooper was
not overly pleased with his team's performance against the Indiana
Fever on Wednesday at Conseco Fieldhouse, but he had to admit that
a win is better than a loss, no matter how ugly.
</P>
<P>
   And there is something to be said about winning four games on
the road and extending a winning streak to seven games.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, Los Angeles has managed to defeat the
WNBA's winningest team, the Houston Comets (13-2). It also managed
to scrape by with a 74-72 win over the Washington Mystics on Monday
and defeat New York in front of thousands of Liberty fans at
Madison Square Garden the day before.
</P>
<P>
   So yes, a win is a win. But even more noteworthy is that Los
Angeles (11-2) is finding a way to get those wins under various
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the Sparks hope to extend their seven-game streak
at home, as they take on the Cleveland Rockers at 5:30 tonight and
the Detroit Shock at 5 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets still sport the best record in the league and have a
one-game lead on the Sparks entering Friday's play, but Los Angeles
is building steam.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-game win streak is the franchise's best, one better
than the former record (set in 1999).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lisa Leslie was named player of the week for her
efforts against Houston, Miami and New York. In that three-game
stretch, she averaged 20 points, 10.7 rebounds and 3.33 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika, who led Los Angeles against Indiana with 19
points, has been a major scoring threat for the Sparks in the past
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   To extend their win streak, the Sparks will have to defeat
Cleveland, the third-place team in the Eastern Division, and
Detroit, the East's second-place team.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers enter tonight's game with a loss after falling to
one of the new expansion teams, Portland Fire, 80-69 last Saturday.
Detroit has defeated its past two opponents, including an 82-78 win
over the Seattle Storm in which Wendy Palmer led her team with 32
points. &QL;

<P>
   MORE MONEY IN STATE POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   Simply registering to lobby in a state is likely to trigger a
barrage of letters from legislators asking for campaign donations.
Just as much as the increased costs of campaigning, the enlargement
of the donor pool appears to be contributing to the staggering
increase in the costs of politics at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   The states don't have uniform reporting procedures, and it is
much harder to get comprehensive statistics about campaign finances
at the state level than the federal. But there are strong
indications the South's capitols have witnessed an inflation in
costs that rivals Washington.
</P>
<P>
   According to a public interest group, the North Carolina Forum
for Research and Economic Education, what the average winner spent
in a North Carolina Senate race rose from $36,301 in 1994 to
$82,161 in 1996 and $110,638 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And the spending figures don't tell the entire story. Much of
the money being raised from lobbyists and their clients is going
into the coffers of powerful legislators who have weak or often no
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the cases where their races aren't contested, they're
raising lots of money to chase away possible opponents and to
funnel money to their colleagues,'' said Bob Hall, director of
Democracy South, a public interest group based in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   A few states have attempted to contain campaign spending at the
legislative level, but this has proved difficult. Florida, for
instance, has a $500 cap on contributions to state races, but it
allows unlimited soft money contributions to the state parties,
which in turn have great flexibility in getting money back to the
candidates. For example, soft money contributions to the Florida
Republican Party, which now controls the Legislature, jumped from
$9.9 million in 1996 to $24.3 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by Florida Common Cause, health care
interests and the insurance industry each contributed more than
$442,000 to the two parties in the first three months of this year,
when the Legislature was about to consider a measure that affected
patients' right to sue their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure failed. So did legislation affecting the sale of
generic drugs, after pharmaceutical interests contributed more than
$79,000.
</P>
<P>
   The increased emphasis on political action committees and
campaign contributions does not sit well with Dakin, schooled in
the ``eyeball-to-eyeball'' approach. But, he says, ``the system
runs on revolving funds,'' and lobbyists understand they have to
open their checkbooks to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers the ``personal touch,'' which sometimes means
ordering carry-out dinner for 150 or 200 people in a committee room
without making a big deal about who picked up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing the game doesn't just mean campaign contributions.
Playing the game means being there all the time, every time,''
Dakin said.
</P>
<P>
   SHADOW SECTORS
</P>
<P>
   Along with money and personal contacts between powerful
executives, their lobbyists and the legislators, a traditional
source of power throughout the South has been the number of
employees _ and voters _ companies such as Carolina Power &AMP; Light
had in legislative districts throughout North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Guillory observed, these local powerhouses are
being outnumbered by companies, such as EDS, which are
headquartered out of the state, or, as is the case with
Glaxo-Wellcome, out of the country. These companies do not often
leave the same deep footprint in the Capitol corridors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the noticeable developments across the region is
the rise of what might be called shadow sectors: big business
interests that either can't, or choose not to, play the traditional
game of statehouse power politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling in Louisiana and tourism in Florida provide contrasting
examples of the effect shadow sectors can have.
</P>
<P>
   While observers detect a splintering of business interests
elsewhere, John Maginnis, who has written several books on
Louisiana politics, says the biggest change in that state's power
politics the last few years has been the unifying of business
interests under the banner of LABI, the Louisiana Association of
Business and Industry.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the business lobby hung together to defeat a proposed
oil and gas processing tax supported by Gov. Mike Foster, who
helped unify the business community to pass his tort reform
measures and has since been foiled by business in his attempt to
find new revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas gets off the hook, Maginnis said, because the
Legislature can always hang another tax increase on casinos and
video poker. The gaming sector spent enormous political capital to
gain entrance into Louisiana, and with its revenues skyrocketing it
has little influence to prevent its becoming a cash cow for the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louisiana's always been able to survive on other people's
money,'' Maginnis said. ``It used to be oil and gas, and now
gambling has started to fill the gap.'' But ``taxing Texans,'' as
they call it in Louisiana, only puts off the day when the state
will have to reckon with the shortcomings in its tax structure, he
contends.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Florida would describe the tourist industry as a
pushover at the Legislature, but it is subdued in the role it
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think Disney and some of the Central Florida
entertainment attractions would run the state. But Disney is a very
low-profile corporate citizen in Tallahassee,'' said Richard
Pinsky, a lobbyist and Republican campaign consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was directly affected, he noted, Disney didn't
flex any muscles when a proposal to tax cruise ships came up _
aware, perhaps, that the measure was going to fail anyway. But the
tourist sector also didn't speak up for itself this year, he said,
when the South Florida counties eliminated auto emissions testing,
a move that could lead to more pollution, tighter government
restrictions and fewer tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Southern states, which have been generous in
bestowing incentives to new industries, Florida has lost a number
of businesses to Arizona and other states. That is due in part,
Pinsky believes, to tourism, which brings revenue into the state
and has little interest in attracting more industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the changes being felt in the Southern economy are only
slowly being reflected in terms of influence in state legislatures.
The old giants still wield considerable power _ but they do so in a
more crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question tobacco has less clout today than 30 years
ago. There's also no question they still have a lot of clout,''
Coble said of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Similar things are said about oil and gas in Louisiana and
agriculture in Florida. The old powers still ply the statehouse
halls, seeking to wield influence. But the halls are a lot more
crowded these days.

 &HT;    Young political enthusiasts are bringing new zest into
Democratic and Republican organizations
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When scores of the state's behind-the-scenes
politicos showed up in Columbus last month to schmooze at the
annual Ohio Board of Elections Association conference, the
Montgomery County contingent stood out like a Brownie troop at a
senior citizens ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would go into these hospitality suites and people would
look at us and say, `What's going on in Montgomery County? These
people are so young,' '' said Nan Whaley, who at age 24 is both
executive director of the county's Democratic Party and a member of
the local Board of Elections.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Whaley at the convention was her mirror image in
Montgomery County politics _ 27-year-old John Shaw, the executive
director of the local Republican Party _ who, like Whaley, holds a
patronage job as a member of the election board.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the two young party execs is a growing cadre of
20-something and early 30-something political workers who are
giving the lie _ at least in the Dayton area _ to the notion that
Generation X is a bunch of slackers who would rather whine about
societal problems than fix them.
</P>
<P>
   The youth infusion has meant ``more pep and vigor in the party
in the last three to four years than in a long time,'' said James
E.P. ``Sully'' Sullivan, 79, a longtime local Democratic Party
player and a former director of the Montgomery County Board of
Elections.
</P>
<P>
   In typical partisan fashion, the two parties each claim to be
the Pied Piper of the local youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 100 Young Democrats in Montgomery County. They
have three Young Republicans,'' Whaley sniffed. ``There is no
organized Young Republicans in Montgomery County.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw begged to differ. The Democrats ``may have a stronger
organization, but we have just as many strong young people'' in the
local Republican ranks. ``Just going to club meetings doesn't mean
you're active.''
</P>
<P>
   RECRUITING THE YOUNG
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County Democratic Chairman Dennis Lieberman said he
got the ball rolling across the generations here in 1996, soon
after the overthrow of former chairman Joe Shump and the old
Democratic guard, by resurrecting the College Democrats Club at the
University of Dayton. The club's growing membership was then
invited to join the county Young Democrats and put to work within
the local party structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word got out that we cared about young people and that we
tried to get them involved in things,'' Lieberman said. ``As a
result, we got lucky and ended up with some very good young
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The list includes Whaley; Charlie Bowling, 29, who helped
rebuild the Young Democrat organization here; Troy Singer, 34, who
ran Tony Hill's top vote-getting campaign last fall for the Dayton
school board; and Hill himself, 31, who started out as an adviser
to U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, R-Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jacobson, chairman of the Montgomery County Republican
Party, says local Republicans have done their own trolling for
youth, primarily by changing the way the party recruits and
promotes its workers.
</P>
<P>
   It's no longer who you know, or how long you've paid party dues,
Jacobson said. Now it's what you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started recruiting young people right out of college that
we think have talent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican kiddie list now includes Shaw; Chris Heizer, 27,
director of the Montgomery County Board of Elections and vice
president of the local Republican Party executive committee; Doug
Tully, 29, supervisor of the Board of Elections and a member of the
local Republican committee; and Jon Husted, 32, who is running for
the 41st District seat in the Ohio House of Representatives being
vacated by J. Donald Mottley, R-West Carrollton.
</P>
<P>
   FROM ENVELOPE-STUFFING TO COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, while the Democrats tend to talk about the
youthful vision and energy that Generation X has brought to party
politics, Republicans are more likely to tout their technical and
organizational skills.
</P>
<P>
   Menial tasks such as typing addresses, stuffing envelopes and
tallying votes used to be the drudgery that greased the political
machine, They were often assigned to armies of senior citizens with
plenty of time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's all done by computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we get bright young people who can take apart a computer
and put it back together again,'' said Susan Finley, co-chair of
the Montgomery County Republican Party who also sits on the Board
of Elections. At age 68, Finley calls herself the ``house mother''
of the local election board.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Mitchell, author of ``Generation X: The Young Adult
Market'' (New Strategist, $69.95), said it's unusual for Dayton to
have so many young people involved in local politics, especially
party politics. ``The thing that is most striking about this
generation is that they tend not to identify with any political
party,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The young pols in both parties worry that too many of their
peers continue to be alienated from the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just immaturity,'' Singer said. ``As we grow
older, we become more aware of how people in office can affect our
paychecks because of taxes that are taken out, how they can affect
the economy and jobs that are available.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Evans, a 19-year-old member of UD's Young Democrats, says
many of her classmates are apathetic about the political scene
because they are confident that good jobs are waiting for them
after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people my age feel very comfortable, almost
complacent,'' Evans said. ``But how long is this (prosperity) going
to last?''
</P>
<P>
   Whaley says that for many Gen-Xers, the bad times are already
here, but younger voters aren't getting the message. ``Most of my
generation is underemployed and don't have good (employee)
benefits. But they don't equate that with the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS OFTEN RUNS IN THE BLOOD
</P>
<P>
   The Gen-Xers involved in local politics most often credited
their families for their interest in political careers.
</P>
<P>
   Whaley cites the inspiration of her mother, who also was active
as a Young Democrat and who later ran for a number of local and
state offices in Indiana, including state auditor. Her mother most
recently won election as clerk-treasurer of Mooresville, Ind., in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Singer's uncle, Enos Singer, was a past president of the Ohio
Board of Elections Association and a longtime veteran of statehouse
politics. His grandfather, Kenneth Singer, was a trustee for many
years in Monroe County in southeastern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   For others, national leaders provided the inspiration to enter
politics. ``My first interest started with Ronald Reagan . . .
because he made us proud to be Americans again,'' Shaw said. ``I've
been reading presidential biographies ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Democrat and Republican youth squads concurred that
Montgomery County's evenly divided vote, and often hotly contested
races, is the challenge that drew them into local party politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people have plenty of opportunities to work in Columbus
or (Washington) D.C., but Dayton is fun,'' Whaley said. ``It's the
number one swing county (for elections) in the state. Every race is
a real fight here. People can win on 400 votes out of 50,000
cast.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw agreed. ``It's an exciting county. Franklin and Hamilton
are mostly Republican. Toledo and Cleveland are mostly Democrat.
But this is just a good 50/50 county with a lot of contested
races.''
</P>
<P>
   They may teasingly call each other R's and D's, but the young
politicos here insist the rivalry only brings them closer socially.
</P>
<P>
   On election night last year, the kiddie corps from both parties
went out to celebrate together. ``Do we argue? Oh yeah,'' Shaw
said. ``But it's all in fun. Nobody ever gets upset about it
because we all know where everybody is coming from before we get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gen-Xers shy away from politics, Shaw puts at least part of
the blame on the system itself. ``I think, frankly, they want to
see more candidates their own age to relate to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   `I PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH WAS'
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the young pols here have been content to work
behind the scenes as campaign workers, strategists and committee
members. But many are itching to run for office and some, like
31-year-old Tony Hill, already have.
</P>
<P>
   After serving for several years as a campaign worker for other
local candidates, Hill ran for Dayton school board last fall and
nabbed the most votes in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be one of those who just complained about
things going wrong,'' he said. ``I kind of put my money where my
mouth was.''
</P>
<P>
   Too often, the younger generation is blamed for not being
engaged in politics ``when the real problem is that the political
system has failed to engage them,'' said Gen-X expert Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people do things out of a civic obligation _ you vote
because you're supposed to,'' she said. ``But younger people aren't
going to vote because of that. You have to give them something to
vote for, give them something to get excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   Term limits may help create some of that excitement in the
statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be there for 10 years before getting into a
position of standing, because everyone is limited to eight years
anyway,'' said Husted, citing one of the reasons he decided to run
for Mottley's vacated seat.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said political leaders can't wait too long before
unleashing other Gen-X candidates, or they'll lose young voters
completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time to start looking at our generation _ not
just on the school board, but to serve downtown on the (city)
commission and in the statehouse as well,'' he said. ``I think we
have some outstanding young people in the city. We need to make
sure we're growing these people for elections down the road.''

ACLU, OTHERS SUE LOS ANGELES OVER CONVENTION EXILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A coalition of civil liberties, labor and protest
groups sued the city of Los Angeles on Friday, claiming LAPD
security plans will keep demonstrators too far from Staples Center
and interfere with their free speech rights during the Democratic
National Convention next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The selection of a presidential candidate is a critical focal
point in our democratic process, a time when we should be
encouraging speech, not putting it in a straitjacket,'' said
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California executive
director Ramona Ripston, whose lawyers brought the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU attorney Dan Tokaji said the security buffer and a
designated ``protest pit'' would so marginalize protesters as to
make it impossible for them to express their constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ACLU will ask a federal court judge to issue a
preliminary injunction as early as Wednesday to block
implementation of the security plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basic constitutional rights cannot be put on ice simply
because a political convention is in town,'' Tokaji said.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council has ordered that Pershing Square downtown be
opened to the expected 50,000 protesters as a ``safe haven,'' but
is reconsidering in the face of a public outcry and warnings from
the Los Angeles Police Department and Secret Service that the area
cannot be secured.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney Debra Gonzales said the city will work with
protest groups within security constraints, which include assuring
the safety of President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and
convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say there won't be room for compromise,'' Gonzales
said. ``But obviously the secure area was established in
consultation with the DNC and the federal agencies responsible for
security. They said the area had to be secure. We've tried to be
reasonable, but obviously there is disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   DNC committee spokesman Peter Ragone said organizers will work
with all parties, including the ACLU. The lawsuit was filed on
behalf of Service Employees International Union Local 660, the Los
Angeles Coalition to Stop the Execution of Mumia Abu-Jamal and the
D2K Convention Planning Coalition, an umbrella group for anarchists
who protested in Seattle and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC wants the issue, ``resolved in a way that protects the
freedom of expression of the demonstrators while also being mindful
of the security of delegates who are expressing their views,''
Ragone said.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD spokesman Cmdr. David Kalish said the ACLU action comes
more than a year after its attorneys declined to sit at the
planning table with police, citing a shortage of staff lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish said he could not comment directly on the lawsuit, but
said police are committed to protecting protesters' rights, as well
as to preserving law and order.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it gets to a balance between First Amendment rights and
providing security at the events, it must come down to common
sense, to being reasonable,'' Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   The security buffer around Staples Center stretches from Venice
Boulevard on the south to Olympic Boulevard on the north; and from
the 110 Freeway on the west to Flower Street on the east.
</P>
<P>
   The designated protest site is at Francisco Street and Olympic
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of protest groups contends that those distances
have been upheld by courts as excessive, and wants access to two
fenced parking areas just north of the center, and to the
sidewalks. It also wants to terminate a couple of marches at 11th
and Figueroa streets, inside the current security buffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think people should be allowed speech activities within the
secure, or no access, zones,'' Tokaji said.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor who specializes in
free-speech issues, said there is a balance of interests
governments must consider in drafting security plans that place
limits on assembly and speech.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the restrictions are applied equally to all groups,
``the government has some, though not unlimited latitude to try to
prevent traffic tie-ups and violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government, however, cannot impose unreasonable or overbroad
restrictions, such as banning leafleting or protesting in a blanket
manner over an excessively large area.
</P>
<P>
   There is some leeway for unusual circumstances, too, which could
apply to the DNC, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a high-profile political event, which in the
past has led to violence, and there is a situation where there is a
serious security concern, then the City Council would have more
flexibility in imposing these restrictions,'' Volokh said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the city cannot be overbroad, or impose restrictions that
are disproportionate to the risk, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, the deputy city attorney, said the city is sensitive
to and committed to protecting protesters' constitutional rights.
She said, however, there is case law allowing the city to place
reasonable limits on the time, place and manner in which people
gather in consideration of others' safety, property protection and
transportation flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said people are free to associate and to exercise
free speech as long as they don't violate the law,'' Gonzales said.
``We've always worked with protest groups, but we can't dismiss
security issues.''

KRISPY KREME BUILDING NICHE MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATSWORTH, Calif. _ Krispy Kreme is going silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Southern doughnut maker is pairing up with Pacific
Theatres in an unusual partnership that gives theatergoers the
chance to snack on powdered and jelly along with their popcorn and
jujubes.
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme has opened its second location in the San Fernando
Valley and has plans for a third within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   The new location, which opened Tuesday inside Pacific Theatres'
Winnetka Stadium 21, might be the only Krispy Kreme outlet in a
movie theater, said the doughnut retailer's Southern California
franchisee. Its upcoming outlet is planned for another unlikely -
but wise - location: at California State University, Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme already has similar outlets at Cal State Fullerton
and Dodger Stadium, but the theater pairing is a unique one, said
Richard Reinis, chairman of Great Circle Family Foods, the
exclusive Southern California franchisee for Krispy Kreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised to see it here. It's pretty unusual to see it
next to the movie theater,'' said Beverly Fleming of Chatsworth.
``I'll keep coming here because it's closer.''
</P>
<P>
   The outlets, with a more limited menu and a bit less decoration
than the regular stores, are a new concept that Reinis said he
hopes will catch on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect to have other points of sale, either under our
direct control or under other reputable strategic partners ...
throughout the Valley and the rest of the Los Angeles area,''
Reinis said.
</P>
<P>
   The doughnuts are not made on-site, but rather delivered from
nearby stores such as Krispy Kreme's Van Nuys location.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Frost, manager of the Winnetka Stadium 21 theaters, said
the outlet has been selling 400 to 500 dozen doughnuts since its
Tuesday opening. As the public's awareness of the outlet grows, he
expects to sell more.
</P>
<P>
   The doughnuts are a little more expensive than at the regular
stores: $4.50 for a half-dozen, or 75 cents each. The store is open
``from 10 a.m. until the last doughnut is gone,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   A theater manager by training, Frost said he had a lot to learn
managing the doughnut shop as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that's completely new to Pacific Theatres,''
he said. ``I was surprised when I found out how many people are
here from the East Coast.''

   CLINTON TWEAKS GOP
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in Philadelphia on Friday that
Republicans will talk a good game when they arrive for their
convention in late July but are not eager to to point out the
serious differences that divide the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have the awfullest time trying to figure out what the
differences are,'' Clinton told a group of union members. ``They're
going to love everybody and help everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a gathering of the American Federation of Federal,
State, County and Municipal Employees, Clinton recited a litany of
issues on which Democrats and Republicans diverge, from the
patients' bill of rights to the minimum wage to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also questioned Texas Gov. George W. Bush's commitment
to Hispanics, saying he had not urged Republican senators to
confirm Enrique Moreno, a Texan whom Clinton nominated as a federal
judge. ``If he had asked them to give him a hearing, they would
have done it,'' Clinton said of Bush. ``He didn't say a word.''
</P>
<P>
   TRUTH SQUAD TAKES AIM AT BUSH
</P>
<P>
   The city where Gov. George W. Bush will be nominated for
president has been chosen by a ``Texas Truth Squad'' _ made up of
union members from Bush's home state _ for the beginning of a
national speaking tour intended to besmirch the governor's record.
</P>
<P>
   The squad, consisting of a teacher, a prison guard, a food
worker and a social worker, made its debut on Thursday at a union
luncheon in Philadelphia presided over by John J. Sweeney, the
president of the AFL-CIO, which has endorsed Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Squad members asserted in a series of short speeches that during
Bush's two terms as governor, Texas has consistently ranked near
the bottom in providing health insurance for children, retirement
pensions, environmental protection and pay for state workers.
</P>
<P>
   Taking special aim at Bush's claim to be an education reformer,
the group said he had diverted money from public schools and tried
to raid teacher retirement funds at a time when the state ranked
45th in the College Board test scores. The squad is scheduled to
make at least a dozen appearances around the United States before
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY CHALLENGER OFF BALLOT
</P>
<P>
   Jack E. Robinson, the entrepreneur who had hoped to be the
Republican challenger to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, did not have
enough valid signatures to put his name on the ballot, leaving
Massachusetts without a Republican contender for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The state ballot law commission ruled Friday that 153 of the
10,139 signatures that Robinson turned in on June 6 were invalid,
leaving him 14 short of the 10,000 signatures he needed to secure a
spot on the ballot. The commission, a panel of three Republicans,
one Democrat and one independent appointed by the governor, found
that 90 of those invalid signatures were forgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has five days to appeal the ruling. Without a
Republican on the ballot, Kennedy will face only Carla Howell of
the Libertarian Party on Election Day.

AT A SCHOOL IN HARLEM, A NIGHTMARE RESONATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City's public school system needed qualified
teachers willing to work in its most downtrodden districts.
Jonathan Bassoff wanted just such a job.
</P>
<P>
   Though raised in Colorado and schooled in Iowa, Bassoff wanted
to teach in Harlem, as his mother had done before the family moved
west. Shortly after receiving his master's degree in education last
year at New York University, Bassoff took a job at Community School
200.
</P>
<P>
   But Bassoff, 26, is not teaching there anymore. This spring, two
sixth-grade boys were charged with raping one of Bassoff's
fourth-grade students in a school stairwell. Days later, Bassoff
was fired for what his termination letter, without elaboration,
called ``egregious'' conduct, and the school's principal and
assistant principal were demoted and reassigned elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That a 9-year-old girl could be raped by two 12-year-olds in a
school stairwell demonstrates on its face that Community School 200
is not like most American schools. But the school's daily disorder
and the troubled backgrounds of many of its students also highlight
the obstacles facing the best-intentioned recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Before the rape, teachers say, C.S. 200 was a place where
students blithely walked out of classrooms and wandered the halls,
and where administrators did not respond to teachers' appeals to
stop them. Novice instructors were promised mentors to coach and
acclimate them to such challenges as maintaining control of a
classroom, but the teachers say they would seldom see the mentors.
</P>
<P>
   Bassoff and other teachers say the rape occurred when the
9-year-old girl and her classmates were supposed to be in the
lunchroom under the supervision of other school employees. Bassoff
had left them there before going to lunch himself. Even before
classes began, Bassoff said, he found little support from the
school's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   When Bassoff arrived at the school, the fourth grade already had
a reputation for unruliness. Vondora Jordan, whose daughter was one
of Bassoff's students and who regularly visited the school as
president of the Parents' Association, said Bassoff's class ``was
known as the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Mr. Bassoff was an excellent teacher,'' Jordan said.
``He did what he could in the classroom. But he didn't have an
aide, and it was hard to control those students.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassoff concedes that he is not a tough disciplinarian. But he
also said the school did little to help him. Though he was promised
a mentor, the mentor visited him only twice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   During a faculty meeting a few weeks before the alleged rape,
one first-year teacher, Archie Manning, asked what _ short of
physically restraining a student _ he could do when someone decided
to leave class. He said he knew the procedure was to call the
principal's office and report it, but that rarely seemed to result
in anything that discouraged repeat incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Grubbs, a third-grade teacher who was at the meeting,
said Diopoulos, the school's principal, and Agnes Howell, the
assistant principal, had two reactions. First, they said, students
should not leave class. And second, if the teacher was in control,
students would behave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, they gave no answer,'' Grubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Diopoulos, who was demoted to an assistant principal and has
been reassigned to Public School 92 in Harlem, declined to answer
questions about his tenure at C.S. 200. ``I tried the best I could
for those children,'' he said. ``Some people are irritated because
they weren't doing what they should be doing. I guess they're
getting their licks in.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell said that she did give extensive support to Bassoff and
other first-year teachers, helping them plan lessons and sometimes
sitting in on classes. Now working in the District 5 office, she
said she believes she was unjustly removed.
</P>
<P>
   The principal and assistant principal were reassigned, rather
than fired, in part because they had tenure in their former,
lower-ranking positions. But Bassoff, as an untenured teacher,
could be dismissed without lengthy hearings.

MEXICAN VOTERS CHOOSE BETWEEN SECURITY, CHANGE 
 
(ADV FOR SUNDAY JULY 2; INCL. TRIM MARKERS) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico chooses a new national government today in
a vote that could prove the fairest, and one of the most important,
in this nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   In making their selection, the country's nearly 59 million
eligible voters will have to balance promises of stability against
vows of clean and credible government, schemes of economic progress
against calls for a new deal for the poor, visions of the future
against legacies of the past.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, they will have to decide whether the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, will stay or go after 71
years of ruling this rapidly developing but still impoverished
land.
</P>
<P>
   Most opinion polls showed PRI presidential candidate Francisco
Labastida locked in a tight race with Vicente Fox, the
blunt-talking candidate of the center-right National Action Party.
Although the polls differ as to who has the lead, most give each
man about 40 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a left-leaning former governor and son of a
PRI founder who has been running for president against the ruling
party for the past 12 years, has about 18 percent of the vote, the
polls indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Two splinter candidates share the remaining few points.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 71 years we have been putting up with tricks and lies,''
Fox said in an appeal for support on a nationally televised news
program Wednesday, the final day of campaigning. ``Now is the hour
to look out for our children. The future is ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidates and independent election watchdog groups
have complained of uneven media coverage benefiting the PRI and of
a deluge of government spending, especially in rural areas, aimed
at assuring Labastida's election.
</P>
<P>
   However, reforms pushed through the Mexican Congress four years
ago make difficult, if not impossible, the sort of ballot-box
stuffing and outright vote theft by which critics say the PRI has
retained power in local, state and federal government. Most
Mexicans now understand that their vote will be free and secret,
according to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vote with confidence that your vote is secret and will be
respected,'' President Ernesto Zedillo, a member of the PRI, said
in television spots that saturated the airwaves last week.
</P>
<P>
   That alone marks today as a political watershed.
</P>
<P>
   The political organization that became the PRI was forged to end
the bloody squabbling among victorious generals of the Mexican
Revolution. The party has controlled Mexican national politics
since 1929, making it the world's longest-ruling regime.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians say the party was born with a sort of ``original
sin'' because its first presidential election, like several others
since, was marred by fraud. But through its decades of rule, the
party also has won widespread popular support by producing relative
peace, a long-lasting economic expansion and real improvements in
the lives of Mexico's poor majority. Until recently, those enabled
many Mexicans to overlook the cronyism and corruption that also
have marked the PRI's long reign, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Agustin Basave, a former assistant interior minister and
disenchanted PRI ideologue who now teaches political science at a
Mexico City university, explained:
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI in the last 70 years in power has weaved a profound
network of support that remains strong,'' Basave said. ``In spite
of all the scandals and corruption, the PRI has penetrated the
whole country at the grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is in every tiny, little town,'' he said. ``It is the
party that, with all its defects, has done something for people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got fertilizer. Your brother-in-law got a government job.
Someone else got some money to go to school.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI also enshrined in Mexico's constitution strict six-year
term limits that prevented its presidents from becoming dictators
of the sort that have plagued much of Latin America throughout
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Latin America struggled with coups and civil wars,''
Basave said, ``the PRI was building roads and increasing
educational spending.''
</P>
<P>
   That largesse and social tranquility fostered a loyalty in many
Mexicans that prevails to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party has done a lot in 70 years,'' said Jose Villa Yanez,
72, a retired customs officials who attended a Labastida rally in
Mexico City the other day. ``It's given us work. It's educated us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we have, we have because of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   But such opinions are in the minority now, according to most
polls. Once assured of 80 percent of the vote or more in national
elections, the PRI now struggles to hold onto less than half of the
electorate. And the disenchantment has worsened as the economy and
political freedoms have improved.
</P>
<P>
   A June survey published by Banamex, Mexico's largest private
bank, found that while most Mexicans were generally unconcerned
about the economic outlook, some 71 percent expressed
dissatisfaction with the overall situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere have the PRI's roots dug deeper and lasted
longer than on the farm, home to the poorest and least-educated
quarter of Mexico's 100 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the countryside there is an alliance from years back with
the party and the governments of the party,'' Labastida said in an
interview as he campaigned in northern Sonora state last month.
``Because in Mexico, half the land was redistributed. Communal
farms and small private land holdings were created.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is counting on the rural vote to win today's election
for him. But some analysts, and some farmers, say that is not as
certain as even a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Economic policies that were begun under President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari and continued by the current administration have driven
many small farmers to the door of desperation. Now, although many
rural families still fervently support the PRI, others are no
longer convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is the PRI? Where is our government?'' asked Pedro
Palacios, who grows a few acres of sugar cane on a communal farm in
Tierra Blanca, a mostly rural township of 100,000 people in
southern Veracruz state. ``They like to say the peasants are with
them, and then they only visit the towns and the cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just need us for the vote,'' Palacios said. ``They just
use us.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The PRI, and today's presidential elections, were the hot topics
one recent evening as Palacios and four friends sat drinking beer
and watching the sunlight fade in front of a small house in La
Atalaya, a forlorn cluster of tiny concrete homes set among emerald
fields five miles south of Tierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   All five men owe their livelihoods to the PRI. Their fathers
received their land from President Lazaro Cardenas, Cuauhtemoc's
father, during a wave of redistribution in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, they enjoyed subsidized government prices for their
sugar cane and other crops. In one election after another, they
dutifully voted for PRI candidates. Now, at least for some of the
men, that marriage is over.
</P>
<P>
   The year's harvest had just ended, the sugar delivered to the
nearby mill. But the mill managers claimed to have no cash, the
farmers said. Most of them were not paid.
</P>
<P>
   As the caps came off one beer after another, the talk became
angrier, more heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are lost out here, deserted,'' said Mario Barada, who farms
about 20 acres of cane in a neighboring village. ``How are we going
to maintain our families?''
</P>
<P>
   Farm prices have fallen so low in recent years that it barely
pays to cut the cane, the men said. The mangoes aren't worth taking
from the trees. Milk is better left in the cow.
</P>
<P>
   As in villages and towns across Mexico, most families in Tierra
Blanca have someone _ a father, aunt, brother or cousin _ working
in the United States. A young man from the town was one of two
Mexicans who drowned in the Rio Grande at Brownsville a few weeks
ago as television cameras rolled and police on both sides of the
river did little to save them.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tierra Blanca used to be solid PRI country, like most of
Veracruz state. But three years ago, the National Action Party won
the city hall. The opposition now controls half of the state's
townships. And the party is expected to win again in October
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The once monolithic PRI began to lose its grip on Mexican
politics 17 years ago, following an economic collapse brought on by
the government's overspending and overborrowing at the height of
the 1970s oil boom. National Action and other opposition parties
won a string of city halls along the U.S. border and across
northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas further damaged the ruling party in 1987,
when he led a group of disgruntled left-leaning politicians out of
the PRI in protest of its increasingly free-market and pro-U.S.
tilt.
</P>
<P>
   Although the PRI has since held on to the presidency _ claiming
a fraud-fueled victory over Cardenas in 1988 and winning a
relatively clean vote in 1994 _ it lost control of the lower house
of Congress three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the loss of Congress ended the presidency's near
total hold on national power, opening the way for real democratic
change.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties now govern 11 of Mexico's 31 states and most
important urban centers, including Mexico City. More than half of
Mexicans today live under opposition local or state governments.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when Mexican voters would turn against the PRI, the
party often resorted to electoral fraud to hold on to power .
</P>
<P>
   The clearest example of such maneuvering, critics say, was the
1988 election in which the PRI's candidate, Harvard-educated
economist Salinas, was declared president after vote-counting
computers inexplicably collapsed for three days.
</P>
<P>
   While the PRI has rarely been as brutal as an outright
dictatorship, some party leaders haven't shied from violence when
patronage, persuasion or vote-pilfering failed them, human rights
advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican army's 1968 massacre of hundreds of unarmed student
protesters stands as one stark example. The troops fired on the
orders of President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, historians say. And
recently, troops, police and paramilitary organizations controlled
by the PRI in the southern states of Chiapas and Guerrero have
slaughtered scores of unarmed peasants in separate incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas' Democratic Revolution Party claims that nearly 650 of
its militants have been killed for political reasons in the past 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the PRI has also proved responsive, albeit sometimes very
slowly, to Mexican society's evolving political demands and social
values.
</P>
<P>
   Critics  &UR; s &LR; ay its willingness to mutate underscores the party's
soulless nature, proving that power rather than principles drives
the party's politics. But the PRI's defenders say its flexibility
has been its forte, allowing the party to stay relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a rigid party,'' said Javier Trevino, a top Labastida
campaign adviser who earned a master's degree in political science
at Harvard. ``The PRI has a great capacity for change.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, changing the PRI has meant trying to
remake it into a modern democratic party. Labastida won his
candidacy in an open primary last November. It was the first time
the PRI's candidate had not been personally selected by Mexico's
outgoing president, who was also the de facto leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Under most of the PRI's long reign, Mexican presidents have
ruled as near-emperors. PRI-controlled Congresses, government
bureaucracies, unions and peasant organizations rarely opposed a
president's will. Each president put his own ideological stamp on
the party and, in turn, on all of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many voices within the PRI, but there is only one
leader,'' is how Trevino puts it. Other have a harsher take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is a party that still doesn't have its own
personality,'' said Basave, who was once in charge of the PRI's
leading policy think tank. ``It was always remade in the image of
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's system provided opportunities for politicians with a
range of ideologies, because each new Mexican president brought his
own supporters into the bureaucracy every six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have very important mobility within the PRI,'' Trevino
said. ``The PRI has the capability of adjusting and evolving. If
the PRI were one person, one strongman, it would have died a long
time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If a Labastida victory extends the PRI's hold on the presidency
for another six years, he will have to govern Mexico in a far
different fashion than his 13 PRI predecessors, many analysts
agree. With a stronger political opposition in place, making deals
_ rather than decreeing policies _ almost certainly will be the
order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as so complicated,'' Labastida said during the
interview in Sonora state last month. ``Why can't we think in
formulas like those in Europe?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't we think of agreements between parties? Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprises us as new,'' he said of the give-and-take of
democracy. ``It's new for us, but it's not new for the world.''

 CHARLES MacGILLIVARY, 83, BATTLE OF BULDGE HERO  
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles A. MacGillivary, who won the Medal of Honor as an Army
sergeant for destroying four German machine-gun nests in France on
a one-man patrol in the Battle of the Bulge, died on June 24 at a
hospital in Boston. MacGillivary, who lost his left arm while
silencing the last of the enemy emplacements, was 83 and lived in
Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of a stroke, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours of Dec. 16, 1944, German forces in the
Ardennes region of Belgium launched a surprise attack spearheaded
by tanks along an 80-mile front in a bid to split the
British-American front and capture Antwerp, the Allies' largest
port. The onslaught opened a triangular bulge, 60 miles deep and 60
miles wide at its base, through the Allied lines and inflicted
81,000 casualties over the next six weeks before the Allies
regained the initiative and went on to invade Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Battle of the Bulge is perhaps best remembered for Brig.
Gen. Anthony C. McAuliffe's reply to a German surrender demand at
Bastogne: ``Nuts.'' But it was the GI _ men like MacGillivary of
the 71st Infantry, 44th Infantry Division _ who turned the tide.
</P>
<P>
   MacGillivary's company was attacked by a German tank division
near Woelfling, France, near the German border, on Dec. 17. The
Americans were pinned down in snowy woods on New Year's Day,
running out of ammunition and talking of surrender. The company
commander had just been killed, and MacGillivary had taken his
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the head of my company, I had a duty to do something,'' he
would recall.
</P>
<P>
   MacGillivary set out on a one-man mission to destroy the German
machine guns menacing his company. Firing two submachine guns _ his
own, which ran out of ammunition, and another he picked up on the
battlefield _ and hurling grenades, he wiped out the German
positions and killed or wounded the defenders. A wounded German at
the last emplacement hit MacGillivary with a machine-gun burst on
his left side, but he fired back and killed the man. Then, as he
would tell it, ``I looked down and my arm wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get hit by a machine gun, it's like somebody put a
hot poker in you,'' he told the Boston Globe in 1995. ``I stuck the
stump of my arm into the snow, but the warm blood melted the snow.
I kept scooping snow around it till my hand was freezing. I figured
I was dying. When they rescued me, my arm had a cake of bloody ice
frozen around it, sealing the wound. If it had been summer, I'd be
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   For his one-man foray enabling his company to continue its
mission with a minimum of casualties, MacGillivary received the
Medal of Honor from President Harry S. Truman at the White House on
Aug. 23, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   McGillivary was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island,
Canada, and came to the Boston area to join a brother at the age
16. He served in the American merchant marine, joined the Army soon
after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and became an American
citizen. He participated in the Normandy invasion, then moved
through France with his division.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he was a special agent for the Customs Bureau in
Boston. He served as president of the Congressional Medal of Honor
Society from 1973 to 1975 and undertook a project to list past
winners of the medal who, like himself, were foreign born.
</P>
<P>
   McGillivary is survived by three daughters, Ann
MacGillivary-Schonland of Duxbury, Mass.; Joan MacGillivary-Ward of
Kingston, Mass., and Charlene MacGillivary-Corea of Windham, N.H.;
a brother, Roland, of Weymouth, Mass.; nine grandchildren, and a
great-grandson. His wife, Esther, died in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In reflecting on the Battle of the Bulge, MacGillivary minimized
his heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I was doing was fighting for my life,'' he said. ``The
guys were freezing to death and my main ambition was to get us out
of there.''

MOYNIHANS SELLING FARM IN AN EFFORT TO SIMPLIFY

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There it was, tucked quietly in between the ads for the $4.5
million Greek Revival and the $2.5 million Colonial, announcing the
end of a political era: ``DeMulder Realty Better Homes and Gardens
is pleased to offer for sale: Derrymore, beloved country estate of
Elizabeth and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.''
</P>
<P>
   The price, $1.1 million, included two houses, two barns,
``bucolic views,'' pastures, woods, fields, ponds, a stream and
``8,000 feet of road frontage!''
</P>
<P>
   A phone call to Derrymore in upstate New York took the cheery
real estate language of Friday's advertisement in The Wall Street
Journal to a more human dimension. ``It's over 500 acres,'' sighed
Elizabeth Moynihan, the retiring senator's wife, who was cleaning
out the woodshed that serves as her office while she spoke. ``It's
a lot of work to maintain it, for me. Pat doesn't drive, and
everyone I know over 70 is doing the same thing. He's giving up the
Senate, and I'm giving up the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are farms, and then there is the Moynihan farm _ the
four-term senator's spiritual home, the site of the 19th-century
schoolhouse where he has written his 18 books, a political base
that tied the man born in Hells Kitchen to the history and hills of
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the political symbolism of the farm that Hillary Rodham
Clinton asked the Moynihans last summer if she could use it to open
her ``listening tour'' of New York state. The unforgettable sight
of that day was of Moynihan slowly walking the woman who was
seeking to replace him down the verdant road from his schoolhouse,
as if giving away a bride, to the gantlet of press assembled in his
hayfield. There were at least 200 reporters, 30 television cameras
and eight satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up this morning and went out on the front step and
saw the satellite trucks at the top of the hill,'' Moynihan said at
the time, ``I felt like a character in `The Invasion of' _ you
know, one of those space alien movies.''
</P>
<P>
   But that most photographed moment of the Moynihans' lives at the
farm _ in the one-traffic-light hamlet called Pindars Corners,
about 70 miles west of Albany, near Oneonta _ was also an odd one.
The couple bought the farm in 1964 (Elizabeth Moynihan refused to
say for how much) and over the next 36 years rarely if ever used it
for political events. Occasionally reporters would interview the
senator there, but mostly it was the place where the senator and
his wife spent their summers and raised their three children, Tim,
44; Maura, 42; and John, 40.
</P>
<P>
   But those days are over. ``It's called simplifying your life,''
Elizabeth Moynihan said Friday. ``Life has different cycles.
Listen, I've painted these walls, I've painted this woodwork, I've
planted these gardens. Who's going to do it? Who's going to take
care of it?''
</P>
<P>
   The senator, a scholar-farmer who never actually gardened,
concurred. ``When I see her out there farming the gardens,'' he
said Friday from Washington, ``I think it's time to say, `Liz, why
don't we go over and look at the Botanical Garden in the Bronx?'''
</P>
<P>
   The prospective sale, he added, ``breaks your heart a little,
but it's time.'' The senator is 73 and still recovering from major
back surgery last year. His wife, who is 70, said Moynihan's
``insides are fine, the head is great, the infrastructure is a
little rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moynihans said the sale of the farm did not necessarily mean
that the senator, whose fourth term is up at the end of this year,
would no longer be a resident of New York. The plan, they said, was
to buy a smaller country house. ``I don't need over 500 acres,''
Elizabeth Moynihan said. ``I don't need two houses, I don't need
three ponds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moynihans, who also own a condominium on Pennsylvania Avenue
in Washington, bought the farm in February 1964, three months after
John F. Kennedy's assassination, while Moynihan was assistant
secretary of labor. ``We always wanted a farm,'' Moynihan said.
``We'd put the dog and the children and so forth in the station
wagon and zigzag across Pennsylvania and look around. When Kennedy
was assassinated, we were pretty depleted. And one day Liz got in
the car with our daughter and just made the trip, got to Oneonta,
and went to a real estate agent, and they said, yeah, they had a
farm for sale. She saw it first thing and said, `That's it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, then, never actually saw the farm before he bought it?
``Nor did I ever do any of the gardening,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Moynihan said that her real estate agent had received
a few interested calls, and that she was planning to show the farm
to one prospective buyer on Monday. Now that the couple had reached
the decision to sell _ only last week, she said _ she was eager to
have it over with. ``I'd just like to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was also looking forward to her life post-gardening.
``People have been visiting me for 38 years,'' she said. ``And now
I'm going to start visiting them.''

CONTRACT TO ENROLL NEW YORK CITY POOR IN HEALTH PLANS IS EXTENDED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After citing ``serious concerns'' about flaws in an
initiative by New York City to move one million poor residents on
Medicaid into managed care health plans, State Comptroller Carl
McCall approved a two-year extension of the program Friday, along
with a list of recommendations on how to improve the effort.
</P>
<P>
   McCall spent several months reviewing the request by the state
Department of Health for the $40 million extension and expansion of
a collaborative state and city program, raising a series of
questions about Maximus, the Virginia-based contractor hired to
help enroll the poor in their new insurance plans. The original $24
million contract expired Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to have serious concerns regarding the performance
and integrity of Maximus and your agency's oversight and
monitoring,'' McCall wrote in a letter Friday to Antonia C.
Novello, the state commissioner of health. ``This is not simply an
issue of contract compliance. The health and well-being of Medicaid
recipients is dependent upon the quality of these outreach
services.''
</P>
<P>
   By intention, the switch to managed care should cut government
cost and enhance health care, because Medicaid recipients would
have their own family doctors instead of relying, as many now do,
on emergency rooms. But the process of linking people with
managed-care doctors has proved complicated in New York and other
states, in part because so many Medicaid recipients do not speak
English.
</P>
<P>
   The mandatory switch to managed care is happening in phases
across New York City, with the effort so far limited to Staten
Island, Lower Manhattan and southwest Brooklyn. Medicaid recipients
are given 60 days to pick a health plan and doctor, after which
both are assigned. Maximus sets up neighborhood seminars and
operates a telephone center to answer questions about the plans.
</P>
<P>
   McCall urged the state and Maximus to improve the training and
monitoring of the call center staff. The state-maintained list of
health plan doctors also needs to be revised, he said, to remove
errors that at times result in patients being assigned to doctors
who do not speak their language or are not part of the managed-care
network. And the state needs to simplify the process of granting
mandatory enrollment waivers to people who have special conditions
or cannot find a doctor who speaks their language, he said.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Signor, a spokesman for the State Department of Health,
said the department was pleased that the comptroller had approved
the two-year extension and the expansion of Maximus' services into
Nassau and Suffolk counties. But he added that the criticisms
McCall raised had in large part already been remedied or were in
the process of being so.
</P>
<P>
   Rachael A. Rowland, a Maximus spokeswoman, said the company was
prepared for the audit McCall said he planned to determine whether
his recommendations were being followed.

EDITORIAL: NICE TAKES HOLIDAY AS CANDIDATES HEAT UP EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Senate campaign in New York already has an overheated
quality, like a machine that is revving at full throttle minutes
after a jump-start. Four months before Election Day, Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Rep. Rick Lazio are hammering each other with a
ferocity that usually does not surface until October. Their
intensity raises an intriguing question. What are they saving to
use after Labor Day?
</P>
<P>
   The problems for each are fairly obvious. Lazio's late start
means he must fix an image of himself in the public mind before she
does. Clinton, whose well-known liabilities turn up in virtually
every poll, must use advertising and speeches to add a negative to
Lazio's portfolio for every negative on her side. That way, come
November, people may be debating issues more than personalities.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Lazio and his advisers have to work on adding
gravitas and on sanding down any sharp ideological edges. So far,
the Clinton campaign may be ahead in this definitional contest. It
has successfully nailed Lazio's political inconsistencies and
missed congressional votes. Such tactics can easily backfire,
however, if Clinton can be accused of ginning up the mighty White
House machine in the interest of sacrificing a lone congressman to
her ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by ferreting out the details of Lazio's votes on
abortion, patients' rights, hate crimes and gun control, Clinton
does more than raise questions about whether he talks like a New
York moderate but votes like a Washington conservative. The first
lady also raises questions about her own lack of a voting record
and, indeed, her lack of substantial political experience
independent of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton has so far had her share of luck. Just as the
independent counsel spared her any charges on the travel office
firings at the White House, Lazio began facing his own troubles
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has been
investigating whether Lazio violated insider trading laws three
years ago by investing in a company controlled by some of his
largest contributors. Lazio has denied any impropriety, and his
supporters have angrily labeled the investigation a Democratic
dirty trick. Detailed scrutiny of a candidate's past, however, is
part of the campaign experience for everyone, as Clinton knows only
too well.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign is also running fairly smoothly, while
Lazio's effort, after a strong launching, has been showing signs of
stress. He has made the kinds of missteps that afflicted Clinton a
year ago. One mistake was for Lazio to skip a gay pride parade in
New York City in favor of a farm stop upstate. He missed a chance
to pick up votes he might not get otherwise in order to talk to a
crowd that already favors him. Lazio's assertions that he will have
an open campaign have worn thin as journalists have been blocked or
limited in their queries. A missed vote on heating oil and a vote
against disclosure of the new secret 527 slush funds have become
easy fodder for Clinton, although Lazio was able to strike back on
the heating-oil vote by pointing out that one of her Congressional
supporters skipped it in order to raise money with her. Lazio aides
admit their man has looked a little off balance. They argue that he
entered the campaign as if shot from a cannon and will soon settle
down.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans complaining about the stream of money coming to
Clinton are taking steps to compete, as they illustrated this week
with a Manhattan fund-raiser that took in $1.7 million. Almost
weekly a new poll shows that despite the lopsided appearance of a
contest between a celebrity first lady and a barely recognized
congressman, this contest remains so tantalizingly close that it is
worth _ and will require _ major expenditure of money and energy by
both parties. &QL;

EDITORIAL: JEALOUSLY DRIVES EVEN GREAT NATIONS TO PETTY ACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 1:
</P>
<P>
   Jealousy drives even great nations to do petty things. France
offered an embarrassing demonstration of this truth earlier this
week when it alone, of more than a 100 countries attending a
conference on democracy held in Warsaw, refused to sign a final
declaration of agreed principles.
</P>
<P>
   France helped launch the worldwide democracy movement with its
1789 Revolution against monarchy and feudal privilege. The ideas of
freedom that drove that upheaval found expression in a charter of
basic liberties issued the same year, the Declaration of the Rights
of Man and the Citizen. The document asserted the equality of all
citizens and their right to governments of their own choosing,
proclaimed the liberty of opinion and expression, and demanded
adherence to the rule of law. Its resonant claims inspired
democrats throughout the late-18th-century world and reinforced the
ideas of America's own, earlier revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Warsaw declaration that France refused to sign on Tuesday
reaffirms some of these same principles for the 21st-century. It
provides that the basis of all government is ``the will of the
people,'' that every person is entitled ``to equal protection of
the law'' and ``freedom of thought, conscience and religion.'' If
some of the fervor and purity of 1789 is missing, something perhaps
even more valuable has been added. The governments of well over
half the world's countries, including some whose democratic
performance leaves something to be desired, have now committed
themselves to a set of principles defining democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   France says that it could not join this list because it feels
that designs for democracy cannot be imposed by well-meaning
outsiders. But France's real problem seems to be the leading role
played by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in convening the
Warsaw democracy conference. Washington's prominence at Warsaw
proved more than French pride could bear.

EDITORIAL: A VERY BUSY LEGISLATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 1:
</P>
<P>
   Albany is quiet this week after a frenzy of legislative activity
unlike any seen for many years. With a budget approved early and a
vital election a few months away, the Legislature squeezed in the
time to approve almost 700 bills to go to Gov. George Pataki for
signing.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes a strong gun control package, an important
hate crimes bill, a bill requiring fire-safe cigarettes and another
providing for public access to critical data about doctors and
hospitals, to name only a few. Still, legislators failed to reform
the campaign finance and ballot systems, revamp the antiquated
Rockefeller drug laws and restructure the state courts.
</P>
<P>
   What unblocked the usual petty stalemates at the end of this
year's legislative marathon remains a political mystery. But there
was a little more fresh air and good political will wafting through
the closed rooms where state laws are manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   After a bitter power struggle between Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver and rival Assemblyman Michael Bragman, Silver began trying
to keep members more informed, even soliciting their input at
various stages in the deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, shuddering at the
possibility that Democrats could take over his chamber after
November's election, began leading his flock toward normally
dormant political territory, finally approving a decent hate crimes
bill being pushed for more than a decade by the Democrats. Pataki
angled for environmental improvements and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The hope, of course, is that this dusting of moderation and
compromise will not blow away after the election. There are still
important bills to be passed. At the top of that list would be
reform of a campaign finance system that has few real limits on
contributions to individual candidates and no limits for donations
to political parties. This is a need so basic it should serve as
the rallying cry for any challengers in this year's election.
