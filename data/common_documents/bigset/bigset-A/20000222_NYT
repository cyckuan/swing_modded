MAYBE A-ROD WILL SHOCK HIS AGENT _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ So, the Mariners will meet Wednesday with Alex
Rodriguez and his agent, Scott Boras. Does anyone believe beyond a
shadow of a doubt that No. 3 will be at Safeco Field on opening
day?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only person with reason for hope is Mariners CEO
Howard Lincoln, the man who can make Rodriguez far richer than,
let's say, Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are willing to pay whatever it takes to make A-Rod
the centerpiece of the franchise. Not that money always matters.
Look at Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   However, regardless of the mega-dollars the M's are willing to
shower upon A-Rod, the shortstop and his agent have held their
position. Rodriguez wants to play out the season in Seattle, then
make a decision about a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Mariners have executed nearly every personnel
move suggested by A-Rod during the November meeting with club
officials, it seems Lincoln wants the chance to make sure the
shortstop has not changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because Rodriguez has twice waved off Boras during
negotiations with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The first time was when A-Rod first signed with the M's for a $1
million bonus after they made him the No. 1 pick in the 1993 draft.
Boras had his client about 12 hours away from attending classes at
the University of Miami, just to stick it to the M's.
</P>
<P>
   Boras, who a few years later held out the Phillies' top draft
pick, J.D. Drew, because the Phillies wouldn't pay free-agent
dollars, wanted to make A-Rod his test case against underpaid draft
picks.
</P>
<P>
   During an emergency meeting with Mariners officials, A-Rod
finally relented, against Boras' direction.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Rodriguez accepted a four-year contract
extension from the Mariners _ a deal that will keep him below
market value this season, considering buddy Derek Jeter is making
almost $10 million for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For that extension, A-Rod again went against his agent's wishes,
because at the time, A-Rod wanted to set his family financially.
Since then, though, Rodriguez has said he will listen to Boras this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   In no uncertain terms, A-Rod knows this next deal is for all the
marbles. And despite his low-key, wait-and-see, boy-next-door
demeanor, A-Rod has been licking his chops.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to make a big splash. Somewhere. Bigger than Griffey
going home. Bigger than Sammy Sosa holding out for $160 million in
Chicago. Bigger than Jeter in New York, if any of those things are
possible.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the final hand of poker will get interesting
because, deep down, the M's know there is a bit of the little boy
in A-Rod.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln hopes history might repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure I know what his agent thinks, but I want to
hear what Alex has to say,'' Lincoln said a few weeks ago during
the Mariners' FanFest.
</P>
<P>
   Should A-Rod stick to his guns, though, Lincoln surely will give
general manager Pat Gillick the green light to commence the
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched Randy Johnson and Griffey both demand out of
Seattle, the Mariners are getting used to this rejection stuff, and
Gillick, remember, is far less sentimental about M's draft picks
who become the biggest thing since Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, behind Gillick's willingness to accept the Reds'
cut-rate deal for Griffey was Lincoln's insistence to take whatever
it could get for the former No. 24.
</P>
<P>
   As for A-Rod, it is interesting to remember that he wears No. 3
_ not for Babe Ruth but for Dale Murphy, the former Atlanta Braves
outfielder whom Rodriguez idolized.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta isn't New York, Los Angeles or Chicago, where the White
Sox have talked about trading for the marquee shortstop. But A-Rod
is intrigued by the Braves' potential to reach the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Braves didn't want to part with Andruw Jones for
Griffey. But that's because their first choice in the trade market
was the other Mariners superstar, the one who would play next to
Chipper Jones in the infield and shore up their suddenly anemic
batting order.
</P>
<P>
   You don't think the Braves would do a little better against the
Yankees in the World Series should A-Rod be vying for the spotlight
against Jeter?
</P>
<P>
   It hardly seems possible that the Mariners are up for another
round of high-powered trade talks, not after what they've just been
through to clear Griffey out of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, it is the Mariners who have control, since
Rodriguez cannot veto any trade. Probably, the Mariners have saved
their kick for the finish.
</P>
<P>
   As the Griffey deal ground on noisily over the winter, Rodriguez
and the Mariners have been making cooing noises. All is well, both
sides have said. Time will tell what happens.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's time to tell.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the standoff between the Mariners and their shortstop
will no doubt begin in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, A-Rod shocks everyone, including his agent.

WHITE, HOLLANDSWORTH BEGIN THEIR BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The two principals involved in what surely
will be the best battle of the Los Angeles Dodgers spring arrived
Monday. And though manager Davey Johnson said Devon White is his
starting center fielder, Todd Hollandsworth will have every chance
to win the job.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation White isn't used to, nor was he expecting it
after signing a three-year free-agent deal with the team after the
1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the organization is saying that Hollandsworth is the player
to play center field, so be it,'' White said. ``When the time
comes, if I have to speak out, I speak out. I can't worry about it
at this time. I'm going to continue to do what I've done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is people might say, 'Oh, they're trying to
light a fire under him.' What the hell is that? I can't even answer
that. I'm coming in here with a positive attitude and no one is
going to make that change. I'm not going to be bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, White said he's anxious to show the Dodgers that he
shouldn't be judged because he's 37 but rather by what he does on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Dodgers are hoping. When he's healthy, White is
one of the best defensive outfielders in baseball. But there was
concern last season when he missed games because of neck, hamstring
and groin problems.
</P>
<P>
   He hit .268, had 14 homers, drove in 68 runs and stole 19 bases
but was limited to 122 starts. White's also had offseason shoulder
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what anyone is saying, that I have to fight
for a job,'' White said. ``The bottom line is I'm here to do what
they're paying me for, and that's what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wants his center fielder to bat leadoff, whether it's
White or Hollandsworth. White, who prefers not to bat first, said
that's fine, as long as he stays there. He said it was difficult
jumping around in the batting order last season. Most of the time,
White hit fifth or sixth (a combined 91 starts) but also led off 13
times and batted second (seven times), third (twice) and seventh
(nine times).
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything to be said, last year I did everything for
the organization from (batting) first to second to third, to fifth,
sixth and seventh,'' White said. ``I accommodated everyone. This
year I think I have to be the selfish player and get in a spot I'm
comfortable with and know who's around me. That's the way I have to
look at things now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's got to be the scapegoat. If it's on my shoulders
now, I can handle it, but I'm going to handle it on my terms. I'm
not going to be all over. I don't want to be all over the lineup to
accommodate everybody else. I need to be in a spot. When the time
comes, Davey and I will talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Hollandsworth unseats White as the Dodgers' opening-day
center fielder depends a lot on White. But Hollandsworth said he's
not worrying about it. Instead, his focus is on avoiding the
disabled list for a full season, something that hasn't happened
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have as good a chance as anybody,'' Hollandsworth
said. ``I'm going to try to take my best game out there each and
every day during spring training and during the season, just like
any other time, and let the actions speak for themselves. The
opportunity is there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Extra bases: The rest of the Dodgers are expected to report
today and the first full-squad workout is Wednesday. . . . Tommy
Lasorda arrived in town Sunday and was in uniform and helping out
Monday.

GORE, BRADLEY WIVES CAMPAIGN IN WASHINGTON STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LACEY _ The initially troubled presidential campaign of Al Gore
became resilient and successful when he moved out of the vice
president's supporting role and began speaking his mind, Tipper
Gore said here Monday night after a day of campaigning for her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the transition from being a sitting vice president to
a candidate campaigning with his vision of the country,'' she
added. ``The vice president is, of course, part of a team ... in
the background, a team player, what you hear on the late night talk
shows. It goes with the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore and Ernestine Schlant Bradley, wife of former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, made separate appearances last night at
an annual crab feed sponsored by the state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Both women are campaigning in what will be for Democrats a
two-part process of picking their party's delegation to this
summer's national convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Republicans, Democrats are treating next Tuesday's
presidential primary as a beauty contest. It will show the relative
strength of Gore and Bradley, but delegate selection will be based
on results of the March 7 precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 Democrats devoured crab, with Olympia lobbyists
clustering and chatting during last night's speechmaking. Those who
bothered to listen were treated to two ebullient women, each
professionally talented, each an intense and full partner in her
husband's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine Bradley argued that a prosperous America should again
dream big dreams. ``Now is the time, with the economy as good as it
is, that we move to get health insurance for all Americans,'' she
declared. ``It is an issue of social justice.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that President Franklin D. Roosevelt embarked on the
country's most sweeping social program of the century, Social
Security, in the midst of the Great Depression. A president should
display ``leadership and obstinacy'' in insisting that reforms be
carried through, she argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is the more radical and inclusive (candidate),'' she told
the audience, citing such proposals by her husband as a ban on
those pistols known as Saturday night specials as well as
registration of all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, Mrs. Bradley, known professionally as Dr. Ernestine
Schlant, talked intensely and in detail about an issue facing the
United States and its European allies _ entrance of the far-right
Freedom Party under its leader Joerg Haider into Austria's
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill has said, and I concur, that we must join the European
Union countries that have cut off relations (with Austria),'' she
said. ``This (Haider) is not an acceptable person. I am very much
in favor of telling Austria this is not the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   An immigrant and the daughter of a Luftwaffe officer, Ernestine
Schlant Bradley is a professor of German language and literature at
Montclair State University in New Jersey. She is best known
professionally for the book The Language of Silence: West German
Literature and the Holocaust, which examines the work of post-World
War II German authors and their treatment (or lack thereof) of Nazi
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, who has known her husband since the age of 17, went
public last year with the fact that she had experienced clinical
depression and undergone successful treatment. The period of
depression came after the Gores' son, Albert III, was nearly killed
when hit by a car outside Baltimore's Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, who has a grduate degree in psychology, said last
night that by going public she hoped to ``help erase the stigma''
surrounding mental illness. ``In so doing, I would be doing
something that was meaningful to me,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's spouse has been known mainly in happy
settings. A talented photographer, she has turned her lense on the
press corps and TV cameras that are part of her husband's life. The
result has been picture books on a family striving to hold onto
normalcy in the fish bowl life of high office.
</P>
<P>
   But the causes of mental illness, its treatment and changing
perceptions, has been Tipper Gore's special passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to talk about it, deal straightforwardly with it, and
embrace employers and fellow employees in curing it,'' she said
last night. ``We need to have insurance policies that do not
discriminate against this illness that originates in the brain. The
brain is, after all, part of the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has paid 13 visits to Washington since the 1996
election, and is due back in the state Saturday night for a
Democratic chili dinner. In his wife's view, the vice president
became most deeply tied to the state on one visit that was not
publicized _ the trip last July when Al Gore and Albert III climbed
Mount Rainier in the midst of lightning, high winds and blowing
snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the proudest things he has ever done,'' Tipper
Gore said last night.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, too, has a link to the state's natural environment. He
visited the Elwha River in 1992, and became convinced of the wisdom
of removing two dams that blocked upstream migration of salmon. He
guided through the Senate legislation authorizing dam removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked his talk,'' Ernestine Bradley told Democrats at
their dinner last night.
</P>
<P>
   She was unable to join her husband on his 1992 trip to the
Elwha. ``It was when I had breast cancer,'' she said quietly. When
he wasn't legislating rivers, Bill Bradley stepped in and took
charge of every facit of his wife's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are both survivors,'' state Rep. Val Ogden, who has also
experienced breast cancer, said in introducing Ernestine Bradley
last night.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore and Ernestine Bradley did not actually meet last
night. They did exchange cordial greetings at a Boise, Idaho,
dinner late last year. Gore was being escorted by Bethune Church,
widow of the late Sen. Frank Church. Bradley was with former Idaho
Gov. Cecil Andrus. In the small world of Democratic politics, one
of Andrus' daughters is married to one of Church's sons.

DODGERS MIGHT HEADLINE IN VEGAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ At this time next year the Los Angeles
Dodgers could be training in Las Vegas instead of Dodgertown.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with representatives from Arizona are on hold, a bill is
awaiting introduction to provide funding in Florida, but
discussions between the Dodgers and representatives of Las Vegas
are going strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an interest in Las Vegas,'' said Bob Graziano, Dodgers
president and chief operating officer. ``Obviously, we'd have to
work in conjunction with other teams to form a complex there.''
</P>
<P>
   The site in Las Vegas would have to house four teams, but
officials from the city want to make the Dodgers the nucleus. The
Texas Rangers, Houston Astros, Toronto Blue Jays, Baltimore Orioles
and Kansas City Royals are the other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers would like a long-term solution to the
spring-training site by the end of the 2000 season, but Graziano
said that might not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, from our perspective, we want to move fairly quickly
on this,'' Graziano said. ``It's hard to tell (when a decision
would be made). It depends on what happens in the Florida
legislature, it depends on Arizona, and it depends on what's going
to happen in Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida Sen. Jack Latvala (R-Palm Harbor) is expected to
introduce a bill this week that could allocate as much as $7
million to the local municipalities for purchasing Dodgertown from
the club, then renovating it. But a decision isn't due until June.
The city of Vero Beach and Indian River County already have $12.5
million in funding.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Phoenix residents will vote in November on a tourism
tax to raise $329 million to build the NFL's Arizona Cardinals a
new stadium. The tax would also provide funding to aid the Cactus
League.
</P>
<P>
   One concern with Las Vegas is the gambling issue. But Graziano
said that based on previous discussions with Major League Baseball
over training on an Indian reservation that has a casino, it
shouldn't be a problem. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To a chorus of boos, shouts and cheers at the Apollo
Theater in Harlem, Bill Bradley and Al Gore engaged on Monday night
in the most brutal presidential debate of the year, with Bradley
attacking the vice president as a ``conservative Democrat'' and
Gore caustically describing Bradley as a ``desperate'' candidate
intent on tearing down his fellow Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The two men drew their swords almost as soon as the session
began, and from there on in, turned almost every question into an
attack on their opponent. It was politics as spectacle, produced in
an 87-year-old theater that is better known for the music of
Charlie Parker and James Brown than debates between men seeking to
be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've seen is an elaborate, what I call Gore Dance,''
Bradley said, showing none of his earlier resistance to the attack
as he mocked his opponent standing just feet away when the subject
turned to the two men's position on registering hand guns. ``It's a
dance to avoid facing up to your conservative record on guns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley,'' Gore responded, ``a couple of days ago,
your campaign said that you wanted to get some things off your
chest. Well, since then you've made personal attack after personal
attack. The problem is these attacks don't solve any problems. They
do divide us as Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``You're sounding a little desperate because you're
trying to build yourself up by tearing everybody else down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, speaking to a mostly black audience, repeatedly
attacked Gore for voting in 1981 in Congress to overturn an
Internal Revenue Service ruling that would forbid tax exemptions to
private schools whose enrollment did not reflect the racial
enrollment of the community they were involved in. Early in the
debate, Bradley produced a sheaf of papers, which he said included
a stack of the bills Gore had supported, and tried to thrust them
into Gore's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture was reminiscent of what Gore had attempted to do to
at an earlier debate, on ``Meet the Press,'' when he challenged
Bradley to agree to foreswear any more political advertising.
Bradley ignored Gore's hand that Sunday morning, and Gore returned
the gesture on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that the bill Bradley referred to dealt with quotas,
and that it had been approved by an overwhelming majority in
Congress, with the votes of most Democrats. And trying to turn the
tables on Bradley on another issue of concern to this audience,
Gore questioned why Bradley had voted against expanding the number
of broadcast franchises available to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ignored Gore's challenge, turning back to the vote ``to
preserve tax-exempt status for schools like Bob Jones that racially
discriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was emblematic of a debate, sponsored by Time and
CNN, that repeatedly seemed on the verge of running out of control,
both because of the candidates on stage and a particularly rowdy
audience that offered the candidates a memorable image of New York
politics at its most insolent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time, time, time,'' the moderator, Bernard Shaw, said
repeatedly as Gore, in particular, attempted to respond to Bradley,
who was by far more aggressive than he has ever been before.
</P>
<P>
   ```Look, Mr. _ Mr. Moderator, and as a point of personal
privilege, can I respond to that?'' Gore asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the rules the rules agreed to by both your
staffs, you cannot, sir,'' Shaw responded, to a swell of laughs
from the 1,500-seat hall.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, an audience member bellowed at Gore when a
question was raised about the environment. ``Vice President Gore,
if you support environmental justice what are you doing about the
fact that $500,000 of your money . . .'' He was drowned out by loud
yells from the audience, leaving the candidates standing in awkward
silence.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, this was the toughest presidential debate
involving Republicans or Democrats this year. Again and again,
Bradley attacked Gore as a conservative Democrat, with a suspect
history on affirmative action, abortion and gun control. Gore
responded by portraying Bradley as desperate and untrustworthy,
asserting that his health care program endangered the elderly and
aides patients.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At times, it seemed unlikely that anyone in the audience _ or
watching on television _ could follow the details of the charges
that Gore and Bradley threw at one another. At one point, Bradley
referred, rather obliquely, to a page in the book ``All Too
Human,'' by George Stephanopoulus, Clinton's former senior aide, to
assert that Gore had worked in the administration to undermine
affirmative action. Gore repeatedly affirmed his commitment to the
program last night.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The debate was the first in a month, and came at a particularly
critical time for Bradley, whose campaign nationally _ and in New
York, a state where he had once been seen as posing a powerful
challenge to Gore, _ has seemed increasingly adrift.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's supporters viewed Monday night's session as a chance,
arguably one of his last before New York and several other crucial
states hold primaries on March 7, to effectively put his campaign
back on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks made up 16 percent of the electorate in the 1992
Democratic primary in New York. President Clinton won 52 percent of
the black vote, according to a survey of voters leaving the polls
at the time was key to his winning the three-way race with 41
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time that Gore and Bradley have appeared at a
debate devoted to black issues. The audience on Monday night was
almost entirely black, invited by community and church
organizations. And the first question was posed by the Rev. Al
Sharpton, who suggested two weeks ago that the two Democratic
candidates for president hold a campaign on racial issues in a
black community.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley agreed on a few things. They both denounced the
flying of the Confederate flag in South Carolina, drawing a
distinction from either one of the Republicans who they might face
in November. Both Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain
of Arizona have declined to condemn South Carolina for flying the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   They also joined, in response to a question from Sharpton, in
decrying the Amadou Diallo shooting case, describing it as evidence
of racial insensitivity in police departments. Both candidates said
they would issue executive orders to ban so-called racial
profiling, in which police departments use race as a factor in
evaluating the potential risk of a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also think it reflects racial profiling in the sense of
racial profiling that seeps into the mind of someone so that he
sees a wallet in the hand of a white man as a wallet, but a wallet
in the hand of a black man as a gun,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate had barely begun when the two candidates began to
snipe at each other with unusual ferocity. The first question,
posed by Sharpton, focused on what each candidate would do to ban
racial profiling and prevent police brutality while keeping crime
low.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley repeated his earlier exhortations of why Gore did not
simply stroll down the hall to ask President Clinton to issue an
executive order, immediately, banning racial profiling. Gore said
that work, indeed, had begun to move in that direction. But he
issued the first of numerous one-line zingers by firing back: ``You
know, racial profiling practically began in New Jersey, senator.''
</P>
<P>
   The nastiness permeated the next few minutes, on issues ranging
from possible reparations for slavery, to health care, to
technology and education for African-Americans. Several times, Gore
criticized Bradley for failing to support legislation that would
have expanded the number of African-American and minority-owned
broadcasting outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, said Bradley wanted to
approach this aggressively and came out swinging. ``We're loaded
for bear and we're going to go get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the approach, he said ``Obviously the stakes are
high, but there's a lot to swing at. People deserve a choice and we
painted it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've started a two-week mission,'' he said explaining that
this would be an all-out effort before the March 7.

L.A. POLICE UNION WANTS INDEPENDENT PROBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH AND BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Disgusted by corruption within its ranks, the
police union representing 9,500 LAPD officers on Monday
unexpectedly called for an independent citizens review of the
widening Rampart scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Protective League's decision to back
civilian oversight of the investigation marked a ``historic
departure from its past bulwark defense of all things LAPD,'' the
union said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents a great leap forward for the police union, and
it's also the first step in reinforcing to the public that
restoring the credibility of the Police Department is our single
biggest priority,'' said union President Ted Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also important for the public to know that the police
union is solidly in favor of a thorough, fair and comprehensive
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 75-year history, the union has never before called for an
outside review of the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   By doing so, the union finds itself at odds with Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks, who opposes such a review, and in an unusual
partnership with the ACLU and other civil rights leaders, who have
long criticized the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD spokesman Cmdr. David Kalish said the department believes
police oversight is properly the responsibility of the five-member
Police Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're an independent body that provides civilian
oversight,'' Kalish said. ``We have confidence in the Board of
Police Commissioners to fulfill that critical role.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen LAPD officers have been fired or relieved of
duty in connection with the corruption detailed thus far by
corrupt-cop-turned- snitch Rafael Perez in sworn statements to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said it is ``imperative that an official, arm's-length and
objective viewpoint weigh in on the report in order to assure
public confidence in its findings.''
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of the police union, USC law professor Erwin
Chemerinsky said Monday that he has agreed to conduct an
independent review of the LAPD report on the scandal, which is due
to be released March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Parks convened a special Board of Inquiry to investigate the
corruption centered in the Rampart Division's Community Resources
Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unprecedented in this city,'' Chemerinsky said. ``The
protective lea the first time really wants to be a force for
progressive change and reform in the Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Chemerinsky, who served as the chairman of Los Angeles' elected
Charter Reform Commission, stressed that his review will be
independent, not prepared on behalf of the union. Chemerinsky said
he will oversee a research and administrative staff and expects the
review to take 30 to 90 days to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said Chemerinsky's work is ``not meant to supercede the
work of the civilian Board of Police Commissioners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any report that portends to be thorough must include findings
and recommendations regarding the Police Commission and its role in
rooting out corruption, hiring policies and management oversight,''
Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This they cannot do objectively without active public
participation in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The corruption probe ignited in September when Perez agreed to
incriminate himself and other cops in exchange for a lenient prison
sentence for stealing eight pounds of cocaine from an LAPD evidence
room. He is scheduled to be sentenced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Parks maintains that his investigators have given the District
Attorney's Office enough evidence to prosecute three dirty cops
connected to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   As the Daily News reported Monday, District Attorney Gil
Garcetti has not filed criminal charges against individual
officers, choosing instead to try to build stronger cases against
them and pursue broader conspiracy charges against all the dirty
cops involved.

VOTING BEGINS TODAY IN ARIZONA'S REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (News analysis) 
 By JEFF BARKER 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
The Republican presidential race arrives in Arizona Tuesday. Sort
of.
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 900,000 registered Republicans are eligible to vote in a
sleepy primary that has seen home-state Sen. John McCain playing
the role of absentee landlord.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's state campaign seems to be running pretty well without
him. He didn't spend much time in Arizona, nor did he seem to need
to. Polls show him with a commanding lead over Texas Gov. George W
. Bush, who opted to concentrate on the close Michigan contest
instead of campaigning over the holiday weekend in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates have been conspicuously absent, the large
demand for absentee ballots suggests a healthy turnout. That may be
due to several factors: the excitement of McCain's success and his
media bonanza outside of Arizona, and a certain soap-opera quality
unique to the Arizona contest.
</P>
<P>
   The once-intriguing story line opened when Republican Gov. Jane
Hull not only endorsed Bush last year, but told stories about
encounters with the senator suggesting he had a volatile temper.
</P>
<P>
   National pundits wondered why McCain seemed to alienate some top
Republicans in his state. A New Hampshire television anchor
pointedly asked McCain during an early debate why those who knew
him best seemed to like him the least.
</P>
<P>
   But Hull later sought to downplay her comments about McCain's
temper. Asked by ``The Arizona Republic'' during January's New
Hampshire campaigning whether voters should even consider the issue
in their deliberations, she replied, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never expected to win this state,'' Hull said Monday,
even though the Bush campaign spent thousands on television ads
that have run since December.
</P>
<P>
   While the McCain-Hull split has been uncomfortable for party
regulars, Hull stressed that she respected McCain, downplaying the
very public rift. But she added that Bush was the better man for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain won the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1, it seemed to
give him momentum everywhere, including in his home state. What
remains to be seen is whether McCain's loss to Bush Saturday in
South Carolina will dampen any of that enthusiasm, although the
late polls suggested it would not.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain's Senate chief of staff, Mark Salter, was asked by a
reporter early in the year whether he was concerned about Arizona,
he simply shook his head and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Salter's confidence was certainly boosted by the clout McCain
holds in the party.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, McCain has run as anti-establishment reformer
challenging the party apparatus. In Arizona, McCain ``is'' the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has close ties to many Arizona companies: America West,
US West and Phelps Dodge, to name a few. Not only have state
businesses contributed to his presidential bid, some have loaned
him lobbyists to help with advance work on the campaign trail. &QL;

NEW ANTI-HATE LAWS INTRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sparked by the Jewish Community Center shooting,
Gov. Gray Davis proposed a series of tough anti-hate laws Monday
and urged schools to adopt anti-hate curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, speaking at the Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of
Tolerance, said the legislation, which he expects to receive
bipartisan support, would give California the toughest hate-crime
laws in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would add three years to any prison sentence for
a felony hate crime, and extend the statute of limitations for
filing hate crime charges to three years from one year.
</P>
<P>
   Davis focused his legislation on so-called hate groups,
proposing to expand their definition to include two or more people
who associate for the purpose of committing hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate groups strike at the very heart of what it means to be an
American, and we are obligated to fight back,'' Davis said. ``We
are the most diverse people on the planet Earth. That was God's
plan. We need to start living like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is drawn from a blue-ribbon panel Davis
appointed, shortly after a white supremacist was accused of
wounding five people at a North Valley Jewish Community Center and
the fatal shooting of a postal carrier in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In its 66-page report, the panel co-chaired by former Secretary
of State Warren Christopher and former California Gov. George
Deukmejian, found that a rise in hate crimes is fueled by
California's rapid growth and increasingly diverse population.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, more than 1,800 hate crimes were reported in the state
involving 1,985 suspects and 2,136 victims, 70 percent of which
involved violent crimes. In the San Fernando Valley, hate crimes
rose by 22 percent from 1998 to 1999, rising from 169 to 206.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the crimes appeared to be the work of people
acting on their own, the influence of hate groups frequently was
found in their backgrounds, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   The report identified 36 hate groups in California, including
the Nazi Low Riders in the San Fernando and Antelope valleys, the
Peckerwoods in Chatsworth and the Antelope Valley, the Aryan
International Movement in Los Angeles and the World Church of the
Creator in Monrovia and Redondo Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience is 70 percent of hate crimes we investigate are
committed by thrill-seeking individuals who don't have a commitment
to hate ideology,'' said Deputy District Attorney Carla Arranaga,
who leads the office's hate crime suppression unit.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates there are more than 60
paramilitary-type organizations in the state, including militia,
``patriot'' and anti-government groups.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' legislation would make the violation of anti-paramilitary
laws a felony rather than a misdemeanor. Currently, it's a
misdemeanor for paramilitary groups to meet for the purposes of
practicing with weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Also, paramilitary group members who teach or demonstrate
firearms- and explosives-related activities can also be charged
with misdemeanors. The new law would make them felonies.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would simplify the removal of false liens by
perpetrators of ``paper terrorism,'' a technique hate groups use to
harass by filing legal or pseudo-legal documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think these recommendations are a good beginning in
addressing hate groups and we ask everyone to help us in what we
hope will launch an all-out, overall attack on the problem of hate
groups,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' legislation calls for the creation of a human relations
curriculum in schools to teach tolerance and constructive ways to
resolve conflicts. He also wants to promote better training for
teachers about tolerance and hate-motivated behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The instruction of young people is absolutely essential for
youth to have greater tolerance for one another,'' Deukmejian said.

TRIBES GAIN CLOUT WITH GAMBLING DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
CAMP VERDE, Ariz. _ A decade ago, the Camp Verde Yavapai-Apache
Indian Community was mired in the Third World.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Its members drifted from one agriculture and service-industry
job to the next, never doing much more than getting by.
</P>
<P>
   Then came gaming _ and the shining new Cliff Castle casino.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the wealth to buy back the tribe's traditional land.
</P>
<P>
   Then came political power.
</P>
<P>
   So much power that when this neighboring town demanded a permit
for the tribe's sand-and-gravel operation inside town limits, the
tribe essentially shrugged it off.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's economic transformation is one small chapter in a
political and cultural drama being played out all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gaming profits rolled into tribal coffers throughout much of the
1990s. At first, the tribes tended to address problems at home like
poor housing, infrastructure and social services.
</P>
<P>
   Then they started making their influence felt elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Just in Arizona:
</P>
<P>
   _The Fort McDowell Mohave-Apache Indian Community seriously
courted the Los Angeles Dodgers for a new spring training base on
its reservation.
</P>
<P>
   _The Pascua Yaqui Tribe bought a good chunk of downtown
Guadalupe in hopes of opening another casino.
</P>
<P>
   _The Quechan Indian Tribe sits at the table of Yuma's most
powerful marketing group.
</P>
<P>
   _The Gila River Indian Community is a major sponsor of Valley
professional sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Indian tribes backed by casino profits have been
building outlet malls in California, plants to make audio parts for
cars in Mississippi and ice-skating rinks in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Which was exactly why the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act,
which allows individual tribes to negotiate gaming compacts with
states, was passed, said Sheila Morago of the National Indian
Gaming Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's done a wonderful job of bringing tribes economic
empowerment,'' Morago said. It's not an even distribution, she
said, noting that tribes with the 20 largest casinos rake in 50
percent of all Indian gaming revenues.
</P>
<P>
   None is in Arizona, she said, ``but there are a number of
(Arizona) tribes doing well, nonetheless.''
</P>
<P>
   Like in Camp Verde.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the 1990s, the tiny tribe had barely a
square mile of land, with houses and trailers in various states of
disrepair. Now, 80 percent of the homes have been remodeled and the
tribe is the largest employer in the Verde Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Vince Randall shakes his head when he thinks about the
humiliations of the past: Tribal members begging for low-end jobs
in Camp Verde; people living on handouts from social-service
agencies; men following the vegetable harvests around the West.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the tribe has bought nearly 3 square miles of the land it
controlled before the arrival of the Europeans. Among those
purchases was the Cloverleaf ranch, which put the tribe at
loggerheads with the Town of Camp Verde as the ranch is within town
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're buying back the land that the White man stole,'' Randall
said, ``and we're trying to develop those lands economically so we
can get more of our people back on the reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribe started negotiations with the town early last year for
a permit to extract sand and gravel from the ranch. But tribal
officials took offense after the town refused to issue a permit
despite approving all but the remediation measures the tribe had
proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The council decided that the tribe's application for a use
permit was lacking completeness,'' said Nancy Buckel, a Camp Verde
town planner.
</P>
<P>
   So Randall said the tribe went ahead with its mining plans. It
also hired a high-priced attorney to back its claim that it doesn't
need a permit because it's extracting the resource for personal
use.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the town of Camp Verde has blinked. Randall said he
understands why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times have changed around here,'' he said with a smile.
``We've even got more college graduates on our Tribal Council than
they do on their Town Council.'' &QL;

<P>
   Most mornings, I park my car in the open air of the garage's
seventh floor and return after dark, almost always pausing to feel
the breeze on the roof and look over the rough carpet of city
stretching in all directions to the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   South and slightly east of the garage are the towers of St.
Mary's Basilica, then the giant tortoise shell of Bank One
Ballpark. Beyond that, past the freeway and the city's oldest
neighborhoods is the dark silhouette of South Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Turning east on a clear day you can see all the way to the
Superstition Mountains, and at the same time watch planes make the
long, slow descent into Sky Harbor. Other planes rise lazily from
the airport, looking as if they'll scrape their bellies on the
office towers downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks north of the garage are the tall buildings of
uptown Phoenix, set at angles to one another like the last
remaining pieces of a chess game. Farther in the distance is Squaw
Peak, tilted like a witch's hat in the direction of Camelback
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to know exactly how long the man was on the roof of
the garage Sunday night. They don't know if he got there during the
day and was able to enjoy the glorious sunset, or if he sneaked
into the building under cover of darkness and made his way slowly
to the top floor, sixteen steps per level, seven levels up.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Monday said they had no new information. The man
appeared to be in his 50s and, based on his attire, may have been
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't say for certain if he fell or was pushed or
jumped, though they suspected suicide. There were cigarette butts
near the railing on the seventh floor.
</P>
<P>
   This would have been near the spot my family and I paused to
watch the last of the fireworks on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Night is as lovely as day from this roof, maybe more so, as the
lights of the city melt into the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know how long the man stood on the seventh floor Sunday
evening, enjoying the view. We don't know if he was angry or sad,
or perhaps even ill. We don't know whether he was in trouble with
the law or mentally incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know where he was born or where he'd grown up or if
he'd ever been in love.
</P>
<P>
   He was facing west when he went over the rail.
</P>
<P>
   The sidewalk along Second Street is lined with palm trees.
They're set parallel to one another like a procession of skinny
flop-haired boys.
</P>
<P>
   From where he stood, the man could have heard the palm fronds
rustling in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The ground around the garage is landscaped with oleanders and
rosemary. The herb's heavy scent lingers on the fingers of those
who touch it as they walk by. In the Middle Ages, it was a symbol
of remembrance and fidelity. Sprigs of it were dipped in gold and
given as keepsakes to honored wedding guests.
</P>
<P>
   The man on the roof landed among the rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   He had gone unnoticed on the streets of the city, as do all
those like him. He had been invisible on the roof of the garage. It
took only a few seconds for him to fall, hard and quiet, coming to
rest where he could no longer be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Security found him on the ground near the garage's entrance, an
unknown man, silent, still, surrounded by the strong scent of
remembrance. &QL;

lights of the city melt into the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know how long the man stood on the seventh floor Sunday
evening, enjoying the view. We don't know if he was angry or sad,
or perhaps even ill. We don't know whether he was in trouble with
the law or mentally incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know where he was born or where he'd grown up or if
he'd ever been in love.
</P>
<P>
   He was facing west when he went over the rail.
</P>
<P>
   The sidewalk along Second Street is lined with palm trees.
They're set parallel to one another like a procession of skinny
flop-haired boys.
</P>
<P>
   From where he stood, the man could have heard the palm fronds
rustling in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The ground around the garage is landscaped with oleanders and
rosemary. The herb's heavy scent lingers on the fingers of those
who touch it as they walk by. In the Middle Ages, it was a symbol
of remembrance and fidelity. Sprigs of it were dipped in gold and
given as keepsakes to honored wedding guests.
</P>
<P>
   The man on the roof landed among the rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   He had gone unnoticed on the streets of the city, as do all
those like him. He had been invisible on the roof of the garage. It
took only a few seconds for him to fall, hard and quiet, coming to
rest where he could no longer be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Security found him on the ground near the garage's entrance, an
unknown man, silent, still, surrounded by the strong scent of
remembrance. &QL;

ALIANZA TO PROVIDE CAPITAL FOR HISPANICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
Bank One Corp. and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce will
announce plans today for a five-year alliance that includes
formation of the nation's first venture capital fund aimed at
Hispanic-owned businesses.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The alliance, which will bring Bank One offices around the
country closer to local Hispanic chambers of commerce, was
conceived in Phoenix by leaders of both organizations and will be
directed for the next year by Bank One officials in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The program, to be called Alianza, which is Spanish for
alliance, is designed to increase access to capital and credit for
Hispanic businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based Bank One is a leading lender to small businesses,
and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber, based in Washington, D.C., oversees
a network of 200 local chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The Alianza effort will include several efforts, bank and
chamber officials said:
</P>
<P>
   The first national venture capital fund exclusively for
Hispanic-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One will invest $5 million to start the fund and has agreed
to help raise another $5 million for it. The fund is expected to be
up and running within the year and would be available to make
direct equity investments of $250,000 to $15 million in businesses
with at least 51 percent Hispanic ownership and $4 million in
annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   _A rewards program that will donate funds to local Hispanic
chambers based on the growth of members' loan and savings accounts
with Bank One. The funds would be used for education programs such
as mentoring, new technology and financing a business.
</P>
<P>
   The rewards program will be a first, bank officials say, in that
it will go beyond existing programs in the banking industry that
offer customers goods and services based on their credit card
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The Alianza program will reward chambers when businesses that
identify themselves as Hispanic chamber members open Bank One
deposit accounts, take out loans with the bank, or make business
credit card purchases on a Hispanic Chamber affinity credit card.
Chambers also would be rewarded for growth in members' existing
accounts with the bank.
</P>
<P>
   _Bank One subsidiary First USA will offer business credit cards
under the U.S. Hispanic Chamber brand name. Cardholders will be
eligible for discounts beyond the rewards program.
</P>
<P>
   _Sponsorship of Hispanic Business Today, the chamber's monthly
television program that is broadcast in 32 markets including
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Ramos, national program manager for Alianza at Bank One,
said the alliance grew out of discussions he had with George
Herrera, president and chief executive officer of the U.S. Hispanic
Chamber, and Ray Arvizu, chamber chairman and president of Arvizu
Advertising in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The three discussed an affinity rewards program that would help
the U.S. chamber add value to local chambers, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   Some affinity reward programs in the industry generate more than
$1 million in benefits to the sponsoring organizations, he said,
and the Alianza effort could run into an even more ``significant
dollar amount'' because of the additional accounts eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the affinity program, though, the three soon saw an
opportunity to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a case to be made on their side that access to
capital was an issue,'' Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   That is how they developed the idea of a rewards program based
on the growth in members' accounts, and from there the discussion
progressed to how to help middle-market businesses grow more
quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started talking about how to leverage our clout,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bank One has been the lead investor in six to eight
venture capital funds that seek out women- and minority-owned
businesses, this will be the first time it has taken the lead on a
fund strictly focused on Hispanic-owned firms, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   It hopes to raise additional investment from other banks and
financial services companies, for a possible total fund size of $70
million to $75 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic-owned businesses saw an 82 percent increase in numbers
and a 152 percent rise in annual revenues between 1992 and 1997,
according to the U.S. Small Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One officials said they will promote Alianza with a major
direct-mail campaign to chamber members in March and through
presentations to local chambers throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   The bank also has trained a number of bilingual telephone
bankers to handle small-business questions at call centers in Tempe
and Chicago. &QL;

 DAZED STARS TUMBLE TO NASHVILLE (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) By JENNIFER FLOYD c.2000 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Six days ago, the Nashville Predators tossed
18 shots at Stars backup goalie Manny Fernandez and couldn't score.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, it took the Predators 26 seconds and one shot to do
what they couldn't in 18. It didn't get much better from there for
the Stars. By the time the Predators reached 18 shots last night,
they had scored four goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it, the coaches talked about it; they were
going to come out hard,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said. ``For
some reason, we weren't ready. No excuses. ... I think maybe we
took them a little lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure to properly prepare turned into a nightmarish
result, a 5-2 loss in a game the Stars say they really couldn't
afford to lose. Tomorrow, the Stars begin a stretch of six games in
12 nights, playing Detroit, Chicago, Colorado, Philadelphia,
Phoenix and Detroit again. The Nashville game was supposed to be an
easy entry onto a hard road. ``Supposed to'' being the key phrase.
There was nothing easy about last night's game for the Stars, who
sat down and talked about what went wrong afterward. The team
meeting focused on putting this game behind them, learning from
what happened and remembering what's at stake. ``We're in a race
here,'' Hatcher said. ``I think the top seed in the Pacific
Division, there is an advantage to it. Tonight's a game we feel we
need these points.'' Fernandez said it was his fault they didn't
get them. The Stars' forwards said it was their fault. The Stars'
defensemen said it was their fault. They could all find clips from
last night's game to support their claim. The Predators' fourth
goal, at 14:53 of the second period, basically summed up
Fernandez's night. He probably should've stopped it, but it sailed
over his shoulder. ``We can't have one guy not show up like that,''
Fernandez said. ``It's even worse when it's a goalie.'' The Stars'
frustrating power play basically summed up the forwards' night.
They had four power plays. They scored on one but failed on a
crucial one midway through the third period that seemed to suck all
of the life out of what until then had been a surging offensive
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power play was frustrating again,'' Stars center Mike
Modano said. ``We've been winning, and when you're winning you
don't bring up those things. But when you lose, you start digging
for areas that let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the stingy defense that is a big reason why they're
winning just wasn't there. That was evident on the first three
Predators goals. The most costly was Nashville defenseman Kimmo
Timonen's goal at 4:43 of the second period. His goal came 33
seconds after Stars winger Brenden Morrow had cut the Predators'
lead to 2-1. ``I think the reality check is with the lineup we have
right now we're really no better than anybody,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``It's our focus and discipline and positional play
that gives us a chance to win games. We're not an offensive
juggernaut now.'' The Stars did add another goal at 1:53 of the
third period when Guy Carbonneau scored on a backhanded spin shot
that looked a lot like Morrow's goal. With the lead slashed to 4-2,
the Stars began peppering Predators goalie Tomas Vokoun with a
flurry of shots. The third period was only five minutes old and the
Stars do have an NHL-best six victories when trailing after two
periods. But the aforementioned power play killed any chance at No.
7. ``Nobody ever mentions the power play when we win and it doesn't
score,'' Stars winger Brett Hull said. ``If you lose, you got to
find something. ... We're not an offensive team, and if we give up
too many goals, we're not going to win.'' The Stars gave up the
fifth and final goal into an empty net with 61 seconds left; the
so-called ``easy'' game before the rough stretch was officially in
the books as a loss. The Stars go into tomorrow's game in Detroit
with a tenuous two-point lead in the Pacific. ``You've got to
understand what happened tonight,'' Modano said. ``I think you have
to take a hard look at what the problem was. We had some areas of
our game that were really exposed tonight. I think that kind of
opens eyes. You go into Detroit on Wednesday, and it's not going to
get any easier.''

DARK MOONDANCER TAKES FIRST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ With heavy rains throughout Monday's card at
Santa Anita, few would have predicted the packed house at the
track, most of whom played hooky from work, hoping to open a wallet
with a $50,000 cash voucher inside.
</P>
<P>
   This was all part of Santa Anita's $100,000 promotional
giveaway, in which wallets with prizes were given to patrons as
they entered the track.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Dark Moondancer's victory covering the marathon
distance of 1 miles over the turf course in the $200,000 San Luis
Obispo Handicap, the day belonged to Los Angeles resident Jose
Ramos, who opened the wallet with the $50,000 cash prize.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, a 29-year-old postal worker, took his mother and
grandmother to the track. He thought about staying home because of
the heavy rains but now has a good idea of how he'll spend the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will use it (the money) to buy a car,'' said Ramos. ``And to
help my mom buy a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Dark Moondancer, the other big winner, beat a short field of
five to return $3, $2.20 and $2.10 for trainer Ronald McAnally.
</P>
<P>
   When Public Purse was withdrawn from the San Luis Obispo last
week, Dark Moondancer became the heavy favorite to win his first
stakes in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come that easy, however. The five-year-old European
import took the lead past Astra Ridge on the bend, then had to fend
off The Fly down the stretch to secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he was the class of the race,'' said Dark
Moondancer's rider, Chris McCarron. ``All I had to do was hope we
got away well and then place him forwardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got a little exciting at the quarter pole when The Fly came
to us but only briefly.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Vienna, trainer of The Fly, said Dark Moondancer
benefited by only carrying 120 pounds, spotting only six pounds to
his horse, carrying 114 pounds with jockey Corey Nakatani aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The San Luis Obispo is the the second leg in Santa Anita's
series of distance turf races, which culminates in the $400,000 San
Juan Capistrano on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Dark Moondancer, owned by Charles Cella, finished ninth in the
Breeders' Cup Turf last November, his first start since winning the
Group I Gran Premio di Milano in Italy last June.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To a chorus of boos, shouts and cheers at the Apollo
Theater in Harlem, Bill Bradley and Al Gore engaged on Monday night
in the most brutal presidential debate of the year, with Bradley
attacking the vice president as a ``conservative Democrat'' and
Gore caustically describing Bradley as a ``desperate'' candidate
intent on tearing down his fellow Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The two men drew their swords almost as soon as the session
began, and from there on in, turned almost every question into an
attack on their opponent. It was politics as spectacle, produced in
an 87-year-old theater that is better known for the music of
Charlie Parker and James Brown than debates between men seeking to
be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've seen is an elaborate, what I call Gore-dance,''
Bradley said in talking about the two men's positions on
registering handgun control. ``It's a dance to avoid facing up to
your conservative record on guns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley,'' Gore responded, ``a couple of days ago,
your campaign said that you wanted to get some things off your
chest. Well, since then you've made personal attack after personal
attack. The problem is these attacks don't solve any problems. They
do divide us as Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``You're sounding a little desperate because you're
trying to build yourself up by tearing everybody else down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, speaking to a mostly black audience, repeatedly
attacked Gore for voting in 1981 in Congress to overturn an
Internal Revenue Service ruling that would forbid tax exemptions to
private colleges with racially discriminatory practices, saying
that it would help schools like Bob Jones University in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the debate, Bradley produced a sheaf of papers, which
he said included a stack of the bills Gore had supported, and tried
to thrust them into Gore's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture was reminiscent of what Gore had attempted to do to
at an earlier debate, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' when he
challenged Bradley to agree to foreswear any more 30-second
televised advertisements. Bradley ignored Gore's hand that Sunday
morning, and Gore returned the gesture on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that the bill Bradley referred to dealt with quotas
and that it had been approved by an overwhelming majority in
Congress, with the votes of most Democrats, and, describing the
assertion that Bob Jones University would have benefited as a
``phony and scurrilous charge.''
</P>
<P>
   And trying to turn the tables on Bradley on another issue of
concern to this audience, Gore questioned why Bradley had voted
against expanding the number of broacast franchises available to
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was emblematic of a debate, sponsored by Time and
CNN, that repeatedly seemed on the verge of running out of control,
both because of the candidates on stage and a particularly rowdy
audience that offered the candidates a memorable image of New York
politics at its most insolent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time, time, time,'' the moderator, Bernard Shaw, said
repeatedly as Gore, in particular, attempted to ride past the
deadlines, responding to Bradley, who was by far more animated than
he has ever been before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Mr. _ Mr. Moderator, and as a point of personal
privilege, can I respond to that?'' Gore asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the rules the rules agreed to by both your
staffs, you cannot, sir,'' Shaw responded, to a swell of laughs
from the 1,500-seat hall.
</P>
<P>
   When the candidates were not creating tulmult, the audience
pitched in. When Gore was asked a question about the environment, a
member of the audience bellowed; ``Vice President Gore, if you
support environmental justice what are you doing about the fact
that $500,000 of your money . . . .'' He was drowned out by loud
yells from the audience, leaving the candidates standing in awkward
silence.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, this was the toughest presidential debate
involving Republicans or Democrats this year. Again and again,
Bradley attacked Gore as a conservative Democrat, suggesting that
he was submerging conservative views on affirmative action,
abortion and gun control as he sought to win the Democratic
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a conservative Democratic,'' Bradley said. ``Did not
support national health insurance, had an 84 percent right to life
voting record and was the poster boy for the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded by portraying Bradley as desperate and
untrustworthy, asserting that his health care program endangered
the elderly and AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley said no one would suffer under his plan. ``Tonight I
pledge that any health care bill that I would sign would have every
Medicaid patient a better health plan than Medicaid is today. . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's not a plan, that's a magic wand.'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At times, it seemed unlikely that anyone in the audience _ or
watching on television _ could follow the details of the charges
that Gore and Bradley threw at each other. At one point, Bradley
referred, rather obliquely, to a page in the book ``All Too
Human,'' by George Stephanopoulus, Clinton's former senior aide, to
assert that Gore had worked in the administration to undermine
affirmative action. Gore repeatedly affirmed his commitment to the
program last night.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The debate was the first in a month, and came at a particularly
critical time for Bradley, whose campaign nationally _ and in New
York, a state where he had once been seen as posing a powerful
challenge to Gore _ has seemed increasingly adrift.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's supporters viewed Monday night's session as a chance,
arguably one of his last before New York and several other crucial
states hold primaries on March 7, to effectively put his campaign
back on the map.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time that Gore and Bradley has appeared at a
debate devoted to black issues. The audience on Monday night was
almost entirely black, invited by community and chuch
organizations. And the first question was posed by the Rev. Al
Sharpton, who, with the Rev. Floyd Flake, suggested two weeks ago
that the two Democratic candidates for president holding a debate
on racial issues in a black community.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley agreed on a few things. They both denounced the
flying of the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina, drawing a
distinction from either one of the Republicans whom they might face
in November. Both Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain
of Arizona have declined to condemn South Carolina for flying the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   They also joined, in response to a question from Sharpton, in
decrying the Amadou Diallo shooting case, describing it as evidence
of racial insensitivy in police departments. Both candidates said
they would issue executive orders to ban so-called racial
profiling, in which police departments use race as a factor in
evaluating the potential risk of a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also think it reflects racial profiling in the sense of
racial profiling that seeps into the mind of someone so that he
sees a wallet in the hand of a white man as a wallet, but a wallet
in the hand of a black man as a gun,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley repeated his earlier exhortations of why Gore did not
simply stroll down the hall to ask President Clinton to issue an
executive order, immediately, banning racial profiling. Gore said
work had indeed begun to move in that direction. But he issued the
first of numerous one-line attacks: ``You know, racial profiling
practically began in New Jersey, senator.''
</P>
<P>
   That set the tone the next few minutes, on issues ranging from
possible reparations for slavery, to health care, to technology and
education for African-Americans. Several times, Gore criticized
Bradley for failing to support legislation that would have expanded
the number of African-American and minority-owned broadcasting
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said on Monday night that he would support Gore if he
become, as many Democrats now believe is likely, his party's
nominee. Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, said Bradley, who had
been criticized by his own supporters for being a recalcitrant
candidate, wanted to approach this aggressively. ``We're loaded for
bear and we're going to go get it,'' Hauser said. ``We've started a
two-week mission.''

 &HT;    Judge in Lewis case doesn't like verbosity
 &HT;    By Joshua B. Good
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The judge who will oversee the Ray Lewis murder trial
doesn't like lawyers who talk too much.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner, 59, gives
attorneys in her court a time limit and expects them to make their
points quickly and move on.
</P>
<P>
   But if Lewis' marathon bail hearing last week is an indication
of the trial to come, satisfying Bonner's requirements may be a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the hearing for the Baltimore Ravens football star, there was
only one defendant, but the proceeding lasted all day. When the
trial starts, there will be three defendants and three verbose
Atlanta lawyers on the defense side of the courtroom. Lewis' team
is headed by Ed Garland, probably the most talkative person so far
involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' fellow murder suspect, Joseph Sweeting, is represented by
Steve Sadow, who briefly gained the media spotlight as the Gold
Club's attorn the FBI raided the Atlanta nude bar looking
for mob ties. The third suspect, Reginald Oakley, is represented by
Bruce Harvey, Atlanta's best-known pony-tailed defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution is led by Clint Rucker, who repeated his name
over and over during Lewis' nationally televised bail hearing.
</P>
<P>
   All four lawyers will need to keep their tongues in check if
they want to stay on Bonner's good side.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't like lawyers to repeat themselves,'' said Carla
Friend, who has defended two murder suspects in Bonner's courtroom.
``That's something lawyers might find hard to do because we like to
talk so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Coleman, a prosecuting attorney who was assigned to
represent the state in Bonner's court for more than a year, knows
what it is like to anger her honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be making an argument and she will come out of left
field and nip at you and make snide comments,'' said Coleman, who
left the Fulton County District Attorney's Office to work for the
DA in Gwinnett County. ``She doesn't give a whole lot of respect to
the attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coleman said Bonner is fair: She is equally tough on defense
attorneys, prosecutors and lawyers in civil cases.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Bonner's desire to keep cases moving could come from
having too many open cases in her court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Bonner had the most unresolved civil cases of all 17
Fulton County Superior Court judges, according to the Fulton County
Daily Report, a newspaper for lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that I work as hard as I can and get further and
further behind,'' Bonner told the legal paper last summer. The
judge declined a request for an interview for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner's background is in civil law. Before she became a State
Court judge in 1990, she was a law partner for six years with
attorney Mary Ann Oakley. Their firm, Oakley and Bonner,
specialized in employment law.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley said she hated to lose Bonner as a partner, but they are
still close friends. Oakley introduced Bonner during the
swearing-in ceremony when Bonner became a Superior Court judge in
1994. Both have season tickets to the Atlanta Braves _ their seats
are side by side _ and they attend five or six Atlanta Symphony
concerts together each year.
</P>
<P>
   When they talk business, Bonner usually tells Oakley about which
attorneys argued a good case and which ones didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't tolerate fools very well,'' Oakley said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who have pending cases in Bonner's court say she has a
reputation for being fair, as long as lawyers keep it brief and
honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice would be to be direct with her. If she asks a
question, she likes you to be up front,'' said public defender
Elizabeth Archer.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said she has respect for the judge, despite losing two
murder trials in Bonner's court. Bonner also denied Archer's
request that another murder suspect, William Harris, be given bail
while he awaits trial for a 1998 slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how Bonner will handle the high-profile
Lewis case.
</P>
<P>
   Much of her criminal docket is filled with run-of-the-mill cases
such as drugs, credit card fraud and an occasional misdemeanor,
such as a trespassing case.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's no nonsense. She's very smart and she will play it by
the book,'' said Fulton County Superior Court Judge Philip
Etheridge. ``The fact that he's a big football player will make
absolutely no difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Her one previous highly publicized criminal case was in 1994.
Bonner sentenced R&AMP;B singer Lisa ``Left Eye'' Lopes of the trio TLC
to several months in a halfway house for burning down Atlanta
Falcons football player Andre Rison's $2 million home.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a big difference between an arson case and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bonner accepted a plea agreement in a little-known
case against Terrance Gooden, who shot and killed a man who was
fighting in the street with Gooden's brother.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Lewis, Sweeting and Reginald Oakley also
stem from a street fight. Their fight, say police and prosecutors,
left two men stabbed to death in Atlanta hours after the Super Bowl
was played in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   In Gooden's case, he could have faced life in prison. But he
pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter. Bonner gave Gooden a
15-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The only notable aspect to the case came at sentencing, when
Bonner told Gooden he was a victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are just one more person who is a victim of the epidemic
of guns that we have in our society,'' Bonner said, ``and if your
family members learn nothing else from this experience it is that
no good comes from having a gun nearby.''

 &HT;    Time, aid help heal wounds left by twisters
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As South Georgians begin recovering from devastating
tornadoes, people in other Georgia communities struck by similar
tragedies in recent years say patience is the best tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that's probably the last thing anybody wants to hear at
a time like this, but when you're dealing with local, state and
federal agencies and private organizations, contractors and
individuals, you've got to be patient,'' said Frank Daniell, deputy
director of the Gwinnett County office of emergency management.
``It just takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 450 homes were damaged or destroyed in Mitchell,
Grady, Colquitt and Tift counties late last Sunday and early
Monday, Feb. 13-14. Insured losses have been estimated at $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   State emergency officials listed 18 dead and more than a hundred
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, tornadoes swept through the north Atlanta metro
area shortly after midnight, cutting a long corridor of destruction
through Gwinnett and DeKalb counties. One person was killed.
Property damage exceeded $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanup costs topped $25 million just in Gwinnett County,
Daniell said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the county is back to normal, except for repairing streets
and curbing damaged either by the storm or subsequent cleanup, he
said. And when Gwinnett got another presidential disaster
declaration this year after the recent ice storm, Daniell said
dealing with the bureaucracy was easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been through the learning process during the tornadoes,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Hall and White counties suffered at least $13 million
in damages and 13 deaths when they were hit by tornadoes that
leveled or severely damaged dozens of homes, chicken houses,
schools and other buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two years later, we're in good shape,'' said Elaine
Sexton, Hall County's emergency management director. ``Now, we have
10 new warning sirens in place. We're still working on getting
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, a monster tornado cut through the Dooly
County city of Vienna in Middle Georgia, leaving 500 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency initially brought in 60
mobile homes as temporary housing. Now, only 11 families remain in
the government housing, said Kenny Calhoun, the county's emergency
management director.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado, which leveled two churches, knocked the police
station off its foundation and sucked the doors off the Fire
Department, was most destructive in Vienna's poorest neighborhoods.
Dozens of small frame houses and older mobile homes, many
uninsured, were ripped apart by winds.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Vienna's destroyed or damaged dwellings have been
repaired or replaced by new houses, apartments and mobile homes,
Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actively seeking permanent solutions for the rest, some
of whom are still making repairs to their homes. It's been hard
because some of these people don't want to move outside the
community and our available rental property is saturated,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Without help, rebuilding would have been difficult for the
county, one of the poorest in Georgia. With $4 million in disaster
funds from FEMA and $500,000 more from the Red Cross, the community
is looking better than ever, Calhoun said. But it took more than
money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The will of the people has been to overcome this,'' he said.
``It's also been the will of the city and the county, from Day
One.''

 &HT;    Insult follows injury in Alabama town
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRICHARD, Ala. _ Forty years ago, so many shoppers came downtown
that their parked autos jammed an abandoned street car line in the
middle of Wilson Avenue. People could hardly find space to walk.
Bargain hunters browsed the sales at Kress department store.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday's shimmering sea of prosperity has gradually
turned into a turbulent tide of poverty. Today on Wilson Avenue,
black steel gates, chains and Masterlocks barricade nearly every
storefront. There are few shoppers. On New Year's Eve, looters
welcomed the millennium by smashing a van through the unguarded
doors of a pawn shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prichard just hasn't kept up,'' said Wayne Flynt, a history
professor at Auburn University.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the economic erosion and social shifts, city government
also is crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   A Mobile County grand jury has recommended the mayor, city
council and most of the water and sewer board be removed from
office for incompetence and neglect. A jury trial is scheduled
March 2.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury said there was ``substantial evidence'' of
corruption. The governor or attorney general would appoint
replacements if a jury decides to remove Prichard's officials.
</P>
<P>
   Prichard is $6 million in debt and declared bankruptcy in
October. According to the grand jury, the city wrote bad checks and
has underfunded its employee pension plan by $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Jesse Norwood and other city officials face criminal
charges. The city council president was arrested immediately after
a recent council meeting then released on bond. A circuit court
judge will hear motions on the cases today.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood, president of the National Conference of Black Mayors,
pleaded innocent. One of his family's businesses wrongly received a
$2,400 check from the city, according to the grand jury. He's also
charged with failing to report lease income from a city agency and
failing to disclose his interests in several businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now my job is just go back to work and continue to work for
the citizens of Prichard and see this thing through,'' Norwood said
outside the Mobile County jail Wednesday after being released on
$5,000 bond. ``I just hope people will continue to work with us and
continue to realize they shouldn't be so fast to judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day. Obviously, it's embarrassing. I'm
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   So are Norwood's constituents.
</P>
<P>
   At the 8-Mile Fruit Stand, where fresh butternut squash is
stacked in wooden crates, Brenda Frazier shops inside, walking on
the store's unvarnished wooden planks. Her keys dangle from her
neck on a ribbon of cloth stamped W.W.J.D. (What would Jesus do).
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel hurt for the reason of trust,'' said Frazier, one of
Prichard's 33,000 residents. ``They didn't do the right thing. I'm
hurt especially because they grew up around here and they didn't do
anything to help make the place better.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the road at the Meat Block, where owner Mike Lee sells 48
rabbits a week along with cuts of pork and beef, customers stream
in steadily. Many are poor but loyal, several on welfare, Lee said.
Food World and others down the road have closed, pressed by a
Wal-Mart Supercenter outside the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a good business. We've been here 28 years,'' Lee said.
``What we do has made us successful, not anything that Prichard
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Prichard developed as a racially mixed but segregated town that
revolved in the political orbit of Mobile, which had struggled
itself as a backwater city on the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents are descended from African slaves who were
kidnapped in 1859 and shipped to the area by a Mobile businessman.
About a hundred blacks were loaded on the ship ``Clotilda,'' which
sailed into Mobile Bay under cover of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   But when authorities discovered the illegal plot, the delivery
was disrupted and the blacks scattered. After the Civil War, the
kidnapped blacks set up a settlement known as Africa Town east of
modern-day Prichard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are proud blacks there that aren't easily assimilated
into Mobile culture,'' Flynt said.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, Prichard and Mobile began going their
separate ways. An interstate highway came to Mobile but skirted
neighboring Prichard. After civil rights laws took effect, many
whites left Prichard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much here in Prichard to take care of the needs of
the working man,'' said Nick Solomon, a businessman on Wilson
Avenue. ``Prichard has never had a solid cash flow as long as I've
been living here. We just don't have a lot of industry in the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   The 64-year-old Solomon runs a combination television repair
shop, pool hall and arcade. Plywood fills in what used to be a
glass door at the front of the place. Inside, two men shoot pool on
one of Solomon's 10 tables. Stacks of television sets sit nearby.
The noon news drones in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Solomon opened his television showroom around 1975,
he found he couldn't compete with larger stores. So he concentrated
on making repairs. He put in a few arcade games to get kids off the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to survive as a business,'' Solomon said. ``You have
to work harder and longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon knew Norwood when the mayor was a child decades ago.
``We should keep an open mind,'' Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   As Solomon tells of taking Norwood and other Boy Scouts on
camping trips, the broadcaster on one of the TVs tells viewers the
mayor says he's innocent of any criminal acts. Said one of
Solomon's employees, ``I'm glad I live in Mobile.''

 &HT;    Watch where you step at the Vatican's Jubilee celebration
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Rome is sprucing up for the Vatican's Jubilee
_ 12 months of celebration marking the 2,000 birthday of the
Christian era. According to Vatican estimates, as many as 25
million additional visitors are expected to hit the Eternal City
before the observance ends on Twelfth Night, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, municipal officials are eager to have their city put
its best (and cleanest) foot forward, but that could be a problem.
Over 200,000 dogs live in Rome, and for lack of back yards in which
to take care of business, they relieve themselves wherever they
can, thus transforming sidewalks and gutters into an urban
minefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoop or pay!'' owners have been warned, but so far, results
are scanty _ which is more than can be said for the doo droppings
all over town. City fathers now have taken matters into their own
hands, figuratively speaking of course, and ordered five
poop-scooping scooters (try repeating that a few times real fast)
to be placed into immediate service. Each scooter comes equipped
with a long vacuum nozzle and a tank mounted on the rear, as well
as a water spray for stubborn spots.
</P>
<P>
   Further description is probably unnecessary. You get the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Folks who've never lived in places like Rome or New York City,
might have difficulty imagining what life without grass is like for
doggies and their owners. Keep in mind that Rover can't just scoot
out the back door and head for a neighbor's flower bed whenever the
urge strikes. He has to be accompanied and cleaned up after.
</P>
<P>
   All of this leads me to believe that city dogs, over the years,
have probably become a bit uppity _ but for good reason. Put
yourself in Rover's place and see how humble you'd be if every time
you had to go, a guy in pinstripes and Gucci's trotted along behind
you with a Baggie and a shovel.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, New Yorkers didn't always scoop. When I lived there
in the '60s, signs everywhere warned owners: Curb your dog _ which
meant sidewalks were off limits and Spot had to be trained to use
the gutter. An improvement, but crossing streets got tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-towners used to complain that New Yorkers were rude. Said
they never spoke to each other or even made eye contact. I hadn't
lived there two days before I figured out why. The natives were no
fools. They walked with their heads down because they were sick and
tired of scraping Dalmatian doo off their loafers.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, I lived in a small Georgia town with its very own
courthouse square, angle parking with a two-hour limit, and an
honest-to-goodness Barney Fife on patrol. Our deputy had a bit of
bad luck one night when the bank alarm went off. Seems he got so
excited that somehow he ended up speeding the wrong way down a
one-way street just in time to meet the sheriff's cruiser ... head
on.
</P>
<P>
   Barney was demoted to parking tickets and a Moto-Guzzi (a
3-wheeled Italian scooter), which he didn't seem to mind a whole
lot until one night some mean boys pushed his Guzzi up the
courthouse steps and turned it upside down on the stone table where
the old guys played checkers.
</P>
<P>
   That made Barney mad. So mad in fact, that he pulled out his gun
and threatened to shoot the miscreants. He didn't, of course, but
the sheriff wasn't any too happy to have his deputy standing on the
courthouse steps swearing and waving around his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy was stripped of his pistol and put on foot patrol
around the square, armed only with a scoop and a broom. Business
was brisk since the town had no leash law.
</P>
<P>
   Barney still kept his badge shined up and walked with the same
old swagger, like his new job description didn't bother him a whole
lot, but we all knew he would have been much happier with something
to drive _ anything _ even an Italian poop-scooping scooter.

 &HT;    Stability control latest innovation from Mercedes
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A problem that has long existed in the automotive
industry is how to resolve the trade-off between ride comfort and
handling precision.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, large luxury cars have offered a sumptuous ride
but left a lot to be desired in the handling department.The other
side of the coin is that sports cars typically ride like wagons but
handle exceptionally well.
</P>
<P>
   At long last a solution has appeared on the automotive horizon,
and it is as simple as A-B-C. Active Body Control is the latest in
a string of technological automotive innovations brought to market
by Mercedes-Benz. It seems like a natural progression from
anti-lock brakes to traction control systems to a stability control
system.
</P>
<P>
   Active body control uses hydraulic, electronic and mechanical
components to reduce a vehicle's body roll compared with a
conventional suspension.
</P>
<P>
   What is body roll, and why should you care?
</P>
<P>
   Try to think of it this way: When a vehicle is traveling down a
perfectly flat stretch of road, the dashboard and bumper are
parallel to the road surface. When the vehicle starts to maneuver
through a corner or bend in the road, those angles change, and the
car tips, or rolls to one side. The greater the degree of change,
the more it affects the vehicle's handling performance because the
change in suspension geometry results in a shift of vehicle weight.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner, the inside tires carry much less of the weight than
the outside tires.
</P>
<P>
   This all sounds pretty complicated, but in reality it is simple.
Think of four equally husky guys carrying a heavy load. They would
be much more efficient if all four of them were carrying the same
amount of the weight. The same applies to a vehicle's tires. If all
don't support the same amount of weight, they do not perform as
efficiently. In simple terms, that means they don't provide equal
grip or traction.
</P>
<P>
   That's why more drivers lose control of a vehicle in a corner
than in a straight line.
</P>
<P>
   In back-to-back tests of a 1999 Mercedes CL and the 2000 CL 500,
I put both vehicles through a 35-mph straight line slalom. I
expected the results to be different, but not as different as they
were.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 CL could accomplish the maneuver, but only with much
effort on my part. It was not a comfortable or confident run. The
body felt like it had large parcels shifting inside as I fought my
way through the course.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the 2000 CL with advanced body control though the same
course was a piece of cake. It provided flat, precise cornering
that any reasonably skilled driver could accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Mercedes is offering ABC only on the CL 500 coupe. It
is expected on the S-Series sedans later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of ABC is the potential for the trickle-down
effect. Just as anti-lock brakes and traction control systems have
found their way into more mainstream vehicles, sometime in the
automotive future we probably will see ABC technology.

 &HT;    2000 Avalon lives up to hype
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's time for an apology to the Toyota Avalon for
mocking those TV commercials showing the sedan floating dreamlike
through the clouds. It really is that smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Give it decent pavement and steady driving, and Toyota's
redesigned flagship is one of the most comfortable rides around. It
will give you some up-and-down movement when the suspension is
seriously worked but, for the most part, the Avalon is proof that
big cars no longer have to ride and drive like barges.
</P>
<P>
   Gorgeous, it isn't. Few reviews fail to join Car and Driver in
calling the 2000 Avalon ``slab-sided,'' which isn't necessarily a
bad thing (see the styling of Mercedes-Benz and BMW sedans). But
the styling _ from Toyota's studio in California _ also gives the
Avalon height (57.7 inches) and width (71.7 inches) to make the
bench-seat model a true six-adult sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Available in XL and XLS trim, the Avalon is such an Americanized
car that it comes off the assembly line at Georgetown, Ky.,
classified as a ``domestic'' vehicle, making it Toyota's first to
carry that tag. Base prices are $25,900 for the XL and $29,755 for
the XLS.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota, at last count, offers eight option packages for the
Avalon, introduced in '95 as a replacement for the Cressida. The
test XLS totaled $33,744, and it was optioned to the max, including
dealer-installed floor mats ($119).
</P>
<P>
   Strong points, in addition to the ride, include a sophisticated
V-6 engine that willingly churns out 210 horsepower with 220
pounds-feet of torque kicking in at 4,400 rpm, adding up to
zero-to-60 mph times in the 8- to 9-second range. That is adequate,
but not shocking, for a 3,500-pound sedan. Engine noise, along with
road noise, is pleasingly suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalon has good seats, lots of storage space _ including
flip-out boxes on the front door armrests _ and drink holders.
Visibility is good, but the front or ``A'' pillars can get in the
way, particularly during left turns. And while the windshield is
steeply raked, the instrument panel slopes away from the front
seats. The instrumentation includes a display showing direction of
travel, time, fuel economy and temperature at the top center of the
dash.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment, size and pricing of the Avalon mark it as
targeting older _ traditional, if you please _ buyers, which is not
what's generally been associated with Toyota. But then neither has
the idea of floating along like a cloud, so maybe it's time for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Toyota Avalon XLS front-drive sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $33,744 (base: $29,755, plus $485 delivery fee)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 3.0-liter V-6 engine with 24 valves (210
horsepower), four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive
lockout
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: Dual front air bags, dual seat-mounted front
air bags, power anti-lock disc brakes, height-adjustable front
shoulder belts, side-impact beams, optional skid and traction
control systems with brake-assist feature ($850)
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: Leather seating with driver's
seat memory, premium stereo with in-dash six-disc CD changer, dual
power heated mirrors with memory, 16-inch alloy wheels, keyless
entry system, $1,625; power moonroof, $910; floor mats, $119
</P>

 &HT;    Mechanic's task ever more demanding
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How many of your cars are being fixed right the first
time _ or even the second time?
</P>
<P>
   Auto repairs are consistently among the top consumer complaints
nationwide. Yes, automakers are building better vehicles, but when
they break, it's a complicated and expensive proposition to fix
them.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of what I do _ train tomorrow's technicians in the
applications of electricity in the automobile. Hands-on testing
procedures are among the ways we instill in them the basic
necessary skills needed to begin diagnostic testing of the complex
electronic operating systems of today's vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Classroom projects serve as a steppingstone toward the ultimate
goal of graduating competent entry-level automotive diagnosticians
and repair mechanics who are so desperately needed in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, an associate's degree in automotive service technology
was a seven-quarter program, and cars were relatively simple
contraptions. High technology was limited to the alternator, power
windows, power seats and air conditioning available on really
deluxe models.
</P>
<P>
   I remember my own electronics class. I learned to fix toasters,
mixers and irons because their automotive counterparts were only an
engineer's concept.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of training, an automotive tech school graduate
embarked upon a career as a mechanic. He needed only adequate
knowledge of the righty-tighty/lefty-loosey rules of nuts and
bolts, a dose of hydraulic principles, some steering and suspension
geometry, and enough understanding of electricity to understand its
limited application to fix cars.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, most automobiles contained more electronics and
computer controls than the first moon-mission rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Today's futuristic vehicles boast navigational systems, infrared
sensors for night driving and multiple computer networks
controlling virtually every aspect of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The service and repair procedures needed to fix today's vehicles
comprise over a million pages of information. The knowledge and
techniques required to repair cars continue to climb exponentially.
However, today, an associate's degree in automotive service
technology is still a seven-quarter program.
</P>
<P>
   Humans certainly haven't been able to absorb and retain more
knowledge in less time. Yet we continue to attempt to cram more
information into the same amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   I think that just as a fuse blows from electrical overload,
future mechanics are on a similar course. In fact, I know several
good mechanics who have bailed out of the profession in the past
year because of the information overload and the paying public's
reaction to it. Or put another way: 1972 Nova expectations driving
2000 Mercedes-Benz technology.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer people are willing to take on the ever-tougher challenges
of repairing automobiles, and experienced mechanics who don't
update their training increasingly are finding themselves left with
professional frustration and unhappy customers.

industry, writes for Cox News Service.

 &HT;    For some, Roths an easy decision
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For 32-year-old Waheed Malik, the decision between
traditional and Roth IRAs was a simple one.
</P>
<P>
   He put $2,000 apiece for himself and his wife into Roth
individual retirement accounts. That costs the dentist more in
taxes on his 1999 return, but it should save a lot more when he
retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 25 years, I don't have to pay tax on the money in that
account,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   His underlying strategy _ to tuck money away in retirement plans
_ is one many taxpayers could benefit from. The decision on which
kind of plan to use is a tactical one, requiring careful
consideration of individual circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   It's still a live decision for people preparing their 1999 tax
returns. IRA contributions for 1999 can be made until April 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional IRA is a baited hook,'' said Osmond Baptist, a
certified financial planner in Atlanta. ``The bait is the $2,000
tax deduction now and the tax deferral of earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hook is that maybe 30 years later, when the $2,000 has
grown, any money withdrawn is taxable as ordinary income, not
capital gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth IRAs, on the other hand, require you to pay income taxes
now on any contribution.
</P>
<P>
   As Baptist noted, $2,000 is the maximum contribution for any
year, either for a Roth or traditional IRA.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth's major benefit is any money your investments earn is
free from tax, assuming you abide by certain rules.
</P>
<P>
   Roth IRAs have other benefits. Unlike traditional IRAs, workers
can continue to contribute to a Roth at any age, and there are no
required withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   That makes them popular with people who are saving for their
estates rather than their retirements.
</P>
<P>
   For younger people who intend to invest for several decades,
such as Malik, selecting a Roth IRA is relatively easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a long-term horizon before you need that money _
at least 10 years _ and you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in
the future than now, then the Roth IRA can make more sense than a
traditional IRA,'' said Mark Watson, a partner in Washington with
the accounting firm of KPMG.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a closer call, he added, for people who expect to need
the money within 10 years and who expect to be in a lower tax
bracket when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   A major consideration is the income limits:
</P>
<P>
   _ For Roth IRAs, a full $2,000 contribution can be made if
adjusted gross income is less than $150,000 on a joint return or
less than $95,000 on a single return. Progressively smaller
contributions are allowed at higher incomes, up to $160,000 for
couples and $110,000 for singles.
</P>
<P>
   _ For traditional IRAs, there are limits on the tax deduction
available. Workers who have a 401(k) or other on-the-job retirement
plan will lose the tax deduction at higher income levels. At least
a partial deduction is available at adjusted gross incomes of less
than $61,000 on joint returns and $41,000 for single taxpayers.

<P>
   ``The hook is that maybe 30 years later, when the $2,000 has
grown, any money withdrawn is taxable as ordinary income, not
capital gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth IRAs, on the other hand, require you to pay income taxes
now on any contribution.
</P>
<P>
   As Baptist noted, $2,000 is the maximum contribution for any
year, either for a Roth or traditional IRA.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth's major benefit is any money your investments earn is
free from tax, assuming you abide by certain rules.
</P>
<P>
   Roth IRAs have other benefits. Unlike traditional IRAs, workers
can continue to contribute to a Roth at any age, and there are no
required withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   That makes them popular with people who are saving for their
estates rather than their retirements.
</P>
<P>
   For younger people who intend to invest for several decades,
such as Malik, selecting a Roth IRA is relatively easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a long-term horizon before you need that money _
at least 10 years _ and you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in
the future than now, then the Roth IRA can make more sense than a
traditional IRA,'' said Mark Watson, a partner in Washington with
the accounting firm of KPMG.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a closer call, he added, for people who expect to need
the money within 10 years and who expect to be in a lower tax
bracket when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   A major consideration is the income limits:
</P>
<P>
   _ For Roth IRAs, a full $2,000 contribution can be made if
adjusted gross income is less than $150,000 on a joint return or
less than $95,000 on a single return. Progressively smaller
contributions are allowed at higher incomes, up to $160,000 for
couples and $110,000 for singles.
</P>
<P>
   _ For traditional IRAs, there are limits on the tax deduction
available. Workers who have a 401(k) or other on-the-job retirement
plan will lose the tax deduction at higher income levels. At least
a partial deduction is available at adjusted gross incomes of less
than $61,000 on joint returns and $41,000 for single taxpayers.

 &HT;    Stability control latest innovation from Mercedes
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A problem that has long existed in the automotive
industry is how to resolve the trade-off between ride comfort and
handling precision.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, large luxury cars have offered a sumptuous ride
but left a lot to be desired in the handling department.The other
side of the coin is that sports cars typically ride like wagons but
handle exceptionally well.
</P>
<P>
   At long last a solution has appeared on the automotive horizon,
and it is as simple as A-B-C. Active Body Control is the latest in
a string of technological automotive innovations brought to market
by Mercedes-Benz. It seems like a natural progression from
anti-lock brakes to traction control systems to a stability control
system.
</P>
<P>
   Active body control uses hydraulic, electronic and mechanical
components to reduce a vehicle's body roll compared with a
conventional suspension.
</P>
<P>
   What is body roll, and why should you care?
</P>
<P>
   Try to think of it this way: When a vehicle is traveling down a
perfectly flat stretch of road, the dashboard and bumper are
parallel to the road surface. When the vehicle starts to maneuver
through a corner or bend in the road, those angles change, and the
car tips, or rolls to one side. The greater the degree of change,
the more it affects the vehicle's handling performance because the
change in suspension geometry results in a shift of vehicle weight.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner, the inside tires carry much less of the weight than
the outside tires.
</P>
<P>
   This all sounds pretty complicated, but in reality it is simple.
Think of four equally husky guys carrying a heavy load. They would
be much more efficient if all four of them were carrying the same
amount of the weight. The same applies to a vehicle's tires. If all
don't support the same amount of weight, they do not perform as
efficiently. In simple terms, that means they don't provide equal
grip or traction.
</P>
<P>
   That's why more drivers lose control of a vehicle in a corner
than in a straight line.
</P>
<P>
   In back-to-back tests of a 1999 Mercedes CL and the 2000 CL 500,
I put both vehicles through a 35-mph straight line slalom. I
expected the results to be different, but not as different as they
were.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 CL could accomplish the maneuver, but only with much
effort on my part. It was not a comfortable or confident run. The
body felt like it had large parcels shifting inside as I fought my
way through the course.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the 2000 CL with advanced body control though the same
course was a piece of cake. It provided flat, precise cornering
that any reasonably skilled driver could accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Mercedes is offering ABC only on the CL 500 coupe. It
is expected on the S-Series sedans later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of ABC is the potential for the trickle-down
effect. Just as anti-lock brakes and traction control systems have
found their way into more mainstream vehicles, sometime in the
automotive future we probably will see ABC technology.

 &HT;    Mechanic's task ever more demanding
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How many of your cars are being fixed right the first
time _ or even the second time?
</P>
<P>
   Auto repairs are consistently among the top consumer complaints
nationwide. Yes, automakers are building better vehicles, but when
they break, it's a complicated and expensive proposition to fix
them.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of what I do _ train tomorrow's technicians in the
applications of electricity in the automobile. Hands-on testing
procedures are among the ways we instill in them the basic
necessary skills needed to begin diagnostic testing of the complex
electronic operating systems of today's vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Classroom projects serve as a steppingstone toward the ultimate
goal of graduating competent entry-level automotive diagnosticians
and repair mechanics who are so desperately needed in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, an associate's degree in automotive service technology
was a seven-quarter program, and cars were relatively simple
contraptions. High technology was limited to the alternator, power
windows, power seats and air conditioning available on really
deluxe models.
</P>
<P>
   I remember my own electronics class. I learned to fix toasters,
mixers and irons because their automotive counterparts were only an
engineer's concept.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of training, an automotive tech school graduate
embarked upon a career as a mechanic. He needed only adequate
knowledge of the righty-tighty/lefty-loosey rules of nuts and
bolts, a dose of hydraulic principles, some steering and suspension
geometry, and enough understanding of electricity to understand its
limited application to fix cars.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, most automobiles contained more electronics and
computer controls than the first moon-mission rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Today's futuristic vehicles boast navigational systems, infrared
sensors for night driving and multiple computer networks
controlling virtually every aspect of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The service and repair procedures needed to fix today's vehicles
comprise over a million pages of information. The knowledge and
techniques required to repair cars continue to climb exponentially.
However, today, an associate's degree in automotive service
technology is still a seven-quarter program.
</P>
<P>
   Humans certainly haven't been able to absorb and retain more
knowledge in less time. Yet we continue to attempt to cram more
information into the same amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   I think that just as a fuse blows from electrical overload,
future mechanics are on a similar course. In fact, I know several
good mechanics who have bailed out of the profession in the past
year because of the information overload and the paying public's
reaction to it. Or put another way: 1972 Nova expectations driving
2000 Mercedes-Benz technology.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer people are willing to take on the ever-tougher challenges
of repairing automobiles, and experienced mechanics who don't
update their training increasingly are finding themselves left with
professional frustration and unhappy customers.
</P>
<P>

industry, writes for Cox News Service.

 &HT;    Donut magnate pokes holes in negativism
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Bill Rosenberg rises from his chair, a
large stogie dangling between his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The cigar seems a perfect excuse for sitting outdoors to talk
with a guest at his oceanside Delray Beach home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't smoke very much,'' he says, waving the cigar, ``not
since I had cancer of the lung in 1971 and they took out part of my
lung.''
</P>
<P>
   It's classic Rosenberg: to the point and unintimidated.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly 84, the founder of Dunkin' Donuts is nothing if not
blunt and comfortable with his approach to life.
</P>
<P>
   He's beaten cancer three times _ once miraculously, he says _
and is showing his gratitude by pumping money into cancer research.
He's donated over $2 million, so far, to the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston and is being honored Friday at a black tie ball
at The Breakers in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   He begins to run down the cancer checklist.
</P>
<P>
   1971: lung cancer discovered during a routine checkup.
</P>
<P>
   1977: cancer of the lymph glands and a sentence of only five
years to live. (That's the miracle part.)
</P>
<P>
   1990: cancer of the penis. A rare cancer that affects only about
1,300 men a year, it shows up as a sore on the penis, usually near
the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor said it was too much friction,'' he laughs, casting
a glance at Ann, his wife of 22 years who's 28 years younger than
he is.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't really a joke, Ann later explains. Friction from
tight clothing can irritate the penis, and sores can be very
serious. The cancer can also be caused by the human papillomavirus,
the same virus that causes cancer of the cervix in women. Part of
the reason the Rosenbergs are giving the interview is to call
attention to the various forms of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cancer, three hip replacements, and a list of
medical problems resulting in 18 operations, the man who left
school at 14 and became a business legend has a wry sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was basically recircumsized,'' he said of the penile
operation. ``The doctor said no sex for 3-4 weeks. I said, `Are you
kidding? Why don't you let me stop eating instead!'''
</P>
<P>
   He and Ann can laugh, now, but she says he has medical records
so thick, ``It's like reading `War and Peace'.''
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing recovery was from the lymphoma, which had been
diagnosed before his first hip operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my first hip was operated on, I got a call from the
doctor. He said, `I want to stop up and see you.' I said, `Why
can't you tell me on the phone?' He said he couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor came up and stood at the foot of my bed. My hip was
killing me, and I'm thinking that in three years I was going to die
anyway. `You know Bill,' he said, `your cancer is gone.' I said,
`What do you mean it's gone? In remission?' He said, `No, it's
gone. (We) can't find any signs of it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to peel me off the ceiling. It was like the governor
said you're not going to be electrocuted. I just felt like I was
reprieved from death.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, he said, he has no explanation for what happened
beyond wearing the ``lucky'' crucifix a friend had given him.
</P>
<P>
   He and Clesson Blaisdell, who was president of the New Hampshire
Senate before his recent death, had exchanged religious jewelry
when Blaisdell found out about Rosenberg's cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Blaisdell gave him the cross his own mother had given him, and
Rosenberg responded by giving Blaisdell a chai, the Jewish symbol
for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found out and he was all upset,'' Rosenberg recalled. ``He
was wearing this crucifix. He said, `this was given to me by my
mother and twice, it saved my life. I want you to put it on, it
will keep you from dying.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg lived to return the cross to Blaisdell, who buried it
with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   But if attitude has anything to do with recovery, Rosenberg
helped to cure himself.
</P>
<P>
   He lives his life dedicated to the principles with which he
started Dunkin' Donuts in a small shop in Massachusetts in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who have a positive mental attitude are result oriented.
That will help you in sickness, business, anything in life. The guy
who says it can't be done finds excuses. It's just a matter of
solving the problem. Just go on with life. Keep busy ... not dizzy,
busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he laughs at himself. He produces his ``attitude is
everything'' sheet with Positive Mental Attitude facing off against
Negative Mental Attitude, like two fighters in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   People with PMA are can do, will do, find solutions,
result-oriented problem solvers. It's that simple, he says. People
with NMA are can't do, won't do, find excuses, do-nothing failures.
</P>
<P>
   He sits back a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he is asked how it feels to be a legend, an icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That and a dollar and a half will buy you a cup of coffee,''
he smiles.
</P>
<P>
   And a donut?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. that's extra.''

 &HT;    Home designer shows soft spot for animal motifs
 &HT;    By Heather Graulich
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ John Landrum Bryant doesn't exactly look the
part of an artiste, and he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to West Palm Beach, the tall, dapper Bryant
oozed ``corporate attorney'' in a tailored navy blazer, crisp white
shirt and 18-karat gold cufflinks.
</P>
<P>
   But then you notice those cufflinks are miniature monkeys; the
clasp holding them on the cuff a perfect, tiny gold banana.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant designed them himself, and while he does actually hold a
law degree from Georgetown University, his heart and soul belong to
his new passion: designing high-end jewelry and home decor with
whimsical animal motifs. The decor line, called Jewelry for the
Home, includes sterling silver and bronze doorknobs, drawer pulls,
faucets, torchieres and tables _ all incorporating tigers,
elephants, monkeys or alligators.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who has a gallery in New York City, will show his work
at the Palm Beach Style Show being held this week at the
International Pavilion in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (people) like my work, they soon forget me,'' Bryant says
of his Savile Row image.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's foray into the art world is fairly recent, and it
surprises even himself, he admits. After getting his law degree, he
ended up as a businessman instead, helping lead nonprofit agencies
such as the National Park Foundation, where he served as president
for 17 years. He and his wife Patricia now run the Bauman
Foundation, a nonprofit group whose work includes supporting an
elephant sanctuary in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I was artistic,'' he says. ``But suddenly it
was like a volcano. I cannot stop designing.''
</P>
<P>
   It started about five years ago, when Bryant thought it would be
nice to have some custom jewelry made for Patricia.
</P>
<P>
   He doodled a few designs and took them to the New York City art
district, where he found silversmiths who helped him learn the
jewelry-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Although he can craft jewelry himself, eventually his level of
ability could not keep up with his increasingly intricate designs,
so he turned all the work over to a professional silversmith.
</P>
<P>
   For anniversaries, birthdays and holidays, he always surprises
his wife with his latest creations.
</P>
<P>
   And when the couple moved into a new apartment in New York's
Ritz Tower two years ago, he added home decor products to his
design repertoire. He wanted doorknobs and other fixtures that
would complement the apartment's lavish murals of exotic animals.
</P>
<P>
   His jewelry manufacturers figured out the complex means of
casting silver and bronze into elaborate fixtures that actually
work well, such as a solid sterling silver baby tiger that holds a
bathtub water spout between its paws.
</P>
<P>
   The line's prices range from $750 for a pair of bronze doorknobs
to $25,000 for the baby tiger faucet. Bryant prides himself on the
quality of the pieces, each of which are hand-cast and hand-carved.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are supposed to feel very nice in your hand,''
says Bryant, who hopes the added whimsy of the animals gives the
homeowner a chance to forget about the day's hassles. ``You turn on
the water and there are baby tigers, playing in the water. It can
be a nice diversion from life's problems.''

 &HT;    Some bath accessories are simple to attach to walls
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When working around my house, I always think
utility first and fashion second (or sometimes not at all).
</P>
<P>
   I love things that work well even if they're not glamorous,
which is why I love plastic hooks that glue to the backs of doors.
They're cheap, they're easy to install, and they give you a place
to toss your robe while you're in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   But most people demand something a little fancier. When they
want to hang something in the bathroom, they're likely to choose
some coordinated rack or fixture that attaches permanently to the
walls.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few tips on attaching things to your bathroom walls:
</P>
<P>
   _ Plain walls: If your bathroom walls are drywall or plaster,
hanging things from them is fairly simple. Attaching fasteners
through ceramic tile can be a bit trickier.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most common touch-up jobs for a bathroom is adding a
set with a coordinated toilet-tissue rack, towel racks or rings and
maybe a robe hook or two. Also available are decorative covers for
electrical switches in matching designs.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-inch metal towel rack costs about $12 to $15 for light
stainless steel or about $40 to $50 for brass. Wooden racks are a
little less expensive than brass.
</P>
<P>
   Ceramic fixtures come in a wide range of prices and two basic
types: surface mounted and recessed. Surface mounted ceramic towel
racks, soap dishes and so on are installed the same way as metal or
wood, while recessed ceramic fixtures are installed much like
ceramic tile.
</P>
<P>
   If you're just replacing existing fixtures with new fixtures in
the same positions, the job should go fairly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the old hooks and racks by removing the screws that hold
them in place. In many cases, the screws are easy to see because
they were driven directly into the wall through the face of the
fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't see any screws, look on the bottom of the rack for
a rectangular opening that has been slid down over a metal bracket
that was screwed to the wall. Look for retaining screws holding the
fixture to the bracket.
</P>
<P>
   If you find retaining screws, remove them and lift up on the
fixture to slide it off the bracket. If there are no retaining
screws, simply lift the fixture off the bracket. Tapping lightly
with a hammer on the bottom of the fixture should loosen it if it's
stubborn.
</P>
<P>
   Recessed ceramic fixtures have no screws or brackets. They seem
to sit flat against the wall and have a ring of caulk around them
where the fixture meets the surrounding tile. We'll talk about
removing them later.
</P>
<P>
   After removing the screws holding your racks, hooks and brackets
in place, fill the screw holes with a little spackle or joint
compound. You can smooth the repair and paint to cover the little
blemish later or position the new fixture to cover the holes.
</P>
<P>
   Installation instructions and screws for your new fixture should
be included in the package in which they came. Following the
instructions should keep you out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Try to attach the brackets for holding your new accent pieces to
studs behind the wall when you can. However, towel racks and robe
hooks are light-duty fixtures, and anchors through the wallboard
should hold them securely enough.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing light-switch and outlet covers is a snap. Cut the
power to the outlet and remove the screw in the center of the old
cover. Pull the old cover free and put the newer cover in its place
with a new screw.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ceramic tile walls: All the metal, wooden and surface-mounted
ceramic fixtures that can be attached to a wall of drywall, plaster
or wood paneling can be attached to a wall of ceramic tile as well.
You just have to provide holes through the tile.
</P>
<P>
   To put anchors into ceramic tile to hold towel racks and similar
fixtures, place an X of masking tape over the spot in the tile
where you want to drill. Use a carbide drill bit and set your
variable-speed drill on low.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've drilled a hole, tap plastic anchors into the holes
carefully to avoid cracking the tile. The screws then will be held
in place by the plastic anchors squeezed against the surrounding
tile.
</P>
<P>
   Before driving screws into ceramic tile, apply a little glob of
silicone caulk to the tip of the screw. That helps make the
connection watertight.
</P>
<P>
   Recessed ceramic fixtures are usually designed to fit into
spaces left by removing one or two standard-size tiles. The
fixtures have a square or rectangular raised area in back, slightly
smaller than the tiles they replace.
</P>
<P>
   Work carefully to remove tiles to replace them with a fixture;
it's a time-consuming job. It might even be worthwhile to hire a
professional if you're not used to working with ceramic tile.
</P>
<P>
   Start by putting a drop cloth over any plumbing fixture under
your work area. Chips from the removed tiles can scratch and damage
surfaces if you accidentally put weight on them and grind them in.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the grout around the tiles you plan to remove. If you
fail to remove the grout, you're likely to crack the tiles around
the ones you want to remove.
</P>
<P>
   You can use a grout-removal tool, available where tile is sold,
or chip the grout away using a chisel, awl or screwdriver lightly
tapped with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Start removing grout at the center of the line you want to
remove. As you proceed, tap the chisel toward the area you've
already cleared of grout. If you chip outward from the cleared
area, you're likely to accidentally chip grout you don't want to
remove.
</P>
<P>
   Once the grout lines are removed, use a chisel and tap an X
across the face of tiles you want to remove. Keep tapping to break
the tile into four triangular sections then break up and remove the
tile a section at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Removing a damaged or unwanted recessed ceramic fixture is done
much the same way. Tap diagonally across the fixture to break it
into pieces; then break up and remove the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully scrape away adhesive on the wall behind the removed
tile using a utility knife or putty knife. Try not to damage the
wallboard under the adhesive or you'll have to patch it before you
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   To glue the new fixture in place you can use a ceramic-tile
adhesive applied with a trowel of the proper size and configuration
for the adhesive you have chosen. With ceramic-tile adhesive, using
the proper trowel is critical because applying too much glue is as
bad as not applying enough.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use a two-part epoxy adhesive to hold ceramic in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Press the new fixture firmly into place and apply strips of
masking tape to hold it in place. Different adhesives cure at
different rates, so you can expect to wait a day to a week before
putting any pressure on your new fixture.

 &HT;    Getting life in order can ease stress
 &HT;    By Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Do any of the following statements sound familiar
to you?
</P>
<P>
   _ I feel like I'm spinning my wheels most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   _ I feel like I'm going in circles half the time.
</P>
<P>
   _ I feel further behind at the end of the day than when I
started at the beginning. I can't ever seem to get caught up.
</P>
<P>
   _ The harder I work, the further behind I get.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 24-hour day just isn't long enough for me to get things
done.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel that you are always behind, use your time very
inefficiently, can never get caught up, waste too much of your time
or that you deserve a prize for the world's most inefficient
individual, then perhaps the following information could be of
assistance to you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clutter, messiness, lost articles, etc., are all examples of
letting chaos control your time. Some individuals have things
categorized at home or work into ``piles'' or categories that
resemble a filing system. If this system truly keeps things in
order, then perhaps it works, but many individuals kid themselves
into believing that their system is helpful when, in fact, a more
traditional filing system or simply throwing things away would be
more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   For many individuals, a cluttered work place or home is simply a
reflection of a lifestyle lacking self-discipline and healthy
order. Check your home and work place to see if some filing,
throwing away, putting on hangers or re-shelving, etc. could
improve your ability to manage time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monitor your telephone and television time. How often do you
decide to a take a short break and call a friend or channel surf,
for a few minutes, only to find that an hour later you are still
taking your short break. Watching your favorite program as a way to
relax at the end of a long day beats staying glued to the boob tube
for long and unintended periods of time. Using e-mail, a fax, voice
mail or an answering machine to screen calls can also create more
time for necessary duties.
</P>
<P>
   _ Staying in good physical and mental shape increases efficiency
and reduces sluggishness, working in slow motion and efforts spent
sailing at half mast. Frequent worrying, poor sleep and depressive
states can also decrease efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   _ Uninvited drop-ins at the office or home can cause difficulty
in staying with a game plan, especially if your schedule is already
full. Let the unexpected ``guest'' know that you would like to
visit at another time when it's convenient for both of you. I'll
return to this important topic again in future columns.

 &HT;    Time arrives for lawn, garden work
 &HT;    By Christine Moran
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ It's still winter, but you don't have to wait
until the first day of spring to start your landscape and garden
work. In fact, if you wait until March 20, it may be too late. Some
projects need to be tackled early.
</P>
<P>
   But, you need to know what to do when, or your lawn and
landscaping can suffer, said Mike Wilder, agricultural extension
agent at the N.C. Cooperative Extension Service in Nashville, Tenn.
You have to know when to plant, when to fertilize and when to
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is crucial,'' Wilder said. ``A lot of people wait until
March or April before they start thinking about sculpting their
landscapes. In most cases, it's too late. There are certain steps
you should take in the fall and winter if you want your landscape
to look nice in the spring and summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer-flowering plants, such as crepe myrtles and butterfly
bushes, need to be pruned in late February, because their flowers
bloom on new growth. Wilder warns people not to prune
spring-flowering plants, such as dogwoods, spirea, azaleas and
forsythia, unless you want to lose the blooms for a season.
</P>
<P>
   He says prune evergreens in February if you want to encourage
new growth. Do it in June if you want to slow growth.
</P>
<P>
   Plant cool-season vegetables, such as asparagus crowns, carrots,
broccoli, cauliflower, head lettuce, onions, garden peas, Irish
potatoes, radishes, rutabagas, spinach and turnips, in February. If
cool, dry weather prevails, the vegetables can be harvested in late
March or early April.
</P>
<P>
   Prune fruit trees only after flower buds swell and show some
color. Even then, Wilder says, don't take too much away. Save some
pruning for May or June.
</P>
<P>
   Apply dormant oil on fruit trees to kill insect eggs before leaf
and flower buds begin to expand. If you wait until March, you'll
damage tender leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Plant trees and shrubs now, so root systems can develop before
hot weather causes them stress. Divide perennials, such as
daylilies, shasta daisies, gaillardias and peonies, when the ground
dries some.
</P>
<P>
   Fertilize spring-flowering bulbs as they emerge. Mid-February is
a good time to apply 3 to 4 inches of mulch along with a
pre-emergent herbicide to prevent summer annual weeds from
germinating. If you're not using herbicides, Wilder says, get ready
to pull weeds this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Fertilize cool-season lawns, such as fescue and bluegrass, in
mid-February. If you have a warm-season grass, such as Bermuda,
zoysia, centipede or St. Augustine, wait until May or June, when
the grass is actively growing.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing to do is to take a soil sample to know if
fertilizing is necessary and if you need lime to adjust the acidity
of your soil.

 &HT;    Watch where you step at the Vatican's Jubilee celebration
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Rome is sprucing up for the Vatican's Jubilee
_ 12 months of celebration marking the 2,000 birthday of the
Christian era. According to Vatican estimates, as many as 25
million additional visitors are expected to hit the Eternal City
before the observance ends on Twelfth Night, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, municipal officials are eager to have their city put
its best (and cleanest) foot forward, but that could be a problem.
Over 200,000 dogs live in Rome, and for lack of back yards in which
to take care of business, they relieve themselves wherever they
can, thus transforming sidewalks and gutters into an urban
minefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoop or pay!'' owners have been warned, but so far, results
are scanty _ which is more than can be said for the doo droppings
all over town. City fathers now have taken matters into their own
hands, figuratively speaking of course, and ordered five
poop-scooping scooters (try repeating that a few times real fast)
to be placed into immediate service. Each scooter comes equipped
with a long vacuum nozzle and a tank mounted on the rear, as well
as a water spray for stubborn spots.
</P>
<P>
   Further description is probably unnecessary. You get the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Folks who've never lived in places like Rome or New York City,
might have difficulty imagining what life without grass is like for
doggies and their owners. Keep in mind that Rover can't just scoot
out the back door and head for a neighbor's flower bed whenever the
urge strikes. He has to be accompanied and cleaned up after.
</P>
<P>
   All of this leads me to believe that city dogs, over the years,
have probably become a bit uppity _ but for good reason. Put
yourself in Rover's place and see how humble you'd be if every time
you had to go, a guy in pinstripes and Gucci's trotted along behind
you with a Baggie and a shovel.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, New Yorkers didn't always scoop. When I lived there
in the '60s, signs everywhere warned owners: Curb your dog _ which
meant sidewalks were off limits and Spot had to be trained to use
the gutter. An improvement, but crossing streets got tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-towners used to complain that New Yorkers were rude. Said
they never spoke to each other or even made eye contact. I hadn't
lived there two days before I figured out why. The natives were no
fools. They walked with their heads down because they were sick and
tired of scraping Dalmatian doo off their loafers.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, I lived in a small Georgia town with its very own
courthouse square, angle parking with a two-hour limit, and an
honest-to-goodness Barney Fife on patrol. Our deputy had a bit of
bad luck one night when the bank alarm went off. Seems he got so
excited that somehow he ended up speeding the wrong way down a
one-way street just in time to meet the sheriff's cruiser ... head
on.
</P>
<P>
   Barney was demoted to parking tickets and a Moto-Guzzi (a
3-wheeled Italian scooter), which he didn't seem to mind a whole
lot until one night some mean boys pushed his Guzzi up the
courthouse steps and turned it upside down on the stone table where
the old guys played checkers.
</P>
<P>
   That made Barney mad. So mad in fact, that he pulled out his gun
and threatened to shoot the miscreants. He didn't, of course, but
the sheriff wasn't any too happy to have his deputy standing on the
courthouse steps swearing and waving around his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy was stripped of his pistol and put on foot patrol
around the square, armed only with a scoop and a broom. Business
was brisk since the town had no leash law.
</P>
<P>
   Barney still kept his badge shined up and walked with the same
old swagger, like his new job description didn't bother him a whole
lot, but we all knew he would have been much happier with something
to drive _ anything _ even an Italian poop-scooping scooter.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Bush reintroduced himself to South Carolina,
post New Hampshire, with a much-ballyhooed speech at Bob Jones
University, a racist school that into the bargain also harbors
sometimes a virulent anti-Catholicism. Atop his waffling on the
state's Confederate battle flag issue, the meaning was clear. Bush
was following in what has become a disturbing tradition among
Republican presidential aspirants. (Teepen, Cox News Service.)

Beach, the tall, dapper Bryant oozed ``corporate attorney'' in a
tailored navy blazer, crisp white shirt and 18-karat gold
cufflinks. But then you notice those cufflinks are miniature
monkeys; the clasp holding them on the cuff a perfect, tiny gold
banana. Bryant designed them himself, and while he does actually
hold a law degree from Georgetown University, his heart and soul
belong to his new passion: designing high-end jewelry and home
decor with whimsical animal motifs. The decor line, called Jewelry
for the Home, includes sterling silver and bronze doorknobs, drawer
pulls, faucets, torchieres and tables all incorporating tigers,
elephants, monkeys or alligators. (Graulich, Palm Beach Post). 28.

important part of a tree because if something prevents them from
providing oxygen, water and food to the tree, it will suffer and
eventually die. In the suburbs, trees are falling victim to
developers' bulldozers; in the city, old age, cramped conditions,
and wear and tear are the culprits. Yet an equally big problem,
tree experts say, is homeowners who don't understand a tree's needs
and, as a result, buy the wrong kind or plant it incorrectly or in
the wrong place or at the wrong time.(Flanders, Atlanta

 &HT;    Family's insurance battle gets national, presidential candidates
attention
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The staffs of every major presidential candidate
have called 2-year-old Kaitlynn Bogan's parents in West Alexandria
after the family told Vice President Al Gore last week about its
battle over health insurance, Kaitlynn's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a rare disease, Kaitlynn's diet is limited to an
expensive synthetic baby formula for which health plans rarely pay.
The Bogan Baby Bill, introduced by Ohio Rep. Gene Krebs (R-Camden)
as House Bill 218, would require private health plans to pay for
such medically necessary formulas.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore arrived for his Dayton campaign visit Feb. 9, ``he
came off the plane and came right up to us,'' mother Lydia Bogan
said. ``He said, `I know who you are.' (U.S. Rep.) Tony Hall
(D-Dayton) had given him information about us. We talked for
probably four minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few days, Bogan said, she talked to the
presidential campaign staffs of Republican candidates Texas Gov.
George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain, and played phone tag
with the representatives of former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's chief
rival for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's people called me and asked for a picture of Kaitlynn to
put in his campaign headquarters in Nashville,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said the television newsmagazine shows
``20/20'' and ``48 Hours'' accelerated their efforts to complete
stories about the Bogans and similar families.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 Ohio babies are born each year with disorders that
make all foods toxic, Krebs said, and state-funded health plans
cover the formula's $1,000-a-month cost for about 2,000 of them.
Nearly all babies outgrow the disorder after a year, but Kaitlynn
has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting incredibly interesting,'' Bogan said, ``because
it's like a bidding war. The Republicans don't want the Democrats
to take it for their issue, and the Democrats don't want the
Republicans to take it. We're getting support from both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, however, the Bogan Baby Bill is stalled in the Rules
and Reference Committee, chaired by House Speaker Jo Ann Davidson
(R-Reynoldsburg). It has passed the Insurance Committee with some
of the House's most conservative Republicans joining the 14-4
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not going to do anything in Ohio, we're going to
call in the national people,'' Bogan said. She said her recently
formed Mothers Aligned for Medical Advocacy (MAMA) has heard from
parents with similar stories across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was ``noncommittal'' about taking action on the issue,
Bogan said, ``but he said this is not just an Ohio problem. This is
a national problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on her conversations with lawmakers from both parties,
Bogan expects the subject will become part of ongoing congressional
discussions on patients' rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue's not going to go away,'' Bogan said of health
insurance reform. ``This is the heartbeat of the American people. A
lot of people are very upset about health care.''

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Bush reintroduced himself to South Carolina,
post New Hampshire, with a much-ballyhooed speech at Bob Jones
University, a racist school that into the bargain also harbors
sometimes a virulent anti-Catholicism. Atop his waffling on the
state's Confederate battle flag issue, the meaning was clear. Bush
was following in what has become a disturbing tradition among
Republican presidential aspirants. (Teepen, Cox News Service.)

business, they relieve themselves wherever they can, thus
transforming sidewalks and gutters into an urban minefield.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THIS is rodeo week in Houston, the week of ill-tempered bulls and
bucking broncs and calves that don't wish to be roped, not to
forget sausage on a stick. This would have been a good week for
Giles Tippette, who was for greater or lesser periods of his life a
rodeo cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the author of 15 western novels, maybe more, and
briefly a mercenary pilot in Africa, a diamond courier, a private
eye, and a contributor to most of the country's magazines. It must
have been hell to be a writer who was nearly always more colorful
than the subjects of his stories.
</P>
<P>
   His hobby, he said, was recovering from the injuries he received
in the sports he took part in so he could write about them. If an
editor wanted a piece on a six-day sailing race in the Gulf of
Mexico, Giles joined the crew. Among other pursuits, he played
roller hockey and something called donkey baseball.
</P>
<P>
   As a competitor, an analyst and a spectator, he enjoyed all
sports except basketball. This was no reflection on the game. A
basketball player once stole his girl when he was on the football
team at John Tarleton Junior College. He never got over it.
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction to a piece on bull riding, Tippette once
observed that, ``Sometimes I think the worst thing about making
friends is the risk of losing them.''
</P>
<P>
   It hurts to reread those words now, but not nearly as much as it
did in October, when Giles died of a lung disease that had stolen
his sense of adventure a breath at a time. He was 63 going on 19,
Peter Pan's tall and rangy other brother. ``Dying is no big deal,''
Red Smith once wrote. ``The least of us will manage that. Living is
the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   In that respect Tippette was a genius, in a freestyle,
catch-as-catch-can way. It was a trial to keep up with him, but he
was the best kind of friend, truthful and generous, the kind who
gave you compliments so big they far outdistanced the insult he had
paid you earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after his passing, other assignments interfered, and
the emotions of the moment went unsaid, a story or two untold. His
fans and readers, including a number of writers, will miss him. And
there will not be a better time to say so.
</P>
<P>
   There was an anecdote that defined Giles Tippette _ a wonderful
name; I wish I had thought of it _ about as well as anyone can.
This was the week of that annual bacchanal, the Houston Livestock
Show and Rodeo, and Giles had stopped for a refreshment in the bar
of a Houston hotel.
</P>
<P>
   He was dressed in the proper vestments _ the hat, the boots, the
belt buckle. He had been tagging along with a world-class cowboy,
Larry Mahan, researching a book that became The Brave Men.
</P>
<P>
   Two barstools over, a stranger sized him up. ``You in the
rodeo?'' asked the stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a writer,'' replied Tippette, not snobby, mind you, just
matter-of-fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you ride?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ride a typewriter.''
</P>
<P>
   No telling how far this conversation could have gone, except
that the stranger soon realized that they were not quite receiving
each other. When it became clear that Giles was a w-r-i-t-e-r, not
an r-i-d-e-r, the fellow introduced himself. He was Bill Peterson,
recently of Florida State, then the new Rice football coach. Out of
that encounter came another book, a season with the Owls called
Saturday's Children.
</P>
<P>
   Three things happened. Within weeks, the players thought Giles
was on the coaching staff. The book resulted in a lawsuit, and for
the only time in the school's history, Rice was investigated for
possible violations of NCAA rules. No penalty resulted, but the
probe was accepted as proof that the Owls, mired in a drought,
still had big-time football ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, Giles stumbled into more good stories than
most writers found on purpose. But he and Bill Peterson were both
correct. Tippette was a writer and a rider _ planes, trains, cars,
boats and bulls, hard landings and soft, a tale in every blessed
one.
</P>
<P>
   In his mid-30s, he felt an urge to return to the rodeo ring, and
he signed up to ride a bull at Fulshear. The public-address
announcer was reciting his literary credentials, and in the chute
the bull was going nuts, acting up and slinging strings of slobber
at him and looking back at him with an evil eye. ``Hell, don't tell
the crowd,'' yelled the author. ``Tell the bull. The bull ain't
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   He rarely rewrote his copy, but what jumped off the page was
nearly always fresh and strong and nearly organic. He made it seem
easy. No writer worth his or her salt would admit, of course, that
the work was ever easy. But Giles made it seem so, and the answer
was in the attitude. He treated words as one would a good friend.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Some of the toughest days are still ahead for
Moises Alou. Monday wasn't one of them.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Morning workouts had just started when Alou strolled into the
Astros' spring-training complex, put on his uniform, grabbed a
couple of bats and joined teammates on a nearby field. After some
brief stretching, Alou entered a batting cage and began swinging
away.
</P>
<P>
   His stroke was crisp. He smashed line drives in every direction.
And with one swing, Alou sent a pitch over a truck passing along a
street behind the wall in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally a guy would be missing pitches and fouling off
pitches,'' Astros hitting instructor Tom McCraw said. ``He was
hitting line drives and hitting balls to all parts of the field.
It's like he never left.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou knows the truth. It has been 16 months since he last played
in a meaningful game. A freak treadmill accident crippled his left
knee and forced him to miss all of last season. It is time Alou can
never regain. But rather than dwell on the what-ifs, the
33-year-old left fielder is ready to put another chapter in an
injury-filled career behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very excited to get here,'' Alou said. ``That's why I'm
here a few days early. Maybe some of the guys will be a little bit
ahead of me, but in a couple of days I'll catch up. I felt good. I
worked hard for a year, and hopefully it will pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Alou was one of the best hitters in the game,
setting career highs with 38 homers and 124 RBIs in 1998. But last
year, with spring training only days away, everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   While preparing for the 1999 season, Alou fell off a treadmill
and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Told he
would miss the entire campaign, Alou retreated to his offseason
home in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, he hoped to prove everybody wrong and return in
time to help the Astros during their September pennant run. Alou
was ready to play again in six months until he fell off a bicycle
in late August. His knee swollen, he had to start his
rehabilitation all over again, officially ending any hopes of
returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think watching was probably the hardest thing for me,'' Alou
said. ``It took a couple of months to realize I wasn't going to
play. Then there was the rehab. There are a lot of ups and downs
when you're coming off major surgery. There are a lot of days when
I felt great and a lot of days when I didn't feel that great.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the playoffs. Alou came under fire for not
accompanying the Astros to Atlanta for their Division Series
against the Braves. While Andres Galarraga and Javy Lopez, both on
the disabled list, sat on the Braves' bench, Astros management was
critical of Alou, and his name popped up in offseason trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Alou had several phone conversations with Astros general manager
Gerry Hunsicker over the winter, and the two sides claim
conciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten used to hearing my name (in trade speculation) all
the time,'' Alou said. ``I didn't worry about it, because I have a
no-trade clause in my contract, and I know most of the stuff was
just rumors. That was 1999. This is 2000. The injury is over, the
rumors are over, and I'm here with the Astros. That's all I have to
worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year is over,'' he said. ``We're starting a new chapter.
All families have squabbles, family feuds, from time to time. A lot
of what happened last year was wrapped up in frustration and
emotion on both sides. Nobody felt worse about Mo's year than Mo.
He is a great athlete and a very proud person. It was difficult for
him to sit and watch his teammates last year. He felt like he
needed to be out there. It's over. He's under contract for the next
two years, and I look forward to having him back in our lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   If he remains healthy, Alou sees no reason why he can't match
his 1998 run production. If not for the historic home-run duel
between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, Alou's numbers would have been
worthy of Most Valuable Player consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a player that likes to set any goals,'' Alou
said. ``But if I stay healthy, why not? I've done it before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are counting on it. With the return of Alou and the
move to Enron Field, the team is hoping to improve an offense that
dropped off drastically last season as a result of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago he was our best hitter, the guy most likely to
get a big hit against a tough pitcher,'' manager Larry Dierker
said. ``He's just a big-game-type player.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker is mulling an outfield switch that would move Alou from
left field to right. He would in turn use a Richard Hidalgo-Daryle
Ward platoon in left, with Roger Cedeno, acquired in December from
the Mets, patrolling center. If the change occurs, Dierker would
prefer it happen during spring training, thus avoiding any
disruptions during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right field may be a little ambitious (for Alou) at this
point,'' Hunsicker said. ``I think coming off a knee injury, we
need to make sure he is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou worked hard to get his knee in shape during the offseason.
The true test of whether it can withstand the strain will come when
he plays defense and starts running the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of doing some movement I haven't done in a
year,'' he said. ``I'll have to see how my knee feels. Right now I
feel good. I just have to be confident and lose a little bit of
fear I might have.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the Astros have some concerns about Alou's knee that
can only be calmed as the season nears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you see the player physically get in the cage and swing
a bat and go through some baseball activities, you always have that
doubt in your mind,'' Hunsicker said. ``In 20 minutes of batting
practice, I don't think he hit one ball that wasn't on the sweet
spot of the bat. The ball coming off his bat just makes a different
sound than it does for the other guys. He's a special player, and
it's just great to see him back out there healthy.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SARASOTA, Fla. _ The autograph hounds were up with the roosters,
and there were already several puddles of drool outside the gate at
Ed Smith Stadium by 9 a.m. when their man turned left in his shiny
new Mercedes and drove right on by.
</P>
<P>
   As he pulled into an open spot near the clubhouse, waves of
minicams washed over the blacktop as if somebody had opened a door
and let the tide in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I got him saying `hey' to me,'' shouted one of the
camera jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   Another one in the back of the throng proudly announced to his
peers, ``I got a great shot of all of you running after him.''
</P>
<P>
   While George W. Bush and John McCain are squabbling for the
right to run for the pedestrian office of president, Ken Griffey
Jr. came to the spring-training home of the Cincinnati Reds for a
well-oiled coronation as king of the National League, if not all of
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Reds' publicity office, this would be the only
time all spring that Junior would meet with the media. There have
probably been papal visits that received less coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ESPNews and CNN/Sports Illustrated carried the news conference
live. Reporters filled about six rows of seats in three sections of
the stands. There was an unofficial master of ceremonies of sorts,
who called out the names and all of the accomplishments of the
individuals who arrived in a flotilla of golf carts down the
first-base line.
</P>
<P>
   First it was general manager Jim Bowden, then manager Jack
McKeon and finally Junior himself who took places before the
cameras in the row of folding chairs set up on the dugout roof amid
the tangle of microphone wires and TV lights. And from the look of
the entire overproduced, artificial setting, you were tempted to
jump in and start the questioning with: ``Bachelor No. 1, if you
could be a chest protector and ''
</P>
<P>
   This is baseball in the 21st century. Actually, it's all sports
in the age of a zillion cable channels with so much dead air to
fill when the Winter X Games and bass tournaments are over.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the way of the sports stars and sports franchises that
want to, quite literally, put your idols up on a pedestal without
letting you get close enough to touch. Just remember to buy those
tickets to help pay for a Junior Mint _ his almost $13 million
salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is back in Cincinnati,'' crowed Bowden, whose comment
must have come as a shock to McKeon and his other players, who
managed to win 96 games and push the Astros to the wire last
season. ``The Cincinnati Reds are excited that Ken Griffey Jr. will
begin taking the next steps in his Hall of Fame career and
hopefully wear his Reds uniform someday when he passes Henry
Aaron's career home-run record. There is just so much excitement in
the air in Cincinnati. We have installed 10 new telephone lines,
and now our ticket offices are open seven days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, indeed. Bowden also mentioned that he hoped Reds fans would
continue to support the team beyond this season to pay off
Griffey's contract, which guarantees him $116.5 million over the
next nine years.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably the most significant baseball acquisition since
the Red Sox sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees, and it has a
particularly warm and fuzzy feel since Griffey is returning to the
city where he grew up while his father played with Johnny Bench,
Pete Rose, Joe Morgan and Tony Perez on the Big Red Machine of the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In deference to Perez, whose number is retired, Junior will
trade in his No. 24 for No. 30, Griffey Sr.'s old number.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Petey Jr. and all of the kids of the old Reds have
done in the past _ worn their dad's number,'' Junior said.
</P>
<P>
   But what about his own dad, who is a coach for the Reds?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him, `Hey, pick a new number.'''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey chatted amiably, gave the usual lines about just trying
to be one of the boys in the clubhouse and denied there was any
pressure to make the Reds champions. But his right leg, which
rattled nervously the entire time he spoke, belied his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there is pressure. There has to be pressure. His
grandmother and his cousins have been on the phone from Cincinnati
telling him that the town is going bonkers. Banners decorate office
buildings. Airplanes tow signs saying: ``Welcome home, Junior!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Uh-oh, here we go again,''' Griffey said. ``I just
figured I'd sneak in the locker room and nobody would notice me. I
didn't think there'd be all these cameras. I didn't want all
this.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``all this'' is what makes all that _ Junior's Mint _
possible. So he sits on a dugout roof, above the fray, or rides in
a shiny Mercedes, the tinted glass keeping the glare of the real
world outside.

<P>
   It is morning on my sister's Illinois farm. My eyes open and I
am surrounded by other eyes. Three people, one dog, four cats.
</P>
<P>
   We all have predator's eyes _ forward facing with binocular
vision _ and move to the kitchen, where breakfast is prey.
</P>
<P>
   We humans, with our very color-sensitive eyes, are searching the
cupboard. The Folger's coffee jar is bright red so we can find it
fast. The little collie mix's round pupils are searching out
breakfast, too, by following the human motions. It can see yellow
and blue but can't tell red from green.
</P>
<P>
   The barn cats slink along the counter. Their vertical pupils,
constricted ovals in the daylight, scan a 287-degree field of
vision for the kill. It comes when the opener pierces the little
round can.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the Angus cattle are so black it is hard to see that
they even have eyes. And the tiny goats have amber eyes with
horizontal pupils set on the sides of thes. This lets them
see what's coming around their flanks. They are, in the natural
world, prey.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the American toad, Bufo americanis, which will
eventually turn up by the pump. It'll hunt crawlies. But you'd have
to be an arcane-knowledge freak to know that humans need eight to
10 times more light than a toad does to see a worm at night,
according to studies done at the University of Helsinki. Or that
the red-tailed hawk that lives on the power-line tower can, on a
clear day, see a rabbit a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   We humans are innately cued to study one another's eyes. Dilated
pupils can mean the person you're looking at really likes you. Or
it can mean you're standing in the dark. Beady little eyes equal
distaste or disdain. Or the sun is behind you.
</P>
<P>
   We are also wired to adore and protect any face with what the
Germans call kinderschema _ the flat faces, snub noses and big eyes
of a human infant.
</P>
<P>
   A baby's eyes take up about a third of its entire face. In
adults, eyes take up about a fifth. In fact, we're born with nearly
adult-sized eyes. Our faces grow up around them.
</P>
<P>
   Kinderschema is the appeal of that puppy in the window or the
kitten your kid brings home. Big eyes reach out.
</P>
<P>
   At an animal shelter a light-colored animal, peering out with
big, dark eyes, will usually find a home before the black one,
whose eyes, like those of the Angus, disappear into the body.
</P>
<P>
   My fascination with animal eyes goes back to February nights in
the 1950s, when I, the older daughter of a father with no sons,
would stand in the barn and help midwife piglets into the world. I
rubbed them down, got the stuff out of their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   But it was when their eyes opened that the piglets were, to my
eyes, really there.
</P>
<P>
   Two kinds of eyes rule in the animal kingdom: directional eyes,
which only sense light and belong to worms and other bitty
creatures, and image-forming eyes, found in certain mollusks,
bivalves, most arthropods and nearly all vertebrates.
</P>
<P>
   The giant squid, a cephalopod, has image-forming peepers bigger
than basketballs.
</P>
<P>
   How eyeballs sit in an animal's head is also important. The
Philippine tarsier, a nocturnal monkey, has eyes so big they don't
move at all in their sockets. Like an owl, it'll turn its whole
head to look around.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, a chameleon, with eyes on stalks, can hold its
head still and swivel those peepers around like periscopes.
</P>
<P>
   The whole business of color vision is murky and controversial.
The human retina has 125 million thin, straight rods that see in
black and white, and 7 million fat little cones that examine colors
in bright light.
</P>
<P>
   Primates have pretty good color vision. Dogs and cats so-so.
Bees can see a color past violet that we cannot see, but they can't
see red. Ants can't see red either. Hummingbirds like red best. And
prairie dogs have some color vision but can't tell red from green.
</P>
<P>
   What color vision means to animals is tricky science, because
while we can examine the comparative anatomy of eyes, it's much
more complicated to determine how an individual species' central
nervous system and brain interpret what the eye sees.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that Homo sapiens are the only creatures that
find it necessary to stand around the paint sample section of a
paint store for two hours on a Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   I'd give the award for most versatile eyes to the oak toad,
which, as it swallows, moves its eyeballs back into the roof of its
mouth to help push food down its throat.
</P>
<P>
   The most useful adaptation goes to the burrowing mole skink,
which has a little picture window in its eyelid so it can look
around without opening its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The shark protects its eyes during an attack by rolling them
back in its head. The horned toad, when threatened, can squirt
blood from its eyes into an enemy's face.
</P>
<P>
   The worst eyesight for a large animal probably belongs to the
rhinoceros. From 15 feet it can't tell a man from a tree, and will
charge big rocks. To see how a rhino sees, squint until your
eyelashes are woven together.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, compared with the possum that lives under the front
porch of my house in Washington, D.C., the rhino could probably
read the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   During mornings on my ``city farm,'' I often breakfast with a
squirrel. It has eyes on the sides of its head like all prey
animals and sits on the air conditioner and stares at me, sideways
with one big eye, until I put out some peanuts. If I'm slow, it
stares harder to catch my eye.
</P>
<P>
   World-renowned photographer James Balog has made an art of
catching the eyes of wild animals. In his recently released book,
``Animal,'' Balog writes, ``Animals are whole unto themselves,
completely poised in an existence bequeathed by 5 billion years of
evolutionary rhythm, their minds and spirits focused. To look into
the eyes of many animals, particularly the big ones like bear and
elephant, is to sense a degree of calm and certainty rarely felt in
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Balog believes that his stylized portraiture yielded an enormous
dividend: ``It led me into the secret labyrinth of the animal mind,
revealing that intangible yet unmistakable force called
consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd rather walk on glass than address the scientific debate on
animal consciousness. I only know that if you grow up among and
around all kinds of animals, as little farm girls do, you believe
that you can tell what animals are thinking when you look at them
and they look at you.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a girl, I shot a ruby-crowned kinglet with a BB gun.
It died in my hand. Its eyes died last.
</P>
<P>
   I never shot a gun again. &QL;

<P>
   I'd rather walk on glass than address the scientific debate on
animal consciousness. I only know that if you grow up among and
around all kinds of animals, as little farm girls do, you believe
that you can tell what animals are thinking when you look at them
and they look at you.

<P>
   When I was a girl, I shot a ruby-crowned kinglet with a BB gun.
It died in my hand. Its eyes died last.

<P>
   I never shot a gun again. &QL;

<P>
   When Robert Kung lays his heart on the table, waiters come to
chat about it and his coffee is on the house.
</P>
<P>
   Kung's manmade heart is slightly bigger than a real one, and it
looks like a fat hamburger with legs: a titanium patty in a hard
plastic bun.
</P>
<P>
   A normal heart beats 70 to 80 times a minute until a person
reaches age 70 or older. But Kung, research director at a company
called Abiomed, will be happy if someone gets about five years out
of his device.
</P>
<P>
   It sits gleaming in the center of the table now, clearly
artificial, and yet its oddly angled legs _ made of Dacron _ give
it the lumpy look of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that actually the heart itself?'' a waiter asks.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment he seems to think it's real.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Kung's artificial heart will become very real indeed to a
human patient. It has already kept calves alive, and it is now
undergoing final tests in Abiomed's lab in Danvers, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   At Penn State's College of Medicine in Hershey, Penn., a second
version of an artificial heart is at about the same stage of
development. Alan Snyder, a bioengineer at Penn State, has worked
on that device since 1976, and his coworkers have been at it since
1971.
</P>
<P>
   But artificial hearts of various sorts have been around since
the 1950s. The most famous of them, the Jarvik-7, was implanted in
a patient named Barney Clark in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, and then a second man, William Schroeder, died lingering
deaths, tethered to air compressors and visited by repeated
infections and strokes. No one has performed a complete heart
replacement since.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the human heart so hard for researchers to imitate?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one very simple problem,'' says Steven Vogel, a
biomechanic at Duke University and author of a book on the
circulatory system called ``Vital Circuits.'' ``Muscle is a soft,
wet, contractile engine, and that's just unlike anything in our
technological armamentarium.''
</P>
<P>
   A natural heart consists of two pumps, each made of two
chambers. The right atrium squirts oxygen-depleted blood from the
body into the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs. The
left atrium squirts aerated blood from the lungs into the left
ventricle, which pumps it out to the body.
</P>
<P>
   With each heartbeat, the two small atria contract together, then
the two large ventricles, making the heart go ba-BUM.
</P>
<P>
   Kung's and Snyder's hearts will leave the patient's atria in
place (they're usually not the problem) and just replace the
ventricles.
</P>
<P>
   Kung's and Snyder's artificial hearts have two ventricles, just
like the real thing, but there the similarity ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the natural heart, you're using muscle as a container,''
Snyder says, ``and the container pumps on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing how to build a self-contracting container, he and
Kung had to sandwich a separate engine between the two ventricles.
The engine pushes against the inside wall of each ventricle _
they're made of a flexible polyurethane _ squeezing blood out of
the heart and into the arteries.
</P>
<P>
   In the Penn State heart, a battery-powered motor drives a piston
that moves back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   In the Abiomed heart, the motor drives a fan blade that sits
immersed in a hydraulic fluid; a rotary valve shoots the fluid
alternately left and right.
</P>
<P>
   Both artificial hearts seem to work, at least in calves. (The
calf studies lasted a few months _ after which the animals outgrew
their hearts _ but researchers found no signs of rejection and few
problems with infection.)
</P>
<P>
   And both look to be enormous improvements over the Jarvik-7. The
recipient won't be chained to cumbersome equipment, because the
control system and even the working battery will be small enough to
implant in a patient's abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of infection, nothing will penetrate the
patient's skin after the initial surgery. The battery will be
recharged continuously by radio waves from a larger, rechargeable
battery pack patients will wear in a harness.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the dream, at least. But artificial hearts still fall
far short of their living models, and no one knows that better than
their designers.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that impresses Kung most about the natural heart is
its ability to pump a little or a lot of blood, as the occasion
requires. A resting heart pumps out five liters of blood (about as
much as a typical human body contains) every minute. But exercise
boosts the output dramatically. A typical athlete's heart churns
out from 25 to 30 liters per minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Abiomed heart can pump more than 10 liters per minute _
plenty for most activities but not enough for others. You will be
able to have sex, for instance, but not a very athletic kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly won't be able to play squash,'' Kung says.
</P>
<P>
   But an artificial heart won't suddenly fail if you ask too much
of it. You just won't be able to execute the desired motion. And
you won't be able to work your way up to it, either.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas a living heart, like any muscle, gets stronger over time
if you exercise it, an artificial heart will never be stronger than
on the day it was implanted, precisely because it is not alive.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an artificial heart needs to be as inert as possible to
prevent blood clots _ which, after migrating from the Jarvik heart,
caused the strokes partly responsible for killing Clark and
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Clots are Kung's and Snyder's biggest worry. They've tried to
minimize the danger in two ways. First, they've designed their
hearts' ventricles so that blood flows through them in a swirling
vortex, without forming stagnant pools that would encourage it to
clot.
</P>
<P>
   Second, they've coated every surface the blood will touch with
their special polyurethane, which sheds blood cells and platelets
the way Teflon sheds grease.
</P>
<P>
   A living heart has a more vigorous strategy for preventing
clots, sending out chemical signals that stop them from forming.
And like other tissues, the heart extracts fuel and nutrients from
the blood and uses them to rebuild itself continuously.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think the heart is the same year to year,'' Vogel says.
``In fact, it has a half-life of less than a year, in terms of
replacing its molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Such feats are still beyond the dreams of engineers. A
self-repairing pump sustained by the fluid it circulates and
capable of strengthening over time to meet demand, your heart is an
extraordinary kind of pump _ one with a normal service life that no
artificial heart has even approached.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the only hope for people with severe afflictions
are transplants _ and there are not nearly enough donor hearts to
go around. So the demand for Kung's and Snyder's contraptions
promises to remain high. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It is morning on my sister's Illinois farm. My eyes open and I
am surrounded by other eyes. Three people, one dog, four cats.
</P>
<P>
   We all have predator's eyes _ forward facing with binocular
vision _ and move to the kitchen, where breakfast is prey.
</P>
<P>
   We humans, with our very color-sensitive eyes, are searching the
cupboard. The Folger's coffee jar is bright red so we can find it
fast. The little collie mix's round pupils are searching out
breakfast, too, by following the human motions. It can see yellow
and blue but can't tell red from green.
</P>
<P>
   The barn cats slink along the counter. Their vertical pupils,
constricted ovals in the daylight, scan a 287-degree field of
vision for the kill. It comes when the opener pierces the little
round can.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the Angus cattle are so black it is hard to see that
they even have eyes. And the tiny goats have amber eyes with
horizontal pupils set on the sides of their heads. This lets them
see what's coming around their flanks. They are, in the natural
world, prey.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the American toad, Bufo americanis, which will
eventually turn up by the pump. It'll hunt crawlies. But you'd have
to be an arcane-knowledge freak to know that humans need eight to
10 times more light than a toad does to see a worm at night,
according to studies done at the University of Helsinki. Or that
the red-tailed hawk that lives on the power-line tower can, on a
clear day, see a rabbit a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   We humans are innately cued to study one another's eyes. Dilated
pupils can mean the person you're looking at really likes you. Or
it can mean you're standing in the dark. Beady little eyes equal
distaste or disdain. Or the sun is behind you.
</P>
<P>
   We are also wired to adore and protect any face with what the
Germans call kinderschema _ the flat faces, snub noses and big eyes
of a human infant.
</P>
<P>
   A baby's eyes take up about a third of its entire face. In
adults, eyes take up about a fifth. In fact, we're born with nearly
adult-sized eyes. Our faces grow up around them.
</P>
<P>
   Kinderschema is the appeal of that puppy in the window or the
kitten your kid brings home. Big eyes reach out.
</P>
<P>
   At an animal shelter a light-colored animal, peering out with
big, dark eyes, will usually find a home before the black one,
whose eyes, like those of the Angus, disappear into the body.
</P>
<P>
   My fascination with animal eyes goes back to February nights in
the 1950s, when I, the older daughter of a father with no sons,
would stand in the barn and help midwife piglets into the world. I
rubbed them down, got the stuff out of their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   But it was when their eyes opened that the piglets were, to my
eyes, really there.
</P>
<P>
   Two kinds of eyes rule in the animal kingdom: directional eyes,
which only sense light and belong to worms and other bitty
creatures, and image-forming eyes, found in certain mollusks,
bivalves, most arthropods and nearly all vertebrates.
</P>
<P>
   The giant squid, a cephalopod, has image-forming peepers bigger
than basketballs.
</P>
<P>
   How eyeballs sit in an animal's head is also important. The
Philippine tarsier, a nocturnal monkey, has eyes so big they don't
move at all in their sockets. Like an owl, it'll turn its whole
head to look around.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, a chameleon, with eyes on stalks, can hold its
head still and swivel those peepers around like periscopes.
</P>
<P>
   The whole business of color vision is murky and controversial.
The human retina has 125 million thin, straight rods that see in
black and white, and 7 million fat little cones that examine colors
in bright light.
</P>
<P>
   Primates have pretty good color vision. Dogs and cats so-so.
Bees can see a color past violet that we cannot see, but they can't
see red. Ants can't see red either. Hummingbirds like red best. And
prairie dogs have some color vision but can't tell red from green.
</P>
<P>
   What color vision means to animals is tricky science, because
while we can examine the comparative anatomy of eyes, it's much
more complicated to determine how an individual species' central
nervous system and brain interpret what the eye sees.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that Homo sapiens are the only creatures that
find it necessary to stand around the paint sample section of a
paint store for two hours on a Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   I'd give the award for most versatile eyes to the oak toad,
which, as it swallows, moves its eyeballs back into the roof of its
mouth to help push food down its throat.
</P>
<P>
   The most useful adaptation goes to the burrowing mole skink,
which has a little picture window in its eyelid so it can look
around without opening its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The shark protects its eyes during an attack by rolling them
back in its head. The horned toad, when threatened, can squirt
blood from its eyes into an enemy's face.
</P>
<P>
   The worst eyesight for a large animal probably belongs to the
rhinoceros. From 15 feet it can't tell a man from a tree, and will
charge big rocks. To see how a rhino sees, squint until your
eyelashes are woven together.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, compared with the possum that lives under the front
porch of my house in Washington, D.C., the rhino could probably
read the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   During mornings on my ``city farm,'' I often breakfast with a
squirrel. It has eyes on the sides of its head like all prey
animals and sits on the air conditioner and stares at me, sideways
with one big eye, until I put out some peanuts. If I'm slow, it
stares harder to catch my eye.
</P>
<P>
   World-renowned photographer James Balog has made an art of
catching the eyes of wild animals. In his recently released book,
``Animal,'' Balog writes, ``Animals are whole unto themselves,
completely poised in an existence bequeathed by 5 billion years of
evolutionary rhythm, their minds and spirits focused. To look into
the eyes of many animals, particularly the big ones like bear and
elephant, is to sense a degree of calm and certainty rarely felt in
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Balog believes that his stylized portraiture yielded an enormous
dividend: ``It led me into the secret labyrinth of the animal mind,
revealing that intangible yet unmistakable force called
consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd rather walk on glass than address the scientific debate on
animal consciousness. I only know that if you grow up among and
around all kinds of animals, as little farm girls do, you believe
that you can tell what animals are thinking when you look at them
and they look at you.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a girl, I shot a ruby-crowned kinglet with a BB gun.
It died in my hand. Its eyes died last.
</P>
<P>
   I never shot a gun again. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It is morning on my sister's Illinois farm. My eyes open and I
am surrounded by other eyes. Three people, one dog, four cats.
</P>
<P>
   We all have predator's eyes _ forward facing with binocular
vision _ and move to the kitchen, where breakfast is prey.
</P>
<P>
   We humans, with our very color-sensitive eyes, are searching the
cupboard. The Folger's coffee jar is bright red so we can find it
fast. The little collie mix's round pupils are searching out
breakfast, too, by following the human motions. It can see yellow
and blue but can't tell red from green.
</P>
<P>
   The barn cats slink along the counter. Their vertical pupils,
constricted ovals in the daylight, scan a 287-degree field of
vision for the kill. It comes when the opener pierces the little
round can.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the Angus cattle are so black it is hard to see that
they even have eyes. And the tiny goats have amber eyes with
horizontal pupils set on the sides of their heads. This lets them
see what's coming around their flanks. They are, in the natural
world, prey.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the American toad, Bufo americanis, which will
eventually turn up by the pump. It'll hunt crawlies. But you'd have
to be an arcane-knowledge freak to know that humans need eight to
10 times more light than a toad does to see a worm at night,
according to studies done at the University of Helsinki. Or that
the red-tailed hawk that lives on the power-line tower can, on a
clear day, see a rabbit a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   We humans are innately cued to study one another's eyes. Dilated
pupils can mean the person you're looking at really likes you. Or
it can mean you're standing in the dark. Beady little eyes equal
distaste or disdain. Or the sun is behind you.
</P>
<P>
   We are also wired to adore and protect any face with what the
Germans call kinderschema _ the flat faces, snub noses and big eyes
of a human infant.
</P>
<P>
   A baby's eyes take up about a third of its entire face. In
adults, eyes take up about a fifth. In fact, we're born with nearly
adult-sized eyes. Our faces grow up around them.
</P>
<P>
   Kinderschema is the appeal of that puppy in the window or the
kitten your kid brings home. Big eyes reach out.
</P>
<P>
   At an animal shelter a light-colored animal, peering out with
big, dark eyes, will usually find a home before the black one,
whose eyes, like those of the Angus, disappear into the body.
</P>
<P>
   My fascination with animal eyes goes back to February nights in
the 1950s, when I, the older daughter of a father with no sons,
would stand in the barn and help midwife piglets into the world. I
rubbed them down, got the stuff out of their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   But it was when their eyes opened that the piglets were, to my
eyes, really there.
</P>
<P>
   Two kinds of eyes rule in the animal kingdom: directional eyes,
which only sense light and belong to worms and other bitty
creatures, and image-forming eyes, found in certain mollusks,
bivalves, most arthropods and nearly all vertebrates.
</P>
<P>
   The giant squid, a cephalopod, has image-forming peepers bigger
than basketballs.
</P>
<P>
   How eyeballs sit in an animal's head is also important. The
Philippine tarsier, a nocturnal monkey, has eyes so big they don't
move at all in their sockets. Like an owl, it'll turn its whole
head to look around.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, a chameleon, with eyes on stalks, can hold its
head still and swivel those peepers around like periscopes.
</P>
<P>
   The whole business of color vision is murky and controversial.
The human retina has 125 million thin, straight rods that see in
black and white, and 7 million fat little cones that examine colors
in bright light.
</P>
<P>
   Primates have pretty good color vision. Dogs and cats so-so.
Bees can see a color past violet that we cannot see, but they can't
see red. Ants can't see red either. Hummingbirds like red best. And
prairie dogs have some color vision but can't tell red from green.
</P>
<P>
   What color vision means to animals is tricky science, because
while we can examine the comparative anatomy of eyes, it's much
more complicated to determine how an individual species' central
nervous system and brain interpret what the eye sees.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that Homo sapiens are the only creatures that
find it necessary to stand around the paint sample section of a
paint store for two hours on a Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   I'd give the award for most versatile eyes to the oak toad,
which, as it swallows, moves its eyeballs back into the roof of its
mouth to help push food down its throat.
</P>
<P>
   The most useful adaptation goes to the burrowing mole skink,
which has a little picture window in its eyelid so it can look
around without opening its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The shark protects its eyes during an attack by rolling them
back in its head. The horned toad, when threatened, can squirt
blood from its eyes into an enemy's face.
</P>
<P>
   The worst eyesight for a large animal probably belongs to the
rhinoceros. From 15 feet it can't tell a man from a tree, and will
charge big rocks. To see how a rhino sees, squint until your
eyelashes are woven together.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, compared with the possum that lives under the front
porch of my house in Washington, D.C., the rhino could probably
read the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   During mornings on my ``city farm,'' I often breakfast with a
squirrel. It has eyes on the sides of its head like all prey
animals and sits on the air conditioner and stares at me, sideways
with one big eye, until I put out some peanuts. If I'm slow, it
stares harder to catch my eye.
</P>
<P>
   World-renowned photographer James Balog has made an art of
catching the eyes of wild animals. In his recently released book,
``Animal,'' Balog writes, ``Animals are whole unto themselves,
completely poised in an existence bequeathed by 5 billion years of
evolutionary rhythm, their minds and spirits focused. To look into
the eyes of many animals, particularly the big ones like bear and
elephant, is to sense a degree of calm and certainty rarely felt in
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Balog believes that his stylized portraiture yielded an enormous
dividend: ``It led me into the secret labyrinth of the animal mind,
revealing that intangible yet unmistakable force called
consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd rather walk on glass than address the scientific debate on
animal consciousness. I only know that if you grow up among and
around all kinds of animals, as little farm girls do, you believe
that you can tell what animals are thinking when you look at them
and they look at you.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a girl, I shot a ruby-crowned kinglet with a BB gun.
It died in my hand. Its eyes died last.
</P>
<P>
   I never shot a gun again. &QL;

<P>
   When Robert Kung lays his heart on the table, waiters come to
chat about it and his coffee is on the house.
</P>
<P>
   Kung's manmade heart is slightly bigger than a real one, and it
looks like a fat hamburger with legs: a titanium patty in a hard
plastic bun.
</P>
<P>
   A normal heart beats 70 to 80 times a minute until a person
reaches age 70 or older. But Kung, research director at a company
called Abiomed, will be happy if someone gets about five years out
of his device.
</P>
<P>
   It sits gleaming in the center of the table now, clearly
artificial, and yet its oddly angled legs _ made of Dacron _ give
it the lumpy look of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that actually the heart itself?'' a waiter asks.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment he seems to think it's real.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Kung's artificial heart will become very real indeed to a
human patient. It has already kept calves alive, and it is now
undergoing final tests in Abiomed's lab in Danvers, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   At Penn State's College of Medicine in Hershey, Penn., a second
version of an artificial heart is at about the same stage of
development. Alan Snyder, a bioengineer at Penn State, has worked
on that device since 1976, and his coworkers have been at it since
1971.
</P>
<P>
   But artificial hearts of various sorts have been around since
the 1950s. The most famous of them, the Jarvik-7, was implanted in
a patient named Barney Clark in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, and then a second man, William Schroeder, died lingering
deaths, tethered to air compressors and visited by repeated
infections and strokes. No one has performed a complete heart
replacement since.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the human heart so hard for researchers to imitate?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one very simple problem,'' says Steven Vogel, a
biomechanic at Duke University and author of a book on the
circulatory system called ``Vital Circuits.'' ``Muscle is a soft,
wet, contractile engine, and that's just unlike anything in our
technological armamentarium.''
</P>
<P>
   A natural heart consists of two pumps, each made of two
chambers. The right atrium squirts oxygen-depleted blood from the
body into the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs. The
left atrium squirts aerated blood from the lungs into the left
ventricle, which pumps it out to the body.
</P>
<P>
   With each heartbeat, the two small atria contract together, then
the two large ventricles, making the heart go ba-BUM.
</P>
<P>
   Kung's and Snyder's hearts will leave the patient's atria in
place (they're usually not the problem) and just replace the
ventricles.
</P>
<P>
   Kung's and Snyder's artificial hearts have two ventricles, just
like the real thing, but there the similarity ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the natural heart, you're using muscle as a container,''
Snyder says, ``and the container pumps on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing how to build a self-contracting container, he and
Kung had to sandwich a separate engine between the two ventricles.
The engine pushes against the inside wall of each ventricle _
they're made of a flexible polyurethane _ squeezing blood out of
the heart and into the arteries.
</P>
<P>
   In the Penn State heart, a battery-powered motor drives a piston
that moves back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   In the Abiomed heart, the motor drives a fan blade that sits
immersed in a hydraulic fluid; a rotary valve shoots the fluid
alternately left and right.
</P>
<P>
   Both artificial hearts seem to work, at least in calves. (The
calf studies lasted a few months _ after which the animals outgrew
their hearts _ but researchers found no signs of rejection and few
problems with infection.)
</P>
<P>
   And both look to be enormous improvements over the Jarvik-7. The
recipient won't be chained to cumbersome equipment, because the
control system and even the working battery will be small enough to
implant in a patient's abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of infection, nothing will penetrate the
patient's skin after the initial surgery. The battery will be
recharged continuously by radio waves from a larger, rechargeable
battery pack patients will wear in a harness.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the dream, at least. But artificial hearts still fall
far short of their living models, and no one knows that better than
their designers.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that impresses Kung most about the natural heart is
its ability to pump a little or a lot of blood, as the occasion
requires. A resting heart pumps out five liters of blood (about as
much as a typical human body contains) every minute. But exercise
boosts the output dramatically. A typical athlete's heart churns
out from 25 to 30 liters per minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Abiomed heart can pump more than 10 liters per minute _
plenty for most activities but not enough for others. You will be
able to have sex, for instance, but not a very athletic kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly won't be able to play squash,'' Kung says.
</P>
<P>
   But an artificial heart won't suddenly fail if you ask too much
of it. You just won't be able to execute the desired motion. And
you won't be able to work your way up to it, either.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas a living heart, like any muscle, gets stronger over time
if you exercise it, an artificial heart will never be stronger than
on the day it was implanted, precisely because it is not alive.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an artificial heart needs to be as inert as possible to
prevent blood clots _ which, after migrating from the Jarvik heart,
caused the strokes partly responsible for killing Clark and
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Clots are Kung's and Snyder's biggest worry. They've tried to
minimize the danger in two ways. First, they've designed their
hearts' ventricles so that blood flows through them in a swirling
vortex, without forming stagnant pools that would encourage it to
clot.
</P>
<P>
   Second, they've coated every surface the blood will touch with
their special polyurethane, which sheds blood cells and platelets
the way Teflon sheds grease.
</P>
<P>
   A living heart has a more vigorous strategy for preventing
clots, sending out chemical signals that stop them from forming.
And like other tissues, the heart extracts fuel and nutrients from
the blood and uses them to rebuild itself continuously.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think the heart is the same year to year,'' Vogel says.
``In fact, it has a half-life of less than a year, in terms of
replacing its molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Such feats are still beyond the dreams of engineers. A
self-repairing pump sustained by the fluid it circulates and
capable of strengthening over time to meet demand, your heart is an
extraordinary kind of pump _ one with a normal service life that no
artificial heart has even approached.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the only hope for people with severe afflictions
are transplants _ and there are not nearly enough donor hearts to
go around. So the demand for Kung's and Snyder's contraptions
promises to remain high. &QL;

   Someday soon, Connie Nielsen could be as big a star in New York
City, where she's been living for the past two years, as she is in
Elling, the small, small town in northern Denmark that the actress
left at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``all the way up there in gloom-and-doom country,''
Nielsen says, where she first performed in her mother's traditional
on-stage Danish review and variety show before continuing on to
Paris and Rome in pursuit of bigger and better roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so small it's not even on the map,'' she says of her old
hometown. ``There's not a lot going on there, but I got nature and
freedom _ and time to think.''
</P>
<P>
   If they were wowed by her past performances, just wait' til the
citizens of Elling get a load of Nielsen in two of her biggest
roles yet: she'll appear in ``Mission to Mars'' as an astronaut
along with Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins, and she stars in Ridley
Scott's epic ``Gladiator'' opposite Russell Crow and Joaquin
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen would be hard to miss in any crowd, but especially in
these ensembles _ she's the girl.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the first time that the actress has proven she can
hold her own in a macho movie. She camped it up as a temptress in
``The Devil's Advocate'' with Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves, played an
intergalactic babe opposite Kurt Russell in ``Soldier'' and buddied
up to Ben Stiller as a twisted German junkie in ``Permanent
Midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pure chance that I always end up being the girl with a
lot of guys around,'' she insists. ``It's not worth theorizing
about _ it's just like that. I try to look beyond the fact that
they are men and I'm a woman. I think that I'm part of an ensemble
and these are my co-workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen applies the same logic to her role in ``Mars.'' While
others might describe that character as a strong woman, ``I tend
not to look at it like that,'' she says. ``I look at the character
like a human being who has this kind of background with these kinds
of tasks in front of her.''
</P>
<P>
   During the filming of ``Gladiator,'' however, evenhandedness had
its limit. Nielsen won't be showing off any Zena-style moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't the one with the sword. I was the one scheming behind
the scenes and doing a lot of corridor-walking,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She may not have been battling barbarians on the film's
mega-sets, but working those period costumes did require a certain
athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trailing 12 meters of silk along behind me and trying
not to trip on it,'' she explains. ``It was part of the reason why
I cut off all my hair. When the next role came up, I said
`Astronaut? Sounds great!'''
</P>
<P>
   Little did Nielsen know that she'd be trading in that old corset
and train for a cumbersome 70-pound space suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was figuring on a T-shirt-and-pants sort of movie with short
hair and no makeup,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That's just how the actress is dressed when she turns up for her
interview, and how she plans to attire herself after all the press
junkets and premieres are finished, when she can hang out with her
10-year-old son. She'll even pay a visit to Elling.
</P>
<P>
   After filming two huge movies in one year, Nielsen is also
hoping to scale things down a hit on-screen, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to do something intimate,'' she says. ``After the
huge canvasses of space and the Roman Empire, I'd like to do
something personal. I'm going to take my time.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's safe to say that Nielsen won't stay away from the set
too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your body is loose, but there's this tight energy, this
electrical thing that's inside you,'' she says of acting in
productions both big and small. ``It's always a rush.'' &QL;

   EXECUTION-TEXAS (Austin, Texas) _ Anti-death activists are
appealing to presidential front-runner George W. Bush to spare
Betty Lou Beets, who will become the second woman to be executed in
modern times Thursday in Texas. Beets was convicted of murdering
her husband and was suspected of killing a previous husband. By

<P>
   DAVIDIAN-TESTIMONY (San Antonio) _ Derek Lovelock, a member of
the Branch Davidians who was present at the 1993 U.S. raid on the
sect's compound near Waco, Texas, was back in the United States
last week for a Houston interview with attorneys for special
counsel John Danforth, who is investigating the Waco events for the
Justice Department. By DICK J. REAVIS.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN-GOOKS (San Francisco)_ Long before he unapologetically
used the word ``gooks`` to describe his Vietnamese torturers, war
hero and presidential contender John McCain had uttered several
eyebrow-raising phrases. When he first ran for Congress in the
early 1980s, he referred to the senior community of Leisure World
as ``Seizure World.`` By MARSHA GINSBURG.

<P>
   EARLY-AMERICANS (Washington) _ The long-held view that the first
Americans arrived via land bridge from northern Asia 11,500 years
ago and quickly spread throughout the New World is giving way to
mounting evidence that migration instead came in multiple waves
beginning as long as 20,000 years ago. By ULYSSES TORASSA.
</P>
<P>
   BIG-FOOT (Conroe, Texas) _ Jimmy Chilcutt, a fingerprint
specialist for the Conroe Police Department near Houston, has
developed techniques for lifting prints that are used by the FBI
and other law-enforcement agencies. He also has one of the few
archives of non-human, primate prints. His special expertise in
primate prints led him to examine casts of Big Foot footprints and
conclude that there is some sort of unexplained animal roaming
through U.S. forests. By HARVEY RICE (Photo available on NYT

   AMERICAN-MATADOR (Reynosa, Mexico) _ El Texano, the only gringo
ever to be confirmed as a matador in Mexico, retired here last
weekend after dedicating his last bull to his father and taking
home its ear. David Renk, 37, a McAllen, Texas, resident who has
spent the past two decades of his life fighting bulls, gave his
final performance as a professional matador to the strains of
``Golondrinas,'' the farewell song, in front of a crowd of about
500 in the Plaza Monumental de Toros. By ALISON GREGOR.

   PERU-FUJIMORI (Lima, Peru) _ Peru's democracy has been weakened
under Alberto Fujimori's 10-year rule, according to many analysts,
who say the president has a huge, unfair advantage in his
constitutionally dubious bid for a third term. By JOHN OTIS.
</P>
<P>
   PERU-SLUMS (Villa El Salvador, Peru) _ Government-sponsored
communal kitchens and day-care centers operating in the slums are
responsible for much of President Alberto Fujimori's popularity
among Peru's poor. Critics accuse the president of buying votes and
say the centers aren't part of a sustainable anti-poverty program.

come true. By MATT BEER.

   SILICON-VALLEY-HOMES(Menlo Park, Calif.) _ The cars slow on
quiet Cloud Avenue so the occupants can roll down the window and
point. Undeterred by relentless rain, the drivers of a Mercedes,
then a Volvo pull to the curb. The object of their rubbernecking?
Not a crime scene or a fire. The focus of attention is an
unassuming four-bedroom house that inspired a 22-way bidding war
recently. The winner reportedly paid close to a million more than
the $1.25 million asking price. By KATHERINE SELIGMAN.
</P>
<P>
   SILICON-VALLEY-POLITICS (San Francisco) _ Silicon Valley isn't
shy anymore about its political agenda. It favors free trade with
China, looser accounting standards, an unlimited supply of
immigrant workers and a ban on Internet taxation. For the most
part, this year's leading presidential candidates have no problem
with those demands. In fact, they're working hard to make one or
more of those proposals a key part of their platforms. By ALAN T.
SARACEVIC.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Growing and exhibiting plants dates back to
ancient times, but it was the Romans who first dedicated structures
to shield their plants from the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans used orangeries _ glass conservatories _ in the 16th
century to protect plants and fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we have greenhouses. But if you don't have a lot of space
to start your plant or vegetable seedlings and cuttings, try a
glass bell jar or cloche (from the French word for bell).
</P>
<P>
   Bell jars shield seedlings during the frosty cooler spring
months, while allowing light to filter through.
</P>
<P>
   They are also a good way to grow warm-weather vegetables in cold
gardens or to harden off plants prior to setting them out.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners have long known that crops raised under glass mature
sooner than those left unprotected. Prior to bell jars, British
plantsmen used broken bottles to nurture seedlings, according to
the Country Living Gardener magazine. Today, a cloche is a term for
anything that is used to protect plants, from empty milk cartons to
a lead glass box. They are wedged open at the bottom for air
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The French constructed cloches from a solid piece of clear or
green glass. Some were large enough to protect two plants at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   These handsome individual domed greenhouses come in a variety of
antique shapes and more contemporary styles.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden bases, with a groove, can also be found for many of the
domes. The groove keeps the bell jar from sliding off the base and
helps to seal out dust.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for bell jars start at $29.99 and go up to hundreds of
dollars for a vintage cloche.
</P>
<P>
   When not being used for growing purposes, bell jars can be
decorative accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorians used them to keep dust off small figurines, dried
floral arrangements or nature studies of birds and other small
critters.
</P>
<P>
   Antique bell jars have also been converted into chandeliers,
sconces and lamps.

&HT;     WELCOME BACK, DAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Letterman is back and I couldn't be happier. Not like,
``Hey, great, Letterman's back.'' But giddy happy. Proud happy. And
this from somebody who usually has the cranky pants pulled on
pretty tight.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman was one of the first people who taught me, indirectly,
how stupid television really is, and how fun it can be once you
realize that and then exploit it. Long before I had any intention
of being the mockery of all my friends and family by reviewing
television for a living, I started watching ``The David Letterman
Show'' on NBC. That was 1980. Still in high school. Kind of
watching TV without understanding it. Then, this skinny guy popped
up on daytime television, probably when I was cutting class, and it
was the best lesson in irony, sarcasm and skewering pop-culture
that anyone could ever get.
</P>
<P>
   The show lasted four months and was akin to the Hindenburg.
</P>
<P>
   But, Lord that was funny stuff. It made absolutely no sense. And
it clearly sent all the daytime viewers scrambling for
alternatives. Soaps, game shows. Anything to get away from that
weird gap-toothed guy who was talking to the audience and acting in
a way that made his show seem like it was produced for eight bucks
and held together by gum and pipe dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, made it glorious viewing. And then there was
Edwin Newman, the most serious news man around, finally getting in
on the spirit of things after a couple of months and loosening up.
I miss Edwin Newman more than any other dead TV journalist
anywhere, and it's all because of Letterman's first show.
</P>
<P>
   All the hallmarks of Letterman's shtick were just coming to
light then. Talking to the audience. Getting them to do things that
made them uncomfortable _ which was riveting. And generally doing
cheap, dumb things that you could never see anywhere else at the
time. Maybe Letterman remembers it differently, but that was a
fascinating four months. Only Bugs Bunny cartoons were as cool at
that point. And that was kids stuff. Letterman's show was kind of
like anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, when ``Late Night With David Letterman'' began,
it was like finding out that other people actually listened to your
tiny little cult band. A late-night show with that Letterman guy?
You mean somebody else was watching and appreciated the whole
shtick? Of course, a good many people were already smitten by
Letterman and soon the entire country would begin to get a glimpse
of why he's now a legend.
</P>
<P>
   College kids really helped launch Letterman. They were the
target audience, and they were ready for his ludicrous, snide
approach, his belief that anybody could host a show with almost no
effort, and they loved the essential element of Letterman's
approach: That purposefully being unfunny was funny. That sending
up television was great art. That goofing on people and not taking
anything serious was the best way to host a show.
</P>
<P>
   I loved every minute of it. And I still do. Because I remember
when watching Letterman was as important as watching ``Twin Peaks''
or ``The Sopranos.'' You couldn't miss it. And man, if you got one
of those T-shirts _ that was like Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, by that time I was understanding just how
revolutionary Letterman's show was, even while it was winking at
and paying tribute to some of his own late-night heroes and
influences. But what Letterman did to late-night television was
make it essential. He took Johnny Carson a step further, by
deconstructing the genre, and his show became _ along with
``Saturday Night Live'' before it _ one of the defining elements of
late-night television history.
</P>
<P>
   There's no one like Letterman. No one as good. Neither Jay Leno
nor Conan O'Brien has ever been as funny or as innovative as
Letterman. Ever.

MICHAEL DOUGLAS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS IN `WONDER BOYS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Curtis Hanson's quirky new movie, ``The Wonder Boys,'' suffers
from some of the same problems that afflict its main character, a
college professor undergoing a prolonged crisis of confidence. Like
this man, Grady Tripp, ``Wonder Boys'' is often aimless and
uncertain, not to mention fanciful in a rather forced fashion.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the movie _ and Grady _ bearable and ultimately
worthwhile is an expert performance from Michael Douglas, a gifted
comic actor who has rarely been afforded the opportunity to play a
likably loose character whose hair isn't always exactly in place.
The movie has other merits, too _ cinematographer Dante Spinotti's
work being chief among them _ but this really is Douglas' showcase,
and he puts on a teacher's clinic in acting.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas' Grady is a man watching his life unravel before his
eyes. One morning, his wife packs her bags and leaves him. Later
that evening, his lover Sara (Frances McDormand), the chancellor of
the Pittsburgh college where Grady teaches creative writing,
reveals that she's pregnant. To top it off, Sara is married to the
head of Grady's department, a Joe DiMaggio fanatic named Walter
(Richard Thomas).
</P>
<P>
   More complications: Grady's amoral book editor (Robert Downey
Jr. in an interesting bit of casting) has arrived from New York,
wanting to see the follow-up to the masterpiece that Grady wrote
seven years ago. It's not that Grady hasn't written anything. The
problem is he can't !ital!stop writing. The novel is at 1,200 pages
and counting.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all these dominoes falling, we're still not sure if
Grady's going to break out of his pot-induced haze and make some
hard choices. But when one of his best students, the devilishly
dour James Leer (Tobey Maguire), hooks up with Grady at a literary
party, events happen that force Grady's hand and threaten to end
his extended adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Grady's losing battle with past acclaim may certainly resonate
with director Hanson, who last directed the universally praised
``L.A. Confidential.'' With this offbeat follow-up, Hanson seems to
be trying a little too hard to soften expectations. To his credit,
he demonstrates a previously untapped capacity for rueful comedy,
even if he often relies on running jokes that grow a bit tired upon
repetition. You can only beat a dead horse so many times.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Steve Kloves (``The Fabulous Baker Boys'') does a
fine job in transferring the humanity of Michael Chabon's novel to
the screen, but one central problem remains. In frequent
voice-overs, Grady stresses the importance of his relationship with
Sara, yet their union is so underdeveloped that it's almost an
afterthought. McDormand pops up every 15 minutes or so, apparently
just to remind you that she's still in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   This flaw isn't fatal; the leisurely paced ``Wonder Boys'' has
too many subplots for that to happen. But it does render its
denouement a little less than wonderful. &QL;

PALEY, DICKINSON COLLECTIONS REFLECT TWO POETIC EVOLUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN MARK EBERHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Poems of Emily Dickinson, edited by R.W. Franklin (692
pages; The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; $29.95)
Begin Again: Collected Poems, by Grace Paley (178 pages; Farrar,
Straus and Giroux; $23)
</P>
<P>
   Movies are made, paintings finished, novels completed. Then they
make their way into the world to be watched, seen, read.
</P>
<P>
   Poetry, though ... poetry evolves. A single poem can take on
many forms. This was true even of the Romantics, who claimed their
work was more inspiration than perspiration. Samuel Taylor
Coleridge constructed seven versions of ``The Rime of the Ancient
Mariner.'' William Wordsworth revised The Prelude for 50 years.
John Keats asserted that if poetry did not come like the leaves to
the tree, ``it had better not come at all'' _ and yet he labored
over his verse.
</P>
<P>
   Two newly issued collections of poetry by female writes, one
living and one dead but both of whom have long inhabited the
literary canon, prove once again that versifiers must continually
be perused, analyzed, re-evaluated _ just as they must constantly
reinvent themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the more surprising of these volumes is R.W. Franklin's
edition of The Poems of Emily Dickinson. One would think that the
work of a poet who died in 1886 would be sufficiently codified by
now. But a century of readers' encounters with Dickinson have been
strangely vexing. Many have come to her through anthologies that
present only a fraction of her work. Others have sought out
complete editions, but the more academically inclined of those
volumes have presented multiple versions of each poem.
</P>
<P>
   Such a thing is fine for scholars, but readers have needed
exactly what Franklin has now provided: a comprehensive edition of
1,789 poems, with only a single version of each. And Franklin has
preserved Dickinson's oddities of spelling, punctuation and
capitalization, which allows readers to experience the artistry of
a fine writer but a true eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dickinson can still be intimidating. How can that not be so,
of a woman who in one year of her life wrote nearly as many poems
as there were days in the calendar? The critic Harold Bloom, in The
Western Canon, correctly tagged Dickinson as one of the brainiest
of all poets; sometimes her verses, while powerfully felt, take
strangely cerebral and oblique turns, even as her language deceives
with its simplicity:
</P>
<P>
   When it comes, the Landscape listens _
</P>
<P>
   Shadows _ hold their breath _
</P>
<P>
   When it goes, 'tis like the Distance
</P>
<P>
   On the look of Death
</P>
<P>
   And Dickinson didn't care for titles. The Dickinson lover is
left to search, half-remembering those famous first lines: ``I like
a look of Agony'' ... ``A death blow is a life blow to some'' ...
``I died for beauty but was scarce//Adjusted in the tomb ...''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin does what he can: He provides a complete index of first
lines. Readers of Dickinson, though, still must be diligent and
devoted, giving more time to the object of their affection than
most other poetry readers are probably wont to do. Perhaps that is
as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Paley is high-maintenance, too. Like Dickinson's, her
poetry does not offer the ``easy read''; her subject matter can be
rather severe. Both Dickinson and Paley, for example, fixate on
death. Paley's Begin Again: Collected Poems, repeats and repeats
the motif of a watery demise, as in ``Drowning (II)'':
</P>
<P>
   This is how come I am drowned:
</P>
<P>
   First the sun shone on me
</P>
<P>
   Then the wind blew over me
</P>
<P>
   Then the sand polished me
</P>
<P>
   Then the sea touched me
</P>
<P>
   Then the tide came
</P>
<P>
   Again like Dickinson, Paley is blessed with an almost childlike
gift for language, but simple does not equal simplistic. ``Drowning
(II)'' is composed entirely of monosyllables except for
``polished,'' and yet it conveys, in six unadorned lines, the
great, human circle of life and death _ death physical, yes, but
also death metaphorical.
</P>
<P>
   In Paley's universe, death, real or imagined, is not really a
thing to be abhorred. Dickinson may get downright jolly about the
subject at times; Paley's tone toward the inevitable is more one of
quiet resignation. ``I wanted//to say last words,'' she writes in
``For My Daughter.'' ``... I wanted to say them now//in case I am
in//calm sleep when the last sleep strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a not-unexpected sentiment from a writer like Paley, who
always seems concerned with how her words are being constructed and
received. Begin Again, in fact, contains selections from her
previous volumes of poetry as well as new material.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Poem About Storytelling,'' Paley's narrator worries about
the ``listeners'' who are there _ or not there _ to hear the tales.
``What if they're all dead or//deadened by grief or in prison?''
she asks. ``Then there's no way out of it,'' for the artist, Paley
writes. ``She will listen//It's her work. She will be the
listener//in the story of the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Paley needn't worry, but it's nice she cares so much. ``A Poem
About Storytelling'' is not only an excellent piece of metafiction,
but also a shrewdly constructed meditation on the price of having
passion _ for life, or work or whatever one may hold dear. With
such work at hand, Paley can be sure she will never lack for
``listeners.'' Who else among modern poets can compare with
Dickinson, if not in sheer mass of work then at least in austere
elegance of diction and complexity of thought?
</P>
<P>
   These two collections show that the poets we think we know can
always have something else to tell us, if we only pay attention.
More than any other art form, poetry is not simply the craft of
invention but of re-invention.

MICHAEL DOUGLAS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS IN `WONDER BOYS'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Curtis Hanson's quirky new movie, ``The Wonder Boys,'' suffers
from some of the same problems that afflict its main character, a
college professor undergoing a prolonged crisis of confidence. Like
this man, Grady Tripp, ``Wonder Boys'' is often aimless and
uncertain, not to mention fanciful in a rather forced fashion.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the movie _ and Grady _ bearable and ultimately
worthwhile is an expert performance from Michael Douglas, a gifted
comic actor who has rarely been afforded the opportunity to play a
likably loose character whose hair isn't always exactly in place.
The movie has other merits, too _ cinematographer Dante Spinotti's
work being chief among them _ but this really is Douglas' showcase,
and he puts on a teacher's clinic in acting.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas' Grady is a man watching his life unravel before his
eyes. One morning, his wife packs her bags and leaves him. Later
that evening, his lover Sara (Frances McDormand), the chancellor of
the Pittsburgh college where Grady teaches creative writing,
reveals that she's pregnant. To top it off, Sara is married to the
head of Grady's department, a Joe DiMaggio fanatic named Walter
(Richard Thomas).
</P>
<P>
   More complications: Grady's amoral book editor (Robert Downey
Jr. in an interesting bit of casting) has arrived from New York,
wanting to see the follow-up to the masterpiece that Grady wrote
seven years ago. It's not that Grady hasn't written anything. The
problem is he can't (BEGIN ITALICS)stop(END ITALICS) writing. The
novel is at 1,200 pages and counting.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all these dominoes falling, we're still not sure if
Grady's going to break out of his pot-induced haze and make some
hard choices. But when one of his best students, the devilishly
dour James Leer (Tobey Maguire), hooks up with Grady at a literary
party, events happen that force Grady's hand and threaten to end
his extended adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Grady's losing battle with past acclaim may certainly resonate
with director Hanson, who last directed the universally praised
``L.A. Confidential.'' With this offbeat follow-up, Hanson seems to
be trying a little too hard to soften expectations. To his credit,
he demonstrates a previously untapped capacity for rueful comedy,
even if he often relies on running jokes that grow a bit tired upon
repetition. You can only beat a dead horse so many times.

FRANKENHEIMER MAKES `REINDEER' WITH CARE, PASSION, GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gospel according to John Frankenheimer: ``You don't become a
better director by holding a lot of meetings. You do it on the
set.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer, 70, is a no-nonsense, old-school director who's
been doing it on the set for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City recently to talk up his new movie, the thriller
``Reindeer Games,'' Frankenheimer said he was inspired to go into
show business when in the late 1940s he saw an intense young Marlon
Brando on the Broadway stage in ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That experience changed my life more than anything else,''
Frankenheimer said on a visit to The Star. ``I was a 17-year-old,
undecided, searching for what to do with my life. After seeing
Brando, I realized I wanted to be part of something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer started out as an actor but found he didn't have
what it took to deal with the insecurities of that profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never comfortable as a performer _ I was always standing
outside myself, criticizing myself,'' he said. ``I couldn't make
the emotional connection between myself and the character. But it
turned out that I could help other people do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravitating toward directing, Frankenheimer cut his teeth on the
live television dramas of the 1950s, and with only his fourth film
_ ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' starring Frank Sinatra, Laurence
Harvey and Angela Lansbury _ created a funny//creepy political
satire that has taken its place as one of the great American
movies.
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected an acting role that most certainly would have
turned him into a household name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was approached by Cubby Broccoli, the producer of the Bond
films, and offered the part of James Bond before it went to Sean
Connery. I turned it down. I've spent a few nights thinking about
that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Frankenheimer's directing credits are respected pictures
as varied as the racing film ``Grand Prix''; a World War II drama
with Burt Lancaster, ``The Train''; an eerie Rock Hudson thriller,
``Seconds''; ``The Birdman of Alcatraz'' (with Lancaster again);
``Seven Days in May,'' a political suspense film (with Lancaster
and Kirk Douglas); ``The French Connection 2'' with Gene Hackman's
second tour as Popeye Doyle; and the noirish ``52 Pick-Up'' with
Roy Scheider and Ann-Margret.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early '90s Frankenheimer was considered something of
a Hollywood has-been. He fought back by directing a string of
made-for-cable movies _ ``Against the Wall'' (about the Attica
prison riot), ``Andersonville'' (set in the notorious Civil War
prison), ``The Burning Season'' (a Brazilian activist opposes the
destruction of the rain forest) and ``George Wallace'' _ that
earned him four Emmy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   He made it back to the big screen when he was asked in
mid-production to take over the ``The Island of Dr. Moreau''
(notorious for the overacting of Marlon Brando and the on-set
tantrums of co-star Val Kilmer). He moved on to the contemporary
spy drama ``Ronin'' with Robert De Niro, and now ``Reindeer
Games,'' a densely plotted crime thriller with Ben Affleck,
Charlize Theron and Gary Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent far-reaching conversation, Frankenheimer talked
about his career and his art.
</P>
<P>
   - During the 1950s Frankenheimer directed live TV dramas on such
long-running series as ``Playhouse 90,'' ``Studio One'' and ``You
Are There.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I learned about what I do I got out of live TV. In
the '50s I directed 152 live dramatic shows. It was an incredible
education in working with actors _ I had 152 different casts. I
also had 152 scripts, and I developed a tremendous respect for the
writer. To this day, when I'm making a film I want to have the
writer with me on the set. When I was shooting `Ronin' I was
constantly on the phone with David Mamet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to leave TV. I loved being a TV director. But
live television dramas just ended about 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first film was `The Young Stranger,' which I made in '56
and which was based on a live TV show I'd done. It was a dreadful
experience. It got great notices, but I found moviemaking to be
such a constipating experience, so slow and frustrating compared to
the freedom of live television.
</P>
<P>
   ``With live TV you had several cameras shooting simultaneously,
and that provided a special kind of fluidity, both in camera
movement and in editing. Television is where I developed my visual
technique of using a wide-angle lens and lots of deep focus. I like
everything in focus _ the entire frame has to be clear and sharp.
It's become part of what I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, until I started doing my cable movies a few years ago, I
was really uncomfortable working in color. My best movies up until
that time had been in black and white. Color, I think, can be very
distracting. Black and white is much more dramatic, it gives a
piece a greater sense of mood, a much more serious emotional
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was shooting `Andersonville' I remembered what John
Huston did with his `Moby Dick.' He shot in color, but in the lab
he desaturated those colors, making them less intense. I started
doing that, too, not only in the lab but with the sets and
costumes. I didn't want any bright red or green cars on the street.
The extras were costumed in earth tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you see, everything that I think is good about my work came
out of live TV. Including my work ethic. You had three weeks
rehearsal and you were on the air. No wasted time. It got you ready
to work with Sinatra.''
</P>
<P>
   - Frankenheimer describes himself as a story-first director and
says he's appalled at the number of movies in which it's clear the
director came up with visual ideas first and worried about plot and
character later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so wrong when the shot takes precedence, when form
takes over content. I can't stand it. Show-off directing calls
attention to itself. A good film should look seamless. Whatever I
do is to put the audience into the picture. Anything I do to take
them out of the picture _ to remind the that it's only a movie _
then I'm not doing my job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm especially frustrated with the way many directors now
shoot action scenes so that they don't make any sense. For an
action scene to satisfy you have to geographically know what you're
doing. You have to show where the characters are in relation to one
another and the location. The responsibility of a director is to
keep the audience oriented at all times. That's why I want
everything in focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's harder because you have to think ahead. You
have to make the picture on the set; you can't wait until you're in
the editing room. Again, it all goes back to live TV. We used to
come in and rehearse and block the scenes and by the time the cast
was ready to act in front of the cameras we had a pre-cut movie.
That's carried over into my films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing _ people ask why we don't have actors and stars
like Burt Lancaster or Lee Marvin any more. Well, Lancaster had
been a circus acrobat. Marvin had been a combat Marine. Charlie
Bronson was a coal miner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point is that those guys had led real lives before they got
into movies. So many actors today go only to the gym and to acting
class. That's it. Their entire lives are based only in references
to other movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Considered a ``name'' director throughout the '60s and into the
'70s, Frankenheimer struggled through much of the '80s and early
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a couple of movies that didn't knock 'em dead at box
office. And the phones stopped ringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I was sitting there at home and I thought, `OK, you can be
just another promising youth who faded away. The world is full of
those people. They'll say that Frankenheimer made ``The Manchurian
Candidate'' and never lived up to his potential after that.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Or you can suck it in, stop thinking about the good old
days, go out and find material you know you can do that doesn't
have lots of fingerprints all over it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out that HBO had a script about the Attica prison
revolt. I read it, I said yes, and it turned me right around. HBO
took a big chance on me. Some people thought I was too expensive,
that my best days were behind me. In Hollywood if you're over 45
you're yesterday's news.
</P>
<P>
   ``But making films for cable saved me, really reinvented my
career. I won four straight Emmys. And that gave me the clout to
land `The Island of Dr. Moreau' with Marlon Brando. Of course, the
moment I arrived on the set in Australia I realized I was grossly
underpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   - The darkly humorous, fast-moving ``Reindeer Games'' certainly
doesn't seem like the work of a 70-year-old man. Frankenheimer said
his style is always dictated by the material, not by what other
directors are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imitate another director. You do a movie because you
know you can. I thought `Reindeer Games' had a terrifically smart
script (by Ehren Kruger). I never saw any of the twists and turns
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is playful, but you can never wink at your audience.
It has to be totally realistic. I never betray the audience by
getting cute or illogical. Once you do that, you never get them
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you do this, the more you realize it's all about
passion, dedication and really caring. I've got to find something
that really matters to me.''

&HT;     PROFESSOR SEES A CONNECTION BETWEEN `SOUL,' SALE  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ What do the Volkswagen Beetle, Nike sneakers and
Body Shop soap have in common? According to a professor at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, they are all products that have
soul. Not in a Ray Charles or Aretha Franklin kind of way. Think
Plato. Think Aristotle.
</P>
<P>
   Think Buddha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not New Age. I'm not sackcloth,'' insists Jeffrey Durgee,
a professor of marketing at RPI. But he is fascinated by the
connection between soul and sale.
</P>
<P>
   In an article titled ``Soul Branding: Thoughts on How to Do
It,'' to appear in a forthcoming edition of the Design Management
Journal, Durgee argues that more and more businesses are learning
that soulfulness is ``experienced in terms of warm, meaningful
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen, for example, draws on '60s nostalgia for the
traditional ``Bug'' by introducing the new New Beetle with the
slogan, ``If you were really good in a past life, you come back as
something better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike claims its products come ``straight from the soul of
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Durgee reserves his highest praise for those companies that
actually walk the walk by giving back to their employees, the
community or the environment. He noted the Body Shop, which
advocates non-animal testing and recycling. Or Volvo, which is
developing a car it claims will actually clean the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can people buy goodness?'' he asked. ``In these cases, the
employees feel good, the consumers feel good and the marketers feel
good. So in a way, I think you can.''
</P>
<P>
   To tap into what makes a product ``soulful,'' Durgee conducted
studies with more than 40 people and asked them to page through a
photo album of products in search of meaning.
</P>
<P>
   What he found is that soulful products allow consumers to relive
the past, particularly cherished childhood memories. Out of a
selection of briefcases, for example, most of those surveyed picked
a weatherbeaten leather item that looked like it came out of the
Truman administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said it looked like it lived another life,'' Durgee
said.
</P>
<P>
   People also found soulfulness in items that appealed to nature
or got the consumer involved, like home-brewed beer.
</P>
<P>
   As a marketing rather than a philosophy professor, Durgee
withheld judgment on the morality of most so-called soulful
appeals. However, he expressed doubts about some appeal-to-nature
claims, like ``mountain grown'' coffee and ``stonewashed'' jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Durgee links deeper products with a more communitarian
philosophy, but acknowledged that certain items seem to buck the
trend. Pan pizza begat personal pan pizza. Live conversation is
being eclipsed by ``chats'' on personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in products that bring people together,'' he
said. ``I like the tandem bicycle instead of the regular one, and
the hot tub instead of the bathtub.''

LALO SCHIFRIN LIVES FOR MUSIC, NOT GRAMMYS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lalo Schifrin isn't surprised at the Latin explosion in popular
music: The Argentina-born composer has been breaking down musical
barriers himself for more than four decades. In fact, Schifrin's
longstanding practice of blending jazz and classical music with
Latin touches makes this year's Grammy favorite Carlos Santana look
like a newcomer and teen idol Ricky Martin look like ... well, a
mere teen idol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing of boundaries ... I think the Berlin Wall fell,''
said Schifrin, who's nominated for an instrumental arranging Grammy
this year for his ``Latin Jazz Suite.'' He's been nominated 20
times before and has won four. Two of those were for his extremely
popular theme and score for the 1960s TV show ``Mission:
Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office _ located in the guest house behind his
Beverly Hills manse _ Schifrin is surrounded by numerous awards and
dozens of pipes (``It's getting to be that a man can only smoke in
his own home,'' he sighs in his heavily accented but eloquent
English). ``Today, with the ways of communication that we have,''
added Schifrin, ``I think that the barriers are coming down fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Schifrin's world is full of juxtapositions of old and new. His
office is dark and European in feel; the only keyboard in sight is
a black Bosendorfer grand piano. ``I used to use electronic
keyboards more, but I'd find myself playing around all day ...
thinking, `Ah, listen to that sound!' so I got rid of most of
them,'' Schifrin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Schifrin's music remains vital and popular with younger
bands. His ``Mission: Impossible'' theme was redone once by U2 and
will be revamped again for ``Mission 2,'' possibly by Limp Bizkit.
Among the groups that have ``sampled'' Schifrin's music for new
songs are Britain's Portishead and the late rapper Big Pun.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of musical diversity is old news to Schifrin. He has
composed for Dizzy Gillespie, the Three Tenors and for soundtracks
featuring such tough guys as Bruce Lee (``Enter the Dragon''),
Clint Eastwood (``Dirty Harry'') and Steve McQueen (``Bullitt'').
One of his most recent projects is a series of concerts and CDs
titled ``Jazz Meets the Symphony,'' exploring the common ground
between jazz and ``serious'' music.
</P>
<P>
   The son of the concertmaster of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic,
Schifrin says his love of jazz rankled his father. ``My father used
to say, `If you can't read it or write it, it's not music.' He
couldn't understand the improvisation,'' recalled Schifrin. His
father also had other concerns: ``He was very concerned that I
would get playing jazz in nightclubs ... and nightclubs are
dangerous because, you know, the women of the night and the drugs
and the alcohol _ all the temptations,'' said Schifrin
matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never had those problems,'' Schifrin said with a slight
smile, ``because my only obsession, my only passion was music.''
</P>
<P>
   Schifrin's wife, Donna, might dispute that statement somewhat,
but she readily admits Schifrin lives to compose. ``Oh, he's a
complete workaholic,'' said Donna Schifrin, who's been married to
Lalo for 26 years (both had been married previously). Said Donna,
``It's not that he doesn't know how to relax; I think he's just
really lucky that he still has a lot he wants to say musically.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade or so, Donna has also taken on being her
husband's personal manager and president of their own record label,
Aleph Records. Aleph releases Schifrin's music and maintains a Web
site (www.schifrin.com) offering recordings, T-shirts and even
autographed photos of Schifrin.
</P>
<P>
   Schifrin himself says he's aware he has a lot of fans but tries
not to be distracted by adulation and awards from both record
buyers and his peers. ``I don't have time for that,'' said
Schifrin.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the Grammys and numerous other awards, such as the
Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres from the French minister
of culture ``very good ego stimulators ... but on the other hand,
they can be dangerous. I know some of my colleagues who started
sleeping on the laurels of their glory, looking back at the past
and stopped working because they had awards. ... I have to keep
going.'' &QL;

WOMAN NOT ONLY SURVIVED SHOOTING, BUT BETTERED HER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For weeks in the winter of 1992, Ann Whedon
lived with a feeling of impending doom.
</P>
<P>
   She took unusual routes to work. She parked blocks away.
Sometimes she wore a disguise.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't do any good. On a cold Thursday afternoon, the doom
enveloped her like a black cloud. After a sales meeting at the Silo
appliance store where she worked in Overland Park, Kan., she walked
to her truck. But when she opened the door, she saw a familiar pair
of brown cowboy boots in the back of the extended cab.
</P>
<P>
   It was Preston Collins, her former boyfriend. Weeks before, she
had left him, concerned about his increasingly irrational behavior.
Angry, he had kidnapped her at gunpoint. She escaped, and now he
was determined to exact his revenge.
</P>
<P>
   She screamed and ran. He ran faster.
</P>
<P>
   One hand squeezed her arm like a vise. The other brandished a
pistol-grip shotgun he had strapped to his body under an overcoat.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed the gun directly at her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going home now,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   Then he fired.
</P>
<P>
   The force of the blast caused the gun to kick and the shot to
miss. It broke two car windows and blew out the front window of a
nearby carpet shop.
</P>
<P>
   It also knocked her to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Although she carried a small gun herself, she didn't know how to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   He reloaded and leveled the gun for another blast.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified, she covered her face and rolled into a ball as he
fired again.
</P>
<P>
   This time the shoJ bound its mark. It blew her right hand off,
took the thumb from her left hand and put a hole the size of a fist
in the back of her left leg, shattering the bone. In addition, the
blast left buckshot embedded in her muscles that would prove
impossible to fully remove.
</P>
<P>
   Lying in a pool of her blood, fighting to stay awake, she made a
silent vow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let you kill me,'' she said. ``I'm not going
to die.''
</P>
<P>
   `Changed my outlook'
</P>
<P>
   In the eight years since the shooting, that resolve has served
her well. By all rights the attack should have killed her, or at
least ruined her life.
</P>
<P>
   It did neither.
</P>
<P>
   While Collins was convicted of attempted murder and is now in
prison, Whedon has prospered. And while she wishes the attack had
never happened, it might have been the best thing that ever
happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   Today she walks with a limp, has a silver hook for a right hand
and pain as her constant companion. But she also has a whole new
life that is in many ways better than the one before. Since the
attack, Whedon, 55, has earned her social work degree at the
University of Kansas and started a new job helping disabled
workers. She even fell in love and got married.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed my perspective, changed my outlook, changed my
whole life,'' she said of the shooting. ``It left me alone with
nothing. You end up with a whole new start whether you want it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't without difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Whedon spent three months in the hospital. Doctors gave her 50
pints of blood. The attack blew away her sciatic nerve and
destroyed the lymph nodes in her leg. She was even paralyzed for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, she has made the most of her new start.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the people in her classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Whedon is also now a teacher. But it's what she teaches
that often leaves people with their mouth hanging open. Every
Wednesday night the woman whose life was blown apart by an angry
boyfriend teaches batterers how to face up to, and conquer, their
anger control problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing story,'' said Johnson County District Attorney
Paul Morrison, who prosecuted Collins' case. ``She came out of (the
shooting) with a real good attitude. ... And now she has positively
affected the lives of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   William H. Reese, who administers the class Whedon teaches,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has survived and done some wondrous things,'' he said. ``I
am very, very, impressed by Ann's courage. She's a lesson for us
all on how to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Chris Whedon, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my hero,'' he said. ``She has shown herself to be one of
the more remarkable human beings for what  come through. And
I do know that she has been inspirational to other people. Just
appearing before those people in the battering class and being a
true physical specter of the outcome of jealously and rage, how can
you not be inspired by that and want to calm down and control
yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   To the people in her batterer's class, Whedon is more than a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's more like a mother to us,'' said Michael Woods, a
39-year-old Independence man who recently graduated from the
six-month court-mandated course. ``You can have any type of
problem. You can either save it till Wednesday night, or you can
call her at home or at work. She'll make time to talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewel Fleming, 32, of Overland Park said Whedon is uniquely
qualified to teach this subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been there,'' Fleming said. ``And you really don't know
what it's like unless you've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   But how can Whedon deal with abusers after what she's been
through?
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, going down there gives me an opportunity to help
someone else not turn into this guy,'' she said, referring to
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   `Get up and do'
</P>
<P>
   After such a brutal attack, no one could have blamed Whedon if
she gave up, withdrew from society or turned bitter.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, she didn't. Her mother, Annie Whedon of
Oskaloosa, Kan., said she didn't raise any of her nine children to
be quitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said you either lie there and molt, or you get up
and do something,'' she said. ``And Ann has always gotten up and
done something. She was always a very determined girl. Maybe I
should say bullheaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Her upbringing helped her survive the attack. So did three
months of counseling, and a life that was rarely idyllic or pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Whedon is the first to admit she's not a perfect person. She's
used marijuana and twice tried cocaine. And when it comes to
picking partners, she doesn't have a very good history, having
divorced twice.
</P>
<P>
   It is the combination of all of this _ her imperfect past, her
current disabilities, combined with her bullheadedness and
commitment to helping others _ that have found expression in her
batterers intervention class. They're also invaluable in her new
full-time job at the Rehabilitation Institute in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   As the case manager in the institute's sheltered workshop,
Whedon hires, fires and assists physically disabled and mentally
challenged workers.
</P>
<P>
   Don Harkins, the institute's director, is thrilled with her
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a tremendous role model,'' he said. ``It would be easy
for someone who has gone through what she's been through to stop
trying and say `enough already,' '' Harkins said. ``But that's not
Ann Whedon. Ann approaches things as a challenge instead of an
obstacle. And she brings a tremendous amount of enthusiasm into the
workshop, and she communicates that through her words and
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those actions go beyond the workplace. In many cases,
Whedon has not only helped workers on the job, but in their
personal lives. She's helped them clean and organize their homes,
taken them to stores and kept them from getting evicted from their
homes. She inspired one client to go to college and start a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got an incredible heart,'' Harkins said ... ``She's been
an incredible addition to the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   `A true giver'
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Whedon has always been caring. But that's where
the similarities to her old life end. In almost every other way,
following the attack, her life has changed for the better.
</P>
<P>
   She says she improved her personal life when she met and married
Rick, a man in her apartment building touched by her tragic tale,
who has devoted his life to making hers better. He calls her
``Red'' and ``Tuffy.'' They've been married about a year and live
in an apartment in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of a person is his new wife?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got it all when you say she has outflow for people,''
he said. ``Most people are inflow. You know, what's in it for me?
She doesn't care about that. ... She's a true giver.''
</P>
<P>
   As Whedon improved her personal life, she also expanded her
mind. Married and quickly pregnant out of high school, she never
went to college. But once there, she couldn't get enough.
</P>
<P>
   Before studying at KU, she enrolled in a Western civilization
class at Johnson County Community College that introduced her to a
whole new world. She began to appreciate history and culture and
books in a whole new light. Recently she read a book called The
Arcanum, a book about the discovery of making porcelain. She also
loves to listen to classical music.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, she has improved her career. Although she always
had jobs she enjoyed, including stints as a baker and a
salesperson, they never seemed to lead anywhere. Today she thinks
she is truly making a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother knows not everyone could do what her daughter has
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who have been traumatized crawl into their
little shell and feel sorry for themselves,'' Annie Whedon said.
``But you make your own future. ... You either lie there and wallow
in it, or get up and do something. And Ann is a hard charger. And
nothing's going to get to her. Nothing.''

NBC HOPES THERE'S MAGIC IN MEGA MINISERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most ambitious TV miniseries in more than a decade begins
Sunday on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   And if the creators of this fairy-tale extravaganza could step
inside the magical world they've made, no doubt they'd find the
nearest genie and ask for a special stone with which to fell the
marauding game show giant that threatens their kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Into the teeth of what is turning out to be the TV story of the
year _ ABC's endless hit ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' _ flies
``The 10th Kingdom,'' which NBC optimistically calls ``the epic
event of the millennium.'' The 10-hour spectacular miniseries
begins tonight and continues for four of the next eight nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10th Kingdom'' reunites the screenwriter, studio and
network that collaborated on the acclaimed 1996 miniseries
``Gulliver's Travels,'' the one that launched the recent craze in
Great Books-inspired TV blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   Since producing ``Gulliver's'' for NBC, the Hallmark
Entertainment father-son team of Robert Halmi Sr. and Robert Halmi
Jr. have virtually owned the miniseries field. Their special
effects-laden retellings include ``Moby Dick,'' ``The Odyssey'' and
``Animal Farm,'' as well as fanciful biographies of Cleopatra,
Merlin and Noah.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The 10th Kingdom'' tops them all, at least in size and
reach. Writer Simon Moore has spun a dense but linear tale about a
mythical world of nine kingdoms and the adventures of two seemingly
ordinary New Yorkers who stumble into it.
</P>
<P>
   His script cribs from nearly every well-known children's tale,
with glass menageries, magic spells, potent curses, poison apples,
mighty beanstalks, talking mice, worker-dwarves, Rapunzel's hair,
an evil queen and two icons of the genre, Cinderella and Snow
White.
</P>
<P>
   It will all end happily, not only for our heroes but for the
viewers who decide to invest a week's worth of TV time watching it.
But none of that becomes clear right away, and indeed for much of
the first two nights ``The 10th Kingdom'' really drags. John
Larroquette is the best thing in this miniseries, but he can't be
expected to carry the whole load even if a witch could turn him
into Richard Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be a grand finish by the time the final acts air
March 5 and 6 ... and by then the Nielsen ratings period will be
over, as will the threat from the kingdom of ABC. (Regis is the
Latin word for ``king'' _ coincidence?)
</P>
<P>
   Through the looking-glass
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10th Kingdom'' opens in a mythical realm where a
working-class stiff can have an apartment overlooking Central Park.
Larroquette plays Tony Lewis, an overworked building super with the
choice digs (it's a job perk, we're told). His 20-something
daughter, Virginia, played by Kimberly Williams, still lives with
him. Her mother mysteriously left them years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Larroquette has a talent for roles like these, which he
sharpened during his sitcom years on ``Night Court'' as well as an
even darker eponymous show for NBC and an underestimated turn in
last year's ``Fawlty Towers'' remake, ``Payne.'' He's wisely
avoided the feature film circuit, perhaps knowing that the same
qualities that make him so appealing here would look like shameless
mugging on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Larroquette gets no help from Williams, who is
called on to play a depressing and not very likable young woman
and, one must say, does all too well at it. Williams has been in
some pretty high-profile stuff, including the ``Father of the
Bride'' films (as the bride) and the ABC dating drama
``Relativity'' three years ago. But _ and perhaps this is faint
praise _ her best work has been done in large ensembles. For the
first two or three hours of ``The 10th Kingdom,'' Williams has a
heavier load to pull, and she clearly strains under the effort.
</P>
<P>
   To viewers who recall ``Gulliver's Travels'' (which pops up from
time to time on the Odyssey Network), the plot construction of
``The 10th Kingdom'' will seem familiar. Just as the scene kept
shifting between 18th-century English society and the exotic lands
where Gulliver roamed, so the action here switches from New York to
fairy-book-land and back again. Frankly, the two worlds can't
collide soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   And they do one night, when Virginia crashes her bike into a
golden retriever that is, in fact, a handsome prince. The dog has
come to her through a magic mirror, with a hunky werewolf and three
hideous trolls in hot pursuit. Soon Virginia, her dad and the dog
will be chased back through the looking-glass and into the fourth
kingdom, an empire founded by none other than the late Snow White
(who will reappear briefly from the dead in the program's eighth
hour as Camryn Manheim). Little mention is made of the other
kingdoms; they are apparently being saved for sequels.
</P>
<P>
   No kids' stuff
</P>
<P>
   The narcotic effect of magic is a recurring theme in ``The 10th
Kingdom,'' and it's one of several reasons why this miniseries,
like the original Grimm fairy tales, is not recommended for the
kiddies. Another reason is the language, and a third is the sadism
of the trolls, who in one scene brutally assault a young couple in
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's Part 2 continues the pursuit inside a ``disenchanted
forest,'' where we're introduced to another baddie called The
Huntsman, whose arrows weave through the trees like heat-seeking
missiles until they strike flesh. Rutger Hauer is the suitably
cold-blooded Huntsman; I suspect he got the part because he's a
ringer for Hannibal Lecter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, things aren't always as grim as Grimm in ``The 10th
Kingdom,'' which delights in mocking many of the fairy-tale
conventions it uses. When Virginia saves the life of a talking
bird, the grateful critter flies back at key moments and sings,
``Because you have saved my life, I will help you.'' After a couple
of interventions, though, the bird adds, ``But this really has to
stop!''
</P>
<P>
   The best running gag is that after several generations, the
fairy kingdoms have sprouted their own bureaucracies. This is
nicely symbolized in the Snow White Memorial Prison, where much of
Part 1 takes place. As it turns out, the land of enchantment has
plenty of red tape to bog down a couple of impatient visitors. They
find their precious time being wasted by gatekeepers who speak in
riddles, ghosts that only speak in verse, disputes that must be
settled by a jury of sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Even a New Yorker can only take so much absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it with you people?'' Tony finally blurts out.'' And
later, ``Can we just stop with the rhyming (stuff)?''
</P>
<P>
   For all the twists and turns in ``The 10th Kingdom,'' the payoff
doesn't come until next weekend, when Virginia discovers that yes,
there is a Snow White. They meet at her icy estate in a scene
reminiscent of Marlon Brando's home in the first ``Superman''
movie. The casting of Manheim was inspired, and her speech even
galvanizes the lackluster Williams into a winning performance down
the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   A new set of NBC executives has replaced the ones that
green-lighted ``The 10th Kingdom,'' and they've stated their
displeasure with its running time. ``The 10th Kingdom'' has its
problems, but cutting it to the standard four-hour miniseries
length wouldn't have solved them. And it would have denied us the
distinct thrill of seeing an odyssey of this length reach its
satisfying conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, how many TV executives guessed that a revival of
``The $64,000 Question'' with a 64-year-old host would become a
prime-time sensation? Sometimes real life is stranger than fairy
tales.

<P>
   The first of the big-money game shows has bitten the dust, and
Fox won't be marrying off any more multimillionaires _ if it ever
did. But never fear: There are plenty more game shows on the way to
take their place.
</P>
<P>
   Since the new year, four game shows have come on the air to join
ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' resulting in hours of
final answers, double-or-nothing questions and manufactured
excitement every week.
</P>
<P>
   And each network has more game shows waiting in the wings, ready
to bring in on a moment's notice. Not much is known about most of
them, but we can report that the replacement CBS is readying for
``Winning Lines,'' the mind-boggling number game that was taken off
the air last week, has a name that will ring a bell to many older
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``The $64,000 Question.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right. CBS is bringing back the one that started it all.
``The $64,000 Question'' not only launched the 1950's quiz-show
craze, but it also pioneered the high-stakes suspense and
over-the-top set design for which ``Millionaire'' is now
celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is still being worked out, but don't be surprised if
this CBS classic returns with a slightly modified title. Sources
say ``The $1,064,000 Question'' is a leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, meanwhile, is busy sweeping away the rubble from ``Who
Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' now better known as ``When
Ratings Hits Go Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' aired the day after
Valentine's Day and drew 22 million viewers in its final hour,
making it one of the week's top five shows. At the end, a
self-described real-estate mogul named Rick Rockwell chose his
bride from among 50 hopefuls and married her right on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   For a fleeting few days it looked as though Fox's audacious
gambit would spin off into a whole new series, with dozens of
would-be spouses competing each week for the honor of re-creating
Tiny Tim's 1969 ``Tonight Show'' wedding with the shadowy tycoon of
their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   And then the former girlfriends of Rockwell started coming out
of the woodwork. One told a San Diego radio station that Rockwell
(aka Richard Balkey) professed his love to her just days before the
taping of ``Multimillionaire'' and said he could easily get out of
his impending marriage contract.
</P>
<P>
   It also wasn't clear whether Rockwell had that much money; one
realtor told a Canadian newspaper that the only thing Rockwell had
ever purchased from him was ``a $100,000 condo that leaks.'' Fox
claimed it had done an extensive background check of Rockwell, but,
by the end of last week, it seemed possible that the onetime
stand-up comic had pulled his biggest practical joke ever.
</P>
<P>
   When an Internet site, thesmokinggun.com, published a
restraining order that a former fiancee of Rockwell's had won
against him nine years earlier, Fox finally found its threshold of
embarrassment. The network yanked a rerun of ``Multimillionaire''
off its schedule and said it would not produce the specials again.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Fox's foray into peddling instant weddings began
and ended with Rick Rockwell, the new genre will live on. Universal
Television is currently selling a game show, ``Wed at First
Sight,'' with the same premise (albeit without multimillionaires
and with the woman, not the man, doing the picking). Look for it in
syndication this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap filler
</P>
<P>
   None of the other Johnny-come-latelys has even approached the
ratings stratosphere of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' The
Regis Philbin Traveling Show has rated at or near the top of the
Nielsens since starting its three-nights-a-week routine in January.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``Twenty One'' also appears to be a bona-fide hit on
Wednesdays _ at least when ABC doesn't schedule an hour of
``Millionaire'' against it. Even ``Winning Lines'' did about as
well in the ratings as the show it replaced, ``Early Edition,'' on
Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   But these shows don't need stellar ratings to be considered
successful. They just need to be reasonably well-watched. For as TV
executives are discovering, even mediocre game shows are cheap
schedule filler and a quick fix for the age-old problem of reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, viewers are annoyed when their favorite programs are
pre-empted for game shows. But the truth is that half the time the
networks only have repeat episodes to offer them anyway. And that's
often just as annoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the networks has two, three, four game shows in
development,'' said Scott Stone, whose Stone Stanley Entertainment
produced ``Winning Lines'' as well as ``Shop Til You Drop'' for Pax
TV. ``I think they really like the fact that their bench is deeper.
They can bring these shows out and give their more expensive shows
a rest.''
</P>
<P>
   But with jackpots of $1 million to $2 million, are these
hey-big-spender game shows really cheaper to make than comedies and
dramas?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Millionaire,'' it's a moot point, since ABC is
charging $500,000 or more for a 30-second commercial on the show.
The others, predictably, have begun to cut corners. The producers
of Fox's ``Greed'' and NBC's ``Twenty One'' were ordered by their
networks to cut back the amount of money being given away.
``Twenty-One's'' Maury Povich was giving away an average of $1
million a week before the prize money was slimmed down.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the show that brought big cash payouts to TV, the
original ``$64,000 Question,'' cost a mere $11,000 per week to
make. As author Jeff Kisseloff detailed in his book The Box: An
Oral History of Television, the show's producers would drag out
each question over an entire program, then pressure contestants
between broadcasts to take their winnings and leave.
</P>
<P>
   More to come
</P>
<P>
   CBS president Leslie Moonves told reporters in January that game
shows couldn't go away too soon for his tastes. But in addition to
reviving ``Question,'' CBS is actually leading the charge into the
next frontier of voyeuristic contests.
</P>
<P>
   This summer it will show an American version of ``Big Brother,''
a Dutch show in which 10 hopefuls share a house for 100 days,
watched by more than 20 cameras and overheard by some 60
microphones. They will vote regularly to kick out housemates until
their number is reduced to a single winner. (One critic has already
tagged it ``MTV's `Real World' meets `Lord of the Flies.' '')
</P>
<P>
   As if that's not enough, ``Big Brother'' will likely be paired
with ``Survivor.'' That show has the same concept, but on a desert
island, and for a million bucks. It ought to be called, ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire ... This Badly?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on cable, Game Show Network, which is having its best
season ever (and was recently added to the Time Warner Cable
lineup), not only shows reruns of old game shows but produces some
of its own. One is a remake of ``3's a Crowd,'' the tacky Chuck
Barris show from the 1970s where a male contestant's wife and his
secretary competed to see who knew more about his personal side.
</P>
<P>
   How long will this game-show craze last, and how lurid will it
get? No final answers here, but I will venture this: Before it's
over, we'll see a revival of ``Queen for a Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the idea of three luckless ladies telling their most
pathetic sob stories for cash prizes _ with the winner decided by
an applause-o-meter _ seems as ripe for recycling today as ``The
$64,000 Question.''

PRODUCER WALTER AFANASIEFF DOES IT ALL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below for Grammy TV shows; all times are PST. Check
local times in your area. Tonight is WEDNESDAY, Feb. 23 in this
story.) 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you listened to Top 40 radio today, you probably heard the
work of Walter Afanasieff.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't ring a bell?
</P>
<P>
   It probably wouldn't, unless, that is, you read the small print
on your CDs. If that's the case, then you've seen Afanasieff's name
on hits from Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Michael Bolton, Ricky
Martin, Whitney Houston and countless others. Oh, he also produced
last year's Grammy Award-winning record of the year, ``My Heart
Will Go On,'' Dion's love theme from ``Titanic'' and one of the
best-selling records of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Known for juggling a number of projects simultaneously,
Afanasieff, a triple-threat musician, songwriter and producer, has
been associated with some of the most popular artists of the last
15 years. Yet, even after a dozen No. 1 records, he's managed to
keep a remarkably low profile.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's a good idea when you're known for big-budget music
for the masses that's also among the most critically reviled each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not close-minded or stuck in one musical bag,'' said
Afanasieff, who is nominated for producer of the year at tonight's
Grammy ceremony at Staples Center. ``The key is still talent and
hard work. To me, making records is a series of almost mathematical
problems that need solving.''
</P>
<P>
   As a producer, the 42-year-old Afanasieff is something of an
anomaly in today's music industry. He writes or co-writes the
songs, arranges the material and records all the backing tracks
before even calling the singer into the studio. Normally on a major
project, specialists are hired for each of those tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, some producers do one or two albums a
year,'' he explained. ``Today, I could do 20 or 30 songs in that
time by having four or five studios going at once. That's five
albums of work in one year.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Afanasieff's Grammy nod for 1999 reflects an especially
busy year when he produced recordings by Savage Garden, Babyface,
Marc Anthony, Kenny G, Martin and Barbra Streisand. Last week, the
Afanasieff-co-produced and arranged ``I Knew I Loved You'' from
Australian pop duo Savage Garden's second album, ``Affirmation,''
reached the top of the singles chart.
</P>
<P>
   The albums ``Christmas With Babyface'' and ``Classics in the Key
of G'' by Kenny G, along with the track ``The Animal Song'' by
Savage Garden from the soundtrack to the film ``The Other Sister,''
are among the recordings specifically cited by the record academy
in Afanasieff's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't our first choice, to be honest,'' admits Savage
Garden's Darren Hayes. ``We thought we wanted more of a rock-type
guy. But we met with Walter and found we had a lot of the same
ideas in mind. Our first album was recorded on a dime ... this was
the other extreme by far.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Vladamir Nikitich in Brazil to Russian parents, Afanasieff
and family moved to San Francisco when he was 5 years old. Taking
piano lessons as a child before moving on to the Conservatory of
Music in San Mateo, Afanasieff spent a year studying classical
music in Europe before returning to the Bay Area and discovering a
passion for jazz.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, he worked as jazz-fusion violinist
Jean-Luc Ponty's keyboardist, eventually meeting drummer-producer
Narada Michael Walden, who had just relocated to the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of their friendship, Walden invited Afanasieff to
work with him on Aretha Franklin's mid-'80s comeback album, ``Who's
Zoomin' Who?'' which went to No. 13 and made Walden a highly
sought-after producer. From that point on, Afanasieff worked his
way up from session player to co-writer to assistant producer to
co-producer. While with Walden, he programmed and co-produced
material for albums by such high-profile artists as Houston, Lionel
Ritchie, George Benson and Streisand.
</P>
<P>
   Afanasieff worked closely with Walden until the team reportedly
split over production credits to Carey's best-selling 1990 debut
album.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me the ropes of writing, producing, music business
economics,'' Afanasieff said. ``I owe him everything.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Walden, Afanasieff began a long-term association
with Sony Music that set him on the path to producer's heaven. His
string of hits started with Carey's ``Love Takes Time'' and
continued through Bolton's No. 1 album, ``Time, Love and
Tenderness,'' Peabo Bryson's ``Can You Stop the Rain'' and Carey's
1991 album, ``Emotions,'' which included four Afanasieff-Carey
compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Afanasieff started the year with a full plate. He's writing and
producing a track for Michael Jackson; penned a composition for a
new California-themed Disney attraction under construction at
Disneyland; is currently producing Julio Iglesias; and is working
on new material for the forthcoming albums by Jennifer Lopez,
Martin, Anthony and teen thrush Jessica Simpson. He will also
produce the next album by rootsy Bay Area band Train.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a departure from what I've been doing,'' he said of the
Train record. ``Nobody is sure exactly how it will sound. I'm not
thought of as that kind of producer. But there's this new wave of
talent out there, and I want to be part of that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Afanasieff, who has been nominated for a dozen Grammys over the
years, said his producer of the year bid carries weight because it
was voted on by peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grammys are still the king of the music industry,'' he
said. ``It's what everyone strives for in the form of awards simply
because it's the only awards show based on recognition from within
the industry. It's not based on popularity or sales. It's based on
a scrutiny of your work.''
</P>
<P>
   Afanasieff's hands-on approach in the studio is perfect for many
of the artists he has worked with _ particularly divas such as
Carey and Dion, who dub over their vocals after the track has been
completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (he and his team of engineers) are totally responsible for
what they're singing, for how the record sounds,'' he said. ``We
sit at our keyboards, develop the song, shape the song, then
literally produce the singer's vocals.
</P>

LATINO CULTURE, AMERICAN CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN MARK EBERHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 10 years' time, Latinos will be the largest minority in
America; in 50 years' time, one in four U.S. residents will be of
Latino origin, if current trends hold.
</P>
<P>
   And yet even as Latino culture saturates the airwaves in the
form of stars such as Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, America at
large still hasn't quite figured out how to embrace it. The United
States continues to struggle with defining itself in terms of black
and white, much less black, white, brown and other colors.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez's Harvest of Empire, then, becomes almost required
reading, not simply for Latinos but for everyone who needs to
better understand the major contributions the culture has made as
far back as 1500.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's excellent opening section, ``Roots (Las Raices),''
notes how English and Spanish explorers and settlers subjugated
native American cultures, but of course the English conquest proved
the more widespread and enduring.
</P>
<P>
   Once the new nation called the United States was established,
however, its frontier expansion continued to carve away at Hispanic
culture. U.S. presidents from Jefferson to Theodore Roosevelt
consider the theft of Latin American land as just a piece in
America's ``Manifest Destiny'' geographical jigsaw puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But along with the conquered lands,'' Gonzalez writes, ``came
unwanted peoples: Native Americans, who were pushed farther west,
then herded onto reservations, and several million Mexicans,
Cubans, Filipinos and Puerto Ricans, who were placed under U.S.
sovereignty. Even when Congress officially declared some of the
conquered peoples U.S. citizens, the newly arrived Anglo settlers
routinely seized their properties, and those seizures were then
upheld by the English-speaking courts the settlers installed. The
Mexican Americans of the Southwest became a foreign minority in the
land of their birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also tackles a range of other subjects, from the
difficult questions posed by bilingualism to the hard-line
politicization of U.S.-Cuban relations, to a subject that most
Americans probably haven't even thought of: the rather sad status
of Puerto Rico, which most mainlanders consider only a vacation
destination, if they consider it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico is perhaps the richest ``colony'' America has ever
had, providing incredible wealth to the United States _ billions of
dollars in investment income, government-owned corporate revenue,
taxes and other resources. And yet Puerto Rican residents, while
considered U.S. citizens by birth, do not have the same rights;
they cannot, for example, vote in federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   So why not just make Puerto Rico the 51st state and correct such
inequities? ``With our government clamping down on the flood of
Latin American immigrants, it is almost unthinkable that a
congressional majority would be prepared to admit an entire state
whose people are racially mixed and who speak Spanish as their main
language.'' Even more unthinkable, of course, given Puerto Rico's
ongoing status as a treasure-trove for America, would be letting it
go its own way.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, however, is not simply a complainer or keeper of
historical facts that some Americans would probably just as soon
forget. He offers solutions in his epilogue _ sound thoughts on
making life for Latinos and, in fact, all Americans better _ such
as reinvesting in U.S. cities and public schools; ending
militaristic operations in Latin American countries; recognizing
``the rights of language minorities'' and promoting the study of
Spanish; and ending the decades-long economic blockade of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, are you listening?

<TEXT>
<P>
   REYNOSA, Mexico _ El Texano, the only gringo ever to be
confirmed as a matador in Mexico, has retired after dedicating his
last bull to his father and taking home its ear.
</P>
<P>
   David Renk, 37, a resident of McAllen, Texas, who has spent the
past two decades of his life fighting bulls, gave his final
performance as a professional matador on Sunday to the strains of
``Golondrinas,'' the farewell song, in front of a crowd of about
500 in the Plaza Monumental de Toros.
</P>
<P>
   Renk performed his signature move, the mano latina, kneeling
before the horns of the first bull he fought, an 1,100-pound beast
that alarmed crowds when it leapt a wooden barricade and took a
turn around the exterior ring.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his second bull, fittingly named ``Bye Bye,'' that
moved the crowd when Renk dedicated the feisty animal to his
father, Fred Renk, an amateur matador who was his son's
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky enough to have the people behind me _ my dad and
my family _ that allowed me to do this,'' David Renk said before
the bullfight began on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He hugged and kissed his father before killing the bull with a
single sword thrust so clean and precise the judges awarded him the
bull's ear, bringing his collection to a career total of 99 such
ears and seven tails.
</P>
<P>
   Renk also has earned one indulto (pardon), the highest honor
that can be granted and another first for a Yankee matador.
</P>
<P>
   American bullfighters are sometimes caught between prejudice
against them in countries where the practice is popular, and
indifference or disgust in their own land, where bullfighting is
illegal and fans not numerous.
</P>
<P>
   Renk's career is all the more extraordinary because he overcame
a severe disability to become a matador.
</P>
<P>
   Renk didn't always have the supple grace of a Spanish dancer
that he demonstrated Sunday. He was born crippled by overly flat
arches, with his feet twisted inward. Walking was painful.
</P>
<P>
   Though doctors told him he would sooner or later be confined to
a wheelchair, Renk had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   He knew he would be a matador.
</P>
<P>
   Though he could hardly walk, Renk toted around a towel on a
stick, playing at mock bullfighting. At 9, medical science caught
up with his aspirations. He underwent an operation and spent a year
in a wheelchair wearing a series of corrective leg casts.
</P>
<P>
   During Easter weekend in 1971, still hobbled by casts, he
announced his career goals at a bullfight in Juarez fought by his
father's friend, retiring matador Pepe Luis Vasquez.
</P>
<P>
   As Renk sat in a wheelchair on the sidelines, Vasquez dedicated
his last bull to the slender boy and told him he could be anything.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a decade later _ also during an Easter weekend in the
border city of Juarez _ Renk became a matador, killing his first
full-grown bull with the help of Vasquez, who had become his
mentor.
</P>
<P>
   He was only the sixth, and at 18 the youngest, American in the
history of bullfighting to become a matador. Throughout Mexico,
Renk became known as ``El Texano,'' fighting his way to the top of
the profession with about 20 corridas, or bullfights, a year.
</P>
<P>
   Renk eventually returned to the United States, got a job in
water purification, married and had children. But he kept fighting.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday, Renk will no longer fight professionally in his
``suit of lights,'' though he will continue to fight smaller bulls
in traje corto, the suit used for festival fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll always be in my blood,'' he said, grinning. ``The gusano
(worm) gets in you. It will never leave you.''
</P>
<P>
   When Renk, now a wiry and sun-weathered man of 37, talks about
bullfighting, his quiet demeanor changes.
</P>
<P>
   He becomes the regal boy in the hundreds of photos and posters
that line the walls of what he affectionately calls his father's
``museum,'' the boy who bears no resemblance to the frail, crippled
youngster he had once been.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put the suit on, and I tie that pigtail to the back of
my head, and put on those pink stockings, I can be arrogant as I
want to be,'' Renk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You become a different person. That's what I get out of it.
Just to even go to a bullfight, the whole thing, is very special.''

<P>
   It happened almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Before people in the United States even began to realize it,
they were living via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic culture now has an impact _ and even greater
depth and speed _ comparable to that of the railroad and the
electric light in the 19th century and plastics and antibiotics
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The decade of the '90s was the most prosperous in U.S. history,
and the Internet is both a product and a beneficiary of that. It's
a gigantic virtual marketplace where people can find whatever they
dream of, from medical diagnoses to movie tickets to plane
reservations to at-home visitors supplied by erotic escort
services.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a day goes by when someone in the average American
middle-class family doesn't do an Internet transaction. Most of the
flowers and boxes of chocolates sent by people in love on
Valentine's Day were ordered from Yahoo.com and Altavista.com, two
favorite virtual ``sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Many bills that used to be paid by mail, from mortgages to
monthly cable-TV fees to private club dues, are now electronic,
click-of-a-mouse transactions. Perhaps the Internet is a good
explanation for the growing number of fat people in the United
States: If everything can be done within easy reach of the
keyboard, why move at all?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand, then, the chaos that exploded during
the second week of February, when electronic pirates _ known as
``hackers'' _ attacked the Yahoo Internet site and created an
incredible bottleneck. The invasion, anonymous and impossible to
contain, was so well coordinated that separate parts of the plan
were able to evolve like clockwork. One by one, other major Web
sites were disrupted: Amazon, eBay, and buy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has pinpointed a credible motive. Perhaps it was all
merely to show the world that the great Internet commercial sites
are actually very vulnerable to invasion and that, furthermore,
their weaknesses can be protected probably only by ``good'' hackers
whose skills are greater than those of the ``bad'' attackers.
</P>
<P>
   In the most authoritative newspaper columns,
information-technology analysts have likened what happened in
cyberspace to this scenario: a sale at a major department store for
which hundreds of thousands of customers arrive at the same time,
but only 10,000 were expected over the course of a week.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, the February attack also bears the sinister feel
of the actions of a serial killer who strikes simply and solely
because he wants to, and nobody can guess who the next victim will
be.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time now I have wondered what makes a hacker, what
his moral code and his lifestyle might be. In the movies they've
been portrayed as gaunt young men who conspire in dark and dirty
basement rooms and grasp their computers as though they were
bloodthirsty knives.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, their image is different. At the university where
I work, the hackers describe themselves as ``white hats.'' They've
told me that their virtual universe has its own culture and
language, its own music and its own clear moral boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   I met some of these young men in mid-February, soon after the
attack on Yahoo. Far from gaunt and dirty, they were athletic, well
mannered and professionally employed in part-time mainstream jobs,
earning no less than $2,000 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them had positions in the information-security areas of
major high-tech corporations in the area of New Jersey between
Princeton and Edison: the home of medical laboratories, cell-phone
manufacturers and international hotel chains.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven I met, three were Indian, two were Korean, one was
Russian and the other was born in Kansas of Chinese parents.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that on Thursday and Saturday nights they meet at
Clyde's, a bar in New Brunswick that features 53 kinds of Martinis.
There they talk about their cybernetic adventures in a language no
ordinary non-''tekkie'' can put into normal written language: bits,
bytes and so on.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rajeev, one of the Indian computer experts, the
Yahoo invasion had all the earmarks of a program sent through the
Internet in November _ one that was signed by ``Mixter.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later I read in The New York Times that Mixter had
been found. He is, it seems, a 20-year-old German hacker who lives
near Hanover, N.J., and is believed to have created one of the most
damaging viruses of the '90s: the Magnolia Web.
</P>
<P>
   By the hackers' moral code, Rajeev told me, Mixter is a gray,
which means he's someone who hasn't yet crossed the boundary into
the territory of the white hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are something like a brotherhood and we have learned to
identify each other,'' Rajeev said. ``I'll bet you that Mixter is a
Prodigy fanatic and his favorite song is `Voodoo People.'
Everything he does has that techno trademark. As far as I'm
concerned he's too heavy. Those kids think they are gods.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoom, one of the Koreans, tried to sketch for me the evil ones,
the ``black hats.'' ``Even though nothing is hard and fast with
us,'' he told me, ``and any of us white hats might turn gray
tomorrow, for no particular reason, I can tell you that none of us
would become a black hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're despicable. You know what they're after? A power rush.
Adrenaline. ... I met a black hat in Nebraska. He lived alone. ...
His house smelled like a cave. This guy would pick some innocent
person who lived 1,000 miles away and access his e-mail _ it's so
easy _ and then destroy this person's life: read his mail and
sometimes answer it for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd use the victim's credit card. ... Once he even changed a
poor guy's blood analysis report _ the man was about to have
emergency surgery. Finally he got bored and found another human
target, but not before dispatching a virus that destroyed the other
computer memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this, and what for? Just to show that he was better, that
he knew more, that he had someone else's life in his hands. For a
black hat, there is no law besides vanity, no religion other than
ego.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the attack on Yahoo and other electronic business
centers has created an almost metaphysical panic in the American
economy _ panic in the face of an evil that nobody is able to
define or analyze or predict. What will happen, one wonders, if the
amoral black hats do infiltrate the crusading white hats, creating
inexplicable chaos?
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has created a new lifestyle and a new language, but
it is also creating new forms of evil and destruction. This century
is just beginning, and reality is already different.

   It happened almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Before people in the United States even began to realize it,
they were living via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic culture now has an impact _ and even greater
depth and speed _ comparable to that of the railroad and the
electric light in the 19th century and plastics and antibiotics
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The decade of the '90s was the most prosperous in U.S. history,
and the Internet is both a product and a beneficiary of that. It's
a gigantic virtual marketplace where people can find whatever they
dream of, from medical diagnoses to movie tickets to plane
reservations to at-home visitors supplied by erotic escort
services.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a day goes by when someone in the average American
middle-class family doesn't do an Internet transaction. Most of the
flowers and boxes of chocolates sent by people in love on
Valentine's Day were ordered from Yahoo.com and Altavista.com, two
favorite virtual ``sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Many bills that used to be paid by mail, from mortgages to
monthly cable-TV fees to private club dues, are now electronic,
click-of-a-mouse transactions. Perhaps the Internet is a good
explanation for the growing number of fat people in the United
States: If everything can be done within easy reach of the
keyboard, why move at all?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand, then, the chaos that exploded during
the second week of February, when electronic pirates _ known as
``hackers'' _ attacked the Yahoo Internet site and created an
incredible bottleneck. The invasion, anonymous and impossible to
contain, was so well coordinated that separate parts of the plan
were able to evolve like clockwork. One by one, other major Web
sites were disrupted: Amazon, eBay, and buy.com.
</P>
<P>

   __ A new study raises questions about the influence of
``vanishing veterans.'' __
</P>
<P>
   .....................................................
</P>
<P>
   Nestled within view of the Potomac River, the Pentagon is
flanked to the north and south by the Memorial and 14th Street
bridges, spans that connect the Defense Department with its
political patrons in Congress across the water on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Not marked on any map is another link that also provides an
important connection between the two institutions: military
service. Lawmakers who have donned a uniform, especially those who
served in combat, are widely regarded as providing an important
bridge of understanding between the world of professional
politicians and the professional military.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 30 years, lawmakers from the World War II
generation have moved on, and the abolition of conscription has
resulted in fewer lawmakers who span the political-military divide.
This trend has caused handwringing and analysis for a few years by
many observers concerned that, with fewer veterans, the federal
legislature may not adequately oversee and guide the U.S. armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study by William Bianco, a political science professor
at Pennsylvania State University, concludes that military service
does not have a notable impact on a legislator's voting behavior.
</P>
<P>
   If the decline of military veterans in Congress is leading to
significant changes in defense policy, Bianco found, its effects
are indirect and generally through changes in legislative agendas
or in the quantity and kinds of information available to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   And while the decline of lawmakers with military experience has
been much discussed, this study found that Congress now has an
unexpectedly low number of members who have served in the armed
forces compared to veterans in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Does military experience matter? ``I think that's a fair
question,'' Bianco said, in a recent interview. ``If you look at
what a lot of veterans are saying, they are very concerned that a
Congress without veterans would behave differently than a Congress
with veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianco examined the trends of military experience in the House
and Senate from 1789 to 1999, closely looking at partisan
differences in military experience during the last century. He also
analyzed the impact of veteran status on select military votes
during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Bianco concluded, ``The gross effect that veterans are going to
vote differently on military-affairs issues, broadly defined, just
doesn't show up in the data.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``Vanishing Veterans: The Decline in Military
Experience in the U.S. Congress,'' found ``no evidence that the
absolute decline or emerging underrepresentation of veterans have,
by themselves, had a significant impact on the kinds of policies
emerging from Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper was co-authored with Air Force Lt. Jamie Markham, then
a Harvard undergraduate ROTC student, as part of a study conducted
by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies' ``Project on the
Gap Between the Military and Civilian Society.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran status, Bianco and Markham found, has ``at best a
modest'' impact on vote decisions and policy outcomes. This, the
authors argue, doesn't mean that the decline in the number of
lawmakers who have served in uniform has no impact on votes. ``What
it suggests is that this effect, if it exists, is primarily
indirect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianco acknowledged that this argument implies that by the time
a bill gets to the House or Senate floor for a vote, veterans are
forced to go along with non-veterans. ``But if the agenda was truly
being skewed one way or the other, you could expect veterans to
break away from non-veterans on most votes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the only place you see that is on bills like the `don't
ask, don't tell' (policy on homosexuals in the military), and even
there the effect isn't shocking. It's not like all the veterans are
on one side of the issue and the non-veterans are on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinning of military veteran ranks in Congress has been
severe over the last 50 years. In 1971 more than 75 percent of
House members had military experience compared with 25 percent in
1999. The Senate has seen a similar decline, although it began
later and was a bit smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the House and Senate over the last generation has
been more or less evenly divided among Republicans and Democrats.
However, the decline of lawmaker veterans of the military has not
been as dramatic on the committees that deal with defense issues,
which ``continue to have a high percentage of veterans,
facilitating their role as information suppliers,'' according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
   This includes lawmakers on the House Armed Services, House
Veterans Affairs, Senate Armed Services and Senate Veterans Affairs
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 100 years, the two party caucuses have had roughly
the same percentage of military veterans. While Republicans have
generally maintained a slight advantage _ a few percentage points _
the study noted: ``Surprisingly, the largest differences are
observed in the contemporary Senate, where Democrats have a better
than 10 percentage-point advantage over Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger trend toward fewer lawmakers with military experience
may be viewed as a statistical correction, Bianco said, because for
decades during the Cold War, Congress had a higher percentage of
veterans when compared to the general population. And while Bianco
found that Congress today is underrepresented by those with
military experience compared to the general population, the
Congress of the early 1900s was even more so.
</P>
<P>
   With an all-volunteer, professional military, the number of
lawmakers who will have saluted a commander is expected to continue
to dwindle. Without universal conscription, Bianco found, an
individual with a high education level and high socioeconomic
status is less likely to serve in the military than one with less
education and lower income.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what's happening in Congress,'' the Penn State professor
said, ``is that it's been drawing from the same group over time _
that group is much less likely to have served (in the military) in
the past, and much less likely to have served relative to the whole
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers with military experience certainly bring a unique
perspective and familiarity with many defense issues that Congress
must address. However, these veterans by no means have a lock on
what is required to understand the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this very cherished belief about how military service
educates people,'' Bianco said. ``They learn about getting together
with a group of people that you don't necessarily like and learn
about patriotism and shared sacrifice. And while I'm certain the
military does that for some people _ and you can get it other ways
too _ it's not inevitable. People don't all come out of the
military as egalitarian internationalists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An Air Force colonel told me that his feeling on this was that
two years of flipping burgers at an air base in Texas doesn't teach
you much about national security. We all make a big deal about Bill
Clinton not being a veteran. But remember,'' Bianco said, ``that
Sam Nunn, one of the most respected defense influentials of the
last generation, is not a veteran.''

break away from non-veterans on most votes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the only place you see that is on bills like the `don't
ask, don't tell' (policy on homosexuals in the military), and even
there the effect isn't shocking. It's not like all the veterans are
on one side of the issue and the non-veterans are on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinning of military veteran ranks in Congress has been
severe over the last 50 years. In 1971 more than 75 percent of
House members had military experience compared with 25 percent in
1999. The Senate has seen a similar decline, although it began
later and was a bit smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the House and Senate over the last generation has
been more or less evenly divided among Republicans and Democrats.
However, the decline of lawmaker veterans of the military has not
been as dramatic on the committees that deal with defense issues,
which ``continue to have a high percentage of veterans,
facilitating their role as information suppliers,'' according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
   This includes lawmakers on the House Armed Services, House
Veterans Affairs, Senate Armed Services and Senate Veterans Affairs
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 100 years, the two party caucuses have had roughly
the same percentage of military veterans. While Republicans have
generally maintained a slight advantage _ a few percentage points _
the study noted: ``Surprisingly, the largest differences are
observed in the contemporary Senate, where Democrats have a better
than 10 percentage-point advantage over Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger trend toward fewer lawmakers with military experience
may be viewed as a statistical correction, Bianco said, because for
decades during the Cold War, Congress had a higher percentage of
veterans when compared to the general population. And while Bianco
found that Congress today is underrepresented by those with
military experience compared to the general population, the
Congress of the early 1900s was even more so.
</P>
<P>
   With an all-volunteer, professional military, the number of
lawmakers who will have saluted a commander is expected to continue
to dwindle. Without universal conscription, Bianco found, an
individual with a high education level and high socioeconomic
status is less likely to serve in the military than one with less
education and lower income.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what's happening in Congress,'' the Penn State professor
said, ``is that it's been drawing from the same group over time _
that group is much less likely to have served (in the military) in
the past, and much less likely to have served relative to the whole
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers with military experience certainly bring a unique
perspective and familiarity with many defense issues that Congress
must address. However, these veterans by no means have a lock on
what is required to understand the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this very cherished belief about how military service
educates people,'' Bianco said. ``They learn about getting together
with a group of people that you don't necessarily like and learn
about patriotism and shared sacrifice. And while I'm certain the
military does that for some people _ and you can get it other ways
too _ it's not inevitable. People don't all come out of the
military as egalitarian internationalists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An Air Force colonel told me that his feeling on this was that
two years of flipping burgers at an air base in Texas doesn't teach
you much about national security. We all make a big deal about Bill
Clinton not being a veteran. But remember,'' Bianco said, ``that
Sam Nunn, one of the most respected defense influentials of the
last generation, is not a veteran.''

<P>
   The return of U.N. arms inspectors to Iraq would do more harm
than good.
</P>
<P>
   This is true no matter how robust is the successor to the U.N.
team that originally worked to disarm Iraq _ that is, the new group
led by Hans Blix, former head of the International Atomic Energy
Agency and chairman of the new U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Simply discovering and destroying Iraq's biological, chemical
and nuclear capabilities is not enough to stop Iraq over the long
term if Iraq is able to simply rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   If inspectors return to Iraq, President Saddam Hussein is again
likely to refuse to cooperate, leaving the United States almost
alone in seeking punishment including military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, besides gaining the complicity of officials at
the United Nations, Iraq has also gained the tacit _ and at times
overt _ support of several major powers: notably Russia, China and
France.
</P>
<P>
   Even more dangerous, however, is the possibility that Saddam
WILL cooperate with the new inspectors. This would spell not only
an end to inspections but also an end of sanctions. And then Iraq
would be free to reconstitute its arms programs _ a clear and
present danger to the entire Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising as it sounds, an impasse will better position the
United States to hamper Saddam's quest for weapons of mass
destruction _ and to avoid being a part of the deliberate flouting
of U.N. resolutions and arms-control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   In the final years of the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM,
which was dispatched to disarm Iraq after the Persian Gulf war,
Saddam chose his provocations according to his own lights,
disrupting inspections or otherwise egregiously violating
agreements when he felt global support for his cause was strong or
when domestic concerns led him to pick a fight abroad.
</P>
<P>
   If the inspections resume, and Saddam picks a particularly
sensitive moment _ say, a setback in the Arab-Israeli peace process
or a burst of internal discontent in Saudi Arabia _ to be defiant,
the necessary diplomatic support for U.S.-led strikes to ensure
compliance may not be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Today's politicians and pundits who champion a resumption of
inspections say that, first, it will lead to the end of Iraq's
clandestine arms projects. Some inspections, they say, are better
than none and besides, it is impossible for Iraq to sustain an
impasse for very long. All three assumptions are false.
</P>
<P>
   The nominal success of inspections today would give Saddam a
free hand to develop bombs tomorrow. A new round of work would
probably not unearth much. U.N. workers would likely discover only
what Saddam wanted them to, or at best marginally improve our
knowledge of what is going on, leaving Iraq's existing lethal
capabilities untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is likely to again find itself in a nasty dilemma
comparable to what it faced on the eve of the Desert Fox airstrikes
in December 1998, when UNSCOM was finally withdrawn. The options:
Either ignore Saddam's deception and pave the way for declaring
Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction, or use force to demand
access.
</P>
<P>
   Past shows of force against Iraq, however, have brought at best
limited progress on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   A more fundamental concern is that if Iraq were allowed to
forbid the conduct of ``any time, any place'' searches and instead
to control their timing and location, it could eventually get a
passing grade for disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam could then push to have Iraq certified as free of
nonconventional arms, which would end the sanctions that keep
Saddam in his box. Better an impasse than a sham.
</P>
<P>
   Before the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the world knew little of
Iraq's efforts beyond the fact that it had a chemical-weapons
program _ used with gruesome effectiveness against its own Kurdish
population and against Iran during the eight-year war. Information
discovered after the Persian Gulf conflict indicated that Iraq was
close to producing a nuclear weapon and had vast stores of chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the United States and its allies mistakenly believed
that Operation Desert Storm had destroyed much of Iraq's
threatening capability. As Defense Secretary Richard Cheney
testified in the immediate aftermath of Desert Storm, ``Saddam
Hussein is out of the nuclear business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq's arsenal proved far more extensive than Western
leaders initially suspected _ and the job for inspectors more
onerous too.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Saddam blocked the inspectors' access, lied to
them about the existence of his deadly weapons programs and
otherwise made a mockery of the whole system. Iraqis repeatedly
stopped the U.N. team at the door and simply moved any sensitive
documents out the rear exit.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's interference was hardly subtle, and its pretexts for
noncompliance were often pathetic. But except for the United States
and Britain, the major powers would not back up the beleaguered
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the work was going full-bore, its effectiveness was
limited. Finding hidden weapons in a vast area is exceptionally
difficult, particularly biological weapons, which require
relatively limited infrastructure and can be easily concealed as
legitimate medical or research facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the U.N. inspectors were never led to a real
success: a complete accounting of Iraq's secret programs and the
destruction of all its proscribed weaponry. Baghdad revealed almost
none of its activities willingly and often lied about destroying
parts of its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of Iraq's biological weapons effort became clear
only after the August 1995 defection of Hussein Kamel al-Majid, a
former general and son-in-law of Saddam who had headed the
clandestine weapons projects. Likewise, the defection of Wafiq
al-Samarrai, the former chief of military intelligence, led to the
revelation that Iraq had manufactured and loaded onto delivery
systems the lethal chemical agent VX _ a surprise to UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq almost certainly still has a small stockpile of chemical
weapons and limited quantities of biological agents and seed stock.
Yet Iraq implausibly insists that its nonconventional weapons
programs have been terminated and therefore demands that sanctions
be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Although assessments vary, Iraq would probably need only a few
years to build a nuclear weapon after sanctions were lifted. Its
biological programs could be resumed in a matter of days. Producing
chemical agents such as mustard gas and sarin would take only a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   So not only sanctions but also strict controls over Iraqi
imports are still crucial to stop proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions have cut Iraqi state revenues by $10 billion to $15
billion a year, slashing the regime's assets. Equally important,
sanctions have sharply restricted what Iraq can buy. If Iraq cannot
acquire dual-use items that can be used for both weapons and
legitimate civilian purposes, developing weapons of mass
destruction will be far harder. An Iraq that can trade as a
``normal'' nation is an unnerving prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Russia is an aggressive advocate of Iraq's cause and a
full-throated critic of inspections and sanctions. France and China
also oppose U.S. policy and _ except for a handful of traumatized
gulf emirates, especially Kuwait _ the Arab states often hesitate
to support U.S. strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatically, it would be difficult and, indeed, foolish for
Washington to openly oppose renewed inspections. But U.S.
policy-makers should recognize that compromises, which offer the
false promise of progress, will in fact lay the groundwork for Iraq
to go its own way.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has spent what limited money he controls on the tools of
war and on lavish rewards for his loyal followers, not on the
well-being of the Iraqi people. Money earmarked for humanitarian
purposes often goes unspent. The regime smuggles humanitarian goods
out of Iraq to sell on the black market. And Iraqis living in the
parts of northern Iraq under U.N. control fare far better than
those under Saddam's political thumb.
</P>
<P>
   If sanctions were lifted, there is little reason to expect that
Saddam would start spending revenue generously on the Iraqi people
and every reason to believe he would blow it on Iraq's lethal toys.
</P>
<P>
   To counter legitimate humanitarian concerns about the harm done
by halting the transfer of some dual-use items _ such as chlorine,
which can be used for both chemical weapons and water purification
_ Washington should push for more international supervision of
Iraqi imports. If the world community can confidently purchase,
transfer and install water-treatment facilities without worrying
that Iraq will divert them for military uses, it could send the
requisite dual-use items.
</P>
<P>
   Such humanitarian acts, however, require that control remain in
international hands lest Saddam's goons swipe the technology. Iraq,
not the United States, is the main barrier to such a shift.
</P>
<P>
   In a wider sense, however, the stumbling blocks in this
diplomatic dance lie not with Iraq but with the U.S. allies and
other major powers who are so anxious to resume trade with Baghdad.
Indeed, America's greatest obstacles are the efforts by France,
Russia and other defenders to readmit Iraq into the community of
nations without requiring it to adhere to international norms.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, standing alone may be self-defeating, despite its
moral attractiveness. But the perfect should not become the enemy
of the good. Renewed inspections would, however unwittingly, help
Saddam develop his weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing inspections may require Washington to stake out some
unpopular diplomatic positions, but given the stakes involved, the
danger of offending Saddam's defenders is easily worth the risk.

of imploding from internal tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year its domestic drama has played out visibly,
and sometimes violently, in killings by a rogue death squad,
newspaper closures, student unrest, political trials and, as
always, uneasy relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iran, often in spite of the theocrats, has begun to achieve
one of the revolution's original goals: empowering the people. For
new social and political movements are blossoming defiantly,
ranging from religious reform and cultural expression to women's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   True, the theocratic regime that seized power in 1979 is
unlikely to survive in its current, austere form because of
profound internal problems. Yet the driving force behind the
revolution has proven adaptable enough to allow Iranians to get for
themselves what the theocracy has failed to provide. Iran's
increasingly savvy population is taking stands on social issues,
making demands and even defying the theocrats.
</P>
<P>
   _ The First Republic (1979-1989). Iran's revolution was about
more than getting rid of an unpopular leader. After the shah's
ouster, the coterie around Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini gradually
crafted a theocracy instead of a democracy. Human rights were
virtually ignored during the decade-long ``First Republic,'' which
lasted from 1979 until Khomeini's death in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The regime's zealots became obsessed with deconstructing the
past and winning converts to their cause, both at home and in the
region. The new state survived only by crushing dissent, spending
its foreign exchange reserves and tapping into fierce, age-old
Persian nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, seeds of public empowerment were planted and grew.
The ``construction jihad'' _ carried out by teams of development
experts and builders _ brought progress in the form of new schools,
social services, clinics, electricity, television and roads to the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution particularly excelled in education, in quantity
if not always in quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, only half of Iran's youth between the ages of
six and 24 were literate. Two decades later, the number had grown
to 93 percent _ even though the population had doubled. And
students remained in school longer: The number of university
graduates soared from 430,000 in the late 1970s to more than 4
million in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   This success spurred people's expectations of a greater role in
the system and access to new instruments of progress.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Second Republic (1989-1997). During President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's tenure, Iran graduated to realistically dealing with
the present. One might say that the government of God plummeted
back to earth _ with a thud.
</P>
<P>
   The new leadership initially promoted physical reconstruction of
the nation, economic reform and a diplomatic thaw. But without the
Ayatollah's authority, longstanding political divisions deepened
and paralysis set in.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a brief try at privatization, including reviving the
monarchy's stock market, the promise of change remained largely
unfulfilled. In the end, the regime's blatantly manipulative
tactics kept it from achieving its goals, instead spawning
corruption, deepening debt and social turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the very policies that Rafsanjani introduced to
win back the support of a war-weary public inadvertently
jump-started the process of the people's empowerment. The regime
sporadically tolerated cultural freedoms and relaxed some of its
social restrictions. It also facilitated a consumer spending spree
on imports by making credit available.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world soon flooded back in, through satellite
dishes, videos, computers and textbooks full of ideas. From that
point on, the tide of information could no longer be controlled,
regardless how hard Iranian conservatives and clerics tried.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Republic also overlapped with the end of the Cold
War, which Iranians felt deeply because of their shared border with
the Soviet Union. The collapse of Soviet rule _ in a country with
superpower resources _ sent a powerful warning about the
vulnerability of revolutionary regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Iran's upheaval was part of global change, including the
demise of communism in Europe, white rule in Africa and military
dictatorships in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's theocracy came to recognize that it was endangering its
own agenda by ignoring the state's real problems _ for example, its
``population policy.'' In the 1980s, millions of women had obeyed
the theocrats' dictate to breed a new Islamic generation that would
defend the revolution. In seven years Iran's population jumped from
34 million to more than 50 million; it is now 70 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the clerics soon realized that soaring population numbers
were more likely to undo the revolution than to save it. So they
introduced one of the world's most extensive family-planning
programs. Every form of birth control, from condoms and pills to
sterilization, became free.
</P>
<P>
   Today all couples have to undergo and pass a family-planning
course before obtaining a marriage license. Thousands of women
mobilized by the Health Ministry have gone door-to-door to explain
the necessity of birth control. Clerics, preaching the benefits of
small family size, have issued decrees approving everything from
intrauterine devices to vasectomies.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Third Republic (1997 to present). In the 1997 presidential
election, which had the highest turnout since the Iranian people
endorsed revolution, 70 percent of Iran's voters spurned the
theocrats' candidate of choice. Instead they elected a dark-horse
cleric named Mohammad Khatami, a former minister of culture and
Islamic guide who was purged in 1992 for ``liberalism'' and
''negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The election marked the burgeoning of what is by now a very
public fight for empowerment. The outcome of the Iranian elections
will at least partly reflect the degree of Khatami's success in
restoring the rule of law, fostering a civil society (two of his
campaign pledges), and wresting power from the religious
superstructure _ the theocratic part of Iran's system _ that limits
the government's powers.
</P>
<P>
   But more likely, Iran's future will be decided by the newly
energized popular forces that made Khatami's election possible in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Even clerics who have held high office and intellectuals who
were proteges of the Ayatollah Khomeini are now challenging the
religion's basic precepts as well as the specifics of theocratic
rule.
</P>
<P>
   For example, all of Tehran was engrossed last autumn in the
trial of Abdollah Nouri, a cleric and editor of the newspaper
Khordad, who served during the Third Republic as vice president,
interior minister and Tehran city councilor. The Special Court for
the Clergy charged him with multiple counts of ``insulting'' Islam,
the prophet Muhammad and the Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri, a close supporter of President Khatami, had run articles
in Khordad that questioned everything from the Islamic concept of
eye-for-eye justice to the clergy's automatic right to hold power.
At his trial, he astonished Iranians by denying the court's right
to judge him: ``I totally reject the court, its membership, and its
competence to conduct this trial, and any verdict you reach will
have no legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Nouri was sentenced to five years in prison.
His newspaper was banned, although his staff defiantly pledged to
launch another publication _ the new way of getting around forced
closures.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nouri, Mohsen Kadivar, a popular young cleric and professor
put on trial for ``disseminating lies and disturbing public
opinion'' by advocating the separation of political and religious
institutions, rejected the clergy's right to judge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being convicted and receiving an 18-month sentence,
Kadivar gained celebrity status. Posters of him were plastered all
over Tehran. Students held a candlelight vigil in the hills near
Evin prison, where he was being held without bail. Chanting
``freedom of thought, forever, forever,'' they released doves as a
symbol of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Like the world around it, Iran is still undergoing a profound
transformation. More internal turmoil lies ahead, as the
revolution's early passions are replaced by hard-earned pragmatism,
and as arrogance gives way to realism among many sectors of Iranian
society.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the government of God is being forced to cede to
secular statecraft _ and to empower Iranians.
</P>

   A generation after it seized power, Iran's revolutionary regime
is deeply troubled.

<P>
   It is fractured by intense political divisions, endangered by
economic disorder, discredited by rampant corruption and smothered
in social restrictions no longer acceptable to large sectors of the
changing population.

<P>
   Iranian women are by far the most politically active in the
Persian Gulf and are among the most empowered in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 200 women ran for the 270-seat parliament and 14 won.
In 1997, four women registered to run for the presidency. Although
all were disqualified by the Council of Guardians that vets
candidates, the decision was not based on gender.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Khatami's stunning upset victory in the 1997
presidential election, in which 70 percent of the voters said no to
the hard-line conservative candidate, would not have happened
without the female vote. And as president, Khatami appointed a
female vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 5,000 women ran in local elections, and 300 won. Today,
more than 40 percent of university students are female, as are
one-third of faculty members. Thousands of women educated after the
revolution work as engineers, doctors, scientists, lawyers and even
clerics. More than 340 directors-general in government ministries
are female.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has 140 female publishers, enough to hold an exhibition of
books and magazines published by women only. Women have become
painters, authors, designers, photographers, movie producers,
directors, stars and sculptors crafting ``anatomically correct''
female figures (otherwise known as nudes).
</P>
<P>
   A fierce women's movement was not what the theocrats had
intended to see as characteristic of Iran's Islamic revolution.
Their original goal was more akin to gender apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   After the revolution, the regime, in one way or another,
dismissed almost all women who earlier had risen to positions of
importance. A former female education minister was executed for
promoting ``prostitution'' among girls.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution's severe intentions were reflected in the new
Islamic dress code and the lowering _ to age 9 _ of the minimum age
at which women could be married. The new constitution also removed
critical women's rights in divorce and child-custody battles.
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, many of the country's restrictions on women
still border on the bizarre:
</P>
<P>
   _ A woman may have an equal vote in parliament or equal powers
among the vice presidents, but her testimony in court carries only
half the weight of a man's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women can head universities and publish newspapers but cannot
leave the country without their husbands' written permission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women can act in plays and movies alongside men, but they
cannot sing in public or ride in the same section of a public bus.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Iranian women have proven irrepressible. In
defiance of the theocracy, they are putting their imprints on
diverse aspects of Iranian life.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the mid-1990s, pressure from women changed laws on
employment, divorce and maternity leave. Women packed a courtroom
to protest child-custody laws after the brutal death of an
eight-year-old girl. She had weighed only 35 pounds and suffered a
fractured skull, two broken arms and burn marks over her body at
the hands of her father, a drug addict with a criminal record and a
documented history of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic tradition allows a mother to keep a daughter until the
age of seven and a son until the age of two; full custody then
switches to the father. In 1998 Parliament revised the law to
stipulate that a child could no longer be awarded to an unfit
father, defining the custody qualifications in a way that could
often disqualify men.
</P>
<P>
   Women have challenged other male bastions as well. Thousands of
women broke a long-time barrier preventing females from attending
male sporting events when they poured into Tehran's stadium to
greet the Iranian soccer team after it qualified for the 1998 World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Women are also playing sports. Tehran alone has 85 women's
basketball teams in five leagues. Only 10,000 women engaged in
intramural sports on the eve of the revolution. Today, 2 million
participate in soccer, basketball, swimming, tennis, handball,
skiing, aerobics, fencing, judo, shooting, volleyball, rowing,
horseback riding, gymnastics, golf, table tennis, karate, tae kwon
do and even water-skiing. This, despite the slightly absurd
waterproof coats and scarves women must wear to demonstrate
``modesty.''
</P>
<P>
   And women have forced the theocrats to acknowledge their
official participation. At the 1996 Olympics, for the first time, a
female athlete led the Iranian team onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   The new activists are as distinct as their political
environment. The most outspoken women are no longer necessarily
Westernized or upper-class elites, but have emerged from within the
revolution. Many are from traditional families, clerical circles
and rural areas _ none of which had previously produced female
activists.
</P>
<P>
   Women's publications have been brazen on reform issues. ``Zan''
(Woman) _ which the theocrats banned in 1999 _ was a newspaper
published by Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former President
Rafsanjani, and a member of parliament. It editorialized against
child-custody laws, the use of stoning as a punishment, and
``temporary marriage'' _ the practice of contracting a short-term
wife. It ran an expose on the return of prostitution and reported
on a New Year's message sent to the country by the former empress
of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Another publication, ``Farzaneh,'' is trying to reconcile more
robust women's rights with the Islamic faith. Its articles have
included ``Human Rights of Women in Islam,'' ``A History of Silence
and Debates Today,'' ``How to Proceed'' and ``The Long Way Ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian cinema, which often focuses on women, has led a major
countercultural revolution since the early 1990s. We find female
movie characters who are challenging the status quo, plots that
focus on the shortcomings of the Islamic system and dialogue that
extends the boundaries of public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Dariush Mehrjui, the father of modern Iranian cinema, wrote a
quartet of films _ ``Banoo'' (1992), ``Sara'' (1993), ``Pari''
(1995) and ``Leila'' (1997) _ about the professional and personal
plight of women in Islamic society. Each ended with the lead female
character defying convention or leaving her husband to head out on
her own _ a radical move in a society where women must get written

   Mohsen Makhmalbaf, who spent five years in the shah's jails, was
known in the 1980s for ardently religious and pro-revolution films.
But his seventh film, ``A Time to Love,'' was a controversial tale
_ with three endings based on three perspectives _ about a married
woman who pursues a younger man.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Makhmalbaf's teen-age daughter Samira made her film
debut with ``The Apple,'' the true story of an illiterate man who
had locked his 12-year-old twin daughters at home since infancy,
for fear that the girls' purity would be spoiled by strange men's
gazes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie revolved around the gradual exposure of the girls _
almost mute, unschooled and both physically and mentally disabled _
to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the film to make this point: All it takes to imprison
many, many women is one man,'' Samira told reporters when the film
opened in New York in 1999. ``What I noticed about those two girls
is that the more they came into contact with society, the more
complete they became as human beings. For me, that became a
metaphor for all women. Women in Iran are like springs. If they
want to be free, and if they try, they burst out with a lot of
energy.''

<P>
   Iranian women are by far the most politically active in the
Persian Gulf and are among the most empowered in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 200 women ran for the 270-seat parliament and 14 won.
In 1997, four women registered to run for the presidency. Although
all were disqualified by the Council of Guardians that vets
candidates, the decision was not based on gender.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Khatami's stunning upset victory in the 1997
presidential election, in which 70 percent of the voters said no to
the hard-line conservative candidate, would not have happened
without the female vote. And as president, Khatami appointed a
female vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 5,000 women ran in local elections, and 300 won. Today,
more than 40 percent of university students are female, as are
one-third of faculty members. Thousands of women educated after the
revolution work as engineers, doctors, scientists, lawyers and even
clerics. More than 340 directors-general in government ministries
are female.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has 140 female publishers, enough to hold an exhibition of
books and magazines published by women only. Women have become
painters, authors, designers, photographers, movie producers,
directors, stars and sculptors crafting ``anatomically correct''
female figures (otherwise known as nudes).
</P>
<P>
   A fierce women's movement was not what the theocrats had
intended to see as characteristic of Iran's Islamic revolution.
Their original goal was more akin to gender apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   After the revolution, the regime, in one way or another,
dismissed almost all women who earlier had risen to positions of
importance. A former female education minister was executed for
promoting ``prostitution'' among girls.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution's severe intentions were reflected in the new
Islamic dress code and the lowering _ to age 9 _ of the minimum age
at which women could be married. The new constitution also removed
critical women's rights in divorce and child-custody battles.
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, many of the country's restrictions on women
still border on the bizarre:
</P>
<P>
   _ A woman may have an equal vote in parliament or equal powers
among the vice presidents, but her testimony in court carries only
half the weight of a man's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women can head universities and publish newspapers but cannot
leave the country without their husbands' written permission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women can act in plays and movies alongside men, but they
cannot sing in public or ride in the same section of a public bus.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Iranian women have proven irrepressible. In
defiance of the theocracy, they are putting their imprints on
diverse aspects of Iranian life.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the mid-1990s, pressure from women changed laws on
employment, divorce and maternity leave. Women packed a courtroom
to protest child-custody laws after the brutal death of an
eight-year-old girl. She had weighed only 35 pounds and suffered a
fractured skull, two broken arms and burn marks over her body at
the hands of her father, a drug addict with a criminal record and a
documented history of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic tradition allows a mother to keep a daughter until the
age of seven and a son until the age of two; full custody then
switches to the father. In 1998 Parliament revised the law to
stipulate that a child could no longer be awarded to an unfit
father, defining the custody qualifications in a way that could
often disqualify men.
</P>
<P>
   Women have challenged other male bastions as well. Thousands of
women broke a long-time barrier preventing females from attending
male sporting events when they poured into Tehran's stadium to
greet the Iranian soccer team after it qualified for the 1998 World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Women are also playing sports. Tehran alone has 85 women's
basketball teams in five leagues. Only 10,000 women engaged in
intramural sports on the eve of the revolution. Today, 2 million
participate in soccer, basketball, swimming, tennis, handball,
skiing, aerobics, fencing, judo, shooting, volleyball, rowing,
horseback riding, gymnastics, golf, table tennis, karate, tae kwon
do and even water-skiing. This, despite the slightly absurd
waterproof coats and scarves women must wear to demonstrate
``modesty.''
</P>
<P>
   And women have forced the theocrats to acknowledge their
official participation. At the 1996 Olympics, for the first time, a
female athlete led the Iranian team onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   The new activists are as distinct as their political
environment. The most outspoken women are no longer necessarily
Westernized or upper-class elites, but have emerged from within the
revolution. Many are from traditional families, clerical circles
and rural areas _ none of which had previously produced female
activists.
</P>
<P>
   Women's publications have been brazen on reform issues. ``Zan''
(Woman) _ which the theocrats banned in 1999 _ was a newspaper
published by Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former President
Rafsanjani, and a member of parliament. It editorialized against
child-custody laws, the use of stoning as a punishment, and
``temporary marriage'' _ the practice of contracting a short-term
wife. It ran an expose on the return of prostitution and reported
on a New Year's message sent to the country by the former empress
of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Another publication, ``Farzaneh,'' is trying to reconcile more
robust women's rights with the Islamic faith. Its articles have
included ``Human Rights of Women in Islam,'' ``A History of Silence
and Debates Today,'' ``How to Proceed'' and ``The Long Way Ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian cinema, which often focuses on women, has led a major
countercultural revolution since the early 1990s. We find female
movie characters who are challenging the status quo, plots that
focus on the shortcomings of the Islamic system and dialogue that
extends the boundaries of public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Dariush Mehrjui, the father of modern Iranian cinema, wrote a
quartet of films _ ``Banoo'' (1992), ``Sara'' (1993), ``Pari''
(1995) and ``Leila'' (1997) _ about the professional and personal
plight of women in Islamic society. Each ended with the lead female
character defying convention or leaving her husband to head out on
her own _ a radical move in a society where women must get written
permission to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen Makhmalbaf, who spent five years in the shah's jails, was
known in the 1980s for ardently religious and pro-revolution films.
But his seventh film, ``A Time to Love,'' was a controversial tale
_ with three endings based on three perspectives _ about a married

</P>

   Ahmed Chalabi, 55, is the head of the Iraqi National Congress,
the once and, for now, future guiding body of the Iraqi opposition
to Saddam Hussein. As such, he is also the closest thing either the
Clinton administration or its Republican opponents have to a
strategy for replacing the failed U.S. policy of containing Iraq.
Aside from brutal in-fighting, though, the opposition has one major
problem. It still hasn't figured out a way to outsmart Saddam.

   Ahmed Chalabi, 55, is the head of the Iraqi National Congress,
the once and, for now, future guiding body of the Iraqi opposition
to Saddam Hussein. As such, he is also the closest thing either the
Clinton administration or its Republican opponents have to a
strategy for replacing the failed U.S. policy of containing Iraq.
Aside from brutal in-fighting, though, the opposition has one major
problem. It still hasn't figured out a way to outsmart Saddam.

   As the primaries go wholesale across the country, it will become
even more painfully obvious how much money talks. Money talked on
buttons, billboards, bands and bumper stickers in Iowa and New
Hampshire, but it now drowns out every other medium as it shouts
with television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if money is speech, then political money is political
speech. And political speech is protected by the First Amendment:
``Congress shall make no law. ...'' _ right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly, the Supreme Court keeps saying. To help curb
the corrupt influence of political money, the court has too
cleverly maintained for a generation that money doesn't actually
speak; it only enables speech.
</P>
<P>
   So when candidates use money to promote themselves, it reasons,
their dollars are as instrumental as their vocal cords and may
never be constrained. But it's OK to put some limits on money
contributed to a candidate, the court thinks, because a donor's
views are no less clearly expressed with a gift of a thousand
dollars than of a million.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of this splitting of First Amendment hairs have
been horrendous.
</P>
<P>
   Unlimited spending has resulted in unlimited television combat.
The candidates with the most money _ their own or their patrons' _
get to speak the loudest. And the biggest donors gain the greatest
influence over public affairs. The system mocks the Supreme Court's
once proud assertion of the rule of ``one person, one vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians have to spend their days soliciting
contributions and redeeming promises made to contributors.
Millionaires can be spared this corruption but, like Steve Forbes
or Ross Perot, get to meddle in contests for which they would never
otherwise qualify.
</P>
<P>
   More perniciously still, well-heeled contributors and interest
groups that seek political power routinely collude with needy
office-seekers to find new paths around the hollow contribution
limits.
</P>
<P>
   They ``bundle'' hundreds of checks from corporate employees or
union members to turn small gifts into conspicuous six-figure
offerings. Or they make in-kind contributions of incalculable
worth, providing planes, cars, computers and troops to wage the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest of all to police is so-called soft money. In cynical
disregard of legal limits, big donors have learned to channel vast
sums to national and state political parties, which then buy
television ads that falsely claim to be uncoordinated with the
candidates who benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of reform, congressional majorities have tried to
outlaw soft money. But that is a futile effort; whatever Congress
or the Supreme Court may decide, political money will always flow,
like water, into the thirsty soil of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Close the party pipeline and the ads will be bought instead by a
gaggle of new ``committees'' and ``associations,'' all aimed at
supporting or attacking specific candidates. And as long as
candidates need enormous sums, they will give excessive weight to
the interests of their big contributors. (In New York this year,
two already well-known contenders for the Senate, who command the
full resources of the White House and New York's City Hall, will
nonetheless spend about $50 million, much of it from donors who
want access and extensive favors.)
</P>
<P>
   In again addressing the issue a few weeks ago, the nine justices
of the Supreme Court wrote five separate opinions, all revealing an
obvious guilt about the confusion and corruption to which they have
contributed. Ruling on a relatively minor case from Missouri, a
majority of six justices reaffirmed the hair-split that permits
limits on contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the six thought the court's past rulings may still
leave room for constitutional spending limits as well. Two other
justices said all limits were intolerable. And Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy, acknowledging an evil mess, wanted to flee from past
rulings and give Congress one more shot at finding a way to limit
both contributions and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Failing that, he thinks (like many Republicans in Congress) that
instant disclosure of contributions would avert most corruption.
This naively assumes that the public could quickly find the true
sponsors and motives of the charmingly named Do-Good and
All-American associations that flourish every electoral season.
</P>
<P>
   There simply is no effective way to stop the flow of money from
donors intent on buying influence over public servants and policy.
It's the office-seekers' need to buy costly television ads that
needs to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of all political TV ads this year will approach $2
billion. It would be cheaper by far for taxpayers to pay for
commercials directly than to suffer the payoffs the winners must
make with huge tax breaks and subsidies. Congress could even demand
free air time to match every purchased minute, as it has done in
its antidrug propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   But an even happier remedy would be to chase all those noisy,
mendacious ads off the air. Political commercials should be
burdened with the fairness doctrine that used to be imposed on TV
editorials and commercial ads. A simple rule that every political
ad must pay for equal time for an opposing view would either level
the playing field or eliminate most 30-second spots.
</P>
<P>
   In their place, society has a right to demand that national
networks and local stations redeem their debt for the use of the
public spectrum by giving candidates ample free time to introduce
themselves and their views.
</P>
<P>
   A government-sponsored commission that studied the problem of
fair campaigning recommended last year that TV stations voluntarily
provide a mere five minutes each night for ``candidate discourse''
on the 30 nights preceding elections _ if only to compensate for
television's shameful abandonment of serious political news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But hardly any broadcasters heeded the plea. Even if they did,
that proposal alone would do nothing to reduce the candidates' need
for money to buy commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Whether defined as direct or indirect speech, money is property.
By requiring our politicians to command huge sums for TV
campaigning, we have in effect erected a property requirement _ a
means test _ for public service.
</P>
<P>
   We have created a system of pay and payoff that forces
officeholders to sell their favor to moneyed elites, raising the
taxes and diminishing the voice of most Americans.

 &HT;    
 By JACK HITT  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was only two years ago that Bob Dole went on ``The Larry King
Show'' to discuss his prostate-cancer operation.
 &HT;    During a commercial break, so the story goes, King leaned over
to ask his old friend, confidentially, how he was dealing with the
operation's grimmest side effect, impotence.
 &HT;    Dole cheerfully informed the talk-show host that there was a new
drug, Viagra, and miraculously, it had cured the problem. King
asked Dole if he would discuss it on the air, and Dole said sure,
why not?
 &HT;    The world was about to become a very different place. Viagra
would cycle through the expected paces of pop-culture acceptance
with stunning speed.
 &HT;    Leno and Letterman got an entire summer's worth of monologues
off the subject. And the newspapers regularly pumped out clowning
(and possibly true) stories about the drug. For example, there was
Frank Bernardo, 70, who left his wife, declaring, ``It's time for
me to be a stud again.'' There was also Gen. Sani Abacha of
Nigeria, who died in the midst of a Viagra-fueled encounter with
two women in his magisterial bed.
 &HT;    But the jokes are over. Viagra's sales topped $1 billion in the
first year and Pfizer is now the second-largest drug company in the
world. The drug's use has leveled off, but consider the level:
Nearly 200,000 prescriptions are filled each week, and 17 million
Americans have used the drug.
 &HT;    Viagra has been embraced by the well off (4 percent of the total
population of Palm Beach County has a prescription), but not only
by the well off. Not long ago, Wal-Mart and Kmart had a Viagra war
that drove the per-pill price down from $10 to $7.80.
 &HT;    At this moment, there are at least a dozen new Viagra-like
medicines and devices currently in clinical trials.
 &HT;    Many of these drugs are for men, but this time around, there are
just as many for women _ specifically, for a new phylum of illness,
female sexual dysfunction, which will soon cycle through the same
paces as ``erectile dysfunction,'' setting the word ``frigidity''
alongside ``impotence'' in our dictionary of merry old archaisms.
 &HT;    ``Our knowledge of sexual health is in revolutionary mode,''
says Dr. Irwin Goldstein, a Boston University urologist and pioneer
in the field.
 &HT;    With $1 billion in sales for Viagra, the research pressure is
intense, yielding paper titles like ``The Ejaculatory Behavior in
Sexually Sluggish Male Rats. ...'' Scientists, doctors and
pharmaceutical companies are racing to discover newer and better
drugs.
 &HT;    Who doubts they will improve the lives of those who suffer from
the newly discovered sexual disorders now showing up in the medical
journals? But these drugs will also have, some say, an
''enhancing'' effect on normally functioning people.
 &HT;    More important, the temptation for anyone to obtain these drugs
will be more easily satisfied than ever before because the family
of pharmaceuticals inspired by Viagra is entering the market at a
time when medicine is decentralizing, slipping the reins long held
by doctors.
 &HT;    For most of the 20th century, any sexual complaint was treated
on the psychiatric couch, not in the lab. Only comparatively
recently has impotence been understood to be an organic disease _
potentially identifiable and treatable with medicine.
 &HT;    The change is part of a cultural shift that dates back to the
birth-control pill, when mostly young people were liberated to
experiment with sex fearlessly outside of marriage. Many moral
conservatives continue to condemn the era for unleashing the
Pandoran epidemics of teen-age pregnancy, sexually transmitted
disease and moral decline.
 &HT;    But this telling of the story ignores a more subtle and
significant shift.
 &HT;    Average folks _ young and old, liberal and conservative _ began
to accept that sex was not a biblical imperative whose sole aim is
procreation, but a lively part of good health _ something to be
enjoyed, like great food and laughter, well into old age. This is
the revolution that Dole has joined at the barricades.
 &HT;    The distinction is not just medical; it's metaphysical.
Psychological problems carry with them the full freight of personal
responsibility. But a physical problem seems more like a cosmic
error, something unrelated to a person's actions.
 &HT;    It's no flaw in your manhood or womanhood if your sexual organs
don't work. It's a ``disorder'' _ and by being labeled as one, it
becomes something detached from your own true self and easier for a
patient to emotionally confront and for a doctor to treat.
 &HT;    Indeed, now that Dole has made the world safe for sexual-health
research, new hypotheses and fresh ideas seem commonplace in this
growing new field.
 &HT;    And many of the cutting-edge discoveries are occurring for
women. Last year, the Journal of the American Medical Association
published a study reporting that 43 percent of women experience
some kind of sexual dysfunction.
 &HT;    Recently, the Network for Excellence in Women's Sexual Health
was organized to help doctors and health care professionals who
want to enter this area of practice. Tests and experiments are
being conducted in university labs and corporate R-and-D facilities
all over the country.
 &HT;    The cumulative lesson of much of this research is leading to two
categories of treatments _ hormone therapy, which restores desire,
and various drugs, which amplify the sensation of arousal.
 &HT;    Many companies are researching hormone medicines. Solvay already
markets one called Estratest. Organon is in trials with a treatment
called tibolone, which is believed to increase desire. Dr. Glenn
Braunstein, an endocrinologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles, is working on a ``testosterone patch'' under grants
from the marketing giant Procter &AMP; Gamble.
 &HT;    But the real gold rush is occurring in the other field of
research _ creating a drug to increase blood flow to the genitals.
The researchers want something simple _ a tablet or perhaps even
better, a quick-acting cream that is stabilized at room temperature
so that women can carry it in a purse like lipstick or men can just
toss it into a shaving kit.
 &HT;    The competition is furious among small firms, each with a
blood-flow drug _ some for men, some for women _ that's anywhere
from one to five years from getting to market. Herewith a sampling,
complete with active ingredients:
 &HT;    -- Vivus: prostaglandin E-1 cream.
 &HT;    -- MacroChem: a gel, using a version of prostaglandin E-1 called
Topiglan.
 &HT;    -- NexMed: alprostadil, a variant of prostaglandin E-1 cream.
 &HT;    -- Tap Pharmaceuticals: an apomorphine treatment formulated into
a small tablet placed under the tongue.
 &HT;    -- Pentech Pharmaceutical: ditto.
 &HT;    -- Zonagen: phentolamine, in tablets and suppositories.
 &HT;    -- Pfizer: Viagra for women (sildenafil).
 &HT;    -- Palatin Technologies: a peptide molecule derivative called
PT-14; in the earliest test stages.
 &HT;    -- ICOS Corp.: a tablet code-named IC351. (That's all they would
reveal.) Bill Gates, who may be telling us something, owns almost
13 percent of the company.
 &HT;    I wanted to compile a complete list of every sex drug currently
in trials. But it became an endless pursuit, the research being so
frenetic and the line between legitimate and illegitimate being so
confusing.
 &HT;    Obviously, once hard science ratified the actual existence of a
drug like Viagra, the very reality of it was a wake-up call to
America's snake-oil salesmen. Infomercials have shifted from
vegetable slicers and wrinkle tonics to ``natural'' aphrodisiacs.
There is scarcely a tree left standing in the rain forest whose
bark hasn't been stripped and tested for the alternative-health
industry.
 &HT;    The Internet is teeming with unsolicited ads for products with
vaguely homonymic names, though none of them come close to Pfizer's
allegedly unintended melding of ``vital'' and ``Niagara'' to
generate the best product name since Coke.
 &HT;    Some long-touted aphrodisiacs are now being tested too. A
derivative of chili peppers is in legitimate trials. Does this
count as a drug?
 &HT;    NitroMed, a company based in Massachusetts, is working on a
mixture of an old passion powder called yohimbe (stripped from the
inner bark of the Corynanthe yohimbe tree in tropical West Africa)
combined with an amino acid called L-Arginine to see if the two can
work effectively as a vasodilator _ that is, a chemical that
increases blood flow.
 &HT;    Then there are the nondrug inventions. A company called
UroMetrics is working on a vacuum device, fitted with a small cup
the size of a thimble, and intended to draw blood directly to the
clitoris. It might be easy to dismiss this as a sex toy, except
that it's also in trials for FDA approval, and UroMetrics intends
to distribute it only as a medical device via prescription.
 &HT;    The pace of change inside this small research world also means
that almost no one is stopping to reflect on the implications of
the drugs that are marching _ and there really is no stopping them
now _ toward the marketplace.
 &HT;    It would be nice if all medical breakthroughs were just to treat
the kind of complaints outlined by doctors. But welcome to the
world of 21st-century consumer needs; there's ``medicine'' for the
most curious things. With couples holding down two jobs and the
enraged pace of modern life, who doubts that a drug-enhanced
four-minute sexual encounter among harried day traders could become
the norm?
 &HT;    The whole idea of a long slow evening won't necessarily
disappear. It'll just go the way of sitting on the porch, the 3
o'clock dinner and the literary novel _ something experienced over
the holidays or on vacation.
 &HT;    ``I find it simply incredible this whole thing is happening,''
said Leonore Tiefer, a psychologist at the New York University
School of Medicine and pretty much the only critic of all this
research I could find. ``There is no such thing as 'female sexual
dysfunction,''' she added. ``It's a social construction invented to
benefit the drug companies.''
 &HT;    Tiefer believes that a kind of ``magical thinking'' infects the
way most of us imagine our sexuality. That it can always be better,
and that we resist the natural changes that define the arc of a
well-lived life: ``That's where this disorder comes in and says,
'If there is a change' _ and invariably there is a change in life _
'then change is bad.' Ah, a problem! So we invent a universal
model, a normative view of sex. If you don't get wet for X period
of seconds from Y pressure of stimulation, then you have a
problem.''
 &HT;    Tiefer was evasive when I asked her about the existence of real
medical conditions being cured by these new drugs. She believes the
medicalization of sex gives people an out _ a way to avoid the root
cause of their sexual problems.
 &HT;    ``I don't see many women depressed about the blood flow to the
genitalia. They are depressed about many other things about sex,
but not that. This research should be done, of course, but with a
few dollars, by a few people, in a few places. But it should not be
this Boeing of sex research.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, many researchers dismiss Tiefer's ideas as
rear-guard propaganda to protect the sex concession that therapists
have held for so long. Fears that the medical establishment will
big-foot the psychologists' business is not an imaginary concern
these days.
 &HT;    The central theme of Peter Kramer's now-classic book,
``Listening to Prozac,'' is the observation that, in the treatment
of depression, drug therapy has driven talk therapy right out of
business.
 &HT;    Beyond the idea of making sex into a very goal-oriented act,
where Viagra and its progeny are truly revolutionary is in putting
something mysterious and uncontrollable under our control. These
drugs suddenly enable us to ``control'' our own sexual health,
pushing the idea of sexuality far beyond the lab or the couch.
Tiefer's ideas seem to presume that these medical inventions will
stay under the strict control of doctors, that the old rules of the
medical-industrial complex still apply.
 &HT;    But the Golden Age of the AMA is over. The appearance of Viagra
has taken place at a time when medicine itself is in the process of
decentralizing and allowing market forces to guide many decisions.
 &HT;    Increasingly, patients are told to take charge of their own
health care; politicians debate a ``patient's bill of rights.''
HMOs themselves are built on the idea that individuals will decide
the general direction of their own care. Doctors are increasingly
called health-care ``providers'' as drugs are now marketed directly
to patients.
 &HT;    Viagra was one of the first new drugs introduced to the world
alongside the slogan: ``Ask your doctor about. ...''
 &HT;    In this loosey-goosey environment, Viagra has already slipped
into the recreational underground _ far beyond the reach of both
psychologists and doctors. Of course, the authorities have tried to
crack down on the practice of selling pharmaceuticals online. And
in December, President Clinton called on the FDA to take measures
to stop the practice.
 &HT;    But controlling the Web is futile, as I discovered one day last
winter when I typed ``Viagra and aphrodisiac'' into a search engine
and was offered hundreds of choices. The Web sites sound like
jokes: ``drugman.com'' and ``mywebdr.com'' and ``viagraguys.com.''
 &HT;    I opted to get my fix from a Web site called ``kwikmed.com.''
 &HT;    After I signed on _ I waited while this message scrolled by:
``Brought to you by Tide Detergent'' _ I was instructed to fill out
an on-line medical interview.
 &HT;    I was asked obvious questions, like ``Are you taking any heart
medication?'' I told the truth and said no. I was asked only a
couple of private questions, but I admitted to no dysfunction
whatsoever.
 &HT;    Only one question was devoted to ascertaining my ``problem.'' So
I wrote: ``Life is not as good as it should be'' _ a philosophical
statement I have pretty much always lived by. When I clicked the
box marked Send, I instantaneously received a message back saying
my doctor had ``approved me for Viagra,'' unless of course my
credit card didn't clear.
 &HT;    The next morning, at the crack of the workday, barely 12 hours
after I had clicked the send button, the FedEx guy appeared with an
envelope that rattled when he handed it to me. In a brown bottle
were 10 of the famous blue diamond-shaped pills. The crooked label
looked as if it had been produced on an Officemax printer. My
doctor was someone named ``A. Guzman.''
 &HT;    As we permit more and more market forces to take command of the
health-care industry, it shouldn't surprise anyone that the new
drug dealer will not be found in the shadows, offering sinsemilla
under his breath. He's already sitting right on our desks, his
cursor winking at us.

 By JACK HITT  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was only two years ago that Bob Dole went on ``The Larry King
Show'' to discuss his prostate-cancer operation.
 &HT;    During a commercial break, so the story goes, King leaned over
to ask his old friend, confidentially, how he was dealing with the
operation's grimmest side effect, impotence.
 &HT;    Dole cheerfully informed the talk-show host that there was a new
drug, Viagra, and miraculously, it had cured the problem. King
asked Dole if he would discuss it on the air, and Dole said sure,
why not?
 &HT;    The world was about to become a very different place. Viagra
would cycle through the expected paces of pop-culture acceptance
with stunning speed.
 &HT;    Leno and Letterman got an entire summer's worth of monologues
off the subject. And the newspapers regularly pumped out clowning
(and possibly true) stories about the drug. For example, there was
Frank Bernardo, 70, who left his wife, declaring, ``It's time for
me to be a stud again.'' There was also Gen. Sani Abacha of
Nigeria, who died in the midst of a Viagra-fueled encounter with
two women in his magisterial bed.
 &HT;    But the jokes are over. Viagra's sales topped $1 billion in the
first year and Pfizer is now the second-largest drug company in the
world. The drug's use has leveled off, but consider the level:
Nearly 200,000 prescriptions are filled each week, and 17 million
Americans have used the drug.
 &HT;    Viagra has been embraced by the well off (4 percent of the total
population of Palm Beach County has a prescription), but not only
by the well off. Not long ago, Wal-Mart and Kmart had a Viagra war
that drove the per-pill price down from $10 to $7.80.
 &HT;    At this moment, there are at least a dozen new Viagra-like
medicines and devices currently in clinical trials.
 &HT;    Many of these drugs are for men, but this time around, there are
just as many for women _ specifically, for a new phylum of illness,
female sexual dysfunction, which will soon cycle through the same
paces as ``erectile dysfunction,'' setting the word ``frigidity''
alongside ``impotence'' in our dictionary of merry old archaisms.
 &HT;    ``Our knowledge of sexual health is in revolutionary mode,''
says Dr. Irwin Goldstein, a Boston University urologist and pioneer
in the field.
 &HT;    With $1 billion in sales for Viagra, the research pressure is
intense, yielding paper titles like ``The Ejaculatory Behavior in
Sexually Sluggish Male Rats. ...'' Scientists, doctors and
pharmaceutical companies are racing to discover newer and better
drugs.
 &HT;    Who doubts they will improve the lives of those who suffer from
the newly discovered sexual disorders now showing up in the medical
journals? But these drugs will also have, some say, an
''enhancing'' effect on normally functioning people.
 &HT;    More important, the temptation for anyone to obtain these drugs
will be more easily satisfied than ever before because the family
of pharmaceuticals inspired by Viagra is entering the market at a
time when medicine is decentralizing, slipping the reins long held
by doctors.
 &HT;    For most of the 20th century, any sexual complaint was treated
on the psychiatric couch, not in the lab. Only comparatively
recently has impotence been understood to be an organic disease _
potentially identifiable and treatable with medicine.
 &HT;    The change is part of a cultural shift that dates back to the
birth-control pill, when mostly young people were liberated to
experiment with sex fearlessly outside of marriage. Many moral
conservatives continue to condemn the era for unleashing the
Pandoran epidemics of teen-age pregnancy, sexually transmitted
disease and moral decline.
 &HT;    But this telling of the story ignores a more subtle and
significant shift.
 &HT;    Average folks _ young and old, liberal and conservative _ began
to accept that sex was not a biblical imperative whose sole aim is
procreation, but a lively part of good health _ something to be
enjoyed, like great food and laughter, well into old age. This is
the revolution that Dole has joined at the barricades.
 &HT;    The distinction is not just medical; it's metaphysical.
Psychological problems carry with them the full freight of personal
responsibility. But a physical problem seems more like a cosmic
error, something unrelated to a person's actions.
 &HT;    It's no flaw in your manhood or womanhood if your sexual organs
don't work. It's a ``disorder'' _ and by being labeled as one, it
becomes something detached from your own true self and easier for a
patient to emotionally confront and for a doctor to treat.
 &HT;    Indeed, now that Dole has made the world safe for sexual-health
research, new hypotheses and fresh ideas seem commonplace in this
growing new field.
 &HT;    And many of the cutting-edge discoveries are occurring for
women. Last year, the Journal of the American Medical Association
published a study reporting that 43 percent of women experience
some kind of sexual dysfunction.
 &HT;    Recently, the Network for Excellence in Women's Sexual Health
was organized to help doctors and health care professionals who
want to enter this area of practice. Tests and experiments are
being conducted in university labs and corporate R-and-D facilities
all over the country.
 &HT;    The cumulative lesson of much of this research is leading to two
categories of treatments _ hormone therapy, which restores desire,
and various drugs, which amplify the sensation of arousal.
 &HT;    Many companies are researching hormone medicines. Solvay already
markets one called Estratest. Organon is in trials with a treatment
called tibolone, which is believed to increase desire. Dr. Glenn
Braunstein, an endocrinologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles, is working on a ``testosterone patch'' under grants
from the marketing giant Procter &AMP; Gamble.
 &HT;    But the real gold rush is occurring in the other field of
research _ creating a drug to increase blood flow to the genitals.
The researchers want something simple _ a tablet or perhaps even
better, a quick-acting cream that is stabilized at room temperature
so that women can carry it in a purse like lipstick or men can just
toss it into a shaving kit.
 &HT;    The competition is furious among small firms, each with a
blood-flow drug _ some for men, some for women _ that's anywhere
from one to five years from getting to market. Herewith a sampling,
complete with active ingredients:
 &HT;    -- Vivus: prostaglandin E-1 cream.
 &HT;    -- MacroChem: a gel, using a version of prostaglandin E-1 called
Topiglan.
 &HT;    -- NexMed: alprostadil, a variant of prostaglandin E-1 cream.
 &HT;    -- Tap Pharmaceuticals: an apomorphine treatment formulated into
a small tablet placed under the tongue.
 &HT;    -- Pentech Pharmaceutical: ditto.
 &HT;    -- Zonagen: phentolamine, in tablets and suppositories.
 &HT;    -- Pfizer: Viagra for women (sildenafil).
 &HT;    -- Palatin Technologies: a peptide molecule derivative called
PT-14; in the earliest test stages.
 &HT;    -- ICOS Corp.: a tablet code-named IC351. (That's all they would
reveal.) Bill Gates, who may be telling us something, owns almost
13 percent of the company.
 &HT;    I wanted to compile a complete list of every sex drug currently
in trials. But it became an endless pursuit, the research being so
frenetic and the line between legitimate and illegitimate being so
confusing.
 &HT;    Obviously, once hard science ratified the actual existence of a
drug like Viagra, the very reality of it was a wake-up call to
America's snake-oil salesmen. Infomercials have shifted from
vegetable slicers and wrinkle tonics to ``natural'' aphrodisiacs.
There is scarcely a tree left standing in the rain forest whose
bark hasn't been stripped and tested for the alternative-health
industry.
 &HT;    The Internet is teeming with unsolicited ads for products with
vaguely homonymic names, though none of them come close to Pfizer's
allegedly unintended melding of ``vital'' and ``Niagara'' to
generate the best product name since Coke.
 &HT;    Some long-touted aphrodisiacs are now being tested too. A
derivative of chili peppers is in legitimate trials. Does this
count as a drug?
 &HT;    NitroMed, a company based in Massachusetts, is working on a
mixture of an old passion powder called yohimbe (stripped from the
inner bark of the Corynanthe yohimbe tree in tropical West Africa)
combined with an amino acid called L-Arginine to see if the two can
work effectively as a vasodilator _ that is, a chemical that
increases blood flow.
 &HT;    Then there are the nondrug inventions. A company called
UroMetrics is working on a vacuum device, fitted with a small cup
the size of a thimble, and intended to draw blood directly to the
clitoris. It might be easy to dismiss this as a sex toy, except
that it's also in trials for FDA approval, and UroMetrics intends
to distribute it only as a medical device via prescription.
 &HT;    The pace of change inside this small research world also means
that almost no one is stopping to reflect on the implications of
the drugs that are marching _ and there really is no stopping them
now _ toward the marketplace.
 &HT;    It would be nice if all medical breakthroughs were just to treat
the kind of complaints outlined by doctors. But welcome to the
world of 21st-century consumer needs; there's ``medicine'' for the
most curious things. With couples holding down two jobs and the
enraged pace of modern life, who doubts that a drug-enhanced
four-minute sexual encounter among harried day traders could become
the norm?
 &HT;    The whole idea of a long slow evening won't necessarily
disappear. It'll just go the way of sitting on the porch, the 3
o'clock dinner and the literary novel _ something experienced over
the holidays or on vacation.
 &HT;    ``I find it simply incredible this whole thing is happening,''
said Leonore Tiefer, a psychologist at the New York University
School of Medicine and pretty much the only critic of all this
research I could find. ``There is no such thing as 'female sexual

 By JANINE di GIOVANNI  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Ahmed Chalabi, a Shiite Muslim from a prominent Baghdad family,
is by turns haughty and brooding, princely and strangely
preoccupied.
 &HT;    In the cold weather, he goes about London in a goatskin robe,
which he likes to flick grandly behind him, and Gore-Tex hiking
boots. But while he may look like some tribal elder who wandered
down from the hills (in trendy shoes), he holds a Ph.D. in
mathematics from the University of Chicago and is fluent in several
languages.
 &HT;    He is also the closest thing either the Clinton administration
or its Republican opponents have to a strategy for replacing the
failed policy of containing Saddam Hussein.
 &HT;    Chalabi, 55, is the head of the Iraqi National Congress (INC),
the once and, for now, future guiding body of the Iraqi oppositionto Saddam Hussein.
 &HT;    Pushed aside as leader early last year, Chalabi managed to
reclaim his position at a general assembly of the INC in New York
this fall.
 &HT;    And that, it bears mentioning, was no easy task. The 300-plus
delegates who met at a Manhattan hotel had arrived from Britain,
Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey
and Canada. And they shared little but a history of backstabbing
and mistrust.
 &HT;    In truth, they gathered only to prove to their American patrons
that they were still collectively committed to overthrowing the
only person they loathe more than one another _ the devil in
Baghdad.
 &HT;    In flowing robes and cheap shiny suits, the delegates
distributed ``Free Iraq'' T-shirts and squabbled. They argued
throughout the weekend _ over the buffet dinner, over mint tea and
over the fax machine spewing out messages from across the world.
 &HT;    Yet somehow, by dawn on Monday morning, they managed to conclude
the general assembly by electing a new seven-man leadership, and
with a minimal amount of blood on the floor.
 &HT;    But not before Chalabi had walked out several times in disgust.
 &HT;    ``It was not a pretty sight,'' one delegate said. ``They threw
shoes at each other. I couldn't believe it. They took off their
shoes and threw them at each other.''
 &HT;    Yes, they threw shoes because they are desperate. With
Washington acting as midwife, the organization is now under serious
pressure to get results.
 &HT;    Saddam is now exercising virtual veto power on U.N. weapons
inspectors and, with an impending U.S. presidential election, the
Democrats are anxious to have something, anything, they can
plausibly hold up as a pro-active Iraq policy.
 &HT;    At the same time, the Republicans, eager to pre-empt the
Democrats, are claiming it was their idea to back the INC and that
they had to push the Clinton administration into getting behind it.
 &HT;    With both U.S. political parties competing to patronize the INC,
it would seem to be well positioned to make good on the promise of
fomenting an Iraqi revolution. But it doesn't seem any closer now
to that goal than it did eight years ago, when it was formed in the
wake of the Persian Gulf war.
 &HT;    Although Congress appropriated $97 million to bankroll the seven
main Iraqi opposition groups, the money has remained in Washington
as the groups have jockeyed for power. That struggle seems to be in
abeyance.
 &HT;    The INC still has one major problem, however. It hasn't figured
out a way to outsmart the Iraqi dictator. ``Saddam kills anyone he
doesn't trust,'' says one observer. ``He squashes opposition like a
bug.''
 &HT;    In its short and painful life the Iraqi National Congress has
done little to inspire confidence that it could ever serve as the
linchpin for American policy. Only now can it be said to be coming
of age, and at that, very slowly. The formal seven-man presidency
includes representatives of all the major factions. Chalabi was
given no official title, but he is acknowledged to be acting in a
presiding role.
 &HT;    It is a perplexing group. Each faction appears to have its own
agenda. The Kurds, for instance, have the issue of nationalism; the
monarchists want to see a royal return; the Islamic groups are
paralyzed by infighting. Yet all now protest their undying
solidarity.
 &HT;    ``All Iraqi opposition groups are united on the need to get rid
of Saddam,'' Chalabi insists. ``We all want the same thing. A
democratic Iraq.''
 &HT;    Adds Sharif Ali Bin al-Hussein, the 43-year-old leader of the
Constitutional Monarchy Party: ``We have a common goal and a common
strategy. It's not about power, it's about unity of Iraqi
opposition.''
 &HT;    This was echoed (cautiously) by the Kurdish leader Jalal
Talabani and the others.
 &HT;    ``What is important now,'' one delegate said heatedly, ``is
getting rid of Saddam. Together.''
 &HT;    Chalabi is insistent that this time the opposition will get it
right. ``Look, we don't want to get a bunch of guns and go blazing
into the sunshine,'' Chalabi said. ``We are going to work with
careful steps to prepare with the U.S. so that our forces are
ready.''
 &HT;    For veteran INC-watchers, ``blazing into the sunshine'' is a
not-so-veiled reference to the group's Waterloo _ the 1996 debacle
in Erbil, a town in northern Iraq that served as its base of
operations before it was leveled by Saddam's tanks.
 &HT;    For the INC, Erbil is a gaping, deep wound that just won't heal.
 &HT;    ``You ask why we don't have an army, why we aren't preparing
actively?'' asks Aras Habib, the organization's operations chief.
``We had an army. We had a good army. We had weapons. We were
fighters. It was destroyed in Erbil.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    The Iraqi National Congress was born in 1992, in the wake of the
Persian Gulf war, with Chalabi as its democratically elected
president. Its operatives lobbied diplomats, opened a human-rights
office and developed military, political and intelligence
operations, largely operating out of Erbil.
 &HT;    What they did not do is establish a financial infrastructure or
a real plan to overthrow Saddam. Vagueness has always been the
Iraqi opposition's downfall. The closest thing to a plan was
Chalabi's ``enclave'' or ``three city'' strategy.
 &HT;    ``I always refused to subscribe to the American policy of
containment,'' he says. ``My strategy was to construct an enclave
and to unite all the opposition groups, including the Kurds, to
form an alliance.''
 &HT;    Chalabi's plan was to capture Kirkuk and Mosul, the leading
cities in the north of Iraq, and Basra, the main southern city, and
slowly squeeze the life out of Saddam's regime.
 &HT;    ``He believed that the Iraqis themselves have the willingness to
rise up against Saddam,'' says Zaab Sethna, an INC adviser who sees
Chalabi more as a visionary than as a naif. ``But this could only
be done if the INC built up its strength in the north and the south
by luring defectors and acquiring arms.''
 &HT;    Whether ultimately feasible or not, the plan had two major and,
as it turned out, fatal flaws. First, it demanded the cooperation
of the two main Kurdish factions _ the Kurdish Democratic Party
(KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) _ which had a long
history of bloody feuds.
 &HT;    ``To think one could unite the Kurds under one anti-Saddam
banner when they had historically been incapable of uniting
themselves was overly optimistic,'' says Patrick Bishop, a
Paris-based Middle East specialist. ``Over the years, the main
Kurdish groups have shown themselves capable of getting in bed with
the devil if they felt it suited their interest.''
 &HT;    Second, the plan assumed the full cooperation of the CIA, which
had been trying for years to oust Saddam. But the agency didn't buy
into Chalabi's strategy, insisting that the dictator would succumb
only to a coup.
 &HT;    However, Chalabi, believing the regime would topple under
sustained pressure and counting on American support, went ahead
with plans to attack Kirkuk and Mosul. By the summer of 1996, he
says, he had a CIA-trained army of more than 1,000 and a highly
effective intelligence operation.
 &HT;    But on the night of Aug. 31, 1996, Chalabi's plans were blasted
into the thin desert air.
 &HT;    ``I was sitting in a meeting at the American Embassy in London
between the PUK and the KDP,'' he says, ``when Saddam's tanks crept
up on the outskirts of Erbil.'' A bitter tone creeps into his
voice. ``We waited for air support, but it never arrived.''
 &HT;    ``Apparently, it was gruesome,'' Sethna recalls. ``Fighters were
calling from the satellite phones. They could see the tanks in the
distance, and they kept calling and calling for help but no one
came.''
 &HT;    Saddam had been invited in by Massoud Barzani, the Kurdish
Democratic Party leader, who saw a way to eliminate both the Iraqi
National Congress and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in one
treacherous move.
 &HT;    The CIA, fearing another debacle like the Bay of Pigs, refused
to help. Hundreds of INC men were executed, and thousands more fled
to Turkey.
 &HT;    Chalabi's critics had long scoffed at the idea that the INC
could ever seriously challenge Saddam's Republican Guard, 80,000
strong, and his superior weaponry. They also dismissed his claims
about his intelligence network and disparaged him as a leader.
 &HT;    But the debate was moot by the morning of Sept. 1, when, for all
practical purposes, the Iraqi National Congress ceased to exist.
 &HT;    By now, having temporarily shelved the three-city plan, the INC,
newly invigorated, has a more modest goal: simply to get off the
ground by setting up bank accounts, re-establishing contacts in
Iraq.
 &HT;    Mostly, says Daniel Byman, a Middle East expert at the Rand
Corp., they are waiting, waiting ``for a lucky break so they can
fill in the gap. I honestly don't think they know what that is.
Maybe Saddam will take a lucky bullet. Maybe there will be a change
in government and they will step in. That seems to be their plan.''
 &HT;    For his part, Saddam is widely believed to have taken advantage
of a year free of U.N. weapons inspectors to resume development of
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons.
 &HT;    While he is not directly threatened by outside forces, other
than the occasional bombing raid by allied warplanes, he is said to
be paranoid about internal threats. In November, according to
intelligence reports, he called in his military commanders for
consultations in small groups _ an indication of growing suspicion.
 &HT;    Whether he was concerned about the INC or some other, undetected
threat is debatable.
 &HT;    ``There are signs,'' says one academic analyst. ``Saddam was
very nervous about the New York meeting.'' But there are also signs
that he hardly noticed it.
 &HT;    ``If he was worried, the Iraqi press wouldn't be writing about
it in their newspapers,'' another analyst says. ``They are
certainly not writing about what is happening in the south. Now
that would be damaging to Saddam.''
 &HT;    One thing has emerged from New York: The INC has been granted a
last opportunity to grow up and become a serious player.
 &HT;    ``The October summit was like crossing the Rubicon,'' admits one
State Department official, who said he had more faith in the
opposition than ever before.
 &HT;    There is also the growing congressional support, particularly
among Republicans looking to highlight the failed Clinton policy.
But how seriously does Washington really take Chalabi and his
organization?
 &HT;    ``The INC has a lot of support because Congress is full of a lot
of posturing idiots who couldn't find Iraq on the map and don't
know anything about foreign policy,'' says one critic. ``They just
know something has to change.''
 &HT;    But Byman points out that the INC has taken two major steps in
the last year.
 &HT;    ``One is their change in leadership, which remedies some of
their problems,'' he says. ``The other is that they've moved away
from past grandiose schemes like marching on Baghdad to addressing
basic organizational steps that they avoided for too long.''
 &HT;    However, Byman still has his doubts about the fundamental
differences within the coalition. ``They all agree that Saddam
should go,'' he frets, ``but what else they agree on, I'm not
sure.''
 &HT;    The Clinton administration is equally unsure about Chalabi, both
for his personality quirks and for his history. For a time last
year, it even seemed as if the White House would rather see Saddam
in Baghdad than Chalabi.
 &HT;    ``They were down on Ahmed because of Jordan,'' says one
Washington observer. (In 1989, Chalabi was indicted for embezzling
millions from a Jordanian bank he founded in the 1970s. He was
eventually convicted in absentia.)
 &HT;    Another blow came in 1998 when Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of
the American forces in the Persian Gulf, bluntly told Congress that
the opposition groups ``have little, if any, viability.''
 &HT;    But the skepticism has quieted down, whether for cynical
reasons, a growing sense of respect for the INC or plain
desperation.
 &HT;    ``The Saddam regime has got to go,'' says one senior State
Department official. ``We crossed that bridge last year. But what
is different now is the opposition. Their recriminations have
subsided. They're watching each other, watching Washington. They're
more sober.''
 &HT;    Exactly how Chalabi and his men are going to pull off a stunt
like getting rid of Saddam Hussein, when the international forces
during the gulf war could not, remains to be seen. For now, the
Iraqi National Congress appears to be starting with basic
organizational issues that should have been addressed a decade ago.
 &HT;    ``They're asking how broad a coalition they can get, and how
they can share resources and leadership,'' Byman says. ``It has
been a good year because they are sitting down and talking, but
that's the first step in 100 and they still have 99 to go.''

<P>
   MENLO PARK, Calif. _ The cars slow on quiet Cloud Avenue so the
occupants can roll down the window and point. Undeterred by
relentless rain, the drivers of a Mercedes, then a Volvo pull to
the curb.
</P>
<P>
   The object of their rubbernecking? Not a crime scene or a fire.
Not a celebrity, unless the sheer act of buying a home here, the
center of the Silicon Valley real estate mosh pit, is worthy of
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of attention is an unassuming four-bedroom house that
inspired a 22-way bidding war recently. The winner paid close to $1
million more than the $1.25 million asking price.
</P>
<P>
   Word of such bidding battles has traveled like urban legend in
the heart of the valley, where a cozy home can cost as much as $1
million and there are plenty of newly minted millionaires _ by some
estimates 64 emerge each day _ to snap them up in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate rush has become a contemporary Gold Rush in
Northern California, fueled by the technology economy.
</P>
<P>
   There is the venture capitalist who offered to pay almost $4
million in cash for a Palo Alto house sight unseen, took one look
and handed over the money before the house hit the market. And the
high-tech entrepreneur who paid a million for a house in Monte
Sereno, between Saratoga and Los Gatos, plus $500,000 in stock
options. And the buyers who are offering sellers free rent, even a
Hawaiian vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond crazy. It's madness,'' said RoyAnne Florence, a
real estate agent with Coldwell Banker in Menlo Park who
represented the seller of the Cloud Avenue house. ``My whole belief
is that the market is being driven by Economics 101. There is a
short supply of houses. That's what's fueling the bizarre
beyond-belief market.''
</P>
<P>
   While the price of houses has skyrocketed around the San
Francisco Bay, nowhere is the market as turbo-powered as in parts
of Silicon Valley, according to real estate agents, developers and
those competing to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The market here changes almost hourly, with many homes selling
auction-style after offers and counter-offers, each pushing future
sale prices further skyward.
</P>
<P>
   With the median resale price of a home in Silicon Valley now
around $450,000, more than seven out of 10 people who do not own
already cannot afford to buy, according to Carl Guardino, president
of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, a high-tech trade
organization working with public and private agencies to create
affordable housing in the valley.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in California are more million-dollar homes being sold
than in Saratoga, where the most expensive one went for $4.7
million, according to one real estate sales monitoring report. The
report by La Jolla-based Acxiom showed 241 such sales last year, up
from 139 the previous year. And four of the top 10 ZIP codes with
the highest sales in California were in the Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the buyers are undeterred by spiraling costs. Foiled in
their first few attempts to buy, they simply get more creative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people offer trips to Hawaii,'' said Jeff Barnett, a
vice president with Alain Pinel Realty in Los Gatos. ``It's no
different than throwing in $5,000 to $7,000. It's just being
creative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one couple looking to buy a home, and they saw in the
garage that the seller collected Porsches. They collected them,
too, so with their offer they sent pictures of them standing next
to their cars, just to show what kind of people they are.''

<P>
   In Palo Alto, a widowed lawyer recently decided to sell the
Crescent Park house where he had raised his children and to look
for something smaller. He set the price at $2.7 million _ on a
house he bought more than 40 years ago for $75,000 _ because a
nearby house had just sold for $2.6 million. A venture capitalist
offered $4 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like hitting the lottery. It's just sheer luck,'' said
the lawyer, who asked that his name not be used because he is
hunting for a smaller house and did not want sellers to know how
much profit he made.
</P>
<P>
   With new houses in short supply, those who can't buy what they
want knock down existing homes and rebuild bigger ones.
</P>
<P>
   In some neighborhoods, ranch-style houses and cottages that have
served as family homes are referred to as ``tear downs.'' Many in
Palo Alto have sold for $700,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone to the extreme,'' said Christine Cummings, who
estimates that in the 13 years she has lived on Parkinson Avenue in
Palo Alto at least a dozen homes out of the 50 on her street have
been torn down or remodeled into what some now call ``monster
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody seems to care what's happening to the neighborhood,''
said Cummings, who supports a city measure to preserve older
houses. ``It's an emotional issue to me. I'm really ticked off that
people don't think houses have spirits to them.''
</P>
<P>
   What is happening in Silicon Valley is ``an anomaly,'' said
Penny Pompei, head of the Silicon Valley Realtors Association. But
rippling effects can be felt elsewhere as buyers find homes listed
for $300,000 are pushed up to $400,000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came from out of state and we'd need a down payment that's
more than the total we've ever paid for a home,'' said Dana
Swenson, who's been frequenting open houses for the 18 months since
she and her husband moved to the Silicon Valley from Utah. ``It's
insanity to think of paying that much for a home.''

REPUBLICAN FOREIGN-POLICY PERSPECTIVES: MORALISTS VS. REALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVING IN ``K'' CATEGORY. / SECOND IN A SERIES OF THREE) The
author examines the Republican ``Conservative Moralist'' and
``Conservative Realist'' positions in the debate over the direct
 &UR; ion of American foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Great Foreign Policy Debate of 2000 is a cascade of ink not
limited to the battle of the journals. It has become a bonanza as
well for the publishing industry as authors from different research
institutes flood bookstores and libraries with their tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious outlet for discussions of international
affairs is the bimonthly magazine ``Foreign Affairs,'' which
specializes in the disputations of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace, and his intellectual soul mate, Bill Kristol, editor of
the ``Weekly Standard'' journal, co-wrote an article in ``Foreign
Affairs''called ``Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy,'' in which
they wrote: ``Finally, American foreign policy should be informed
with a clear moral purpose, based on the understanding that its
moral goals and its fundamental national interest are almost in
harmony . . . The remoralization of America at home ultimately
requires the remoralization of American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   `GREAT FATHER FIGURE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows that democracies do not fight each other,''
writes Robert Kagan, who may be considered the leading advocate of
the Conservative Moralist congregation. ``American democracy should
be expansionary, and the U.S. should be more assertive and activist
in enlarging the frontiers of democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Ronald Reagan as the great father figure of American
foreign policy. Not only was Reagan skeptical of international
organizations, but he also understood the necessity for the U.S. to
act unilaterally and to intervene into the affairs of another
country on the grounds of American national interest. Reagan had an
intuitive grasp of hard power, or military force.''
</P>
<P>
   REALISM AND MORALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kagan traces his intellectual ancestry to Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join realism and moralism,'' Kagan said, ``and so did Teddy
Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson, for all his genius, even though he
desired to make the `world safe for democracy,' was willing to
sacrifice American sovereignty to a world government.
</P>
<P>
   ``TR (Teddy Roosevelt) would not have done that, but recognized
the need to use U.S. power unilaterally to spread American ideas
and values. Reagan was part of the TR (Roosevelt) tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ledeen, research fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, has published a book, ``Freedom Betrayed,'' that reads
like a hymn to the American system.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ledeen, the democratic revolution has passed
through two periods: The first was the American Revolution of 1776,
and the second is America in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A proselytizing Democrat, Ledeen attaches himself to the Wilson
who sought to ``make the world safe for democracy,'' and ``Freedom
Betrayed'' presents the United States as a revolutionary power, a
``chosen nation'' for converting the world to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC IMPERIALISM? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dogma of Conservative Moralists is open to theological
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan, Kristol and Ledeen abandon the principles of George
Kennan's ``containment policy'' through which America won the Cold
War. The containment policy was essentially a static program, for
it conformed to a bipolar world, and it assumed that both the
Soviet Union and the United States would remain on their sides of
the Iron Curtain, while Washington waited for the decay of
Stalinist Communist imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The priesthood of Conservative Moralism wants to replace the
static nature of the containment policy with a form of democratic
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the post-Cold War world is a monopolar one in which
the United State is preeminent, that limits to American
expansionism no longer exist, this College of Cardinals seeks to
root the democratic flag in such far-away places as Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (countries that few Americans even know
are on the map) _ all of which, not incidentally, are enormously
rich in oil and natural-gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign-policy gurus have not proved their claim that
unilateral intervention into the affairs of a sovereign country is
an effective means of installing democracy in a nation. Government
through the consent of the people arises only when other supportive
institutions exist, such as a free press, an independent judiciary
and a population committed to the principles of civil rights, and
these cannot be imposed by paratroopers descending from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY OR CAPITALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the prophets of Conservative Moralism do not clearly
indicate which they wish to export _ democracy or capitalism.
Michael Ledeen, however, does have the courage of his faith, for he
wishes to export the Reagan Republican Platform of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Freedom Betrayed,''Ledeen defines the democratic
revolution: ``Today it means waging war against the growing power
of the preeminent modern institution: state bureaucracy . . That is
why the call to slash the size of government is such an integral
part of the democratic revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between the American Constitution and
the Republican platform of 1980: Although it is patriotism to ask
American soldiers to fight for the Constitution, it is bottomless
greed to ask them to fight to imperialize the Reagan 1980 campaign
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to position itself as the final arbiter of the Great
Debate, ``Foreign Affairs'' has devoted its January-February 2000
issue to the Republican side of this argument. In this issue,
Condoleezza Rice wrote the lead article, ``Promoting the National
Interest,'' an exposition of the Conservative Realist position. In
the March/April 2000 issue, ``Foreign Affairs''will follow up with
the Democratic response.
</P>
<P>
   NATION COMES FIRST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice has deep roots in the Bush dynasty because she worked as a
Russian specialist on the National Security Council under President
Bush and presidential adviser Brent Scowcroft. A book by Bush and
Scowcroft, ``A World Transformed,'' refers to her as extremely
competent and knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Re-emphasizing one of the major principles of Conservative
Realism, Rice upholds the primacy of national interest over
international organizations and norms. The theory of ``universal
human rights'' is a wonderful ideal, but here also national
interest takes priority over the banner of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Russia, Rice supports the expansion of NATO to
include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The United States
should not be deterred by Russian anger because of the ballooning
of NATO into real estate once controlled by Soviet armies.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet specialist to Bush favors U.S. support for the
continued independence of the Ukraine and other countries in
Central Asia that seek to protect their sovereignty from Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   REBUILD MILITARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea region is of vital importance for U.S. interests
because of its huge oil and natural-gas reserves. In this region of
the globe, the policy of containing the Soviet Union is replaced by
the policy of dismembering Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing President Clinton for cutting the defense budget,
Rice wants to rebuild the military to throw out the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Russians and construct a
national missile-defense system. The defeat of the renewal of the
1992 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was correct. In the last
analysis, it is ``hard power,'' the persuasiveness of the bullet,
that determines the fate of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rice favors U.S. participation in all international
organizations because such collaboration is an advantage to the
national interests of America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she favors continued U.S. participation in the
World Trade Organization, because she favors opening markets for
U.S. exports. Trade is an important instrument of U.S. foreign
policy, and the international reduction of tariffs and other trade
barriers represents a gain to the United States because it helps
create an entrepreneurial capitalist class in whatever nation
becomes a partner in these commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding trade with China, the former national security adviser
believes, is in American national self-interest because it will
speed economic liberalization, and the emergence of an aggressive
capitalist phalanx could act as the springboard for the sprouting
of political democracy. Unlike Clinton, however, Rice does not view
China as a ``strategic partner'' but as a ``strategic competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Realists want to maintain Taiwanese
independence, and they image themselves as the party of the right
on the China issue. In essence, they want to create an East Asian
``rollback theory'' in the style of John Foster Dulles, keeping
China out of Taiwan and forcing China out of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   CEASE BEING WORLD'S POLICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From her new position at Stanford University, Rice launched has
her most spirited diatribes against the Clinton administration on
the question of humanitarian intervention. She points to the
failure of such action in Haiti and to the ineffectiveness of
multilateral humanitarian intervention in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States exerts hard hegemonic power in the
world, it should not act as the earth's ``globocop.'' Rice does not
believe that it is within the national interest of the United
States to play the universal gendarme.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Rice an authoritative voice from the Conservative
Realist pew, but the probable ghostwriter on foreign policy for
Gov. George W. Bush. There is no difference in substance between
the Rice essay and a speech on America's position in the world that
Bush gave to kick off his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
Reagan, agrees with Rice, particularly on the need to protect U.S.
sovereignty and to build an anti-ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was defeated,''
Kirkpatrick confessed. ``I worked for five years at the U.N., and I
can tell you that votes in the General Assembly are often stampeded
and ill-informed. There are over 150 members in the General
Assembly, and the vast majority have no experience with nuclear
weapons, and so their votes are not based on fact or experience. It
is wrong to give such a body a literal veto over American
armaments, defense and national interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall discussing the issue of the anti-ballistic missile
defense system with Ronald Reagan. The president looked upon a
system which could prevent an attack as a moral imperative because
it would prevent incalculable carnage. He believed that the policy
of MAD _ mutually assured destruction _ was immoral because it left
open the possibility of attack and cataclysmic bloodshed. To be
able to deter such an attack was equal to defending against
unprecedented inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN BEEFS UP HIS TEAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is also a member of the Conservative Realist
choir.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has added some illustrious names to his
foreign-policy team. Other notable foreign-policy sages now stand
alongside Henry Kissinger in the ex-Navy pilot's camp, and they
include Zbigniew Brzezinski, Larry Eagleberger, Kirkpatrick and R.
James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoner of war also looks suspiciously upon mainland
China. Although McCain supports the maintainence of normal trade
relations with China, he looks upon that country of 1.2 billion
people as a rival to the United State in the Pacific Rim, and he
stands firmly for continued independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The November election will undoubtedly witness impassioned
disagreements over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
China already enjoys most-favored-nation trading rights with the
United States and a mushrooming trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA AT CENTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging China as a potential adversary, McCain wants to link
membership in the World Trade Organization with domestic
liberalization in China. Rather than remain in a state of Clinton
self-denial, Conservative Realists want China to broaden universal
rights, grant religious freedom and cease political repression
before granting it equal representation in the trade group.

   Regardless of whether Bush or McCain becomes the GOP
presidential contender, China will become the center of gravity of
the foreign-policy debates. For most of the 12 years that
Republicans held the White House, from 1980 to 1992 under Reagan
and George Bush, the Cold War raged and Republicans looked tougher
on the Soviet Union than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Evil Empire'' has disappeared, the bipolar world is a
theme of the past, but the Republicans have also suffered their
losses: They can no longer appear as the knights of anti-communism.
To reinvent their image as Sir Lancelot slaying the Red Dragon,
they are trying to paint Beijing as the Second KGB. Abiding by the
philosophy of ``Wag the Dog,'' if a war does not exist, then it is
necessary to invent one.

</P>
<P>
   ``ACTUAL INNOCENCE'' &QL; 
By Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer (Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In our rush to convict violent criminals and offer justice to
their victims, it's easy to overlook the plight of the innocent
man. Today, DNA tests are used before trial. Of the first 18,000
test results at the FBI and other crime laboratories, at least
5,000 absolved suspects of guilt before their cases were tried. But
what about men who were convicted before DNA testing was common
practice? Lawyers Scheck and Neufeld are founders of the
``Innocence Project,'' which fights for DNA tests for men who are
in prison. The authors present case after case in which bad
lawyering, police misconduct or false testimony by witnesses
resulted in the conviction of innocent men on rape or murder
charges. Although the book is at times overly dramatic (Dwyer, who
writes for the ``New York Daily News,'' refers to ``Barry and
Peter'' as if they are superheroes, swooping in to save the day
with their test tubes), it is a sobering reminder of the forgotten
victims of violent crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``MIRTH OF A NATION'' &QL; 
Edited by Michael J. Rosen (HarperPerennial, $15) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from us to make jokes at Yanni's expense, but we're
willing to laugh if someone else steps up to the plate. In this
case, it's ``New Yorker'' writer Kurt Andersen, who presents
himself as the man who invented Yanni _ the hair, the name
(``Zazu'' and ``Yahweh'' were contenders), the waterbed smile.
Andersen is one of 54 humorists who contribute to this anthology of
funny writing. Among the others: Roy Blount Jr., on the game of
golf (the first time he saw himself hitting a golf ball on video,
he looked exactly like a man killing a snake); Christopher Buckley
on the art of name-dropping; Garry Trudeau, who admits, copiously,
that he has smoked marijuana; Ian Frazier, who visits upon his
children the laws of the home (``Bite not, lest you be cast into
quiet time . . . '') and Dave Barry on his visit to Paris, where
there was only one empty parking space and it was under heavy
police guard at the Louvre museum. This volume is the first in a
series. Rosen invites you to submit work for future installments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``WILD MINDS: WHAT ANIMALS REALLY THINK'' &QL; 
By Marc D. Hauser (Holt, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone want to guess what that fine gentleman on the cover was
thinking when someone snapped his picture? Hauser, psychology
professor and head of an animal-research program at Harvard
University, delves into questions that have already spawned many
books and much speculation: Are animals capable of experiencing th
same emotions that we feel? Do animals simply follow rules, or do
they understand those rules and their purpose? Hauser calls
accounts of weeping elephants and altruistic dolphins ``wildly
speculative,'' as faulty as the scientific belief that animals are
``mindless and irrational, driven by instinct and overwhelmed by
their passions.'' He explores such ``animal'' behavior as making
tools, counting, calculating distance, communicating and
cooperating with others, showing compassion, and making and abiding
by rules. In the process, he discusses what sets humans apart from
other animals _ their mysterious awareness of self. We will never
understand animals, he says, until we stop trying to see ourselves
in them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``LOSING YOUR PARENTS, FINDING YOUR SELF'' &QL; 
By Victoria Secunda (Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secunda interviewed 94 men and women who during their adulthoods
experienced the deaths of one or both parents. In the process, she
discovered that ``parental death is a defining event for adult
offspring that, with regard to its impact on one's sense of self,
often eclipses the variables of marital status, career achievement,
being a parent oneself, or the cause and manner of parental
death.'' In other words, it matters, and in many different ways.
Some people feel a sense of euphoric relief when their parents die.
Others feel lost, with no one to talk to or impress. Some find that
their marriages or their relationships with their siblings are
enhanced after a parent dies. For others, those ties deteriorate.
Secunda's book is not perfect (it begins with a bit of baggage, an
overlong description of her terrible relationship with her mother),
but it is interesting in the shared experiences she discovered
among the subjects of her survey _ experiences not of grief, but of
the long-term consequences of an inevitable and life-altering
event. &QL;

JARRETT'S DAYTONA EFFORT WAS FIT FOR A KING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ When Dale Jarrett pulled down pit road to
make his way toward Victory Lane after winning Sunday's Daytona
500, he was greeted by several well-wishers. But Jarrett was
startled when a familiar figure wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses,
and a toothy grin came out to offer his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got involved in Winston Cup racing, I had the dream
that everybody else does of one day being in Victory Lane and
having a Daytona 500 trophy,'' said Jarrett, who claimed his third
such title, to go along with triumphs in 1993 and 1996. ``It's
always nice to come down pit road and get the congratulations of
other team members and your own team members.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the thing today was Richard Petty came out, made his way
across pit road, and shook my hand. That sent chills up my spine
that the King would make his way out there and congratulate me on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a career year in 1999 _ in which he won his first
NASCAR Winston Cup championship for the Robert Yates Racing team _
Jarrett may be embarking on another. He picked up a staggering
$2,277,975 in winnings Sunday, including a $1 million Winston No
Bull 5 bonus for his third Daytona 500 title. Jarrett joined Petty
(seven), Cale Yarborough (four), and Bobby Allison (three) as the
only drivers in NASCAR history to win three or more Daytona 500s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just shows how special it is to get those three,''
said Jarrett, who was flanked by crew chief Todd Parrott in the
postrace press conference. ``It's very, very elite company and I
just have a lot of people to thank, mainly this guy sitting beside
me, for all those possibilities for it all happening.''
</P>
<P>
   While his first two Daytona 500s hold a special place in
Jarrett's treasure chest of memories, this trophy earned a coveted
spot because of the adversity his team had overcome to attain it.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment his red-white-and-blue rocketship was unloaded
from the hauler, Jarrett dominated Speedweeks 2000, winning the
pole position and the Bud Shootout, and finishing runner-up to Bill
Elliott in an impressive 1-2-3 Ford finish in the Gatorade Twin
125s.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it appeared he was in cruise control, though, Jarrett
was jarred by a Happy Hour accident Saturday afternoon that had his
team scrambling _ flying in fabricators Kevin Stimberis, Robby
Hancock, and Andrew Johnson from the team's shop in Charlotte,
N.C., that night _ to make emergency repairs to an out-of-joint
nose, a kink in the left corner of the hood, and dents on the front
and rear bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like our great week had gone to pieces late Saturday
afternoon,'' Jarrett said. ``I spent about 2 1/2 hours after
practice was over with Todd and guys yesterday afternoon, and once
we went over everything, knowing the chassis was OK, then we talked
about what we needed to do to the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very confident when I left (the garage) that the car
would be back in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be good as new.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Jarrett enshrined his No. 88 Ford Quality Car Taurus at
the Daytona USA motorsports museum, where it will be on display
until next year's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an incredible race car,'' Jarrett said. ``It won
at Talladega in 1998 and won a million-dollar bonus there. It won
here in July last here and I think it finished second in both
Talladega races last year, then won some $2 million here, so this
is about a $4 million race car and I guess it deserves a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it really wouldn't be our choice. It really wasn't a
choice, sitting there in second, but it did cross my mind that,
hey, if I go on and win this Daytona 500, I've got to give up this
great-handling race car. But I know that he'll build some more
great ones, too.''

A SIGN OF SPRING: FLOWER SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spring is near. Garden shows are under way. The Philadelphia
Flower Show, largest indoor flower show in the world and the oldest
in this country, runs March 5 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   This year's theme is ``Gardens for the New Millennium,''
celebrating how plants and flowers will enhance lives in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   If you're heading for this show, bring comfortable walking shoes
_ the exhibit area covers 10 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Should you be overwhelmed by the displays, take a break and
stroll eight of the most historical blocks in America. There are
guided trolly tours, a laser light show, world-class museums, and
dozens of events in conjunction with Flower Show Week, and all are
within walking distance of the show. And, should you take a walk,
there's free same-day readmission to return to smell the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Flower Show Week includes hotel and day-trip packages, cultural
attractions, discounts, events, and restaurant offers. Pick up a
Bloomin' Fun Pass Book at the show, or call the Philadelphia
Visitors Center at 800-611-5960. Flower show information is also
available at www.philaflowershow.com.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is also big in the flower world. The New England Spring
Flower Show, March 11-19, is the third largest in the world. The
129th annual show will be held at the Bayside Expo Center with the
theme ``Symphony for the Senses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston show covers 5 1/2 acres and will have 50 garden
displays. Tickets for the Massachusetts Horticultural Society show
are $15 weekdays and $17 weekends for adults, and $6 for children
4-12. Discounted tickets are available at Stop &AMP; Shop. For show
information, call 617-536-9280 or visit www.masshort.org.
</P>
<P>
   There's still time to check out the Rhode Island Spring Flower &AMP;
Garden Show at the Rhode Island Convention Center in Providence.
The show is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. For information, call
800-766-1670 or visit www.flowershow.com.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some gardens that are open to the public? ``The
Garden Conservancy's Open Days Directory: The Guide to Visiting
Hundreds of America's Best Private Gardens'' (Abrams, $14.95)
offers gardens that are open to the public on select weekend days
from March through October. This year 17 new cities were added to
the book, including destinations in New Hampshire and Long Island's
North Shore. The book can be ordered ($14.95 plus $3.50 shipping)
by writing to the Garden Conservancy, PO Box 219, Cold Spring, NY
10516 or calling 888-842-2442.
</P>
<P>
   Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii will feature its Kona Spring
Blossom Festival April 1 through 29. The festival features a farm
and field day, open houses in three villages, and Japanese heritage
events. The festival is planned to showcase the island's unique
agriculture that includes Kona coffee and macadamia nuts as well as
tropical fruits, nuts, flowers, vegetables, and specialty items
such as vanilla aand cocoa beans. For information on the festival,
call 808-323-3434 or visit www.agtourism.org.

<P>
   Spring break &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where is the college crowd heading for spring break this year?
Council Travel, which specializes in student trips, reports that
the five most popular destinations are: Panama City Beach, Fla.;
Cancun, Mexico; Daytona Beach, Fla.; South Padre Island, Texas; and
various Colorado ski resorts.
</P>
<P>
   For the majority of the expected 1.5 million undergraduate
students on spring break, warm weather, low prices, and
like-minded, party-hearty soulmates are the prime criteria.
Accessibility is also a prime factor. While students in the West
head to Mexico and Colorado, those in the East have made Caribbean
spots popular.
</P>
<P>
   While the often wild and uninhibited activities that
characterize spring break get a lot of media coverage, Council
Travel is finding a growing number of young adults are heading to
Europe for a different kind of trip. Last year more than 400,000
students traveled overseas, double the number that did so just
eight years ago, said Bill McGuinness of Council Travel. For
information, call 800-2COUNCIL or visit www.counciltravel.com.
</P>
<P>
   Offering a slightly different version of where the students are
going is a survey by PopWall.com, which bills itself as ``the Pulse
of the Net Generation.'' The on-line survey of 274 students reports
Mexico as the most popular with 14 percent of those surveyed, and
Florida a close second at 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also covered questions on drinking and sex.One
revelation was that 60 percent planned on paying for the vacation
themselves. If you want the answers to these and other questions,
check out PopWall.com.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica is expecting more students to select the island as their
destination of choice. The reason: MTV featured the island last
year. This year Ocho Rios is holding Spring Break Escape March
13-20 and to help boost it, the week is sponsored by Rolling Stone.
Negril is holding Tropical Insanity March 4-25. For information,
check out the Jamaica Web site at www.jamaicatravel.com.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Fort Lauderdale, where spring break became
defined by the 1960 film ``Where the Boys Are''? Well, the 23 miles
of beaches are still great, but a lot quieter since Fort Lauderdale
transformed itself from the host of 350,000 students to a diverse
and cosmopolitan destination.
</P>
<P>
   This year Fort Lauderdale reports the closest thing to a
bacchanalian rampage might be what happens on stage during the
Broadway show ``Titanic'' (March 7-19). Otherwise there are
concerts, great museums, antique shops, and great dining. Not your
typical spring-break fare. Want to know more? Call 800-22-SUNNY or

<P>
   Touring inn to inn on cross-country skis or snowshoes and
indulging in chocolate dishes along the way _ that's what the 11th
annual Chocolate Festival at the Mount Washington Valley Ski
Touring and Snowshoe Center is all about. The festival is Feb. 27
from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and includes eight inns with such treats as
chocolate fondue, fudges, chocolate chip cookies, chocolate mousse,
even maple-flavored chocolate business cards. Event passes are $14
for adults, $8 for juniors and seniors, and are available at
various locations in the area. For complete information, call
603-356-9920 or visit www.CrossCountrySkiNH.com. When calling, ask
about inns in the area that offer free skiing with a stay. &QL;

   Summer reading &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to spend your summer reading and discussing great
works of literature, philosophy, and the opera, take off for Santa
Fe. Each summer St. John's College, nationally recognized as the
great books school, offers a unique educational experience in a
small group, seminar-style setting. The Summer Classics is a series
of weeklong seminars, with participants choosing one seminar a week
for up to three weeks. Mornings are dedicated to the seminar, with
afternoons free for studying or participating in college-sponsored
excursions. For information, write to Summer Classics, St. John's

an upgrade to a Diamond Villa suite (all-inclusive rack rates begin
at $240 a person through March 31, and $205 April 1-Dec. 22). The
villa package includes an attendant to prepare breakfast, do light
washing and ironing, and to pack. The package also includes an
in-villa romantic dinner for two with a personal balladeer, and
five spa treatments a day per person. The nine-year-old resort is
undergoing a complete renovation, which ``will not disturb the
guest experience,'' said Peter Trench, co-general manager. For

   SARASOTA, Fla. _ At times Monday, Ken Griffey Jr. looked like a
rookie conductor facing a massive orchestra. He was nervous. His
right leg shook as he spoke at Ed Smith Stadium. Here he was,
running solo on the Hype Treadmill for the 11th day in a row.
</P>
<P>
   One day he is facing a staggering number of media. Another day
he is hearing the story of how, because of him, the Cincinnati
Reds' outdated phone system became so jammed that employees
couldn't check their voice mail. New day, new news: One of his
teammates, Sean Casey, stole Griffey's rookie card from a
department store when he was 13. Casey's father found out and sent
his son to the dictionary. He made him look up ``selfish,''
``greed,'' and ``thief.'' He made him return the card, too.
</P>
<P>
   On Day 11 in the buzzing Griffey Kingdom, a photographer even
accused the peaceful Holley Lama of intentionally obstructing his
view of the king. Man. I haven't been this insulted since Halle
Berry stopped taking my calls (I couldn't sell her on Halle
Holley). So I guess now would be a good time to explain why all
this spring training attention to Griffey is dangerous, overblown,
and unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   But I can't do it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I can't wait to see how teams are going to approach
this lineup; it is easily baseball's best. You'll find more power
in Cleveland. You'll find Nomar Garciaparra in Boston. You'll find
a balanced, patient crew in New York (in both Queens and the
Bronx). But over a full season, it's going to be impossible to
quiet the Reds. If I were one of their fans, I'd begin saving for
World Series tickets, too.
</P>
<P>
   Reds manager Jack McKeon was asked where Griffey will hit in the
lineup. ``Anywhere he wants,'' McKeon replied. He was joking. He
plans to put Griffey in the No. 3 spot, behind leadoff man Pokey
Reese and Barry Larkin and in front of cleanup hitter Dante
Bichette and Casey, who hit .332 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, those five had 2,961 at-bats last season and
struck out only 418 times. Reese, Larkin, and Griffey all have
speed. They also have Gold Gloves, giving the Reds one of the most
devastating up-the-middle defenses in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey no longer will have the Ballpark in Arlington, Yankee
Stadium, and Edison Field to assault. But consider some of the NL
perks. He gains six extra games in the thin air of Coors Field. He
gains 81 games in the Queen City's Cinergy Field, where the ball
travels well. It's 307 feet to right in the new San Francisco park.
Dodger Stadium measures 330 down the right-field line. And there is
always Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's early. I know there could be an injury tomorrow. But
how do you pitch these guys? And receiving pitches from the Reds
may not be as inviting as you might think. They had the National
League's best bullpen last season. They don't have a 200-inning
pitcher in their rotation, but they expect Denny Neagle to reach
that this season.
</P>
<P>
   One thing all Reds fans should worry about is Junior adjusting
to NL pitching. He played in the American League for 11 seasons and
the new league is going to be very tough on him.
</P>
<P>
   Nah. Just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, Larkin, Reese, McKeon, and Reds general manager Jim
Bowden were all smiling _ understandably _ this week. Larkin and
Griffey both grew up in Cincinnati and were friendly before the
Feb. 10 trade between the Mariners and Reds. Larkin said he has
seen the change in Griffey the past week. It used to be that Larkin
would leave a message and Griffey wouldn't return it for three
days. Now the center fielder is on the phone with the shortstop
several times a day, asking questions. Lots of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Senior talked a lot,'' Larkin said of Griffey's father,
a Reds coach. ``But, my God, this guy . . .''
</P>
<P>
   If Griffey likes to talk as much as Larkin says he does, it's
another reason he will fit in Cincinnati. This team enjoyed talking
a lot last year, without Griffey. Now the Reds also may add Deion
Sanders, who signed a minor league contract.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey wasn't extremely talkative. Not only did he appear to be
uncomfortable, it seemed that he wasn't thrilled to be talking to
anyone. He arrived at his press conference Monday in a golf cart
and took a seat atop the first-base dugout. He scanned the crowd
and said, ``This is not normal.''
</P>
<P>
   He wore a shirt that could be described as ``Mariners blue.'' He
explained that he will have to get some new gear because, ``Most of
the things I own are blue.'' Although it didn't show, he said his
level of excitement rivaled his enthusiasm of 1995, when he scored
the winning run in Game 5 of a Division Series with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey insisted that he wanted to be traded so he could be
closer to his family. His wife and two children were here, waving
at a man in the Reds' offices. The man couldn't stop smiling. It
was Bowden, the GM who grew up in Massachusetts (Weston and
Wellesley).
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he has dreamed of acquiring Griffey since 1992. The
Reds' new park, which will open in 2003, was designed with a
lefthanded power hitter in mind. Bowden knows he made a brilliant
trade, but he said with a straight face, ``The Mariners made a
better trade than people give them credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew that answer sounded more like Beacon Hill than Weston.
He made a great trade. This is one of the rare times that all the
hype is justified. Reds fans knew that in December when they heard
that their GM was pursuing Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would pick up my restaurant tabs without giving me a
chance to pay them,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what the fans will buy him before Game 1 of the World
Series.

ANALYSTS KEEP TRYING TO PREDICT HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the hottest Internet companies of the past decade died
quietly last week. PointCast, a company that automatically
``pushes'' data to millions of Internet-linked computers, had once
been considered a world-changing company at the forefront of a
crucial technology.
</P>
<P>
   Among those singing the praises of push technology were the
technology industry analysts at the Yankee Group in Boston.
Customers who bought the company's reports on push services would
have learned that PointCast and similar companies had a bright
future. Indeed, in late 1996, Yankee analysts predicted that push
services would be a $5.7 billion business by now. Instead the
market quietly faded away.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in 1998, Yankee Group predicted that there
would be about 1.25 million households using high-speed Internet
connections. That forecastproved to be about right. According to
recent cable industry data, there are now approximately 1.4 million
users of high-speed cable modems in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting the future is a perilous business, especially in
high-technology industries. But that hasn't stopped a host of
expert analysts from attempting it. Companies like the Yankee
Group, Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., International Data
Corp. of Framingham, Mass., and Jupiter Communications Inc. of New
York earn millions for providing businesses with forecasts on the
high-tech future, and strategic advice on how to prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous executives aren't the only ones who rely on these
experts for hire. Journalists from every newspaper in the land,
including The Boston Globe, routinely quote analysts from these
leading research firms, and build stories around the statistics and
forecasts they provide.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts say that forecasts of industry trends are
little more valuable than horoscopes, especially when they attempt
to look three or four years into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no science in industry forecasting at all,'' says
Boston business consultant William Sherden, author of a skeptical
book about the folly of trying to predict the future. Even Sherden
admits, however, that he sometimes purchases a forecast, in search
of a little near-term guidance about industry trends.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to people who produce the research, and they'll concede
that their long-term predictions are at best rough guides to the
future. John Gantz, chief research
</P>
<P>
   officer at IDC, even warns that in many cases, nobody goes back
to check the accuracy of an estimate made years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what anyone tells you,'' says Gantz. ``No one in
this business goes back and looks at the actuals . . . not on a
rigorous basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gantz insists that the very popularity of his firm's
services provide some evidence that IDC often gets it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get it wrong often enough, they won't buy our stuff,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Jupiter Communications chief executive Gene DeRose
readily acknowledges that the specific numbers aren't really the
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about the lessons that we give them, and the
dynamics of how the industry works,'' he says. DeRose says his
customers need the assurance that statistics can bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace demands and has a passionate need for these
numbers,'' he says. But in the end, Jupiter and other firms say
they use the data mainly to point up trends.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Spence, assistant director of e-commerce marketing for
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. in New York, is a loyal buyer
of research from Jupiter Communications, even though she knows
their long-term forecasts will sometimes fall short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jupiter has been very responsive to us getting the information
we need,'' Spence says, ``and it's all about timing.''
</P>
<P>
   But what good is timing if the data are wrong? Spence replies
that she doesn't expect market research data to tell her precisely
what's going to happen next year or the year after.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work with statistics and numbers enough to know you can
pretty much make statistics say whatever you want them to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she adds, each forecasting firm will inevitably come
out with a different statistic.
</P>
<P>
   What matters to Spence is not whether the market for online
furniture sales goes up 30 percent or 40 percent, but whether it's
likely to go up at all. It's the direction she's looking for, not a
particular data point.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the forecasters don't even get the trends right.
Yankee Group wasn't alone in wildly overestimating public demand
for push software products like PointCast. Wired magazine produced
a special issue devoted to push software, claiming that it would
transform the way people used computers. Major software makers like
Netscape Communications Corp. and Microsoft Corp., desperate to
catch the wave, built push software into their Internet browsers.
They all got it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the analysts keep trying, driven by intense demand from
companies desperate for a glimpse into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have some way to plan,'' says Glantz. ``No company
can operate without plans and strategies that go beyond a year.''
</P>
<P>
   IDC, Yankee, Jupiter, and many other forecasting shops follow a
business model called ``syndicated research.'' Old-line consulting
firms like Arthur D. Little &AMP; Co. had long done in-depth research
for their large corporate clients. But starting in the 1970s, firms
like IDC and the Yankee Group hit on a way to provide the same
service to smaller clients. They'd prepare detailed reports on
various industry segments, then sell the information to anybody who
cared to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee Group, for instance, was founded in 1970 by Howard
Anderson, a Harvard Business School graduate who'd noticed that
there wasn't much solid data available on computer companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point he determined that there was a lack of knowledge
about how technology was going to impact business,'' says current
Yankee Group chief executive Berge Ayvazian. So Anderson began
cranking out reports on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Yankee Group has about a thousand customers. Each
subscribes to one or more of the company's two dozen service
groups. For instance, there are analyst teams that specialize in
media and entertainment businesses, telecommunications in Latin
America, and of course, Internet computing. Each subscription sells
for $25,000. That money not only buys access to research, but also
the researchers. Subscribers are entitled to phone their analysts
for detailed briefings.
</P>
<P>
   This human contact is the real value of the subscription,
according to senior vice president Brian Adamik.
</P>
<P>
   ``We require our analysts to talk to our clients every month,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   IDC follows a similar business model, but with a much larger
catalog of 200 services. Even more than Yankee Group, IDC is
associated with statistics _ data on past performance of key
technology markets, and forecasts of how those businesses will
perform years into the future.
</P>
<P>
   IDC and other research firms get their information in much the
same way reporters do, with lots of legwork. Say you're trying to
figure out how many computers are being sold. IDC's John Gantz says
his company would approach the question from multiple angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We survey users to find out `What did you buy,' `What do you
have installed today' . . . and we even call the vendors to ask
them, `What did you ship?' '' Gantz says. ``We have relationships
with the big distributors. We get information from them on how much
did they move (and) pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. The analysts will also contact the companies
that make components that go into the devices. How many hard drives
are being made? For that matter, how many hard drive controller
chips are being made? By tracking the supply of the components used
in a product, companies like IDC hope to get an accurate picture of
how many are being produced.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts tend to be people with MBA degrees and a knack for
qualitative analysis, or veterans of the industries they track. A
handful, like Jupiter Communications' DeRose, got their start as
journalists. Along with hard numbers, the analysts absorb anecdotal
data that give them a feel for the state of an industry. A certain
amount of this gut-level instinct winds up in these reports, and
plays a major part in the one-on-one discussions between analysts
and their customers.

   Are Islam and democracy compatible? Iran's parliamentary

with examples of good government, let alone democracy. But religion
is seldom the culprit. &QL;

harassment, bribery of the voters, media manipulation and misuse of
all the apparatus of government. &QL;

   It happened almost half a century ago, in a war that most
Americans barely recall. The story came to light in September, when
the Associated Press ran a starkly detailed account of American
soldiers who said they had gunned down perhaps hundreds of South
Korean civilians in three days in July 1950. Although it is
agonizing to think of U.S. soldiers committing war atrocities,
America must clear the air _ and its conscience _ over No Gun Ri.
The last time America took a serious look at a war crime of its own
_ the infamous My Lai Massacre in 1968 _ it botched the job. &QL;

believe that the return of American troops will bring more rape,
prostitution and sexually-transmitted disease and add to the

<P>
   Are Islam and democracy compatible? Iran's parliamentary
election this Friday will not provide a definitive answer, but it
may provide some hints. Alas, the Islamic world is not burdened
with examples of good government, let alone democracy. But religion
is seldom the culprit. &QL;

   The leader is gone, for the good of the party, and it seems
churlish not to applaud and say, ``Well done, Wolfgang Schauble. By
falling on your sword, you have done the noble thing and now we can
all put this behind us and move on.'' Yet the words do not come
easily. A feeling persists that this is the wrong leader, resigning
for the wrong reasons, and that it is too soon to bring down the
curtain on the German Christian Democrats' financial scandals. &QL;

   Soon, notes and coins could go the way of the dinosaur, to be

mouse _ or so digital enthusiasts would have us believe. They may
be right _ but don't bet your last dollar bill on it. Futurologists
have predicted a cashless society ever since the invention of
``plastic money'' exactly 50 years ago. Yet people seem
unaccountably, incorrigibly fond of cash. Why is this?... &QL;

   Few people hoping for good news from Africa would have expected

Zimbabwe should have delivered such an eye-catching lesson in
democracy as the one it gave this week. It has shown that Africans,
like other people, relish the power of the ballot box, and that
brave dissidents, energetic civic groups and networks of
discontented individuals can sometimes win, even in the face of
harassment, bribery of the voters, media manipulation and misuse of
all the apparatus of government. &QL;

   &UR; AMERICA, DON'T HIDE FROM THE PAINFUL TRUTH OF NO GUN RI &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It happened almost half a century ago, in a war that most
Americans barely recall. The story came to light in September, when
the Associated Press ran a starkly detailed account of American
soldiers who said they had gunned down perhaps hundreds of South
Korean civilians in three days in July 1950. Although it is
agonizing to think of U.S. soldiers committing war atrocities,
America must clear the air _ and its conscience _ over No Gun Ri.
The last time America took a serious look at a war crime of its own
_ the infamous My Lai Massacre in 1968 _ it botched the job. &QL;

   &UR; THE GOP ESTABLISHMENT VS. JOHN MCCAIN &LR;  &QL;

   Bob Dole recently told a TV audience that the reason he had a
Band-Aid on his thumb was that he had pricked himself in his rush
to replace his Bush button with a McCain one. ``You couldn't find a
McCain button on anybody yesterday,'' he drolly noted, ``but today
they're all over the place.'' Well, not quite all over the place.
There are precious few McCain badges on the lapels of Dole's old
cronies at the heart of the Republican establishment. Why? Because
McCain represents a gigantic threat to the way it does business. &QL;

   Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are
frozen. This may be the worst moment for the Palestinians since
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was elected last year. Ominously,
many Palestinians feel that Barak's vision of a final settlement in
the peace process bears an uncanny resemblance to the one touted by
his despised predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. &QL;

   American servicemen, arriving in the Philippines for their first

to get the wrong idea when they hear that local women have been
burning their underpants in public in anticipation. The
knicker-burning was, in fact, a gesture of protest by a group who
believe that the return of American troops will bring more rape,
prostitution and sexually-transmitted disease and add to the
numbers of unwanted mixed-race children. &QL;

carry on voting for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)

now faces. He must persuade Mexicans to switch their political
brand loyalty, to something most have never tasted. &QL;

<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ In a red booth at Johnny's Luncheonette, Charlie
Pierce is talking about the family curse. All around, men and women
are doing business over flapjacks and coffee. But Pierce is sipping
a diet Coke and avoiding eye contact as he talks about the
devastating swath that Alzheimer's disease has cut through his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, a former Boston Herald sports columnist who writes for
such national magazines as GQ and Esquire, tells that story with
stark eloquence in his upcoming book, ``Hard to Forget.'' But he
seems a lot less comfortable discussing it in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone is a hero, not everyone does things well,'' he
says at one point, his eyes closed tight. ``This was done badly by
my mother and myself. And I did learn from the things I did
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   What Pierce is talking about is his father's struggle with
Alzheimer's, which stole the former schoolteacher's mind and
finally, in 1989, killed him. Pierce is also allud-
</P>
<P>
   ing to the difficulty his family had confronting the disease,
which also killed all four of his uncles and is now claiming his
father's last remaining sibling, Mary.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, due out in April, Pierce writes with searing
honesty about his journey through the ``country'' of Alzheimer's
and his attempt to come to terms with a disease that strikes at the
very essence of self: one's memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have the right combination of genes, I will get the
disease,'' says Pierce almost nonchalantly, as he tackles a plate
of corned beef hash. ``I panic when I lose my car keys. Losing the
car keys is different for me than it is for other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce makes brief eye contact and then looks down at the blue
and white galleys of his new book. ``Who knows? Maybe I'll forget I
ever wrote this book.''
</P>
<P>
   At 46, Charlie Pierce is a writer and local talk-show pundit
known for his lyrical prose, his sharp wit, and his prodigious
memory, especially when it comes to sports minutiae. Pierce is also
a writer at large for Esquire, where he opines about sports and
politics and everything in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am good at Trivial Pursuit,'' he allows. ``I hope to
continue to be good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce says the book, his first, grew out of an article in GQ,
which grew out of his desire to know if he would continue to be
good at remembering anything. ``My editor at GQ and I were talking
about genetic testing and how the scientific advances were way
ahead of the law, and he said, `That's a really interesting story,
but we need to find a focus for it in one person,' '' Pierce
recalls. ``And I said, `What about me? I have a genetic link to
Alzheimer's in my family.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That conversation took place in the summer of 1996. Pierce's
article about his family was published in February 1997, making the
short list for a National Magazine Award and giving Pierce's agent
a book proposal he could sell. But back in the early '80s, when his
father was putting his pants on backward and forgetting his only
son's name, Pierce had no idea there was a genetic component
involved. He didn't even know there was a name for what his father
had.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1985, when his father left his house in
Shrewsbury to drive to a local store for flowers and ended up in a
small town in Vermont, that John Pierce was diagnosed with
Alzheimer's. Even then, Charlie Pierce didn't know the extent to
which this disease might haunt his future. Or, as he acknowledges,
he didn't want to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alzheimer's is a disease you can hide, you can ignore, you can
pretend isn't there, for years,'' Pierce says. ``And that's what we
did. This is the kind of disease that was the worst possible
disease for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents, first-generation Irish who had settled in
Worcester, were the kind ``who didn't talk about stuff like this. I
think my mother could have handled my father if he had cancer or
heart disease or a nonneurological disease,'' Pierce says. ``But I
think my mother had a problem with mental illness. She was never
able to see what was going on with my Dad as anything other than
him going crazy on her. And she enormously resented that at a level
she couldn't even confront.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Pierce writes about how his mother first pretended
that nothing was wrong with her husband, and then, when he was
incontinent, she wouldn't hear of putting the World War II veteran
in a nursing home. His mother, who died in 1996, was not alone in
that denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my Dad was sick, we were so dispersed as a family, I
didn't know anything was wrong with my uncles. I didn't know that
my Uncle Jim thought there was a baby in the attic,'' Pierce says.
``So I didn't assume a genetic link. There was an aluminum
hypothesis for many years, so I thought my Dad had come into
contact with aluminum in the Navy.'' The theory was that excessive
exposure to aluminum might cause Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce writes that he ``was rooting very hard for aluminum as
the cause of my father's disease.'' Self-deprecating humor peppers
``Hard to Forget'' and elevates his story from, in Pierce's words,
``a primal scream'' into a gripping memoir with universal themes.
And it lightens the mood in the breakfast booth as Pierce explains
how he copes with the knowledge that he is at high risk of
developing Alzheimer's. ``I take my vitamin A and my gingko every
morning,'' he says, looking down with a hint of a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of time and good help from people like my wife
and Joanne Koenig-Coste for me to be able to appreciate the fact
that sometimes there is humor there, that Alzheimer patients do do
things that are funny, and that it's OK to laugh about it,'' he
adds. Koenig-Coste led the support group that Pierce's wife,
Margaret, discovered and attended regularly. She eventually
persuaded her husband to come along, and Pierce credits both women
with helping him confront the family curse.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a generous dollop of science in Pierce's book,
which details the genetic advances and the ``cowboys'' _ his name
for the researchers _ responsible for them. Pierce says he enjoyed
chronicling the larger-than-life stories of these scientists. But
these days he is relieved to be writing stories that don't involve
his own family. ``It's nice to go back to being a snoop and a pest
to other people,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he has no desire to know what his odds are of
following his father into the mist of Alzheimer's. ``I don't know
what I'd do with the knowledge,'' he shrugs. ``I could arrange my
finances and write a will, but I've already done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce also says he wouldn't get tested unless this country's
regulatory system catches up with the speed of its scientific
advances. ``I don't think anyone should get tested until there are
absolute safeguards for where that information goes,'' he says.
``Insurance companies can create anything into a preexisting
condition, and the potential for mischief with genetic information
is vast and terrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce is a lot more bullish about the hopes for an eventual
treatment for Alzheimer's, if not for himself, then for his
children Brendan, 14, and Molly, 6. (His third child, Abraham, 23,
is his stepson.) ``Between the geneticists and the drug companies,
they've got this disease surrounded, and they'll come up with
something in my lifetime,'' Pierce says, looking at the table and
then pounding it with his fist. ``Knock on linoleum.''

 &HT;    Are Islam and democracy compatible? Iran's parliamentary
election this Friday will not provide a definitive answer, but it
may provide some hints. It turns, in any event, on the issue of how
democratic an Islamist regime can be.
 &HT;    Iranians can elect, in a tolerably fair way, the representatives
they want; the question is how much authority and freedom their
system then allows these representatives.
 &HT;    Our conclusion is not much.
 &HT;    President Muhammad Khatami has succeeded in making the
theocratic state less restrictive. But a growing number of Iranians
_ the bold, the thoughtful, the young _ want an administration and
a judiciary that are free from clerical despotism. The turbaned are
finding it ever harder to slap these hungry reformers down.
 &HT;    Outside Iran, political Islam has long since lost the cohesive,
cataclysmic energy that the western world, perhaps wrongly,
detected in the years after Iran's 1979 revolution. It has not,
however, lost its power to alarm.
 &HT;    The concept of ``Islamic terrorism'' still chills people, in
Moscow these days as well as in New York. Christians in Nigeria's
Muslim states quail at the introduction of the sharia (religious
law). And most Arab countries are still so wary of political Islam
that they refuse to allow it any political license at all.
 &HT;    Secularists share a simple fear: they believe that once Islamist
politicians have got themselves into a position of control, they
will never let go.
 &HT;    The Islamists themselves feed that fear when they preach of
power coming from God, of religion and state being one, and the
separation of the two a secular aberration. But, so far, Iran is
the sole example of radical Islamists running anything like a
democracy.
 &HT;    With democratic reform strongly promoted in this election, and
with Iran's braver prelates now admitting publicly that political
power, even if divine in origin, belongs to the people, it is much
too soon to pronounce that the Iranian test case has proved
democracy and political Islam to be incompatible.
 &HT;    Alas, the Islamic world is not burdened with examples of good
government, let alone democracy. But religion is seldom the
culprit: look, rather, for cruel autocrats, corrupt feudal systems,
overbearing armies or any combination of the above.
 &HT;    Indonesia, the largest Muslim country, is now working its
difficult way through a bad inheritance, but its new,
democratically chosen president is an Islamist of welcome
moderation and its Islamic tradition has long been tolerant.
 &HT;    Pakistan, a state specifically designed for Muslims, is in a
poor way, but not on account of its religion.
 &HT;    Turkey would shine more convincingly as a democracy if its army
had not thrown out a government dominated by mild Islamists.
 &HT;    The scene darkens as one moves west, with the Arabs inhabiting
the least democratic patch on God's earth. Most Arab rulers, be
they kings or presidents, take all the decisions that matter; their
minions then carry them out.
 &HT;    If they cannot claim a crown, they are reelected through
soft-flowing referendums. Arab ruling parties, with cash and
patronage in their gift, can usually win without cheating, though
to be safe they usually cheat too. Religion is largely irrelevant
to this common misbehavior.
 &HT;    Adherence to an austere, even cruel, form of Islamic law puts
Saudi Arabia at the bottom of most tourists' wish-lists. But it is
its feudal ruling family, not Islamic precept, that bars even the
pretense of democracy.
 &HT;    Syria's President Hafez Assad, having rid himself of the
Islamist ``threat'' by murdering many thousands at Hama in 1982,
rules as an undisputed despot who intends, in feudal fashion, to
pass the job on to his son.
 &HT;    Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, who let his Islamists live, but
then had to fight the movement's armed wing, now locks up civilian
Islamists to prevent them from taking part in politics.
 &HT;    Algeria's army preceded Turkey's in pushing Islamists out of
power, but in a manner that led to a savage eight-year civil war in
the 1990s.
 &HT;    There are exceptions, of course, when Islamism itself is a
principal villain. In Sudan, an unrelenting Islamist government in
a religiously divided country has exacerbated a painfully long
civil war.
 &HT;    And the Taliban has enforced a primitive form of Islam on
Afghanistan that has had the Iranians, as well as everybody else,
in shock.
 &HT;    Making matters worse, both regimes have trained and been host to
the bands of roving mercenaries who keep alive the fear of Islamic
terrorism. 
  
 &HT;     (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750)  
  
 &HT;    The West has paternity rights to these terrorists, claims
Russia, which says _ perhaps disingenuously _ that it was Islamist
allies of the Chechens who blew up blocks of apartment buildings in
Moscow last year.
 &HT;    But Russia is correct about the paternity. In the 1980s,
America, with Pakistan, financed, trained and equipped some 50,000
volunteers, mainly Arab, to fight the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan.
 &HT;    When the Afghan war was won, the volunteers dispersed, looking
for ways to practice the only skill they knew. One of them, Osama
bin Laden, turned against America during the war with Iraq.
 &HT;    A rich and clever Saudi, bin Laden at one time ran a lethal
network. He has now, it seems, been contained, a liability to the
Taliban regime that may well eventually hand him over in exchange
for international respectability.
 &HT;    But there are many other ``Afghanis,'' capable of individual
acts of great evil. 
  
 &HT;     (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050)  
  
 &HT;    The actions of a few zealots have helped to discolor
understanding of political Islam. The importance of the movement,
these days, is not what it can achieve in the political field, and
even less what it can do with its bombs. It is rather its mole-like
incursions into ordinary life.
 &HT;    In many Muslim countries, particularly in the Middle East,
people are behaving, or finding themselves obliged to behave, in a
stricter Islamic manner.
 &HT;    Suddenly, there are more curbs on what they can read, or how
they can entertain themselves. Women, not always unwillingly, are
having to cover up.
 &HT;    The happy exception to this trend is Islamist Iran. Here, people
are beginning to find that they can burst out of old restrictions,
not enter into new ones.
 &HT;    Political Islam still provides dangers, but it also provides
reasons for hope.

may provide some hints. It turns, in any event, on the issue of how
democratic an Islamist regime can be.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians can elect, in a tolerably fair way, the representatives
they want; the question is how much authority and freedom their
system then allows these representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Our conclusion is not much.
</P>
<P>
   President Muhammad Khatami has succeeded in making the
theocratic state less restrictive. But a growing number of Iranians
_ the bold, the thoughtful, the young _ want an administration and
a judiciary that are free from clerical despotism. The turbaned are
finding it ever harder to slap these hungry reformers down.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Iran, political Islam has long since lost the cohesive,
cataclysmic energy that the western world, perhaps wrongly,
detected in the years after Iran's 1979 revolution. It has not,
however, lost its power to alarm.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of ``Islamic terrorism'' still chills people, in
Moscow these days as well as in New York. Christians in Nigeria's
Muslim states quail at the introduction of the sharia (religious
law). And most Arab countries are still so wary of political Islam
that they refuse to allow it any political license at all.
</P>
<P>
   Secularists share a simple fear: they believe that once Islamist
politicians have got themselves into a position of control, they
will never let go.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists themselves feed that fear when they preach of
power coming from God, of religion and state being one, and the
separation of the two a secular aberration. But, so far, Iran is
the sole example of radical Islamists running anything like a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   With democratic reform strongly promoted in this election, and
with Iran's braver prelates now admitting publicly that political
power, even if divine in origin, belongs to the people, it is much
too soon to pronounce that the Iranian test case has proved
democracy and political Islam to be incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the Islamic world is not burdened with examples of good
government, let alone democracy. But religion is seldom the
culprit: look, rather, for cruel autocrats, corrupt feudal systems,
overbearing armies or any combination of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the largest Muslim country, is now working its
difficult way through a bad inheritance, but its new,
democratically chosen president is an Islamist of welcome
moderation and its Islamic tradition has long been tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, a state specifically designed for Muslims, is in a
poor way, but not on account of its religion.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey would shine more convincingly as a democracy if its army
had not thrown out a government dominated by mild Islamists.
</P>
<P>
   The scene darkens as one moves west, with the Arabs inhabiting
the least democratic patch on God's earth. Most Arab rulers, be
they kings or presidents, take all the decisions that matter; their
minions then carry them out.
</P>
<P>
   If they cannot claim a crown, they are reelected through
soft-flowing referendums. Arab ruling parties, with cash and
patronage in their gift, can usually win without cheating, though
to be safe they usually cheat too. Religion is largely irrelevant
to this common misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   Adherence to an austere, even cruel, form of Islamic law puts
Saudi Arabia at the bottom of most tourists' wish-lists. But it is
its feudal ruling family, not Islamic precept, that bars even the
pretense of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's President Hafez Assad, having rid himself of the
Islamist ``threat'' by murdering many thousands at Hama in 1982,
rules as an undisputed despot who intends, in feudal fashion, to
pass the job on to his son.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, who let his Islamists live, but
then had to fight the movement's armed wing, now locks up civilian
Islamists to prevent them from taking part in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria's army preceded Turkey's in pushing Islamists out of
power, but in a manner that led to a savage eight-year civil war in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions, of course, when Islamism itself is a
principal villain. In Sudan, an unrelenting Islamist government in
a religiously divided country has exacerbated a painfully long
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   And the Taliban has enforced a primitive form of Islam on
Afghanistan that has had the Iranians, as well as everybody else,
in shock.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, both regimes have trained and been host to
the bands of roving mercenaries who keep alive the fear of Islamic
terrorism. &QL;

<P>
   The West has paternity rights to these terrorists, claims
Russia, which says _ perhaps disingenuously _ that it was Islamist
allies of the Chechens who blew up blocks of apartment buildings in
Moscow last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia is correct about the paternity. In the 1980s,
America, with Pakistan, financed, trained and equipped some 50,000
volunteers, mainly Arab, to fight the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   When the Afghan war was won, the volunteers dispersed, looking
for ways to practice the only skill they knew. One of them, Osama
bin Laden, turned against America during the war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   A rich and clever Saudi, bin Laden at one time ran a lethal
network. He has now, it seems, been contained, a liability to the
Taliban regime that may well eventually hand him over in exchange
for international respectability.

   But there are many other ``Afghanis,'' capable of individual
acts of great evil. &QL;

   The actions of a few zealots have helped to discolor
understanding of political Islam. The importance of the movement,
these days, is not what it can achieve in the political field, and
even less what it can do with its bombs. It is rather its mole-like
incursions into ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   In many Muslim countries, particularly in the Middle East,
people are behaving, or finding themselves obliged to behave, in a
stricter Islamic manner.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there are more curbs on what they can read, or how
they can entertain themselves. Women, not always unwillingly, are
having to cover up.
</P>
<P>
   The happy exception to this trend is Islamist Iran. Here, people
are beginning to find that they can burst out of old restrictions,
not enter into new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Political Islam still provides dangers, but it also provides
reasons for hope. &QL;

<P>
   The leader has gone, for the good of the party, and it seems
churlish not to applaud and say, ``Well done, Wolfgang Schauble. By
falling on your sword, you have done the noble thing and now we can
put all this behind us and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the words do not come easily. A feeling persists that this
is the wrong leader, resigning for the wrong reason, and that it is
too soon to bring down the curtain on the German Christian
Democrats' financial scandals and all their ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   The whiff of something rotten is still in the air and, until its
source is fully exposed and dealt with, it will continue to
contaminate the Christian Democrats, and maybe others too.
</P>
<P>
   The man who could do most to help, and therefore the man who
should have been humbling himself this week, is Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   It was he, by his own admission, who accepted illegal
contributions to his party's funds, yet he defiantly still refuses
to name the donors.
</P>
<P>
   Schauble has reason to be embarrassed too: among other things,
he admits he took a handsome cash donation from an arms dealer.
This was certainly an error of judgment, but a legal one, it seems,
not in itself a resigning matter.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the feeling that Schauble, variously Kohl's protege, loyal
supporter and faithful successor, has now become his proxy and his
fall guy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the reason for resigning, it is not any admission of
guilt for misdeeds, or even errors of judgment. No, it is to allow
the party to make a new beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Not, of course, that this is for Schauble a narrow partisan
matter. Rather it is for the sake of Germany: it is of ``supreme
importance'' that the Christian Democrats remain a strong force for
integration in the political center if the crisis in the party is
not to become ``a crisis of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This goal must come above all else,'' said the departing
leader. Bunkum. Democracies need honest parties, parties that admit
their mistakes and purge their rotten elements, more than they need
forces for integration in the political center.
</P>
<P>
   A rotten Christian Democratic Union (CDU) will do nothing to
serve democracy. Nor, moreover, will it be a force for integration.
The voters will mistrust it and turn elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   If they sense that the other mainstream parties are decent and
honest, they will give them their support. If not, they will stay
at home _ or look to the extremes. That is exactly what Schauble
says he wants to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Germans are in a censorious mood these days _ look at their
unforgiving criticisms of the apparently minor infractions of
leading Social Democrats, such as Johannes Rau _ but they are not
turning to the extremes, not yet anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Before they resort to that, they have other possibilities to
explore. One is the party of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, the
Social Democrats, who may yet emerge looking reasonably clean from
the intensive scandal-searching now going on.
</P>
<P>
   Another is their partner in government, the Greens, in secular
decline, it seems, but no longer barmy in their policies. On the
contrary, on economic policy the Greens often make more sense than
the Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the Free Democrats, Germany's liberals. They
are centrists, for whom the tribulations of the Christian Democrats
provide a historic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Were they to espouse liberal social policies to match the
economic ones they have long advocated, they could expand their
popular appeal and thus escape from their traditional role as
coalition counterweights to become a mass party in their own right.
At any rate they could hope to.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, however, that German democracy is not yet at
stake; the fate of the Christian Democrats may be. Here Schauble is
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CDU is in the worst crisis in its history,'' he said this
week. What he did not say was that, if his successor is to get the
party out of its crisis, he _ or more likely she _ will have to
persuade the party's grand old man, Kohl, and all those around him
at the end of his 25-year reign as party chairman, to come clean
about what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Only then will the voters be prepared to put their trust, once
again, in the CDU. The good news, however, is that in the meantime
German democracy will probably survive.

LUSTER HASN'T FADED FROM AMERICANS' SHINING MOMENT IN 1980 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The clock never moved. ``There were 10 minutes left when I
scored the goal,'' captain Mike Eruzione remembers. ``I went out
and played another shift and the clock said, like, 9:59. Then I
played another shift and it said 8:20.''
</P>
<P>
   Time didn't stand still when the US Olympic hockey team shocked
the Soviet Union and the world with its ``miracle on ice'' in Lake
Placid 20 years ago. It just seemed that way, as the Americans
strove desperately to hold off the Big Red Machine until the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many times when you play a game, you never want it to
end,'' says Eruzione, who never played another after he and his
teammates beat Finland for the Olympic gold medal two days later.
``That night, we couldn't wait for it to end.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, that game has never ended. Last week, when Eruzione
dropped the puck before a Penguins game in Pittsburgh, he got a
standing ovation from a crowd chanting, ``USA, USA.'' Millions of
Americans can tell you where they were and what they were doing
Feb. 22, 1980, when the Boys of Winter beat the unbeatable Soviets,
4-3, holding them scoreless for the final 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, it was a psychological turning point for the
American people,'' says Jack O'Callahan, the defenseman from
Charlestown, Mass., whose exultant, toothless grin graces the
famous celebratory photo snapped by The Boston Globe's Frank
O'Brien. ``Things were at a low point and the country was in a dark
state.''
</P>
<P>
   In February of 1980, both inflation and unemployment were
soaring, US citizens were being held hostage in Iran, the Red Army
was defiantly occupying Afghanistan, and President Jimmy Carter was
pushing for a boycott of the Summer Olympics in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without realizing it,'' muses O'Callahan, ``we became the dawn
of a new way of looking at things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, seeded seventh among the 12-team field, weren't
even supposed to win a medal on their home ice. They trailed in six
of their seven games. They trailed the Soviets three times. They
trailed the Finns with one period to play. They never trailed at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a thing that will never be forgotten in the history of
sport,'' says Vyacheslav Fetisov, a defenseman on that Soviet squad
who went on to win two Olympic gold medals and two Stanley Cups
with the Detroit Red Wings and is now an assistant coach with the
New Jersey Devils. ``It is a great example of how young kids can
get together with a big goal in their minds and make the impossible
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Boys of Winter (at an average age of 22, they were the
youngest US Olympic team ever) came from Massachusetts and the
Midwest, from the shadow of Bunker Hill to the Iron Range of
Minnesota. They were amateurs fresh out of college, most of them,
or still undergrads. They were selected and molded and goaded and
inspired by the mercurial, mystical Herb Brooks, the last player
cut from the 1960 team that defeated the Soviets at Squaw Valley.
And when they arrived in the Adirondacks, nobody had any idea how
they'd do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the kind of team where if we didn't play well, we could
lose to everybody in the tournament,'' says Jim Craig, the goalie
from North Easton, Mass., who played every minute of every game.
``And if we did play well, we could beat everybody in the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody, it seemed, except the guys in the red helmets. The
Soviets were undeniably the best team in the world. ``The best team
ever assembled, and I play for many teams,'' states Fetisov.
Vladislav Tretiak, Boris Mikhailov, Sergei Makharov, Valery
Kharlamov, Vladimir Petrov, Aleksandr Maltsev, Vladimir Krutov,
Valery Vasiliev _ a Hall of Fame on one bench.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, the Soviets had beaten the cream of the NHL in a
midseason best-of-three at Madison Square Garden, destroying the
pros, 6-0, in the finale. ``We played as good as we could,''
shrugged NHL captain Bobby Clarke, as his stunned mates blinked
back tears in the locker room. ``They are a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Olympians also played the Soviets in the Garden in a
tuneup the weekend before the Games and were demolished, 10-3.
``That was pretty good,'' Brooks cracked afterward, trying to
lighten the mood. ``That was fun to play them, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans didn't figure to face the CCCP again. They weren't
expected to make the Olympic medal round, not with Sweden and
Czechoslovakia in their group. But they came from behind twice in
the opener and tied the Swedes on Bill Baker's slapper (his only
tournament point) with 27 seconds left and the US cage empty.
</P>
<P>
   Then they routed the Czechs, 7-3, and suddenly, the award podium
seemed possible. ``We began thinking, hey, we could take a medal
out of this thing,'' says Dave Silk, who grew up in Scituate. ``But
none of us was so cavalier to think that it would beat the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the loss at Squaw Valley, the Soviets had won the
gold at every Olympics since they first turned up in 1956. They
hadn't lost a game since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only team we were worried about was the Czechs,'' says
Fetisov. ``We weren't worried about anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Worry, in Russian, was a relative word. The Soviets had beaten
the Czechs, 11-1 and 6-1, at the 1979 world championships in
Moscow. In Lake Placid, they were running up fantastic numbers _
16-0 over Japan, 17-4 over the Netherlands, 8-1 over Poland. They
didn't need 60 minutes to beat you. The Soviets required only 60
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could score three goals in a minute and a half,'' says
Silk. ``They were deadly that way. Whenever the puck was in play,
there was danger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Finns had them on the ropes, down a goal with five minutes
to go. Then Krutov, Maltsev, and Mikhailov went bing-bing-bing in
79 seconds and it was 4-2 for the Soviets. The Canadians had them
down two goals in the final seconds of the second period and missed
a breakaway for three. The Soviets beat them, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   They may be winning, but the champs are off-form, Brooks told
his players. Bored, maybe. They'd won everything they could win.
``What do they have left?'' Brooks said. ``They're ripe.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks could give the Big Red Machine a go _ if they ever got
to play them. After the Czech victory, the Americans seemed flat.
They had to rally to beat the Norwegians, a bunch of Oslo plumbers
and taxi drivers. They didn't shed the Romanians until midway
through the game. And they went two goals down to the Germans
before winning by two.
</P>
<P>
   But the Boys of Winter kept winning, somehow. And when they were
dressing for their medal-round date with the Soviets, they seemed
oddly relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had destroyed us before the Olympics,'' O'Callahan says.
``We knew they could kill us. So there was no need being tense
about it. We'd tried that two weeks before and it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans could never beat the Soviets in a best-of-three,
but they didn't have to. One night, one game, one chance. This is
no accident, Brooks told his players before they took the ice. This
was fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were born to be a player,'' he said. ``You were meant to
be here. This moment is yours.''
</P>
<P>
   This was no mere hockey game, the Americans realized, as soon as
they came out of their dressing room. It was, as Newsweek magazine
said, ``a morality play on ice.'' The Soviets were hooted at the
sight of their red helmets. The Americans were greeted like Daniel
Boone, Alvin York, John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flags were everywhere and they weren't bought on the way
in,'' says Craig. ``They brought them out of attics and basements.
The patriotism at Lake Placid was real.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the gloom, the malaise, the anger, the frustration, the
helplessness that had been building for a year and more in America
had been given voice. People who didn't know whether a puck was
vulcanized or galvanized suddenly cared desperately about one
hockey game.
</P>
<P>
   Until they came through the gate in their red, white, and blue,
the US players hadn't sensed that. They had been sequestered in the
athletes' village out in Ray Brook for a fortnight, away from
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't read the papers,'' Eruzione says. ``We were in a
cocoon. We were clueless.''
</P>
<P>
   It was better that way, they concluded later. It was enough to
be playing against the best team in the world. Eruzione and his
mates didn't also need to be playing for truth, justice, and the
American Way.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to play out of your minds, Brooks told them. Just
play your game. It's been good enough so far. Stay poised, keep
possession and forecheck like hell.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets scored first, after nine minutes, but that was no
novelty. Everybody but the Romanians had scored first on the
Americans. Buzz Schneider, who had stung Tretiak for a hat trick at
the 1975 world championships, blasted a slapshot past him five
minutes later to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets grabbed the lead back within four minutes and set up
shop in the US end, peppering Craig with rubber. Then, one second
from the end of the first period, came the turning point. Dave
Christian had taken a long, what-the-hell slapper that bounced
harmlessly off Tretiak's pads. But Mark Johnson (``Magic'' to his
teammates) darted between a pair of Soviet defensemen and wristed
in the rebound just before the buzzer. 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets, who were already on their way to the locker room
and their intermission tea, didn't want to be bothered with a
meaningless faceoff. ``Drop the puck,'' O'Callahan shouted to the
referee, hoping that his teammates could get a gift goal into an
empty net. No such luck.
</P>
<P>
   The officials beckoned to coach Viktor Tikhonov to send out at
least a token group to take the draw. Instead of Tretiak, he
dispatched Vladimir Myshkin, the backup goalie. ``Does that mean
Tretiak can't come back?'' Eruzione asked Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knew what it meant. The Americans had heard that Tretiak,
arguably the world's best goaltender, had hurt his glove hand
before the game. Not so, Fetisov insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no problem,'' Fetisov says. ``He was healthy. I think
the coach was a little bit panicking. Or maybe he was trying to
kill two birds with one arrow.''
</P>
<P>
   By yanking Tretiak, who considered himself indispensable,
Tikhonov might have been sending an intramural message. Myshkin,
after all, had shut out the NHL. The Americans, meanwhile, had
deciphered a message of their own. ``It was, `Hey, guys, we're not
playing very well and it's 2-2,' '' says Eruzione.

   ``Money can't buy friends, but you can get a better class of
enemy,'' Spike Milligan, a British comedian, once opined.
</P>
<P>
   Without money, much economic activity would grind to a halt. But
what is money? Over the centuries, many things have served the
purpose, from beads to cowrie shells to pigs. More recently people
have found notes and coins rather easier to carry around.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, notes and coins could go the same way as pigs, to
be replaced by electronic digits that transfer value at the click
of a mouse _ or so digital enthusiasts would have us believe.
</P>
<P>
   They may be right: but don't bet your last dollar bill on it.
</P>
<P>
   Futurologists have predicted a cashless society ever since the
invention of ``plastic money.'' It is exactly 50 years since Diners
Club introduced the world's first charge card.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards, which followed slightly later, took a long time to
catch on, but now, as Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal
Reserve, recently joked, ``children, dogs, cats and moose are
getting credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet people seem unaccountably fond of cash. In America, Germany
and Japan the value of notes and coins in circulation has risen
faster than the value of GDP over the past 30 years. This implies
that the average person is carrying more, not less, cash than he
used to.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this? Part of the answer is that a growing chunk of
American and German bank notes circulate outside these countries,
in such places as Russia where the local currency is not trusted.
However, foreign holdings of yen are relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   A second explanation is that tax evasion and illegal activities
such as drug trafficking, conducted in cash, have increased.
</P>
<P>
   A third, more prosaic reason is that an expansion in the number
of cash machines has increased the convenience of using the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 2,500 years of existence, cash may be looking a
bit long in the tooth for today's ``new economy.'' But the truth is
that it is still ideally suited to many everyday purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Could e-cash become a serious rival? With a prepaid card, where
money is stored on a computer chip, you need never be short of the
right change for a ticket machine or parking meter.
</P>
<P>
   And the explosion in Internet commerce could give a boost to
privately issued digital cash that can be used to make payments
over computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   The elimination of many physical cash transactions is certainly
technically feasible, and e-cash plans are proliferating. But there
are still big barriers to a cashless society.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can ever be as liquid as notes and coins, which, as
legal tender, are acceptable as payment everywhere; digital cash is
unlikely ever to match cash for ubiquity.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger problem with most e-cash systems is that they
allow governments or firms to snoop on your spending habits. It is
not only criminals that might wish to avoid that.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest advantage of cash over checks, credit cards and most
current forms of e-cash is, indeed, its anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, digital cash could be designed to offer the same
privacy _ a fact that worries governments. If transactions could be
made with anonymous e-money, this would increase the scope for tax
evasion and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   It is largely thanks to government pressure that most versions
of e-money deny users the anonymity of old-fashioned cash. Without
such privacy, e-money will never eliminate cash.
</P>
<P>
   The awkward truth is that many governments would love to get rid
of traditional, anonymous cash if they could, precisely in order to
reduce the opportunities for tax evasion and crime. They would do
better to tackle such problems at source, by reducing the
incentives to dodge the taxman and by better policing.
</P>
<P>
   If cash provides a safety value that makes it possible for some
firms to escape overly burdensome taxes and regulations, long live
cash. Money may be able to buy a better class of enemy, but
remember that the enemy of oppressive governments is often the
friend of the people. &QL;

   Bob Dole may have been one of America's more dismal presidential
candidates. But when it comes to tart political observations he
remains a class act.
</P>
<P>
   He recently told a television audience that the reason he had a
Band-Aid on his thumb was that he had pricked himself in his rush
to replace his Bush button with a McCain one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't find a McCain button on anybody yesterday,'' he
noted, ``but today they're all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite all over the place. There are precious few
McCain badges on the lapels of Dole's old friends at the heart of
the Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most powerful Republicans on Capitol Hill _ notably
Trent Lott, Mitch McConnell and Orrin Hatch in the Senate, and Tom
DeLay in the House _ would rather turn vegetarian than support
Senator McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And even Republicans who confess to liking the senator
personally can be ferociously critical of his political skills,
arguing that he is more interested in winning cheap publicity than
in the painstaking business of passing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of his fellow senators have so far endorsed McCain.
Yet 39 senators, 175 congressmen and umpteen governors have
endorsed George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There is even more hostility to McCain in the bizarre collection
of think-tanks and religious groups that dominates the party's
conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Feulner, the head of the Heritage Foundation, has lamented
that McCain's agenda is simply not conservative; Pat Robertson has
urged social conservatives to leave the party in droves if McCain
is the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Right to Life Committee has littered South
Carolina with leaflets saying that McCain ``voted repeatedly to use
tax dollars for experiments that use body parts from aborted
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   The explanation for all this hostility is simple: McCain
represents a gigantic threat to the way the establishment does
business. At the very least, his campaign against the ``iron
triangle'' of ``lobbyists, big money and legislation'' is going to
change the way that Washington works.
</P>
<P>
   It could well end up altering the balance of power in all sorts
of unforeseen ways, perhaps even playing into the hands of the
Democrats, with their lock on union dues and their automatic
support from feminists and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my best friend,'' says Phil Gramm, who enlisted McCain to
run his campaign for the presidency in 1996. ``But his views on
campaign-finance reform would make us the minority party for 25
years.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain adds to his unpopularity by personalizing his crusade,
employing a staff man to sniff out his colleagues' pork and then
exposing it for all to see on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He has accused McConnell of cuddling up to tobacco interests,
Lott of throwing public money at a local shipyard and Robert
Bennett of helping to get $2.2 million to repair sewers in Utah in
return for contributions, a charge Bennett vigorously denies.
</P>
<P>
   His indifference to the formalities of Senate life grates with
many of his colleagues, particularly when he dismisses their
remarks as ``chicken(feces).''
</P>
<P>
   The other thing that leaves Republicans foaming is their belief
that McCain is a hypocrite, preaching about cleansing the Augean
stables but then rolling in the muck himself.
</P>
<P>
   He takes political contributions from Microsoft, Viacom, Bell
South and US West, all companies that must at some point have
business before his Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He flies on corporate jets. He recently held a
$500-to-$1,000-a-plate ``Straight Talk dinner'' in Washington,
complete with some of the iron triangle's most famous lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   So how much has the radical McCain to fear from his party's
establishment?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can emerge wholly undamaged from the sort of attack ads
that are being aired in South Carolina and Michigan. But McCain has
a chance of emerging less damaged than most.
</P>
<P>
   The more the establishment rails against him, the more it
reinforces his reputation as an outsider. And the lower it sinks in
the use of dirty tactics such as ``push polling'' (pretending to
conduct a telephone opinion poll while really besmirching one of
the candidates), the more it demonstrates that the political system
needs a thorough cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is a limit to how long the establishment will
keep up its hostility. Trent Lott and Pat Robertson may never
relent, but most Republicans supported Bush only because he looked
like a winner, and they may soon uncover a secret love for
campaign-finance reform if McCain can capture that mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the former candidate of the Christian right, and
Bill Jones, the highest Republican elected official in California,
have both endorsed McCain in recent days, and Republican moneymen
have started cutting their losses by ``dutching'' a little money on
the man from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is shoving the Republican establishment into doing
rather more than just diversify its risks. The establishment
embraced Bush because he seemed to promise an easy chance of
rehabilitating itself after a disastrous few years when it had been
outfoxed by Bill Clinton and led up the garden path by Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came from the respected ranks of Republican governors
rather than the despised ranks of Washington insiders. He belonged
to one of the party's most respected families. And he had dreamed
up a concoction _ ``compassionate conservatism'' _ which promised
to bring new groups of people into a party that seems to have hit a
ceiling of 42 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has all but killed this Whiggish dream of change without
revolution. He has exposed the party's deepest divisions, forced
Bush to pander to its most Neanderthal elements, and rendered
``compassionate conservatism'' all but irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's most reflective supporters argue that this is all for
the best, provided the insurgency gathers pace.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment periodically loses touch with the rest of the
country, they say, gripped by unpopular ideas, corrupted by
corporate money and just plain complacent, and the only solution is
an internal revolution. This happened with Ronald Reagan in the
late 1970s and then again, rather less triumphantly, with Gingrich
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This may well be right. But the establishment Republicans' worry
is that McCain will provide enough of a shock to traumatize their
preferred candidate but not enough to revitalize their ailing
party. &QL;

   Everyone's, in South Carolina. Some lowlights: ``The Cambodian
Khmer Rouge has claimed that McCain is a Vietnamese agent.'' (Paul
Weyrich, influential conservative, apparently suggesting McCain is
the Manchurian Candidate.)

<P>
   ``Do we really want another politician in the White House
America can't trust?'' (McCain campaign ad)
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about as low a blow as you can give.'' (George W. Bush,
responding to the above in a televised debate on Feb. 15).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people and especially the people of South
Carolina are sick and tired of negative campaigns.'' (McCain ad,
after the candidate had decided to stop all his negative
advertising.) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, a Los Angeles Times poll found that 64 percent

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND NEW YORK _ It is, in some ways, the best of times for
the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet boom has boosted the Journal's advertising revenue
by 40 percent over last year; at the FT (part-owner of The
Economist) it is up around 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants ``brand'' and ``content,'' which both companies
have in spades; the share prices of the papers' parent companies,
Dow Jones and Pearson, have leapt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a worrying time, too. Both papers face new competition
_ from online services and from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Since the FT launched its American edition in September 1997,
circulation has jumped, reaching 102,000 in December 1999 _ not yet
a serious threat to the Journal's 1.7 million, but uncomfortable
for an incumbent whose circulation has slipped by 7 percent over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dow Jones is hitting back in the FT's own territory. Hence
the relaunch, earlier this month, of the Wall Street Journal
Europe, with more staff, more technology coverage and a less
archaic front page.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the FT's second strike: the launch, on Feb. 21, of FT
Deutschland, a German-language daily business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson will not say how much this new venture is costing, but
100 new journalists (some of whom have left before the launch) do
not come cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Running the paper as a joint venture with Gruner + Jahr,
Bertelsmann's magazine arm, offsets some risk; but joint ventures
bring their own problems.
</P>
<P>
   So why take the risk? Because Germany is Europe's biggest
market, which the FT, with a circulation there of 22,000, has
barely penetrated. And German business journalism is stodgy and
slow.
</P>
<P>
   When Oskar Lafontaine resigned as finance minister at 6 p.m.,
the German papers scraped a mention, while the FT had the full
story.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Journal has weighed in with the competition.
Handelsblatt, Germany's main business daily, has a Journal editor
in its offices, and is using Journal copy. The front article is
already livelier.
</P>
<P>
   But the real focus of the battle is now online. Here, the
competition is not between the quality of journalism but between
the companies' strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones has one big advantage: its newswire. While other
newspapers worry about how to deliver the immediacy that the
Internet demands, Dow Jones is already in the business of
up-to-the-minute news.
</P>
<P>
   With the newswire, the paper and dedicated online editors and
writers, it has an editorial staff of 1,500. The FT, with 350
journalists on the paper and another 110 working online, is small
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones has stuck to the model of charging for its online
newspaper. The Journal's Web edition is frequently updated and has
more technology, but it looks like its paper parent, with the same
typeface and long articles that most readers print off.
</P>
<P>
   It had 375,000 paid subscribers ($29 for print-edition
subscribers, $59 for the rest) in December 1999, up from 266,000 a
year earlier _ a real business with real revenues. But elsewhere
the subscription model is being abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com, a much-hyped but now troubled online rival to the
Journal and the FT, has recently had to move away from it and offer
plenty of free content, and is now looking for a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that Dow Jones has missed an opportunity. Its
DowJones.com site has not been well marketed.
</P>
<P>
   And wsj.com should have been able to exploit the best brand for
the biggest bull market in history. Yet instead of creating a
Web-based business with a huge market capitalization, it has
treated the Internet as just another distribution channel.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Crovitz, who runs Dow Jones's electronic publishing,
rejects both charges, pointing out that the leap in the company's
stock price is down to analysts' approval of its Web strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps wisely, given the imbalance in resources, the FT is
moving towards a model of Web publishing that avoids direct
competition with the Journal.
</P>
<P>
   It has given up the corporate market: in January, it sold FT
Profile, an archive for corporate intranets, to Lexis-Nexis, a
subsidiary of Reed Elsevier. ``It wasn't large enough to compete,''
says John Makinson, finance director at Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   The FT is instead using the paper's brand to create a business
portal. The journalism is different: the paper is broken up into 15
subject areas, news stories are shorter, and background pieces are
broken up into chunks that are easily read on-screen.
</P>
<P>
   There are sports, restaurant, travel and other partner-sites to
click through to, and a business-oriented search engine. The
content (aside from a few bits of the archive) is free.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for the FT is to integrate the paper's
journalists with its dot.com journalists. The 25 percent staff
increase over the past four months has been disruptive; paper
journalists look down on their less experienced, lower-paid dot.com
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they will have to learn to work together because, says Peter
Martin, deputy editor of the paper and editorial director of the
Web edition, ``the aim is to bring the entire intellectual engine
of the paper on to the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company spent Pounds40 million ($65 million) on
FT.com. Revenues were around Pounds7 million ($12 million).
</P>
<P>
   FT.com's strategy relies on Internet advertising taking off. If
it does, the Internet will open up markets that the FT could not
have dreamed of when distribution relied on printing plants and
newspaper boys.
</P>
<P>
   But if instead the Journal's model is right, the Internet may
help it to dominate the world's business newspaper market. &QL;

 UNDATED: ... says Eruzione.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even after Maltsev put the Soviets ahead again on the power play
barely two minutes into the second period, their hosts sensed it
was a different game, a different night this time. The Americans
had been behind, 6-0, at Madison Square Garden. ``This thing's
special,'' Silk mused. ``This could be one of those nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Silk had been a fourth-line wing when the Games began.
Then he scored the first goal against the Swedes ``and it elevated
me.'' So Brooks had moved him to the first line with the aces and
was using him on the power play. Now, with the Americans a man up
with a dozen minutes to play, here came Silk down the left side,
looking to flip the puck over to Johnson before Vasiliev leveled
him.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, the red light was on. The puck had bounced off
defenseman Sergei Starikov's skate and onto the stick of Johnson,
who wristed a shot between Myshkin's legs from 5 feet away. It was
``the goal from nowhere'' and now, anything seemed possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were staying stride for stride with the Soviets,
banging and bollixing them. Now the ``Conehead Line'' _ Schneider,
Mark Pavelich, and John Harrington from the Iron Range _ was coming
up ice and Schneider, out of gas, was lifting his stick to come off
early.
</P>
<P>
   Over the dasher came Eruzione, just in time to collect a pass
from Pavelich, who was whacked in the corner just as he let it go.
Eruzione saw defenseman Vasily Pervukhin go to one knee to block
his shot, used the screen to wrist a 25-footer past Myshkin's
stick, and went dancing and screaming into the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The man who was almost cut a few months before the Games, the
man who wasn't supposed to be on the ice, had put his mates within
reach of the most astounding upset in hockey history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if I want to be real deep about it, I could think it was
destiny,'' Eruzione says. ``It was my time to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   All he and his teammates had to do now was shut down the world's
most prolific scoring machine for half a period.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can still score,'' Brooks reminded his charges as the
clock ticked down. ``They can score plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Finns had had the Soviets down with half as much time left
and lost by two goals. Ten minutes was half a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, if we need one goal we can get one goal,'' says
Fetisov. ``If we need two goals, we can get two.''
</P>
<P>
   Krutov thought he had one, but chinked the post _ and Maltsev
missed the rebound. Vladimir Golikov drove a shot off Craig's pads.
``If we're gonna lose, it's gonna be a good goal,'' Craig vowed to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes left now and Craig's mates were playing kamikaze
hockey, hurling themselves into the corners, dropping in front of
slapshots, happily taking pucks off legs and chests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do anything to win,'' thought O'Callahan. ``And they
won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks was rotating all four lines now, clocking the shifts with
a stopwatch. Tikhonov was staying with his gold-medal vets, the
Mikhailovs and Kharlamovs. ``What's going on?'' Petrov muttered
after seeing three US different faces across from him on the same
shift.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes remaining, then three, then two, each one seeming
like five to the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd skate your shift and come back and look up at the
scoreboard and say, `They forgot to turn on the clock,' '' recalls
O'Callahan. ``You got so you didn't want to look at the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig kept screaming to his defensemen not to tie up the puck,
urging them to keep play going and the clock ticking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want the Soviets to get settled and set something
up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, everyone thought Tikhonov would pull Myshkin and
the Soviets would be skating six on five. But he never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' Brooks thought with 30 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty seconds now, with the Americans moving the puck around,
playing keepaway. ``We're going to win,'' wing Eric Strobel told
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe in miracles?'' ABC announcer Al Michaels asked
the nation, which was watching on tape delay because the
international federation refused to change the 5:30 p.m. start.
``Yes,'' he shouted, as the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Bedlam on the ice. Five teammates mobbed Craig, who had made 36
saves. The bench came dashing onto the ice, hugging anyone in a
white jersey. O'Callahan found Mike Ramsey, the 19-year-old
defenseman from Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was coming at me with his arms in the air,'' recalls
O'Callahan, who'd feared he'd never play after the Soviets caved in
his knee in the pre-Games tuneup in New York. ``He jumped on me and
I jumped on him and we just rolled around a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Then O'Callahan and Craig and Eruzione and Silk, the BU quartet,
went off to the side for a group hug. It was the Beanpot gone
global. Meanwhile, the vanquished champions waited patiently on
their blue line, stunned. They had never had a clock run out on
them at Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shock for everybody,'' remembers Fetisov. ``I knew we were
going to score a goal, even in the last second.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Soviets seemed amused, too, watching the star-spangled
celebration. Look at those wild kids, their expressions said.
``Nice game,'' Mikhailov told Johnson in the doping room.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the locker room, after President Carter had called
Brooks to congratulate him, the players began singing ``God Bless
America,'' until they realized they didn't know the words. So they
hummed instead.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, the result went around the world. The US
aircraft carrier Nimitz, cruising in the Mediterranean, flashed the
score to a nearby Soviet intelligence vessel. Above the Indian
Ocean, after American fighter jets had intercepted them near the
aircraft carrier Coral Sea, two Soviet pilots switched on their
radios. ``Congratulations,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `WE WON!'' headlines read across America the next morning. But
the players knew they'd won nothing yet. If they lost to the Finns
by two goals and the Soviets and Swedes tied, they would leave
without a medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not good enough for all this attention,'' Brooks told
them the next day, when he saw them scribbling autographs before
the workout. ``You're too young to win this thing. You haven't got
the talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Brooks skated them into the floor. ``He was yelling and
screaming at us,'' Eruzione recalls. ``I thought, what's he so
pissed off about? We just beat the Soviets. Then I realized he had
to bring us down.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't blow it, Brooks warned his squad Sunday morning, just
before the faceoff. You've been together too long and come too far
for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our last 60 minutes,'' he said. ``Our last will be our
best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans fell behind, as usual. They tied it up and fell
behind again. After two periods, the Finns led, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty minutes, gentlemen,'' Brooks told his players in the
locker room. ``If it's not 20, you'll never live it down. This will
haunt you the rest of your lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Phil Verchota, the burly teddy-bear forward from Duluth,
stood up. ``There's no (expletive) way the Finns are taking this
away from us,'' O'Callahan remembers him saying.
</P>
<P>
   No way, the Americans kept telling themselves when they returned
to the ice. No way. Verchota tied it up within three minutes, Rob
McClanahan scored the winner three minutes later and Johnson added
the coup de grace four minutes from the end.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much receiving the gold medals from Lord Killanin
that made the miracle real, Silk says. It was seeing the American
flag go up. Then Eruzione, who was on the podium as captain,
beckoned everyone else to join him. Twenty medals, one team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get in early,'' Brooks ordered his champions, who were due at
the White House the next morning. ``I'm not taking a bunch of
drunken hockey players to see the President of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   They were heroes now, deluged with telegrams and phone calls and
parades and luncheons and interviews and endorsement offers and
marriage proposals. All but Eruzione went on to play hockey
somewhere else. All are retired now. But two decades later, the
Boys of Winter are still playing one game _ and always will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still running into people who talk about it, who tell me
where they were when we beat the Russians,'' marvels Eruzione, who
still lives in Winthrop, Mass, just outside of Boston. ``It's like
Pearl Harbor and the Kennedy assassination and the Challenger. But
those were terrible tragedies. Ours was a hockey game.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND NEW YORK _ It is, in some ways, the best of times for
the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet boom has boosted the Journal's advertising revenue
by 40 percent over last year; at the FT (part-owner of The
Economist) it is up around 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants ``brand'' and ``content,'' which both companies
have in spades; the share prices of the papers' parent companies,
Dow Jones and Pearson, have leapt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a worrying time, too. Both papers face new competition
_ from online services and from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Since the FT launched its American edition in September 1997,
circulation has jumped, reaching 102,000 in December 1999 _ not yet
a serious threat to the Journal's 1.7 million, but uncomfortable
for an incumbent whose circulation has slipped by 7 percent over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dow Jones is hitting back in the FT's own territory. Hence
the relaunch, earlier this month, of the Wall Street Journal
Europe, with more staff, more technology coverage and a less
archaic front page.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the FT's second strike: the launch, on Feb. 21, of FT
Deutschland, a German-language daily business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson will not say how much this new venture is costing, but
100 new journalists (some of whom have left before the launch) do
not come cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Running the paper as a joint venture with Gruner + Jahr,
Bertelsmann's magazine arm, offsets some risk; but joint ventures
bring their own problems.
</P>
<P>
   So why take the risk? Because Germany is Europe's biggest
market, which the FT, with a circulation there of 22,000, has
barely penetrated. And German business journalism is stodgy and
slow.
</P>
<P>
   When Oskar Lafontaine resigned as finance minister at 6 p.m.,
the German papers scraped a mention, while the FT had the full
story.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Journal has weighed in with the competition.
Handelsblatt, Germany's main business daily, has a Journal editor
in its offices, and is using Journal copy. The front article is
already livelier.
</P>
<P>
   But the real focus of the battle is now online. Here, the
competition is not between the quality of journalism but between
the companies' strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones has one big advantage: its newswire. While other
newspapers worry about how to deliver the immediacy that the
Internet demands, Dow Jones is already in the business of
up-to-the-minute news.
</P>
<P>
   With the newswire, the paper and dedicated online editors and
writers, it has an editorial staff of 1,500. The FT, with 350
journalists on the paper and another 110 working online, is small
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones has stuck to the model of charging for its online
newspaper. The Journal's Web edition is frequently updated and has
more technology, but it looks like its paper parent, with the same
typeface and long articles that most readers print off.
</P>
<P>
   It had 375,000 paid subscribers ($29 for print-edition
subscribers, $59 for the rest) in December 1999, up from 266,000 a
year earlier _ a real business with real revenues. But elsewhere
the subscription model is being abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com, a much-hyped but now troubled online rival to the
Journal and the FT, has recently had to move away from it and offer
plenty of free content, and is now looking for a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that Dow Jones has missed an opportunity. Its
DowJones.com site has not been well marketed.
</P>
<P>
   And wsj.com should have been able to exploit the best brand for
the biggest bull market in history. Yet instead of creating a
Web-based business with a huge market capitalization, it has
treated the Internet as just another distribution channel.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Crovitz, who runs Dow Jones's electronic publishing,
rejects both charges, pointing out that the leap in the company's
stock price is down to analysts' approval of its Web strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps wisely, given the imbalance in resources, the FT is
moving towards a model of Web publishing that avoids direct
competition with the Journal.
</P>
<P>
   It has given up the corporate market: in January, it sold FT
Profile, an archive for corporate intranets, to Lexis-Nexis, a
subsidiary of Reed Elsevier. ``It wasn't large enough to compete,''
says John Makinson, finance director at Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   The FT is instead using the paper's brand to create a business
portal. The journalism is different: the paper is broken up into 15
subject areas, news stories are shorter, and background pieces are
broken up into chunks that are easily read on-screen.
</P>
<P>
   There are sports, restaurant, travel and other partner-sites to
click through to, and a business-oriented search engine. The
content (aside from a few bits of the archive) is free.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for the FT is to integrate the paper's
journalists with its dot.com journalists. The 25 percent staff
increase over the past four months has been disruptive; paper
journalists look down on their less experienced, lower-paid dot.com
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they will have to learn to work together because, says Peter
Martin, deputy editor of the paper and editorial director of the
Web edition, ``the aim is to bring the entire intellectual engine
of the paper on to the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company spent Pounds40 million ($65 million) on
FT.com. Revenues were around Pounds7 million ($12 million).
</P>
<P>
   FT.com's strategy relies on Internet advertising taking off. If
it does, the Internet will open up markets that the FT could not
have dreamed of when distribution relied on printing plants and
newspaper boys.
</P>
<P>
   But if instead the Journal's model is right, the Internet may
help it to dominate the world's business newspaper market. &QL;

   PRINCETON, N.J. _ It happened almost half a century ago, in a
war that most Americans barely recall.
</P>
<P>
   But the inquiry now going on into the killing in 1950 of a large
number of people at an obscure hamlet in South Korea promises to
bring a murky subject into the uncomfortable daylight of modern
ideas about war.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a blue-ribbon panel of American investigators
returned to South Korea to continue their inquiries into the
incident at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   The story came to light in September, when the Associated Press
ran a starkly detailed account of American soldiers who said they
had gunned down scores, maybe hundreds, of South Korean civilians
in three days in late July 1950.
</P>
<P>
   It is painful for Americans to think of American soldiers
committing war crimes, not least because the allegation about No
Gun Ri comes at a time when an attempt is being made to set up an
international system of war-crimes tribunals that might one day
point a finger at the American troops to whom much of the world
looks for its security.
</P>
<P>
   At first, American army officials had shrugged off the No Gun Ri
accusation. But, once the AP had published its story, the
government moved smartly.
</P>
<P>
   William Cohen, the secretary of defense, ordered Louis Caldera,
the Army secretary, to lead that team of investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A patently independent-minded bunch, these include a former
Washington Post reporter, Don Oberdorfer, and a Harvard history
professor, Ernest May, as well as General Robert Ricassi, a former
commander of American forces in Korea. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 275) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the American Army in Korea was no juggernaut. The
Americans who stumbled into action at the beginning of July 1950 to
help South Korea repel the invading North Korean communists were an
ill-prepared lot, pulled away from the relatively cushy job of
occupying Japan.
</P>
<P>
   They were driven ignominiously and bloodily into a southern
corner of the Korean peninsula by the ferocity of the
Soviet-equipped North Korean People's Army. It was not until well
after the No Gun Ri killings that they began to push their way back
northwards. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the AP's account, the Americans at No Gun Ri had
been at the front for only three days. They were worried that North
Korean soldiers were hiding themselves among South Korean refugees,
and they had orders not to let refugees cross their lines.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the soldiers told the AP that they knew there were
women and children in the crowd hiding under a bridge at No Gun Ri;
one soldier says he shot over their heads rather than kill
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera's panel will have to weigh all these things. The last
time America took a serious look at a war crime of its own, it
botched the job.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1968 an American infantry company killed several
hundred civilians, including children, at two hamlets in Vietnam,
one of them the now infamous My Lai 4. The killing was led by
Lieutenant William Calley.
</P>
<P>
   A commission under a lieutenant-general recommended charging 30
people for covering up the massacre, but only one, a colonel, was
eventually court-martialled, and he was acquitted. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>

life with hard labor for killing or causing the deaths of over 100
Vietnamese. But President Richard Nixon stepped in: the young
killer served only three years, mostly under house arrest in Fort

   The Clinton administration has backed the creation of two United
Nations war-crimes tribunals; they will look into the slaughter of
civilians that took place in Rwanda and ex-Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in June 1998, a U.N. conference in Rome agreed to set up a
permanent International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute people
accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But what is a war crime?
</P>
<P>
   The United States is not happy about the ICC. The definition of
a war crime is still far from clear. To kill civilians deliberately
and unnecessarily is clearly a crime. To kill them when they are
inextricably mixed up with armed enemies who are trying to kill you
is probably not.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Defense Department worries that its soldiers, trying to
help some future Kosovo, may be accused by people whose chief
interest is tripping America up of doing the first when in fact
they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   That anxiety has been heightened by the ex-Yugoslavia war-crimes
tribunal, which was created in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla Del
Ponte, revealed that she was studying a preliminary report
assembled for her predecessor of complaints about possible war
crimes committed during NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia, which
liberated Kosovo from Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's
repression.
</P>
<P>
   Furore. NATO officials, who had relished the tribunal's
indictment of Milosevic last May as a vindication of NATO's fight,
were horrified. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal is in a delicate position. It has no police force
of its own, and relies on NATO countries to carry out war-crimes
arrests in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   It also relies on NATO countries, principally the United States,
for much of the intelligence data needed for evidence against the
most egregious offenders.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it cannot refuse, without endangering its claim to
impartiality, to investigate complaints made by Serbia, Russia and
some human-rights lawyers that certain aspects of NATO's bombing
breached the Geneva Conventions on what can be done in a war.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte says she is studying documents presented by NATO's
accusers, but makes it clear that she has taken no decision whether
to open a ``formal inquiry.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,325) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   America's generals, not noticeably keen on humanitarian wars of
intervention in the first place, are going to be doubly resentful
if human-rights-minded liberals get them into a humanitarian war
and then expose American soldiers to prosecution for what they do
in that war.
</P>
<P>
   The generals, and their government, are therefore squirming. And
anti-Americans abroad, whether of the hard-core Serb variety or the
soft-core French sort, enjoy watching America squirm.
</P>
<P>
   No country relishes talking about its failures. Americans are
roughly as unhappy about My Lai or the B-52 bombing of Vietnam _ or
the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki _ as Britons
are with the firebombing of Dresden or Frenchmen with the bloody
war they fought to try to keep Algeria French.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is to a country's credit if it is prepared to stare hard
at its own past. That is the basic case for Caldera and his team
doing a thorough job at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposed new ICC would have the power to look only
into alleged war crimes committed after its creation, and so would
have no jurisdiction in this case, how the No Gun Ri investigation
is conducted will be seen as a test of America's resolve on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   The ICC's rules say that any country can have first go at
prosecuting its own war-crimes suspects; the ICC can step in only
if it rules that the country concerned has fluffed it, either
through malice or incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Had an ICC been around when Nixon gave his helping hand to
Lieutenant Calley, it might have been tempted to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   But if America shows about No Gun Ri the dedication to the rule
of law that it prides itself on, agonizingly difficult though it
may be to decide exactly what happened there, it will demonstrate
to the rest of the world that it obeys the rules it expects others
to honor.
</P>
<P>
   The world's policeman can police itself. &QL;

   PRINCETON, N.J. _ It happened almost half a century ago, in a
war that most Americans barely recall.
</P>
<P>
   But the inquiry now going on into the killing in 1950 of a large
number of people at an obscure hamlet in South Korea promises to
bring a murky subject into the uncomfortable daylight of modern
ideas about war.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a blue-ribbon panel of American investigators
returned to South Korea to continue their inquiries into the
incident at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   The story came to light in September, when the Associated Press
ran a starkly detailed account of American soldiers who said they
had gunned down scores, maybe hundreds, of South Korean civilians
in three days in late July 1950.
</P>
<P>
   It is painful for Americans to think of American soldiers
committing war crimes, not least because the allegation about No
Gun Ri comes at a time when an attempt is being made to set up an
international system of war-crimes tribunals that might one day
point a finger at the American troops to whom much of the world
looks for its security.
</P>
<P>
   At first, American army officials had shrugged off the No Gun Ri
accusation. But, once the AP had published its story, the
government moved smartly.
</P>
<P>
   William Cohen, the secretary of defense, ordered Louis Caldera,
the Army secretary, to lead that team of investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A patently independent-minded bunch, these include a former
Washington Post reporter, Don Oberdorfer, and a Harvard history
professor, Ernest May, as well as General Robert Ricassi, a former
commander of American forces in Korea. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   At the time, the American Army in Korea was no juggernaut. The
Americans who stumbled into action at the beginning of July 1950 to
help South Korea repel the invading North Korean communists were an
ill-prepared lot, pulled away from the relatively cushy job of
occupying Japan.
</P>
<P>
   They were driven ignominiously and bloodily into a southern
corner of the Korean peninsula by the ferocity of the
Soviet-equipped North Korean People's Army. It was not until well
after the No Gun Ri killings that they began to push their way back
northwards. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the AP's account, the Americans at No Gun Ri had
been at the front for only three days. They were worried that North
Korean soldiers were hiding themselves among South Korean refugees,
and they had orders not to let refugees cross their lines.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the soldiers told the AP that they knew there were
women and children in the crowd hiding under a bridge at No Gun Ri;
one soldier says he shot over their heads rather than kill
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera's panel will have to weigh all these things. The last
time America took a serious look at a war crime of its own, it
botched the job.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1968 an American infantry company killed several
hundred civilians, including children, at two hamlets in Vietnam,
one of them the now infamous My Lai 4. The killing was led by
Lieutenant William Calley.
</P>
<P>
   A commission under a lieutenant-general recommended charging 30
people for covering up the massacre, but only one, a colonel, was
eventually court-martialled, and he was acquitted. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC;

TAX DEBATE GROWS AS NET BOOM ROLLS ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER AND STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   E-commerce continues to boom as more consumers than ever click
on the ``buy'' buttons at Amazon.com and other online shops. But an
unresolved issue hangs over the emerging online marketplace:
whether cyberpurchases should be subject to the same sales taxes
levied on brick-and-mortar retailing.
</P>
<P>
   While a congressional commission has been examining the question
and hopes to issue recommendations this year, any chance of
reaching consensus in 2000 seems remote given the wide range of
views on how sales taxes would affect e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The basic positions on sales taxes are clear: Opponents fear a
tax would dramatically slow the spread of e-commerce, just as it is
on the verge of gaining a secure foothold among consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the increased acceptance of online retailing
could potentially produce sales-tax numbers that are too large to
ignore. And they say ``e-tailers'' will have a competitive
advantage over regular retailers unless they are also required to
collect sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Between these two poles, there is an array of opinions and
alliances, but even those whose allegiances are clearly on the side
of protecting e-commerce think sales taxes in some form are
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see how the tax system would withstand the
Internet being tax-free,'' said Shikhar Ghosh, head of iBelong Inc.
and chair of the Massachusetts Software and Internet Council.
</P>
<P>
   For now, a federal moratorium on new Internet taxes is in place
at least through October 2001, with the result that the states are
becoming the battleground on the sales-tax issue.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, legislators plan to study how much sales-tax
revenue the state is losing on orders residents place over the Web.
Representative John H. Rogers (D-Norwood), cochair of the taxation
committee, said that the risk of doing nothing could be that ``this
technology would gradually make the sales tax obsolete'' as
ever-more shopping and purchasing moves online.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said a subcommittee will be formed to study the tax issue
in coming months, though an aide to Senator Marian Walsh, the other
cochair, said no action is expected before 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The mere formation of the subcommittee is controversial. Last
year, Governor Paul Cellucci, a staunch opponent of Internet sales
taxes, vetoed a budget item that would have created a commission to
study e-commerce taxes. Cellucci testified recently before Congress
against sales taxes, and on Wednesday he will take his antitax
message to a technology luncheon in Newton, appearing with Virgina
Governor James Gilmore, another sales-tax opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, who also chairs the federal Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce that is studying Internet tax issues, faces
bills in the Virginia General Assembly to eliminate retail sales
taxes, on the grounds that if online retailers don't have to
collect a sales tax, neither should brick-and-mortar merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore said the bills are simply political posturing and have
no real chance of passing. Despite the ongoing debate, he believes
the federal moratorium on sales taxes could be extended several
years while the issue continues to be sorted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a desire right now for a continued moratorium,''
Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   It is an open question whether the states are bound by the
moratorium, but so far most are following the federal government's
lead.
</P>
<P>
   In response, some state and local officials have argued that
they may be forced to raise other taxes to make up for lost revenue
if the emerging online marketplace continues to grow. Sales taxes
accounted for $3.3 billion of the $14.2 billion in taxes
Massachusetts collected last year.
</P>
<P>
   But these leaders have run into resistance from governors who
want to protect the booming technology sectors that have boosted
their states' economies.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines have grown fuzzier _ and thornier _ over time.
Conservative Republicans are battling conservative Republicans.
Retailers are duking it out with retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Even traditional merchants aren't always on the same side.
Federated Department Stores Inc., an old-line merchant that has
planted solid roots online with macys.com, is conspicuously absent
from the parade of traditional merchants complaining that their
online rivals are being pampered.
</P>
<P>
   Technology firms also have developed different positions on the
tax issue. Internet gateways America Online Inc. and Lycos Inc. are
staunchly opposed to Internet commerce taxes. But a few high-tech
companies have said they would support some online taxes if the
tens of thousands of local and state tax systems _ each with its
own different regulations _ were somehow simplified.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over taxing so-called ``remote'' sellers such as
eToys Inc. is hardly new. The issue first emerged following the
explosion in catalog sales. It resurfaced several years ago when
tax collectors nationwide began suspecting that the online
marketplace would grow much, much larger.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Internet retail sales are fast gaining ground on catalog
sales. The Direct Marketing Association says online sales will
reach $31.1 billion in 2004 compared with $75.5 billion in catalog
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe Internet revenue will surpass catalog revenue by
2004. By then, Forrester Research estimates, online sales
nationwide could reach $184 billion, up from $20 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet and catalog transactions are already subject to
state sales taxes. But they go largely unpaid because most of these
retailers aren't required to collect those taxes unless they
actually have operations in the state where the purchase is made.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, consumers are supposd to be reporting their sales tax
obligations on many of their catalog and online purchases. But
these rules are rarely enforced by the states where they are in
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers have been further baffled by retailers' decisions to
tax or not to tax. Nordstrom Inc., for instance, charges online
sales taxes in states where it operates department stores. A Web
site co-owned by Barnes &AMP; Noble does not have widespread taxes
because the retailer considers its online store to be a separate
division. Also giving most consumers a tax-free shopping experience
are a host of retailers who exist only in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   On its own, Staples Inc. has figured out a way to collect sales
taxes from electronic customers in each of the 44 states in which
it operates retail stores. It wants its online rivals to figure it
out, too.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the company is looking for ``any state initiative
that levels the playing field,'' said Shannon Lapierre, a Staples
spokeswoman.

MORE HONEYMOON HORRORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether it's cow flop or cackling chickens, the unexpected can
get in the way of honeymoon bliss. Here are more terror tales from
entrants in Thrifty Car Rentals' sixth annual Honeymoon Disasters
Contest:
</P>
<P>
   --Alie and Ray Randlett of Cape Coral, Fla., decided to reenact
a love scene from a classic TV commercial by running through a
field of wildflowers in Virginia _ and ended up tromping through
cow patties. They also decided to jog along a mountain trail, but
the rains came, leaving them ankle deep in a rushing stream. Did we
mention the early-morning fire at their hotel?
</P>
<P>
   --Nancy and Paul Jack Davis of Phoenix were married secretly,
then ran off to a backwoods cabin to escape the bride's unhappy
family. But her dad and his cohorts found them, socked the groom in
the face, and dragged the bride off. A car chase followed, with the
groom ending up spending the weekend in jail. But love won out.
</P>
<P>
   --Ann Porter and Don Williamson of Tallahassee were going
camping in Montana, so they stored fuel in their backpacks, which
they brought aboard their plane. That fuel leaked from the overhead
bin, necessitating an emergency landing and a visit from the
hazardous materials crew. Add to that a $1,700 fine from the
Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   --Kristi and Robert Macarelli of Fort Myers, Fla., suffered
severe sunburn, had their luggage ransacked, shared a bus with live
chickens, were bumped from three flights, and endured unending
rain, insulting cabbies, and snakes. They got seasick on a cruise,

BOSTON: IT'S CRUISE CITY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's going to be a great cruise season for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   With 122 ship calls this season, business at the Black Falcon
Cruise Terminal has increased nearly tenfold since 1985 when only
13 ships called.
</P>
<P>
   The best news, though, is the number of ships that will depart
Boston on cruises to Canada, Bermuda, New England ports, England,
and nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the list is the Norwegian Majesty's 27 weekly cruises to
Bermuda. Carnival Cruise Line's Carnival Destiny will offer two
four-day voyages, May 22 and 29, calling on Halifax, Nova Scotia,
and St. John, New Brunswick; and a three-day cruise, leaving May
26, to St. John. Premier Cruise Line is bringing in two ships: the
Seabreeze and the Big Red Boat. The Seabreeze will offer 36
embarkations alternating two-night cruises to nowhere and
five-night cruises to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Red Boat will only be calling on Boston during its New
England/Canada cruises out of New York. Premier soon will have four
Big Red Boats sailing out of New York, Florida, California, and
.....
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Elizabeth 2 will offer trans-Atlanic service from
Boston with four six-day cruises to Southampton, England, leaving
May 11, June 6, and Sept. 4 and 24. The QE2 recently underwent a
major renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean's Splendor of the Seas will make four
embarkations this fall on its New England/Canada itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Silverseas Cruise Line's Silver Wind arrives in Boston from
Dublin Sept. 22 for a Sept. 23 embarkation to New England/Canada
ports. The line's newest ship, the Silver Shadow, will visit Oct.
13.
</P>
<P>
   The 122 visits are expected to bring more than 200,000 cruise
ship passengers through the Black Falcon terminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cruise ship industry will bring jobs and increased
economic opportunity to the Boston area,'' said Virginia
Buckingham, Massachusetts Port Authority executive director.
Massport is now investing $10 million to expand and modernize the
terminal, added new gangways to accommodate larger ships (the
Destiny is one of the world's largest), and improving ticketing,
waiting, and baggage areas. ``This season alone we have 18 dates
with multiple embarkations,'' said Michael Leone, port director. On
Sept. 24, Black Falcon will have three embarkations _ the QE2,
Norwegian Majesty, and Seabreeze.

   The Washington Post reported that Clipper Cruise Line's
102-passenger Nantucket Clipper voluntarily shut down in St. Thomas
because of the flu. The paper said that, according to Dave Forney
of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately
half the ship's passengers had become sick on two successive
cruises. (The CDC, which monitors conditions aboard ships that call
at American ports, becomes concerned when 4 percent of passengers
become ill, the report said).
</P>
<P>
   Following an inspection by epidemiologists, the ship has resumed
sailings.
</P>

   If you are concerned about a cruise ship's sanitation, call the
CDC's International Travelers Information line at 404-639-2573 or

<P>
   The Norwegian Coastal Voyage is offering savings of $90 to $220
to passengers 67 and older on the 1,250-mile trip along Norway's
spectacular west coast. The 11-ship fleet sails daily year round
between Bergen in the south and Kirkenes in the north, above the
Arctic Circle. More than half the ships have been built since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Senior savings are available except from June 1 to July 15.
Fares, with the savings, begin at $1,075 a person.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian Coastal Voyage has been operating since 1893, its
ships doubling as cargo vessels and local transportation for
Norwegians. The ships call at 34 fishing villages, towns, and
cities, pausing only briefly at some places to pick up and unload
goods, and at others long enough for sightseeing and shopping.
Ports visited at night on the northbound voyage are called on in
the daytime during the southbound trip.

   A new and innovative guest loyalty program for travelers who
sail on the six lines belonging to World's Leading Cruise Lines _
Carnival, Holland America, Windstar, Seabourn, Cunard, and Costa _
is now available.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called Vacation Interchange Privileges, provides
the same discount benefits accorded to members of each line's past
program.
</P>
<P>
   For example, guests who sail on Seabourn, Windstar, or Cunard
will not only have access to discounts offered through past-guest
programs of the Seabourn Club, Windstar Foremast Club, and Cunard
World Club, but also savings available through any of the six WLCL
member lines' repeat-passenger programs. All the cruise line
members of the WLCL are owned by Carnival.
</P>
<P>
   Savings of up to 50 percent are offered on select sailings of
Carnival, Costa, and Windstar. The discounts on Holland America are
up to 35 percent and those on Cunard, up to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the discount, a traveler simply books a cruise through any
travel agent, who then informs the cruise line reservations agent
of the past-guest status at the time of bookings and, with the
initial deposit, supplies proof of the prior WLCL cruise. Other
restrictions may apply.
</P>

   New canal boat &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Canal boating, long a favorite way to travel in France and
England, among other European countries, is coming to New England.
The Blackstone Valley Tourism Council's 40-foot canal boat, the
Samuel Slater, has arrived in Central Falls, R.I. The boat, built
in England to ensure authenticity, will be used for sightseeing and
overnight stays on the Blackstone River, which runs through the
Blackstone Valley region of Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Plans
are to use the boat for overnight stays at a cost of $125. The boat
is named for Samuel Slater, who began America's Industrial
Revolution at a mill in Pawtucket, R.I., that is now a museum to
that period.
</P>
<P>
   One of the country's earliest canals was along the Blackstone,
providing transportation of goods from the many mills that lined
its banks. The boat will not be sailing along the rivers of nearby
Providence because, according to a story in the Providence Journal,
those waters are considered navigable waterways, which under law
allow only US-built boats to carry cargo and passengers between US
destinations. The Blackstone is not considered a navigable
waterway.
</P>
<P>
   The council is seeking period furnishings for the boat, and
plans to put the vessel into service sometime this spring.

&HT;     PALM INTRODUCES ORGANIZER WITH COLOR SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT BEER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ever since the Palm Pilot was introduced in
1996, its fans have been hoping for a color screen. Now they have
it.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Inc., the spin-off division of 3Com that plans its own
initial public offering, unwrapped its Palm IIIc ('c' for color)
hand-held organizer on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new Palm substantially raises the bar in the hand-held
computing world. The Palm already owns at least 70 percent of the
market against competitors Microsoft, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and
others.
</P>
<P>
   The other hand-held color computers on the market, including
Compaq's Aero 2100, are heavy, the screens are somewhat dim, and
they're powered by Microsoft's Windows CE software, a woefully weak
platform when put up against the elegant, easy-to-use Palm OS.
</P>
<P>
   The new Palm IIIc beats the competition handily in both these
categories.
</P>
<P>
   The new device sports what is called an active matrix thin film
transistor display. It is the same kind of screen found in some
laptops. It is crisp, bright, and displays colors with as much
vibrancy as any laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Its color capabilities are driven by an internal lithium ion
battery. This power source is rechargeable through the included
desktop ``cradle,'' which also allows the Palm IIIc to be
synchronized with computer applications such as the Microsoft
Outlook or Palm's own personal information software.
</P>
<P>
   Palm is claiming the device will work for up to two weeks
between recharges, depending on how bright the screen is. If you
are on the road for longer periods of time, you may want to
consider the optional car/airplane or home charging cords. Or
simply pack the cradle.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm IIIc is packed in the classic III case. Apparently,
company engineers could not fit the battery needed for the color
display into the sleeker Palm V case. The battery also boosts the
weight of the Palm IIIc to 6.8 ounces, a smidgen over the Palm
III's 6 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good trade-off for the delight of having a bright, color
screen. There aren't that many color applications actually
available for the new color Palm. The device comes with a
backgammon and a full-color calculator. Considering the robust
40,000-plus developers' market for Palm software, you can expect
the color-based Palm software market to emerge simultaneously with
the IIIc.
</P>
<P>
   Also included with the Palm is the new Palm OS 3.5. It's a
tweaked version of the aforementioned operating system. Chief among
its new features are drop-down menus that appear with a title bar
tap, and a new view in the datebook which summarizes all
appointments and to-dos on one screen.
</P>
<P>
   There are some imperfections with the Palm IIIc: The screen is
nearly unreadable in bright light, a problem the gray-scale LCD
Palms don't have. You have to step into the shadows to see the
screen in those situations.
</P>
<P>
   And the price of this new Palm is a bit steep: $450 list, though
it is already being advertised at less than $400 on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   All-in-all, the new Palm IIIc is a more than worthy addition to
the Palm line.

COLLEGES TARGET APATHY WITH INSTRUCTION IN CITIZENSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A professor tells of a college student who had volunteered, like
so many of his peers, in a soup kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a great experience, the student enthused, he hoped
his grandchildren would get the same opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   He did not seem to realize, the professor recalls with some
alarm, that this might be missing a point.
</P>
<P>
   When colleges began encouraging volunteerism a decade ago, it
was because they wanted students to become good citizens, to see
their responsibility for improving the nation's future.
</P>
<P>
   All they got, though, was good volunteers. Students are turning
out to build homes, tutor children, feed the poor, in record
numbers. But their voting participation rate is the lowest it has
been since 18-year-olds got the franchise. Discussion of politics
on campus, interest in social activism, and desire to ``be a
community leader'' have sunk.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the disconnect, higher education is taking a
more deliberate tack toward instruction in citizenship. The change
is not without critics, given how it departs from long-held notions
about what universities are and are not supposed to teach. But more
and more, college presidents are saying it is irresponsible for
higher education to default to apathy.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts leads the pack with the inauguration last month of its
University College of Citizenship and Public Service, which by 2002
will include courses across the catalog on everything from the
intricacies of political polling to the steps required to mount a
campaign for environmental cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Holyoke made the opening of its new Center for Leadership
and Public Advocacy the number one goal of its recent mission
statement. And over the past six months, scores of presidents
involved in Campus Compact, an organization founded in 1985 to try
to combat student apathy by encouraging community service, have
signed a pledge to increase voter registration on campus, engage in
their local communities, and create courses teaching ``the values
and skills of our democratic society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought that the way to get citizenship was to
just throw students out into service without challenging them to
think in a civic way, to think about the public issues that
underlie the very need for the service they're doing,'' said Rick
Battistoni, a political science professor at Providence College.
``A lot of service programs have worked hard to get students the
opportunity to do service, but they haven't challenged them to
think.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal, proponents of the curriculum say, is to make students
see the connection between, say, working in the soup kitchen and
understanding the conditions behind homelessness, being able to
evaluate policy changes that might alleviate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizenship has to become truly part of the fabric of the
university,'' said Tufts President John DiBiaggio. ``It doesn't
seem to me we can graduate students only with the ability to be
competitive for a job or admission to graduate or professional
school. We do that already. That's not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBiaggio, the head of Campus Compact, is such an enthusiastic
proponent of civic education that he is teaching the inaugural
seminar in the University College, a course called ``Leadership for
Active Citizenship'' that he sees as the first step ``to make
citizenship the defining signature strength of Tufts.''
</P>
<P>
   The first in an Italian immigrant family to go to college,
DiBiaggio recalled how the state of Michigan honored his father for
never failing to vote in any local, state, or national election.
Having left a country where elections didn't really mean choice,
the president recalled, his father got angry with anyone who had a
choice and didn't exercise it.
</P>
<P>
   These days, many students do not. While a record 75.3 percent of
college freshmen last fall did volunteer work in high school, only
15 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds voted in the 1998 election. This
year's annual freshmen survey by the University of Southern
California at Los Angeles found only 16.7 percent of students
interested in ``influencing the political structure,'' 26 percent
interested in keeping up with political affairs, and 28 percent in
``being a community leader.'' (By contrast, 73.4 percent of
students said they want to be well-off financially.)
</P>
<P>
   The Tufts trustees approved the University College in late 1998.
By 2002, it will include eight chaired professorships in each of
Tufts' schools, and offer a certificate program _ something less
than a minor _ for students who complete a certain number of
courses and service requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But the goal, DiBiaggio said, is to avoid making a separate
degree or specialty of citizenship and public service. Rather, in
the same way many schools have tried to include math or writing
``across the curriculum,'' the university wants to integrate
lessons of citizenship into courses in all departments. Ultimately,
officials say, it will be hard for any student to avoid exposure to
the how-to's of ``active citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This says this is critical enough, important enough, for us to
invest in,'' DiBiaggio said. ``We can say it's important, we can
have it as our vision statement, but this formalizes it. It's nice
to express a lot of platitudes, but it's another to convert it into
action.''
</P>
<P>
   The 50 students in his introductory course are an idealistic
lot. In their applications to be admitted to the class, they listed
experience working in community service projects in places like
Brownsville, Texas. One student said her goal was that ``every
child should have food or access to food.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBiaggio sees his task to take that inchoate idealism and turn
it into activism. He asks the students what makes a good leader. A
young woman in the front row quietly offers, ``To help change
others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a dream, not a goal,'' DiBiaggio retorts. ``So, how are
you going to do it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To see that more people have opportunities?'' she offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a dream, a wonderful dream,'' he says. ``But a
goal is something different. To address your dreams, that's why you
have goals, an action plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But to some other colleges, all the talk of teaching citizenship
sounds like a marketing gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   In their pitch to trustees, Tufts officials acknowledged the new
college will make the university more marketable among prospective
students, by defining a niche. They also say it will boost
fund-raising, and it has, with Democratic fund-raiser Alan
Solomont, a Tufts alumnus, leading the drive.
</P>
<P>
   And, as in the debate on teaching values, some question whether
you can teach, much less define, qualities like ``leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The probing analysis of these questions is why we have history
departments, women's studies departments, political science
departments,'' said Tom Gerety, president of Amherst College, who
still recounts his days as a campus activist at Yale. ``The
institution of protest is, I think, bogus, and instituting a
catechism of good citizenship is suspect. It exploits the deference
of our students to try to teach them these things. We should be

DIALLO TRIAL ENTERS FINAL PHASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Amadou Diallo trial is entering its final phase,
but the case surrounding it is not nearly over, nor are its
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was the West African immigrant who, just over a year ago,
was gunned down by four white police officers who fired 41 bullets
as he stood, unarmed, in the doorway of his Bronx apartment
building.
</P>
<P>
   The killing unleashed pent-up racial tensions in this city, and
prompted weeks of protests against police abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers, who were members of the New York Police
Department's elite Street Crime Unit, were indicted on charges of
second-degree murder, the first time any officer here had been
charged with murder for something done while on the job.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after two weeks of testimony, many doubt that the
racially mixed jury will find the officers guilty. Certainly the
prosecutors have their doubts. Last week, they asked the judge to
let the jurors consider less serious charges, including
manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The judge agreed,
as did the officers' lawyers, with noticeable relief.
</P>
<P>
   While second-degree murder carries a jail term of 15 years to
life, manslaughter could result in as light a sentence as 18
months, while criminally negligent homicide can lead to mere
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Many took the move as a sign that the prosecutors
``overreached'' in seeking an indictment for murder. All along,
their lawyers have called the shooting ``a tragedy, not a crime,''
and last week the officers themselves _ Sean Carroll, Edward
McMellon, Richard Murphy, and Kenneth Boss _ finally took the stand
to tell their side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed Diallo was acting suspiciously in his doorway, and
that when they approached him, he pulled what they thought was a
gun from his pocket. One of them yelled ``Gun!'' and they all
fired. They also said Diallo was still standing, meaning he was
still seen as a threat, so they kept up the fire.
</P>
<P>
   After the smoke cleared, the officers said, they approached the
body and saw that the object Diallo had been grabbing was his
wallet, not a gun. They testified that they went into shock or
broke down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, called by the defense lawyers, confirmed she heard
an officer yell ``Gun!'' However, upon cross-examination, she also
testified that the police continued to fire after Diallo fell to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers tried to discredit that part of her testimony,
noting she had earlier said Diallo stood during most of the
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   However, a medical examiner, called by the prosecution,
testified that one bullet seemed to enter Diallo's foot and dart up
toward his knee, a trajectory suggesting shots were fired as Diallo
lay on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of this testimony, all of which was challenged,
lies in the two legal definitions for second-degree murder. One
involves an ``intent'' to commit murder, which does not fit this
case. The other involves a ``depraved indifference to life.'' The
prosecution argued, and will insist, again, in closing statements,
that by firing 41 bullets and continuing to fire after Diallo fell,
the officers displayed a ``depraved indifference'' to Diallo's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers think this is still far-fetched; that, however
trigger-happy or nervous or aggressive the officers may have been,
their behavior falls short of ``depraved.''
</P>
<P>
   In his instructions to the jury, Judge Joseph C. Teresi will say
citizens have the right to use force if they ``reasonably'' believe
it necessary to defend themselves. He will also say the law allows
police a particular benefit of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
who spoke at many of the protests against the officers last summer,
acknowledged in an interview last week, ``This kind of case is very
tough to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been saying as much to several black leaders who
have been protesting during the trial, outside the Albany
courthouse, where the case was moved after a panel of judges ruled
that the officers could not get a fair trial in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privately, I think they see the point,'' Siegel said. ``But
publicly, they go back out there and say it's murder, pure and
simple.'' If the police are acquitted, or convicted of the lesser
crimes, Siegel said he thinks it may be necessary to ``walk the
streets'' to calm people's anger.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been leading the protests from the
beginning, said Friday that demonstrations will continue if the
verdict falls short of murder, but he emphasized they will be
peaceful. ``We don't want Amadou's name tarnished with any
violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The major focus, he said, will be to push the US Justice
Department to bring a federal civil rights case against the four
officers. The lawyers for Diallo's parents will also file a civil
lawsuit against the city.
</P>
<P>
   There are several precedents for a federal case, notably in the
case of Los Angeles motorist Rodney King. A state court jury
acquitted the police officers who beat King on a highway, but
federal prosecutors later tried them for violating King's civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Questions also remain about the court order to move the trial to
Albany. Even if one accepts the argument that a Bronx jury could
not give white police a fair trial, and many do not accept that, it
seemed clear when the case began that the officers would request a
trial by judge.
</P>
<P>
   The judge chosen to hear the case was a black woman with a
liberal reputation. Sharpton and others suspect the case was moved
because the judge was black, another possible violation.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel regrets that the case was moved for another reason: ``If
the cops are acquitted,'' he said, ``it would have more legitimacy
in the community had that been decided by a local jury or by a
black judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, unless the upstate jury finds the officers guilty, he fears
that the doubts, distrust, and suspicion will linger, not only over
this case but between police and the city's citizens generally.

SIX YEARS LATER, BOOK STILL IRKS MANY IN THE EAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BERKELEY, Calif. _ There was a time when Silicon Valley and
Route 128 were mentioned in the same breath, as if the two regions
were exactly alike in their technological prowess, the only
difference being the weather.
</P>
<P>
   AnnaLee Saxenian, who grew up in Concord, Mass. and attended
graduate school in Berkeley, Calif. and Cambridge, Mass., knew
better. In 1991, she set out to prove what she intuitively knew _
that New England and Silicon Valley were fundamentally different in
their approaches to technology and that those differences would
lead one region to grow faster than the other.
</P>
<P>
   The results of her research were published in ``Regional
Advantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route
128.'' Though the book is now six years old, it still has the power
to evoke strong opinions and is frequently invoked in conversations
comparing the two regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people who would spit at the mention of her book,''
says Eric R. Giler, president and founder of Brooktrout Inc. in
Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, Saxenian's book traces the evolution of the two
regions and concludes that Boston was dominated by big companies
that were too rigid, closed, and hierarchical to adapt to
fast-changing technologies.
</P>
<P>
   As proof, Saxenian points to companies such as Digital Equipment
Corp., Data General Corp., and Wang Laboratories Inc., all of which
have withered. By contrast, Saxenian found Silicon Valley teeming
with smaller, fleet-footed companies that encouraged workers to
network, exchange ideas, and embrace risk.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed in Massachusetts since Saxenian published
her controversial book in 1994. The state is now home to hot
start-ups such as Akamai Technologies Inc. in Cambridge and
Sycamore Networks in Chelmsford, as well as fast-growing, large
companies such as EMC Corp. in Hopkinton.
</P>
<P>
   Software, the coin of the New Economy, is a vibrant industry in
Massachusetts, growing from 800 companies 10 years ago to more than
3,000 today. Saxenian's critics point out that her book chronicled
the decline of the area's hardware sector, without paying much heed
to the meteoric rise of the software sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``She missed the whole software revolution,'' says Joyce
Plotkin, president of the Massachusetts Software and Internet
Council. Plotkin pointed to a study released last July from the
Progressive Policy Institute in Boston that put Massachusetts at
the top of the list of states best positioned for innovation.
</P>
<P>
   But Saxenian, now 45, does not waver from her conclusions. In an
interview last Tuesday in her Berkeley home, she said: ``The
argument in `Regional Advantage' continues to apply. While Route
128 has been changing, it's a catch-up game now. The scale in
Silicon Valley is just much greater, and the infrastructure here is
far more developed. The center of gravity in terms of innovation is
still Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   That blunt, unapologetic stance may have earned Saxenian a
reputation in Massachusetts as the Camille Paglia of technology,
but Saxenian herself is surprisingly unassuming in appearance. With
her toothy grin, dark curly hair, and friendly, nervous manner, one
can easily mistake her for a graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   Saxenian began studying Silicon Valley in 1980 as a graduate
student at the University of California at Berkeley, where she is
now an associate professor. She was struck by how much people in
the region's semiconductor industry knew one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intuitively, I knew this place was different than what I had
grown up with around in Boston,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving her master's degree in regional planning at
Berkeley, she went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for
a doctorate in political science and began teaching at Berkeley in
1989, developing a reputation as an expert on Silicon Valley, just
as the region exploded in prominence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used Route 128 as a foil to contrast how one region was
following a model of big, vertically integrated companies, while
Silicon Valley was following a different model,'' Saxenian said.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the apparent hostility toward her book, technology
leaders in Boston agree that Route 128 needs to foster more Silicon
Valley-style tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, Stanford University not only teaches students,
it provides a catalyst for people to network. Our universities here
need to take a much bigger role in doing that,'' says William J.
Warner, who founded Wildfire Communications Inc. in Lexington and
Avid Technology Inc. in Tewksbury.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, rare praise emerges from Saxenian's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard so many negative things about the book that I decided
to read it myself,'' Giler says. ``I found that the book is
completely accurate.''

SERVICE ADDS FACE VALUE TO INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If all the time we are spending on the Internet is turning us
into a nation of antisocial losers, as Stanford University
researchers reported last week, what about making our Internet
chatting something more like real human interaction?
</P>
<P>
   That's one big possibility for a newly launched version of a
service that allows you to see and hear people you are chatting
with on the Net, so you can have something a little more like a
face-to-face conversation thaembodied exchange of one-liners
in a chat room.
</P>
<P>
   The software, called CU-SeeMe World, developed at Cornell
University and licensed by White Pine Software of Nashua, has been
around for more than four years and now counts up to 4 million
users globally.
</P>
<P>
   What's new is that CU-SeeMe is quietly starting to offer a new
version of the system that can be quickly downloaded, for free,
from the Net instead of requiring you to spend $70 by mail order or
at CompUSA to install it in your machine.
</P>
<P>
   Through the cuseemeworld.com Web site, people who have paid $50
or $100 for a little camera to mount on top of their computer
monitor can set up video chat rooms ``on the fly.'' The idea of
giving it away is to attract more advertising to the site and spur
demand for premium versions of the service, including fully private
and lurker-proof chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Let's ignore the obvious possibilities for the Net's singles-bar
and trawling-for-sex chat rooms. What the new version of CU-SeeMe
makes eminently more doable are things like:
</P>
<P>
   --Sunday-afternoon conversations among far-flung family members
where you can see little Alice in her new dress and see how Uncle
Joe looks since he shaved off his nasty beard.
</P>
<P>
   --Nighttime get-togethers for eighth-grade girls plotting what
tomorrow's outfit must be.
</P>
<P>
   --A ``call'' to Grandma or to Dad on Army duty in Bosnia to show
how you are dressing your kid for Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one pervasive downside of Internet business has always
been the lack of contact with an actual human being,'' says Killko
Caballero, White Pine's president and chief executive. Everything
from call centers and help desks to chat rooms ``immediately become
more valuable entities with the enhancement of seeing who you are
talking to.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe adding some sexy technology could make talking to
family and friends more appealing for the 25 percent of hour-a-day
Internet users who, according to the Stanford study, admit they
spend less time talking to real people they know because they're
spending the time on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The new CU-SeeMe version is initially designed to support three
images at a time, but it can go up to 12 images at a time or more
or down to just one person for more face-to-face conversation.
While participating in a chat in the lower left corner, people can
click on a button to see the face of one of their chat
participants. They can also look up whatever information, or
fiction, fellow chatters offer about who they are. To avoid
cacophony and cross-talk, users can shut off the sound and just
enjoy text chatting.
</P>
<P>
   With three or more people on the screen, the pictures are not
necessarily terrific _ about the size of an image on a baseball
card. If you are using a 56k dial-up modem, expect to see some
choppiness in the video image, but with a broadband connection you
can see something as good as the 30-frames-per-second image quality
you would see on television. Broadband is also crucial to
supporting more than three people at a time in a visual chat.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more Americans get high-speed Net access _ nearly 14
million within four years _ using your computer as the videophone
that AT&AMP;T predicted in 1964 seems like an inescapable fad-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Services like these are already making inroads at hundreds of
companies that use them as an alternative to scheduling
face-to-face meetings for far-flung employees. Microsoft, for
example, offers NetMeeting, often bundled with Windows, which
competes with a business-oriented product of White Pine's
MeetingPoint. Vocal Communications Ltd. of Fort Lee, N.J., which is
known mainly for voice calling over the Internet, offers a version
that can add video as well.
</P>
<P>
   Where White Pine thinks it has a big lead, for now, is in how
quickly and easily casual home users can try out its video
chatting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enables you to be face to face with the click of a mouse,''
said Willy Wiegler, director and executive producer of CU-SeeMe
World. ``If you can get on the Net, you can use this.''

`FACEPRINTS' RAISE FEARS OF `BIG BROTHER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your face is on its way to becoming your ``fingerprint'' _ for
accessing ATM machines, entering the workplace, checking in at
airline ticketing counters and even getting you into your own
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of punching in an easily-forgotten series of letters or
numbers, or digging through a thicket of plastic cards in your
wallet to fish out an ID, you may soon turn toward a closed-circuit
TV camera to get you into your workplace or gain access to an ATM
machine.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a second, a face-recognition program will scan your
features while it electronically riffles through millions of stored
``faceprints'' to find the proper match and signal an OK _ or a
flashing warning sign that the face it's scanning isn't yours.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it all possible is artificial intelligence software
that can extract from a video image the unique pattern of
irregularities in the human face, and compare it with facial images
stored in a data bank.
</P>
<P>
   These programs mimic the way the human brain recogonizes a face.
That is, when a video camera captures a face, the programs
electronically analyze the distances between various parts, or
landmarks, of the face. Because every face has its own distinct
pattern, the information enables the programs to distinguish one
individual from another.
</P>
<P>
   Facial landmarks are on distinctive structures, like the eye
sockets, the bridge of the nose, or the cheekbones, explains Joseph
Atick, a former mathematical physicist who heads Visionics Corp. of
Jersey City, N.J., the maker of a leading face-recognition program
called FaceIt. The face has 60 landmarks, ``but it only takes 14 to
reconstruct'' an individual's distinctive facial pattern, Atick
said.
</P>
<P>
   While face-recognition methods may make it easier for banks and
employers to identify you, they have another large and growing
application that many find troubling: The programs, when used with
automated closed-circuit TV, or CCTV, cameras and zoom lenses,
become powerful surveillance tools.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties activists worry that the technology will be used
to monitor the movements of ordinary citizens and might be unfairly
focused on political activists or minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has very frightening consequences that we have only begun
to explore,'' said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he said, the technology could ``make it impossible
to maintain anonymity in society, so that even the most innocent of
our movements and activities will be subject to tracking by the
public and private sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   In commercial use since 1997, the technology is used for
spotting known cardsharks in US casinos, catching repeat
shoplifters in England, and checking for known terrorists in
international airports.
</P>
<P>
   Both CCTV and face-recognition applications are already used by
law enforcement officials in Britain, where high-tech surveillance
by the government is much more accepted than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Newham, a borough of East London, have adopted
Visionics' FaceIt system to check people in the streets against a
database of known criminals. In one instance last December, the
system was used to identify trouble-makers hanging around a soccer
stadium before a big match. And Newham officials say the system has
significantly reduced crime there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't regard ourselves as `Big Brother,' '' said Bob Lack,
who manages security technology for the East London borough of
Newham, where the cameras watch an inner-city area. ``We're more
like a friendly uncle and aunt watching over you'' to prevent
muggings and robberies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Prime Minister Tony Blair and Home Secretary Jack
Straw visited Newham to see its anticrime surveillance in action as
they promoted a new government initative aimed at reducing crime in
Britain over the next five years. The government has given Newham a
grant to expand and upgrade its CCTV face-recognition system, said
Tim Pidgeon, head of European business development for Visionics.
</P>
<P>
   Atick, the Visionics president, said: ``FaceIt attempts to
balance individual privacy rights with society's larger expectation
of public safety.'' And, he noted, face-recognition technology ``is
blind as a bat without a database behind it.'' Meaning: If you
aren't a known lawbreaker, the system will just discard your image.
</P>
<P>
   But critics aren't reassured, and they are calling for
regulation of high-tech surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is developing at light speed, but the law that
governs its use is not developed at all,'' said the ACLU's
Steinhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Among his fears, he said, is cameras recording everyone present
at a political rally _ and identifying them by matching their
captured images to, say, photos stored by departments of motor
vehicles. ``Once you create these databases you can expect they'll
be used for a whole host of other purposes,'' Steinhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, high-tech surveillance _ at least in the hands of
governmental agencies _ has found strong resistance in the United
States. A proposal by the police department in Oakland, Calif., to
install face-recognizing TV cameras in that city was withdrawn in
1997 after the ACLU and other critics protested. The city attorney,
too, held that the system would violate constitutional privacy
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Still, US society seems to be more tolerant of surveillance
technologies in the hands of the private sector than the government
_ the reverse of the situation in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In several major casinos in Las Vegas and elsewhere, for
example, the technology has been installed to identify known card
sharks and cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   Security personnel who watch casino play from an overhead ``eye
in the sky'' previously had to flip through a book of photos if
they thought they saw a cheater at work and wanted to identify him
or her. But Jeff Jonas, president of Systems Research &AMP; Development
in Las Vegas, said that the FaceIt face-recognition system can make
the process much faster and more accurate; however, he added, it
doesn't always work unless the person is in a certain position and
is illuminated with strong lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Face-recognition technology is just one branch of the science
called biometrics _ the identification of people by their unique
features. Among its tools are those that measure hands, laser
devices that scan the eye's iris, and devices that analyze voice
patterns, scan the ear, and even record patterns of heat from a
person's body.
</P>
<P>
   The FaceIt system grew out of mathematical research that Atick
and others conducted at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study.
The trick was to write programs that could read the landmarks or
``nodal points'' on a face. A major challenge, he said, was to
adapt the software _ which originally could be run only by $25,000
computers _ to personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Atick founded Visionics and headed development of
its FaceIt system, which was launched in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A rival faceprint system developed at MIT's Media Lab is
licensed to Viisage Technology in Littleton, Mass. Its program
measures 128 different points on the face, according to Viisage
president and chief executive officer Thomas Colatosti.
</P>
<P>
   The Viisage system is being used at Foxwoods Casino in
Connecticut and in the state Department of Transitional Assistance
to make certain people don't file under multiple names for welfare
benefits, Colatosti said. The company also produces Massachusetts'
drivers licenses with a photo ID, and is working on a pilot project
involving ATM machines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most sweeping law-enforcement application of face
recognition, the Visionics system is being used with a database in
Florida that shares criminal and terrorist information with
Interpol, the organization that coordinates international police
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fantastic concept,'' Atick said. He said an officer
taking video photos live at a crime scene, for example, can send
the images instantaneously to the Florida database that contains
millions of photo records.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Norton, executive director of the International
Biometric Industry Association in Washington, said his group is
well aware that the new technology can both invade the privacy of
and protect people at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sensitive that people are going to say, `What's the
government really doing with this technology?' '' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry, he said, is prepared ``to tolerate intelligent
regulation on this topic.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mention the Internet company CMGI Inc., and people think first
of its sky-high stock price, or perhaps a string of glittering
acquisitions, such as the popular AltaVista Internet search
service. But for CMGI chief David Wetherell, the heart of the
business is Engage Technologies, Inc., a five-year-old firm that
has quietly collected a treasury of detailed information about
millions of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think someday this will be the most valuable database in the
world,'' Wetherell said at CMGI's annual meeting last year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schaut, the man Wetherell chose to run Engage, puts it a
little differently: ``We're that secret sauce that allows CMGI to
do its thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Its thing'' is an effort to turn CMGI's huge Internet
investments into steady profits.
</P>
<P>
   Engage is vital to the plan. It exists to capture data on the
millions of visitors to CMGI's own sites, as well as to many other
Web locations. Using custom software, Engage figures out Web
surfers' tastes and interests. That information lets Engage target
them with advertising that's far more likely to attract eyeballs _
and dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most impressive thing about the Engage database is
what's not in it: personal information about Internet users. Engage
thinks it's found a way to reliably deliver personalized
information to Web surfers without knowing who they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no name and address data,'' Schaut says. ``There's no
e-mail address . . . no user-identifiable data.''
</P>
<P>
   This is made possible by the use of cookies _ little bits of
coded information that can be loaded onto a Web surfer's computer.
When you visit a particular Web site, such as Yahoo, the site's
computer can put a cookie onto your computer.
</P>
<P>
   And you can create a customized version of the Yahoo site, with
only those features you want to see. Whenever you return, the Yahoo
computer will read the cookie on your computer to recall the
features you asked for.
</P>
<P>
   All of this can be done without collecting any personal
information from the user. Cookies were invented to allow Web sites
to deliver personalized services without having to know anything
about the person.
</P>
<P>
   But cookies are used in a more controversial way by Emerge's
biggest rival, New York-based DoubleClick Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1996, DoubleClick also built its business plan around
anonymous tracking of Internet users. But late last year, it spent
$1.7 billion in stock to acquire Abacus Direct, which builds
databases of millions of names and addresses. The merged companies
have launched a program called Abacus Alliance, which will collect
names and addresses from Internet surfers. This data can be used to
target them for both online and postal advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Abacus Alliance has aroused a furor among groups concerned about
consumer privacy, though. A California woman has sued DoubleClick,
alleging it misappropriated personal information. The Federal Trade
Commission and Michigan's attorney general have launched
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Engage figures to avoid this sort of controversy _ and attract
customers who don't want to be accused of invading their customers'
privacy _ by refusing to add personal information to its database.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons it's so valuable is because it is
anonymous,'' says David Andonian, president of corporate
development at CMGI Inc., based in Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Engage has been toddling along quietly since 1995. That was when
Wetherell made the coup that launched him in the Internet business
_ the sale of an early Web browsing program to America Online for
$70 million. Much of that money went to establish CMGI's hugely
successful venture capital fund. But another chunk was used to
found Engage. The goal was to create a firm that would precisely
target Internet advertising to the most likely prospects, and to
measure the success of those ads.
</P>
<P>
   Only in July of 1999 did Engage begin selling its Engage
Knowledge profiling service. By then, the company had created a
network of popular Web sites where visitors receive cookies. Once
Engage attaches one of its cookies to someone's Web browser, the
company can track that person's travels to any other site in the
Engage network.
</P>
<P>
   The system tracks ``recency, frequency, and duration,'' says
Schaut. It determines how often a person visits, which pages on the
site he visits and how long he stays on those pages. A visitor to a
news site might spend most of his time reading news about the stock
market. This information is run through a sophisticated program
that assigns a numerical score to the user's interest in stocks,
and links it to the user's Engage Knowledge cookie. At least 35
million Internet surfers have been tracked by Engage, and each of
them has a profile that measures interest in 800 different
categories. ``We're selling a score,'' says Andonian, a set of
numbers that estimates your likely interests and tastes.
</P>
<P>
   This score is used to send targeted ads to the Web surfer. Visit
any Engage-linked Web site, and it'll use your cookie to look up an
anonymous but detailed personal profile. This profile determines
which ads you'll see.
</P>
<P>
   Show a customer an ad for a product that truly interests him and
it's much more likely he'll click on the ad for more information.
The number of these ``clickthroughs'' determines the price
advertisers are willing to pay Web sites, and anything that boosts
it is good news for both the site owner and the advertiser. Our
investor, for instance, may ignore most Web ads, but might start
clicking merrily away if he gets a steady stream of ads from
financial services firms.
</P>
<P>
   And this won't happen just when he's visiting a financial site.
Engage will display relevant ads, even when a Web user visits an
irrelevant Web site. For instance, a computer gaming Web site might
not seem the logical place for a financial-services ad. But Engage
might send just such an ad to our stock market watcher. Any Web
site that teams up with Engage will display ads based on visitor
profiles, no matter the purpose of the site itself.
</P>
<P>
   To make this part of the strategy work, Engage has built up a
network of Web sites that are visited by about 54 percent of
everybody on the Internet. These sites not only display ads sold
through Engage; they also provide more data that further enhances
the accuracy of the Engage Knowledge profiles. Every page you visit
on an Engage site provides the company with a little more
information about your tastes and interests.
</P>
<P>
   Engage recently paid $2.4 billion in stock to acquire two ad
network companies from its parent firm, CMGI. AdSmart and Flycast
sell advertising space on over 2,300 sites, ranging from big-name
sites such as Ameritrade and US News and World Report, to
lesser-known sites that serve small market niches. ``We like very
focused interest sites,'' Schaut says. ``That's good data.''
</P>
<P>
   Create Engage profiles of regular visitors to, say, a science
fiction site, and you'll likely have tapped into a group that'll be
interested in ads for the latest science fiction movies and TV
shows. But when our investment buff visits this site, he may still
get some financial services ads thrown in, because he brought his
Engage Knowledge profile with him.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Engage system seeks to develop a sort of virtuous
cycle. The more sites in the network, the more profiling data is
collected. The more data collected, the more accurate the profiles.
The more accurate the profiles, the more products purchased by
people viewing the ads, the more advertisers come knocking on
Engage's door, and the more sites want to join the network.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only about 500 customers have signed up for the Engage
service. But one of the early adopters, Philip Pennington,
president and chief executive of Image Networks Inc. in San
Antonio, Texas, is already in love. Image Networks sells ad space
on 13,000 sites and recently began using Engage's profiling data to
decide which sites should get which ads. ``We were able to see a 25
percent increase in the clickthrough rate in just a week,''
Pennington said.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the sort of response Schaut is counting on. He
sees Engage as a boon to thousands of small sites that can't sell
ad space in the traditional way because they attract relatively
small audiences. A leader like Yahoo can sell all the ad space it
wants. However, Schaut estimates that about 80 percent of ad space
on the Web goes unsold, because it's on less-popular sites.
</P>
<P>
   But because Engage aims its ads at the individual, not the Web
site, even the smallest sites can become viable advertising venues.
The Engage profiling system, says Schaut, ``gets the dollars
flowing where the eyeballs are going.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the dollars are barely trickling to Engage so far _ $8.3
million in sales for the quarter ended last December _ Engage has
attained a hefty share price, closing last Friday at $124 a share
on the Nasdaq exchange. Schaut and Wetherell, and quite a few
investors, are betting that the growth of the Internet will
eventually bring Engage and CMGI a torrent of profit.

   Anecdotal data plays a large role in the reports issued by
Forrester Research. Much of the firm's research is based upon
interviews with vendors, distributors, and consumers, in an effort
to understand their buying patterns or marketing plans. The results
are written up in brief, breezy reports with relatively few hard
numbers to slow the reader down. (Forrester executives declined to
be interviewed for this story. The company is in a federally
mandated ``quiet period'' because of a pending stock offering.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Harvard Business Review-Lite,'' says Jeffrey
Rayport, an associate professor at the Harvard Business School, and
a consultant with Monitor Group of Boston. ``There are those who
say that's totally unscientific.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rayport is just as skeptical of the number crunchers like
Yankee Group and IDC.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are others who'd say the numbers you get . . . are
totally suspect, so how can you trust those?'' In Rayport's view,
Forrester's word-of-mouth approach is at least as likely to produce
reliable results.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the technology analysts try to gaze far into the future.
Julio Gomez of Gomez Advisors Inc. in Lincoln prefers to sell
customers accurate information about the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give them tools to help them do their jobs today,'' he
says, ``not tell them what things are going to look like in five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez's 40 researchers analyze the performance of a host of
Internet retailing companies, using a set of standardized criteria
_ how easy is it to use the site, for instance, and how its prices
compare with those of other sites. The resulting data is used to
rate the quality of these retail Web sites, and these ratings are
constantly reviewed and updated.
</P>
<P>
   The final ratings are available to the public at the Gomez Web
site. But Gomez also uses the data to produce short-term analyses
of trends in various Internet retail markets, like online computer
retailing or bookselling. It's these reports that Gomez sells for a
fee to corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our value is more for tactical decisions than for long-term
strategic decisions,'' Gomez says.
</P>
<P>
   That might endear him to William Sherden, a renowned skeptic of
efforts to predict the long-term future. In his 1997 book ``The
Fortune Sellers,'' Sherden mocks human efforts to make accurate
predictions in a wide range of areas, from weather to the stock
market. In his view, it's possible to make fairly reliable
predictions about an industry's performance looking ahead a few
months, usually by assuming present trends will continue. But go
further out _ a year or more _ and it all becomes guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   Sherden isn't questioning the analysts' ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the people who are producing these forecasts
actually believe they're doing something useful and valuable and
reliable,'' he says. He just thinks they're kidding themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Sherden says, companies ``are not buying it for
market predictions; they're buying it for technology trends.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an attitude that the technology forecasters cheerfully
embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that you can't possibly predict very accurately or
with much detail . . . what that market opportunity or that new
arena is going to look like,'' says Yankee Group's Ayvazian. ``It's
not the forecast that's valuable; it's the strategy that's
valuable.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Religion and our schools, again
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Cincinnati suburb of Blue Ash, the school board last week
overturned a two-year experiment that could have far-reaching
effects on schools everywhere. The board, faced with a lawsuit from
the American Civil Liberties Union, rescinded its two-year-old
policy of declaring their schools closed on two Jewish holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Through a smokescreen of absentee rate determination, the issue
decided was more about the separation of church and state; a
controversy that is nowhere near to closure and becoming more
complex with each day.
</P>
<P>
   What the suburban Ohio school board was doing _ as do so many
other school boards nationwide _ was closing the schools based on a
subterfuge. Calling them ``teacher work days'' or some derivative
thereof, the schools conveniently close on days of religious
holidays: Good Friday, Yom Kippur, etc.
</P>
<P>
   As others seek to impose prayer back into the public schools,
this decision would seem to widen the fracture. The area director
of the American Jewish Committee, in support of the decision,
asserted that schools should set their calendars for
administrative, not religious, reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Ohio school district, it appears, are many of Moslem,
Hindu and others non Judeo-Christian faiths. Shall ``teacher work
days'' be created for them as well? It gets a little clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming number of our school students are Christian;
the remainder are but small segments in the pie chart of religion
representation. Thus, it would appear to be academically
impractical to close schools for the holy days of those minorities.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea of how far the ACLU would have gone with its suit
had not the school board backed down but the challenge of Christmas
could have been on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the nation's constitutional foundation calling for a
separation of church and state, it doesn't live up to that. God can
be found on the dollar bill, in the Pledge of Allegiance and in
Christmas Day being declared a national holiday. Religious
movements want God back in the schools, as well.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mixed bag as to what the Ohio matter represents. The
original claim was that opening a school on a religious holy day
caused high absentee rates. In the school district that serves Blue
Ash, there was an average of 15 percent absenteeism on Jewish holy
days against a daily norm of 4 percent. That's what led to school
closing policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there were other minorities in the district that
felt excluded, they not getting their religious holidays off.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a school-age kid _ 1939-1951 _ schools did not close
either for Good Friday, Yom Kippur and varying religious holidays
other than Christmas week. If you were a practicing Catholic, you
simply took Good Friday off _ and the school understood. If you
were Jewish, you were absent on Jewish holy days and endured the
friendly chiding of Christian classmates who pronounced us lucky:
``Hey, you get your holidays off and Christmas, too. No fair!''
</P>
<P>
   Right! It wasn't fair but it was fun to go one-up on them.
</P>
<P>
   Today's environment is far more complicated. Closing the schools
on religious days, under any name other than religion, is
transparent. As minority religions continue to grow in the U.S.,
the need arises for inclusion as opposed to exclusion. To close the
schools for Jewish dates but not Moslem, or such, is wrong. Keep
them open and let the students (and their parents) determine the
breadth of their religious involvement.
</P>
<P>
   If the day is important to those of a particular faith, deal
with it the way it used to be: Take the day off but don't shut down
the entire school.
</P>
<P>
   This still doesn't explain Christmas Day, the dollar bill or the
Pledge of Allegiance but, as the unknown philosopher once warned
us: ``This is not a simple life, my friend, and there are no simple
answers.''

NECCO'S NUTTY WAR OF WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am sitting here with a Clark bar to my left and a Lewis &AMP;
Clark Bar to my right, conducting a taste test to determine what
has caused the otherwise nice people of the New England
Confectionery Company to act like unmitigated twits.
</P>
<P>
   And the answer may be in the chocolate. I take a bite of the
Clark bar _ brittle to the point of being unnatural, a relic of
times gone by. The butter crunch clings to my teeth.
</P>
<P>
   I take a bite of the Lewis &AMP; Clark Bar and immediately feel
myself ascending on the wings of angels, floating to a place so
creamy, chocolaty smooth that no mortal man has ever been there. I
am mesmerized by this cocoa concoction, struggling to keep my
clothes on in the presence of this wonderful bar.
</P>
<P>
   Ahem, some background: That's the New England Confectionery
Company, as in Necco, the nation's oldest candy manufacturer, which
still makes its namesake Necco wafers in its Cambridge, Mass.
plant. Last year, Necco bought the bankrupt Clark company, and with
it a candy bar that most chocolate aficionados believed had long
ago met with an unnoticed death.
</P>
<P>
   Time has not been kind to the Clark bar. The garish red wrapper
with the midnight blue lettering says stale, not fresh. The
Butterfinger has stolen its following. The Clark's coveted space
along the candy aisle has been squeezed out by what seems like nine
different variations of the M&AMP;M and Milky Way offerings, not to
mention Hershey bars so wide-ranging that one is even called the
Whatchamacallit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, of the dozen markets I shopped Monday, not one carried
the Clark bar, including the convenience store adjacent to the
Necco manufacturing plant in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes Debbie Kruger of North Dakota to make matters
even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Kruger makes chocolate in the pharmacy on Main Street in Mandan
that she owns with her husband, Rusty _ a storefront complete with
an old-fashioned soda fountain and a collection of Coca-Cola
antiques.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, she began producing small batches of the
Lewis &AMP; Clark Bar, named for the adventurers who camped for the
winter of 1804-05 in her hometown, where there's now a Lewis &AMP;
Clark Bridge, a Lewis &AMP; Clark Street, and a Lewis &AMP; Clark School.
</P>
<P>
   Necco, flailing away without much notice in the much-heralded
chocolate wars, seemed to find an enemy it could defeat. So it went
after Kruger and her tiny Lindy Sue's Candies, firing off a letter
that threatened her with copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Necco executives and the lawyers who pull their
strings actually believe that the names of Meriwether Lewis and
William Clark, two of this nation's foremost explorers, fall within
the trademark of a candy bar that chocolate maker David Clark named
after himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very scared,'' Kruger says. ``I didn't want to go to
court and fight them because I didn't think I could win. They have
full-time lawyers. I couldn't afford a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for a moment, that the chocolate bars are nothing
alike. The Clark, in its most flattering portrayal, is butter
crunch, the Lewis &AMP; Clark a pure milk chocolate bar. The Clark is
covered by the aforementioned wrapper, the Lewis &AMP; Clark encased in
gold foil with a wrapper that depicts the explorers, two buffaloes,
and the Indian guide Sacagawea.
</P>
<P>
   So they talked on the telephone last week _ Kruger, Necco
president Domenic Antonellis, and North Dakota Senator Byron
Dorgan. Initially, Antonellis sounded apologetic, but when he
learned that Kruger was selling her bar all along the Lewis &AMP; Clark
trail, not just in North Dakota, he said he'd have to talk to his
lawyers again. The issue remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a big company muscling a small company,'' Dorgan
laments from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The entire episode is an embarrassing shame. Necco has always
been a proud, benevolent company, filled with characters like
Walter Marshall, who plans to retire soon from writing Valentine's
sayings on those candy hearts. But now the lawyers appear in firm
control, which is never good. Common sense is out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Necco fears that Kruger is plotting to sell the Lewis &AMP; Clark
name to Mars or Hershey _ a scenario that isn't so much unlikely as
absurd. Could it be they're really afraid that Kruger just makes a
better candy bar?

   Don't phone your local newspaper editor for help. Hostility
toward those terminal prepositions still runs strong among people
who not only aced sixth-grade grammar but went on to practice it
professionally. If you want to win the jackpot, consult your
sensible next-door neighbor, who hasn't thought about prepositions
since high school.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there's nothing wrong with a preposition at the end of
a sentence. What's more, those little last words are often not
prepositions at all, when you look closely. Yet editors tie
themselves in knots (and give writers fits) trying to get rid of
final prepositions.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary citizens apparently know better. Readers write to
complain about misuse of tenses, neglect of the subjunctive,
overuse of slang, and a thousand other ills the media are heir to,
but nobody's troubled, apparently, by late-breaking prepositions.
In fact, several correspondents have repeated the famous tale of
Winston Churchill's retort to someone's attempt to clean up a
sentence he had ended with a preposition: ``This is the kind of
bloody nonsense (or `arrant pedantry') up with which I will not
put.'' Others have sent variations on the sentence that aims for
the biggest pileup of terminal prepositions: ``What did you bring
that book that I don't want to be read to from up for?'' But the
mail has brought not a single protest about the final preposition.
</P>
<P>
   How did the people get so far ahead of the pros on this issue?
It's a mystery. Usage writers throughout the century have been
making fun of the fake ``rule'' about prepositions: In the 1926
edition of Modern English Usage, H. W. Fowler calls it a
``cherished superstition,'' and most usage guides since _
Bernstein's ``The Careful Writer'' (1965), Harper's usage
dictionary (1985), Oxford's Modern English Usage (1998) _ note that
constructions like ``Which shelf do the plates go on?'' and ``rules
to live by'' are good and idiomatic English.
</P>
<P>
   And Churchill's twist on put up with points to a larger issue:
Not all these little words are true prepositions. Many English
verbs, like those in its sister language, German, come in two
parts: When you put up string beans, run off with your sister's
boyfriend, drop in on a neighbor, buckle up or buckle down, you're
not using prepositions. Those are two-word verbs _ phrasal verbs,
they're sometimes called, or lexemes, in linguist lingo. But
they're units of meaning, not verbs with prepositions tacked on.
</P>
<P>
   The perpetrator of our prepositional muddle seems to be John
Dryden, the 17th-century English man of letters, who wrote in Latin
as well as English. Since prepositions can't come at the end of
Latin sentences, he probably reasoned, they shouldn't appear there
in English either. (Other scholars told us not to split
infinitives, on the same shaky grounds.) But unless you hope to
write prose like Dryden's _ and you probably don't _ there's no
reason to obey his syntactical strictures.
</P>
<P>
   Finish it off
</P>
<P>
   Bill Earls of Middletown, Conn., wrote last month to say he was
fed up with frisson and fin de siecle. Foreign words, to his ear,
are pretentious, meant mostly ``to establish the writer as a member
of an exclusive fraternity,'' and these two are among his least
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know whether frisson _ French for a shiver of excitement
or fear _ is headed for US citizenship. And fin de siecle still
means the end of the 19th century; it seems likely to fade as we
try to decide how to describe the end of the 20th. But I realized I
had probably added to Earls's distress with last week's column,
where I gave the number of Don Giovanni's conquests in Italian _
mille e tre _ instead of saying 1,003. Also, as Giovanni's many
fans know, that was just the tally in Spain; the Don had previously
done very well with the ladies of Italy, France, Germany, and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Pretentious and inaccurate, Earls is probably muttering. Still,
I hope he has some empathy for today's scribblers. Dryden's readers
would have understood every classical allusion and Latin catch
phrase; now, when so many smart and literate people have never
conjugated a Latin verb, a writer takes a risk even in offering a
simple mea culpa.

STRANDED IN MAINE WITHOUT A CAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHERMAN STATION, Maine _ Three years ago, her '84 Chevy gave its
final shudder and Ruby Perkins started to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists have come to know her _ a blond-haired figure walking
the mile-and-a-half down Route 11 past barns and houses and scrubby
pine to the store, where she buys a carton of milk or a loaf of
bread, turns, and walks the mile-and-a-half home. Sometimes, she
bounces a grocery cart full of food the whole way along the road
shoulder. She has stopped being self-conscious about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk all the time,'' said Perkins, 33, a mother of two.
``People just look, and I say, `Hey, you do what you gotta do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, the walking has taken on new proportions. Unable
to find a ride to her job training in Patten, 9 miles away, Perkins
sets out on foot every morning at 7:30, an hour-and-a-half before
she's due there, hoping someone will stop to pick her up. Most
often, someone does, which makes her think guiltily of her father,
who once said he would chop her thumbs off rather than see her
hitchhike.
</P>
<P>
   But she needs to get from one place to another. In rural Maine,
where public transportation is a concept as distant as the parking
meter, Perkins's dilemma is repeated daily by poor women who find
themselves stranded, unable to scrape up enough money to buy or
maintain cars. Pressed by welfare deadlines to seek employment
outside their homes, they are relying on bicycles, or squandering
their money on taxicabs, or walking for miles in the dead of
winter, or missing their appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how much I believe if we're talking about
employment we're really talking about transportation,'' said Jane
Gilbert, who, as human resources director for the Maine Department
of Transportation, has struggled to accommodate stranded women.
``When you're living in Macwahoc, Maine, unless you've got your own
car, you are sucking air. You don't have options.''
</P>
<P>
   North of Bangor, where distances between people begin to double
and triple, human life shapes itself around vehicles, and around
the lack of them. A generation ago, the stranded female was a
natural part of the social landscape; when Barbara Van Burgal moved
from Michigan to Van Buren, a small town on the Canadian border,
she was astonished to discover that while men were reliant on cars
and trucks, many of her female neighbors didn't even have a
driver's license _ and didn't want one. Lisa Daggett grew up in
Sherman, and remembers snow banks that climbed to the roofs of
houses, trapping women and children inside for days or weeks at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an assumed way of life then,'' said Daggett, who
works at the Center for Women, Work and Community in Lewiston.
``Now I get a panic attack just thinking of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Maine, as in the rest of the country, new deadlines for
getting women off welfare have made the rural isolation a public
issue. In a 1997 survey of 112 Mainers who received Temporary Aid
for Needy Families, or TANF, 32 percent of respondents said they
could not work at a paid job because they could not get there, and
28 percent said they had gone without transportation for at least a
month over the past three years, according to the Maine Center for
Economic Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The same struggles are playing out in rural areas all over the
United States. After studying the problem, University of Iowa urban
planner Alan Peters concluded that money spent on job training for
poor people would be better spent buying them cars. Per capita
spending on transportation can run as low as $1.50 in rural areas
and as high as $300 in big cities, said Chris Bogren,
communications director at the Community Transport Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to see in a city why you need to do this. There's
congestion, there's pollution. It's harder to see isolation,'' said
Bogren. ``I remember riding a bus in rural Missouri and sitting
next to a woman who said, `I left my house for the first time in
seven years when this bus started running.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar story to Nicole Martin, 21, who lives in a
70-foot trailer on Route 116, about 4 miles from the tiny downtown
of Medway, Maine. Even if she could afford a car _ a prospect so
outlandish to Martin that, thinking about it, she just laughs _ she
could not drive it because she does not have a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   So with snowbanks building up against the window sills, the
trailer's two rooms became her world: Friends occasionally drive
her 14 miles to the grocery store in Millinocket, but sometimes she
doesn't leave for weeks at a time, making her feel so ``ballistic''
that she blows off steam by playing Meat Loaf albums at full blast.
On her 21st birthday, she couldn't get a ride into town and
celebrated her first legal drink at the trailer's padded bar.
</P>
<P>
   But it was no mistake, coming here, she said. Some of the best
moments of her childhood were spent sitting on a hill with her
sister, as quiet as possible, waiting for moose to gather at a salt
pit. When she got pregnant with Garrett, who is now 18 months old,
she wanted to stay near her boyfriend and family. The $150 rent she
pays for her half of the trailer is as much as she can afford, and
transportation difficulties are just the price she has to pay.
</P>
<P>
   When she found out that a state welfare-to-work program required
her to attend job training in Millinocket every day, the news came
as a shock. She got a few rides from her roommate's sister-in-law,
Missy, until Missy's car broke down. Then she got a volunteer
driver, until the volunteer threw up her hands at driving 30 miles
out of her way every day. Finally, Martin acknowledged that she was
in a classic rural bind: Even after job training, the low-wage job
she could find in the countryside wouldn't pay for a car. Without a
car, she wouldn't be able to show up for that low-wage job. She's
packing up her baby and moving to Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   But she's already wondering when she can come back. ``Sometimes,
people who come from a country area want to stay in a country
area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Women like Martin have been left behind as Maine reduced its
welfare rolls by 50 percent over the past eight years, and the
government is slowly assembling ``a patchwork quilt'' of
transportation options for isolated families, said Van Burgal, of
the state's Office of Family Independence, which provides support
services for families trying to get off state assistance. Van
Burgal's office will fund car repairs, reimburse for mileage, and
assist with insurance payments for families receiving TANF. And
Good Wheels, a new state program administered by Goodwill
Industries, has just begun to provide TANF recipients with
low-interest car loans and financial advice. Project director Ellen
Brangwynne said she hopes to supply poor families with 300 cars
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But state Senator Sharon Treat, a Gardiner Democrat who
sponsored a bill last year that would have created a committee to
study transportation and work patterns, said lawmakers are a long
way from seeing transportation as a service the state must provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough one to get other legislators to see as
important,'' said Treat. ``People thought, it's not food, it's not
medicine, it's not shelter. . . . There's a real fear of giving
something away for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Maine centers for Women, Work and Community, counselors
have begun to look at cars as the gateway to women's independence.
Last year, after their son died, a couple donated his car to the
organization, and administrators began to explore who among their
clients needed the car most.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, they had 20 applications from women in desperate
circumstances. In essays, the women explained how transportation
had come to dominate their lives: One woman in Waterville
hitchhiked with her elderly mother to chemotherapy sessions.
Another woman did all her shopping on a mountain bike. One woman in
Skowhegan was so reliant on her husband for transportation that she
couldn't begin to think of getting away from his beatings, said a
resource administrator, Wendy Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Poulin, 39, of Lisbon, a full-time college student and
single mother of two disabled children, ended up getting the car.
For four months after her 1985 Pontiac broke down, Poulin had to
drop out of classes and devote herself full time to the doctors'
appointments, grocery runs, and tasks that took half a day without
a car.
</P>
<P>
   The worst moments were so bad that she couldn't even think about
them until long after they were over. Late one night in November,
her heat went off, and she watched the needle on the thermostat
slide to 50, and then slide below it. She kept feeling her
children's faces for cold, and when their noses felt like they had
been playing outside, she called for help.
</P>
<P>
   She vows she won't ever be in that position again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pride comes into it,'' Poulin said. ``If I was this dependent
on someone before, then I damn sure don't want to be dependent
again. Then they have a huge piece of you, and when that's gone,
what are you left with?''

MCCAIN'S GAMBIT: WOO CONSERVATIVES, DON'T DISMAY MODERATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ This has nothing to do with who is
``negative'' and who is ``positive.'' Instead, it has everything to
do with who is motivated.
</P>
<P>
   What George W. Bush was able to show in South Carolina is that
John McCain's candidacy is a reason for conservative Republicans to
flock to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Awakened by that stunning success, McCain is trying to stay
viable by performing a most difficult political feat _ striking out
in two directions at once without seeming to be flailing wildly or
contradicting himself.
</P>
<P>
   He is reminding voters here, as he decidedly did not in Dixie,
that his own conservative credential are impeccable, from opposing
abortion rights to battling gun control. But he is also asserting
the validity of his reformer's credentials and ridiculing Bush's.
What Tuesday's voting will decide is whether he is losing a
moderate voter for every conservative he convinces.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, by contrast, has morphed again since his
Saturday victory. From the proud conservative of South Carolina, he
is once again the front-runner here, performing more of a victory
lap than a campaign, proclaiming the end of ``Clinton-Gore'' more
than the impending demise of McCain, happily in the embrace of
almost the entire Republican establishment here, beginning with
Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
   The one similarity to South Carolina, and it could be all Bush
needs, is that he is again warning that ``they'' are trying to take
over the Republican primary. In South Carolina it was a vague
threat about Democrats; here, the Republicans from Bush on down
have a visible foil in Democratic attorney Geoffrey Feiger (``Dr.
Kevorkian's lawyer,'' as Bush refers to him), whom Engler crushed
last year but who is using radio ads to promote McCain votes.
</P>
<P>
   Feiger makes most Democrats cringe and all Republicans see red.
The Bush approach lacks the intensity of South Carolina, which
offered three weeks for the message to take hold _ in contrast to
Michigan's three news cycles _ but it resonates nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   This part of Michigan, the west, is Bush country _ the most
conservative, the most intensely anti-abortion rights, the most
pro-Engler. From Kalamazoo and Battle Creek to the south on up
through here to Traverse City, a huge, motivated conservative vote
would be more than enough to overcome less ideological McCain
voting in the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   And it is no accident that in addition to the proven attack ads
from South Carolina, the Bush campaign is using surrogates _ radio,
e-mail, and flyers _ to sell aggressively the notion that took hold
among right wingers down South: McCain is not a reliable
right-to-lifer, his 17-year record on that score notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has not shied away from Bush country. His state
operation is based here, he has had the support of the local paper,
and he showed the flag at the airport and at a town meeting up in
Traverse City.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether his message in Michigan will help or
complicate his uphill (despite the dead-heat polls) campaign. On
the plus side, the big issue is the same big issue that dominated
South Carolina _ McCain. His campaigning has dominated the local
news cycles thus far; Bush has risked appearing like the guy who
lost New Hampshire, disdainful of his opponent and selling
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how voters will react to the McCain message. He
has abandoned concern about who is and who isn't the negative
campaigner. Instead he has gone after two major elements of the
post-New Hampshire Bush persona _ the reformer and the
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has attacked the idea that Bush's record supports his
reformer's pose, above all on campaign donations. Noting that in
all his time in Texas, where money flows without restriction, Bush
has never made or supported a single reform, McCain has received
considerable local coverage with his assertion that only tooth
fairy-believers accept Bush's credentials.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been noticed for his adoption of an old Steve Forbes
line of attack: That government expenditures in Texas have soared
under Bush's leadership far more rapidly than they have in Bill
Clinton's Washington. In neither case, are the merits (McCain is
correct) important; the only thing that counts is that his message
has been covered in a compressed campaign where anything that's
``new'' helps get attention.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has also sold himself aggressively here as the
Republican of the Right he has usually been in Congress _ against
abortion rights, gun control, and a higher minimum wage; and for
less violent smut on television. He's coming through clear, but it
remains to be seen if the guy who now travels with Gary Bauer in
tow can continue to attract the Democrats and independents who
still form his base of support.
</P>
<P>
   McCain can never win without attracting more than the 25 percent
he got in South Carolina from Republicans and conservatives; but if
he raises those numbers here by reducing his appeal to
non-Republicans, the effort will flop.
</P>
<P>
   He's still the reformer, but his new line is: ``I'm a proud,
conservative, pro-life, conservative Republican.''

WRENCHING TALE FOISTS STARDOM ON DAVE EGGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dave Eggers never had it in his head to become a
hot-new-thing literary-star, and now that he is one, he shows no
interest in taking to the role. He seems perpetually lackadaisical,
except when he's wryly bemused. He dresses shabbily, his Brooklyn
apartment is beyond unkempt, he wears a baseball cap to mash down
his Eraserhead hair (``I didn't have time to take a shower today,''
he says. ``Sorry.''), and he claims not even to own a copy of the
book that has made him suddenly famous.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published by Simon &AMP; Schuster, is called ``A
Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,'' which sort of sums up
the sensibility involved here _ the fey irony that a) acknowledges
its pretentiousness, b) disarms criticism of its pretentiousness,
yet c) raises the possibility that, wait, maybe he's serious, maybe
the book really is all those things.
</P>
<P>
   Its subject-matter is no less disorienting than its title.
Almost a decade ago, when Eggers was 21, both his parents died of
cancer, within five weeks of each other, leaving him to look after
his 8-year-old brother, Toph. The book is about how they dealt with
it and how they pushed ahead with a life of joy, heartbreak, love,
bitterness, freedom, frustration _ all the usual stuff of life _ in
the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   One hesitates before such a book. It could be maudlin. Since
much of it is ironic and self-indulgent and funny, it could be a
bit sicko. Eggers skates right up to the edge of these cliffs _
sometimes sails right over the top, plunges into the abyss _ but,
mostly, amazingly, it works.
</P>
<P>
   Michiko Kakutani, a New York Times book critic who generally has
little patience for playful post-modernism, hailed the book as ``a
virtuosic piece of writing, a big, daring, manic-depressive stew of
a book that noisily announces the debut of a talented _ yes,
staggeringly talented _ new writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Out for just a few weeks, the book is already in its fifth
edition, with 100,000 copies in print. Last week, 400 fans crammed
into a Manhattan Barnes &AMP; Noble for an Eggers reading, more than
the store had ever seen for a reading, while 100 more were turned
away for lack of space.
</P>
<P>
   Even McSweeney's, the year-old literary quarterly that Eggers
edits out of his home _ ``which,'' he admits, ``couldn't be
weirder'' _ is selling out soon after hitting newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   He seems genuinely bewildered by the opened floodgates. ``I have
no idea what's going on,'' he says, flatly. ``I'm the last guy to
ask. I've never been one to write things that appeal to a lot of
people. If I have 10 to 12 people paying attention, then I'm happy
as a clam.'' He pauses. ``We just sold publishing rights to
Finland. There's no way of processing such things. The only thing
you can do is just keep talking with your high-school friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York tabloids report that he's turned down offers of $2
million for film-rights from New Line and Miramax. ``I don't know
where these things come from,'' he deadpans. ``I haven't heard
about anything like that.'' Still, he concedes, he has no desire to
see his most wrenching life stories beamed up on the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of these people who say, `I'll try anything, to
see what will happen,' '' he says, slowly. ``I never thought that a
movie would be such a hot idea. But, then I started thinking, `Wow,
if they're throwing around that kind of money, that would make all
the McSweeney's dreams come true.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Already, his foreign-rights sales have allowed him to start
paying his writers for the first time, and to start a McSweeney's
book-publishing house. ``We want to publish a lot of books, with
extravagant production,'' he says. ``We'll pay the writers, give
them 100 percent of the profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he's warming to the idea of a movie, after all. ``If
it were done in a very strange way,'' he muses, ``if somebody took
it to the limits, made it a corollary work of art instead of a
straight adaptation, just took the book as a starting-off point,
yeah, I could get into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then his brow furrows a bit again. ``But the movie thing,'' he
mumbles. ``It might be so painful.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an author, after all, who has not even read his book
since finishing it. ``And I won't,'' he insists. ``There are five
or six parts of the book _ the rough ones to write, the raw, more
emotional parts _ I don't know what's on those pages.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a particularly affecting chapter in which Eggers
recounts finding, quite by accident, his mother's cremated remains.
``The part about the cremains,'' he says, using funeral-parlor
parlance, ``I wrote that once and that's it. I just barely got it
down once. I didn't look at it again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The book is full of literary high jinks. The preface begins,
``There is no overwhelming need to read the preface. . . If you
have already read the preface and wish you had not, we apologize.
We should have told you sooner.'' A 21-page acknowledgements
section acknowledges, spells out, analyzes, puffs up, and debunks
every narrative trick he's about to pull.
</P>
<P>
   This is old-hat stuff by now; it should be tedious. It shouldn't
work. It shouldn't be funny or moving, much less hilarious and
gripping. And yet it is. It's a gravity-defying circus act, this
book. Eggers somehow balances the elements by keeping everything
continuously off-balance. He creates _ and, more dazzling, sustains
_ a tension between the tears and the laughter, the grimness, and
the weirdness.
</P>
<P>
   Eggers is fully aware of the traps that he laid for himself and
managed to elude at every turn. ``It's all in the material and the
subject matter,'' he says. ``I wanted to keep playing with form,
but, as the story went along, it became harder. The events
overwhelm the gimmickry, they burst through, they wash all over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``events'' evolved into an obsession. For over a year, he
wrote the book nearly every night, from midnight to 4 a.m., after
his brother had gone to bed. ``I don't know why an idea so silly
came to me,'' he says of the whole concept of writing about dead
parents. ``But I couldn't shake it.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent he wrote it as a catharsis, it did the job. ``For
years, I couldn't see past it,'' he says. ``Now I can. I've never
tried to write fiction. Now I find I have all these ideas for short
stories and novels. I feel like I can do that now. I couldn't have,
before doing this.

<P>
   ``I'm working on'' _ he pauses _ ``a novel kind of thing. It
used to be I didn't think I was born with the right to do that.
When I was writing this book, I felt it really had to hurt. I had
this strange belief that if you're writing about anything that
isn't 19th-century steamships _ if you're writing about your own
heart _ you might as well put it in the first person and tell the
truth, or else it's sort of cowardly. I was being a little silly
then. It's incredibly liberating just to make things up, and not
have to type the word `I.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Eggers grew up in Lake Forest, Ill., the deceptively trim
Chicago suburb where ``Ordinary People,'' that nightmare vision of
suburbia, was filmed. He and his friends, many of whom are still
friends today, ``worshipped Monty Python,'' he recalls. ``We knew
every line by heart. We did talent-show acts that consisted of
Monty Python routines. I wrote a column in the school newspaper
that tried to make as little sense as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his early 20s, he fell for the short stories of Lorrie Moore.
``I thought she was the be-all and end-all,'' he says. ``It's that
combination of her subject matter _ the entire heartbreak of the
situations _ and how funny she is. I had a little bit of a crush on
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he discovered the surreal whimsy of Donald Barthelme and
John Barth. ``They opened me up to a different thing,'' he says.
``They completely kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite contemporary writer is George Saunders, author of
``CivilWarLand in Bad Decline,'' because ``anything can happen in
any sentence and he's in complete control _ a monkey might pop up
and he might start talking, but you never feel it's improbable, he
has such an assured voice. And his stories have such heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Put all these influences together, and you have as apt a
description as any of Eggers's own prose style: silly strangeness,
humor, heartbreak, heart.
</P>
<P>
   Eggers is more self-consciously literary, more deliberate, than
his insouciance might suggest. Before he wrote his book, he drew a
gigantic chart, outlining its entire structure. (He reproduces part
of it on page xxxiii of the acknowledgements, and notes that you
can order the full version for $5. ``You will not be
disappointed,'' he writes. ``Unless you are usually disappointed,
in which case this will be yet another disappointment.'')
</P>
<P>
   When writing, he used a word-processing program that let him see
how his prose would look in a book. ``I had to see it in the right
font,'' he says. ``I had to see how the paragraph breaks looked,
with the margins a certain way. I'm really reluctant to write for
something where I don't control the design.''
</P>
<P>
   He still lives with his brother, who is now 17, and whose
privacy Eggers avidly protects. There are two older siblings, a
brother and sister, but they took it for granted that Dave would
take custody. ``Toph and I had been inseparable since he was born,
we were completely attached,'' he says. ``None of us could imagine
its working any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   He hangs out with a few friends who make up a growing gang of
experimental writers in Brooklyn, many of whom he publishes in
McSweeney's. ``As long as we can play with the form of it and push
it _ and the next one we're pushing into the fourth dimension, and
that's all I can say right now'' _ he laughs _ ``as long as there
are experiments to do, we'll keep doing it. We just want to bring
odd, beautiful things into the world. It's just sort of fun to
do.''

A GOOD TIME WITH `CUCKOO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At first, Arthur Laurents's ``The Time of the
Cuckoo'' seems like an odd play to revive. You might start out
wondering why a play that had received what some consider its
perfect incarnation as the David Lean film ``Summertime'' is doing
back on the stage, but then you realize it works much better
without all the distractions of what Laurents calls the travelogue
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   At times, you think it is stuck in the 1950s _ it was written in
1952 _ and then you remember the Puritanism of both the left and
the right when it came to l'affaire Lewinsky and it seems very much
of the moment. With a panel of historians recently rating Bill
Clinton's moral authority below that of Richard Nixon, who
dispensed with the Constitution, any time can be a time of the
cuckoo. And the theater can at least remind some of us there are
worse things in the world than extramarital sex. Still, ``The Time
of the Cuckoo'' is not a great play. It needs a first-rate staging
to work and that's what it gets at the Lincoln Center production,
which opened this week.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is a joy to watch _ particularly Debra Monk, Tom
Aldredge, and Polly Holliday as three of the American tourists, and
Cigdem Onat and Olek Krupa as the guiltless, if not entirely
guileless, Venetians. With the help of James Noone's gorgeous
garden piazza, which subtly hints at the romance outside the
pensione's gates, director Nicholas Martin focuses the forcefulness
of Laurents's rebellion against conventional morality. At the same
time, Martin gives each of the characters breathing room from what
could've been a claustrophobic setting.
</P>
<P>
   Monk takes what, alas, has to be called the Katharine Hepburn
role, given her star turn in ``Summertime.'' (In his upcoming
autobiography, Laurents writes that Hepburn advised Shirley Booth,
who pioneered the part, not to play Leona Samish in the film and
then took the role herself.) It is not an easy part to pull off
because most of the dated dialogue is centered in Leona's
wisecracks. In fact, the overall persona recalls the Eve Ardens,
Rosalind Russells, and other 50-somethings or 40-somethings of the
'50s who were making their way in TV and films without male
accompaniment. All of which means that Monk's generally successful
attempt in making Samish's self-destructiveness convincing 50 years
later is all the more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Samish is looking for love in all the accepted tall, dark,
handsome, and rich forms. That Krupa has more schlump in his
swagger than Rossano Brazzi did makes him all the more believable
as Renato Di Rossi. It falls to him and Signora Floria (Onat), the
owner of the pensione, to loosen up the moralism and monogamy of
the Americans. Life is imperfect, as are life's circumstances, so
gather ye rosebuds, love the one you're with, and find the best
happiness you can while you can.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Williams argued along the same lines more poetically
in ``The Rose Tattoo,'' although Laurents is more unconventional in
taking love's and lust's possibilities outside the marital arena.
Perhaps there is code at work in terms of tolerance for
homosexuality _ Laurents was accidentally outed by Frank Rich in
1995. But that's less central to the play than Laurents's ability
to dispense with romantic and sexual absolutes in a setting that
seemed to be crying out for traditional love. Samish wants life to
be a waltz. ``You should have gone to Vienna,'' says Signora
Floria.
</P>
<P>
   Laurents is perhaps better known for his screenplays (``The Way
We Were'') and musicals (the book for ``West Side Story''). So one
hopes for a revival of the musical based on this play, ``Do I Hear
a Waltz?,'' which he wrote with Richard Rodgers and Stephen
Sondheim. But then this production makes its own unexpectedly
resonant music under Martin's baton. There is more to running a
theater than one's ability as a director, but at least in that
capacity the Huntington has an obvious winner.

CINDY BLACKMAN FINDS THE BEAT OF THE DRUM IRRESISTIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When she was a child, some folks would ask Cindy Blackman why
she didn't play the flute. They would fix their mouths in that
certain disapproving way, shake their heads, and wonder aloud why
that Blackman girl couldn't just play the clarinet, violin, or
something _ anything _ other than the instrument she had chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Girls weren't supposed to want to play the drums.
</P>
<P>
   But Blackman always loved the drums. Even before she was big
enough to see over a kit, she was fascinated by the way they
looked, was seduced by their urgent sound when she heard them on
records, or on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember just loving the role the drummer had in the band in
terms of the rhythm they created, and the way they carried the
rhythm. I always liked that,'' Blackman recalled. ``I liked what I
heard even when drums were treated more as a background instrument.
But when I heard them played in a way that put them more in the
foreground, that really got me.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Blackman has been putting drums in the
foreground as the leader of her own jazz combo. She has released
several well-regarded albums, including her latest, ``Works on
Canvas,'' a challenging blend of original works and standards such
as ``April in Paris'' and ``Green Dolphin Street.'' Her best
compositions are reminiscent of her jazz heroes, especially the
late Tony Williams, who was a member of Miles Davis's influential
1960s quintet with Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, and Ron Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and she has this other job, too. Since 1993, she's been the
sistah in the wraparound shades and the Cleopatra Jones 'fro
keeping the beat for Lenny Kravitz on such hits as ``Are You Gonna
Go My Way,'' ``Rock and Roll is Dead,'' ``Fly Away,'' and the
current single, ``I Belong to You.''
</P>
<P>
   With her jazz and rock credentials, these days Blackman is one
of the best-known women drummers around, a growing sorority that
includes all-around percussionist Sheila ``E'' Escovedo; Stefanie
Eulinberg, who plays with Kid Rock; Kate Schellenback of Luscious
Jackson; and Terri Lyne Carrington, who has played with everyone
from Dianne Reeves to Carlos Santana.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and raised in Bristol,
Cromwell, and West Hartford, Conn., and her household percolated
with a heady brew of musical styles. Her mother, a violinist, loved
classical music; her father favored the jazz of Ahmad Jamal and
Miles Davis; her sister was into Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family
Stone, and the Beatles; and her brother was tuning his ear to John
Coltrane. As for Blackman, she was listening to the Jackson 5 and
the Sylvers, ``the teeny bop music of the time,'' she said, as well
as Kansas and Tower of Power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a collage of sounds,'' said Blackman, 40, during
an phone interview from her Brooklyn, N.Y., home. ``I feel blessed
to have been able to hear such a variety of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 8, she was asking her parents for drums. But
it took her several years to convince her father to invest in a kit
for his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my dad and he said, `Well, we got you skis, and you
gave your skis away. So if we spend more money on these drums, are
you going to play them or give them away?' ''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Blackman ditched her skis after she saw a show
in which a woman was paralyzed after crashing during a race. ``I
didn't want anything to do with the skis after that _ I gave them
away the next day,'' she said with a laugh. ``The drums seemed a
lot safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackman's formal training began at age 13, and she would later
spend three semesters at the Berklee College of Music. She studied
with Lennie Nelson and Alan Dawson, who also taught Tony Williams.
During these years, she became intrigued by jazz drumming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so much more intricate,'' she said. ``The first time I
heard Max Roach, I was absolutely floored.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she moved to New York in the early 1980s, she was
was a straight-up jazzhead, and was hanging out with her heroes
like Williams, whom she calls ``the most advanced drummer to have
graced this earth.'' And there was lots of time in the company of
such luminaries as Roach, Elvin Jones, Kenny Clarke, and the great
Art Blakey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me a lot about drumming, about music, about life,''
she said of Blakey. ``He was the kind of guy you would go hang out
with, and you'd leave feeling like you were on top of the world. He
loved music and jazz so much, you couldn't be in his presence and
not carry that with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackman's jazz work is often characterized as hard bop. She
doesn't shun the label, but she maintains her influences are more
expansive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne Shorter referred to it as `creative music,' and that's
the term I use because that allows you to have total freedom in
terms of what elements you allow in the music,'' she said. ``If you
categorize it, it puts things in a box. Instead of saying it's this
kind of music, or that kind of music, how about saying it's just
music that's going to ignite thought and a creative spark?
</P>
<P>
   ``But whatever people call it, I feel really blessed to be able
to do what I love doing,'' Blackman said. ``To love music is a
blessing in itself. To play music and to play it for your career is
an extreme blessing. So, without sounding fanatical, I just thank
the Lord for allowing me to do this.''

THE QUIRKY LIFE OF AN ARTIST AND HIS WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
M: THE MAN WHO BECAME CARAVAGGIO 
By Peter Robb. 
Henry Holt, 570pp., illustrated, $30.00. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Robb addresses ``M: The Man Who Became Caravaggio'' not to
the specialist but to the general reader who is interested in
Caravaggio, as everybody seems to be these days.
</P>
<P>
   Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio is now recognized as the
greatest artist active in Europe during the 15 or so great years of
his career; many in his own time thought so too. Caravaggio was
also the most notorious artist of his time, a rebel, a hothead,
wild, a criminal. He knew his way around the brawling streetlife in
Rome, repeatedly got into trouble with the law, did time in jail,
and killed a man in an argument after a tennis match. He enjoyed
the protection of wealthy and powerful men, most of them cardinals,
and was on easy terms with workers of both sexes from Rome's
professional sex industry.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the last years of his life condemned to death and on
the run; people always thought he was crazy, and by the end he may
well have been. Then, in 1610, when it seemed his pardon was
assured, he mysteriously disappeared (he was only 39), and nobody
knows what happened to him, although Robb presents a theory that
fits the known facts better than some of its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   To some in the late 16th century, Caravaggio was a
counterculture hero, and over the last 50 years or so, he has
become a counterculture hero again. There have been novels about
him, stacks of biographies and studies, and even a movie. Robb's
bibliography runs to 15 pages of illegibly small type. But even in
this crowded company, his own book stands out for its thoroughness,
and fearless bravura.
</P>
<P>
   Robb, an Australian writer who has lived in Italy for 14 years,
received attention a couple of years ago with the international
publication of ``Midnight in Sicily,'' an extraordinary book about
the history of Sicily and the story of the Mafia in the last half
of the 20th century, intertwined with observations and reflections
about the literature, painting, and food of that amazing island _
where, incidentally, Caravaggio spent most of the last year of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   The strengths of Robb's new book are the strengths of its
predecessor _ it is not just about one thing, but about the way odd
things are connected in human and artistic realities. Robb writes
not only about the man Caravaggio, but also about the society of
the elite that supported him, about the repressive regime within
which he had to work, about the jealousy of some of his fellow
artists and the admiration of others, about his turbulent
relationships with young men and prominent female prostitutes,
about the politics of religion and of art, about the surprising
intersections of many different, coexisting worlds, and the way in
which the paintings of Caravaggio reflect his worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The established facts about Caravaggio's life would fill just a
few pages; Robb enthrallingly uses 570 not only to establish a
context and to speculate on what can't be known but also to study
the one thing no one can get to the bottom of, Caravaggio's
surviving paintings. Most of the book, and the best of it, lies in
Robb's close readings of the paintings. (It helps to have a good
book of Caravaggio reproductions at hand, because there aren't
enough of them here, and they're poorly reproduced and awkwardly
laid out for study.)
</P>
<P>
   It has been commonplace for a century and more to call
Caravaggio the first ``modern'' artist. What people mean by that is
that he put his own world, and his own psychology, into paintings
that were supposed to be on classical or biblical subjects. In the
single recorded remark Caravaggio made about art, which turned up
in a bit of police testimony, ``To me the term good man means
someone who knows how to do things well _ that is, knows how to do
his art well _ so in painting, a good man knows how to paint well
and imitate natural things well.''
</P>
<P>
   Caravaggio's success at imitating natural things well was fine
when he was painting water in a carafe or the blush on a grape, or
even a worm hole in an apple. But the Roman church was opposed to
nature in general and implacably opposed to human nature in
particular. Some of Caravaggio's greatest paintings were rejected
by the institutions that commissioned them. He became controversial
when he put human feelings and human realities into his works, not
to mention actual recognizable people from Rome's street life. Poor
pilgrims with tattered clothes and dirty feet kneel before the
Virgin Mary, and the model for the Virgin herself was a prominent
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Robb's method is unconventional. He writes in a mixture of
poetic evocation (``an embarrassment of frozen turmoil was now set
in a strangely elegiac early morning aspic'') and vulgar street
talk, striving to achieve a prose equivalent of Caravaggio's visual
daring. His work rests on a solid base of scholarship, and nearly
every paragraph has a word or an image in italics that comes from a
source contemporary to Caravaggio. But it is also freely
speculative, sexually partisan (Robb chooses not to be embarrassed
by Caravaggio's frank omnisexuality but to glory in it), and openly
anachronistic _ he devotes pages to comparing Caravaggio to the New
York photographer Weegee, who is quoted in the epigraph (``Crime
was my oyster'').
</P>
<P>
   There are some flaws in his work, which shows signs of
insufficiently rigorous editing _ Robb has an ear for talk like the
late George V. Higgins did, and writes in an oral tradition,
repeating himself more often than a reader needs. Much of what he
has said, he has said so well there's no danger anyone will forget.
It's clear that Caravaggio is Robb's oyster, and he makes him ours
too.

KNIGHT SINGS THE PRAISES OF HER `FEEL-GOOD' `CAFE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, Gladys Knight was honored with a Pioneer Award
from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in New York. Stevie Wonder
stood at her side as she and her longtime group, the Pips, came up
to the podium. Tears flowed as they hugged one another _ and Knight
was particularly overcome. Although the public thinks of her as a
star, Knight, like many R &AMP; B pioneers, says she was cheated out of
royalties in the early days and has often struggled to have her
songs cross over from black radio stations to white Top 40 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our ups and downs, and yes, we had to face racism,''
Knight says in a recent conversation from Chicago. ``You have to
realize that this is the 51st year for me in this business, and the
Pips and I were together for almost 40 years. So we went through
some times _ socially, as well as economically.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who was born in Atlanta, is 55, but she's been touring
since age 4, when she joined traveling church choirs in the South.
She has indeed seen some things, so you can excuse her if she's
trying to have some fun with her latest venture, ``Smokey Joe's
Cafe.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical is based on the songs of Jerry Leiber and Mike
Stoller, who wrote hits for Elvis Presley (``Hound Dog'' and
``Jailhouse Rock''), the Coasters (``Charlie Brown''), the
Drifters, Peggy Lee, and many others.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, whose career includes such hits as ``Midnight Train to
Georgia'' and ``I Heard It Through the Grapevine,'' starred in the
show on Broadway last year after being recruited by Leiber and
Stoller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful feel-good musical show,'' she says. ``Even if
you weren't born during the time when this music was popular, you'd
still have a sense of recognition because the things they have
written about are still so relevant today. Everybody knows a
Charlie Brown _ you know, that person who creates havoc and makes
mischief and keeps something going all the time. We've still got
those kind of people. And it makes for a really fun show. The music
is great and the way they've opted to present it is unique, fresh,
and uplifting.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight never met Leiber and Stoller in their heyday, but she
felt honored when they invited her to do the musical on Broadway.
``They came up with the idea of perking things up a bit, since they
had been on Broadway for about five years,'' she says. ``They
wanted to do a guest-star kind of thing, where they'd have a guest
star come in and maybe do a number for one week. So I came in and
did the week, and it worked out so well that they called me back to
do two weeks. And that worked out so well that they called me back
to do four weeks and it just went from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight is a diehard show-business trouper who opened shows for
Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke before she was 13. She can still reel
off horror stories from the early days _ she and the Pips (who
included her cousin, James Wood, whose nickname was Pip) never got
any money from their first hit, ``Every Beat of My Heart,'' in
1961; and she still disdains most record company CEOs. ``Most of
them tell you what to sing and what not to sing, but they couldn't
carry a note or play a note if they needed to. They can count the
money, though. I give them credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Knight is looking ahead, not back. She won't let past
frustrations defeat her. She's on an upswing from a recent Grammy
nomination in the contemporary soul gospel category for her CD
``Many Different Roads.'' She's also doing a pop album for MCA
Records and hopes to get that out this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not frustrated, no,'' she says. ``Anything that the
heavenly father ordains, there's no way to stop it. It's his plan
anyway, and I'm just here to be his servant. He's going to see to
it that I'm successful in whatever arena I'm supposed to be
successful in.''
</P>
<P>
   Born a Southern Baptist, Knight is now a Mormon, and cites her
faith as a sustaining power. ``Whoever is not treating someone
fairly, they're going to have to answer for that. I don't even have
to worry about it. I don't have to spin my wheels dealing with it.
I just need to still make my music and he will grant me a way to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight is also about to release a physical fitness book, ``Body
Temples,'' with her fitness guru, Al Claiborne. She works out five
times a week and watches her sugar intake (she's a spokeswoman for
the American Diabetes Foundation); she says she's lost 40 pounds
and feels terrific. ``I'm just trying to get this body temple to
feel right.''

   BOURBON (New York) _ So many wine snobs, so little patience.
That's why one of my favorite drinking buddies is Al Hirschfeld.

prefers to keep drinking it past cocktails and through the meal,
which, by the way, he prefers to be steak. I love a guy who breaks

my dirty little secret is: I'm drinking bourbon right along with

FOR SPORTY TURF, START WITH TIF419 SOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Where can I get Bermuda 419 grass seed? It's the grass used
in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas and The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   _ M.G., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Tifton 419 Bermuda grass, also called Tif419, is not
available as a seed. ``It is vegetatively planted only'' _ meaning
sod, sprigged or plugged with live growing plants, according to
Jason Gray, turfgrass extension assistant with Texas A&AMP;M
University. ``No seeded varieties available will look anything like
Tif419.''
</P>
<P>
   You can special-order Tif419 sod from Thomas Brothers Grass at
4020 S. Cooper St. in Arlington. It sells for $131.67 per pallet
plus a $5 pallet deposit. For more information, call (817) 467-1103
or visit the Web site www.thomasbros.com.
</P>
<P>
   More information on Texas grasses is available from the Texas
Turfgrass Association's Web site, www.texasturf.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the name of the ``Law &AMP; Order'' theme song, and is it
available on CD?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.H., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The unnamed theme is included on the 1994 CD ``Inventions
From the Blue Line'' by Mike Post, the composer of numerous
cop-show theme songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventions'' also includes the themes from ``NYPD Blue,''
``Silk Stalkings,'' ``Renegade'' and ``Cop Files'' along with five
other songs used on ``Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Post, a five-time Grammy winner, has written themes and music
for more than two dozen TV shows. His other themes include ``Hill
Street Blues,'' ``The Commish,'' ``Quantum Leap'' and ``The
Greatest American Hero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventions'' is available from several retailers and directly
from the record label American Gramaphone Records for $9.98 plus
$4.50 shipping and handling. Call (800) 446-6860 for ordering
information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm trying to find the name of a movie that starred Thelma
Ritter as a mother trying to find husbands for her three daughters.
Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.M.G., S. Grafton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's the 1963 comedy ``For Love or Money,'' which also
starred Kirk Douglas, Julie Newmar and William Bendix.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is out of print and did not turn up in a search.
CloseOutVideo.com, a Florida dealer specializing in hard-to-find
videos, has sold it but recently ran out of copies. To contact the
company, call (727) 447-4147 or visit the Web site
www.closeoutvideo.com.

DROUGHT PUTS A NEW TEXAS CROP _ FRESH-WATER PEARLS _ ON HOLD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly half of all Texas counties are eligible for drought
relief now and the others are getting thirsty. Farmers are mowing
and bailing highway right-of-way to feed their livestock; stock
tanks are baked rock-hard dry.
</P>
<P>
   The hot, dusty winds continue to blow and there is a new victim
in this parched scenario: a new Texas crop that is failing, a new
industry that is being held in arid abeyance.
</P>
<P>
   Pearls.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have been working to establish a fresh-water pearl
industry in the state. The project is being conducted at Lake
Anahuac, near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should just take a couple of years to get the first
pearls,'' said Dr. Leonard DiMichele, a fisheries researcher with
the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station. ``We've got the animals,
we've got the techniques, and usually we have the water. But this
is not a good year right now. We've had trouble with the drought
and growing conditions. We'll try to replant this spring.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMichele and other researchers thought that the Anahuac
location would be a good one because they are working with the
local water district that helps farmers flood rice fields every
year. That's a lot of water. Usually.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the rice fields are endangered and the anticipated
pearl industry is left unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Cultured pearls will remain in the grips of the Japanese and
other Asian markets for now, but researchers say that when the
rains do come, customers could end up with strings of purely Texas
pearls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a marketing and distribution infrastructure
right now,'' DiMichele said. ``But there are people watching our
research and they are ready to establish the systems when the time
comes.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason researchers believe Texas is fertile ground _ or
water _ for pearls is the presence of the Tampico pearly mussel
that produces pink to flame red pearls. It can be found all along
the Colorado River drainage basin and in Lake Buchanan, where
DiMichele has begun yet another research project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a bit of the pearls brought back to Spain by the
conquistadors came from those mussels,'' DiMichele said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the nuclei, or shell pieces that are introduced to
mussels or oysters to begin pearl formation, come from the United
State. The best of the nuclei come from the South, where the shells
are thick and strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like a thick, homogeneous shell,'' DiMichele said of the
Asian growers. ``The shells are cut into small cubes and rounded
out. The nuclei range from 5 to 10 millimeters in size. Actually,
when you buy the pearls, you're basically buying back the nuclei. A
cultured pearl has only a couple millimeters covering the nuclei.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMichele likens the current system to that of Colonial America.
``You produce the raw material and ship it overseas for the
manufacturing, and then it gets sold back to you,'' he said. ``That
is never as good an economic arrangement as doing the manufacturing
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 70 percent of the pearls sold worldwide are sold in the
United States, researchers believe U.S. pearl farms could become a
multimillion-dollar industry.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as it rains.

<P>
   I have some bad news and some good news today.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that my husband left me. He took his clothes,
his car, and a big chunk of our checking account. He left before
dawn with barely a glance backward. The squeal of his tires on the
pavement was the most emotion displayed during his departure.
</P>
<P>
   He took the kids with him. Their clothes, CDs, Game Boys, and
their incessant noise _ all gone. Of course, they're coming back.
It's just a weekend trip. Kind of a last-minute deal. Regrettably,
I had prior commitments and could not accompany them. Oh, well.
Whatever will I do with myself for three, whole, entire,
uninterrupted, complete days alone?
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   After work, I'll go home and clean the house. I know that
doesn't sound appealing, but the idea that it will remain clean for
three days just gives me goosebumps. Then, I'll eat soup. I'll
probably cook it in a bowl since you shouldn't put cans in the
microwave. That's as close as I can come to not cooking at all. I
may even just drink my dinner.
</P>
<P>
   I've considered polishing my toenails because during dinner last
month, one of my girlfriends said, ``You can tell a lot about a
woman by her feet.'' Like what, for instance? What on earth can you
tell about someone by their feet? Big. Small. Wide. So what? That's
genetic stuff. OK, if they're dirty, you've got some ammunition,
but otherwise, I wouldn't exactly call a woman's feet a window to
her soul.
</P>
<P>
   But, just in case she's right, I might dig out that red polish
that I usually reserve for summer days at the beach. Nah, who's
gonna see my feet this weekend, anyway? If my friend drops by, I'll
just put on socks. That leaves me more time to read. I'll read a
good, trashy novel. That soup and the novel will get me through
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, I don't have to go to any sporting events. I won't
be asked to go for a bike ride or play badminton. The phone
probably won't ring. I won't even have to locate anyone's socks or
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Boy oh boy, I'm just gonna walk around the house in my socks and
... be bored out of my mind. What on earth was I thinking to let
them leave me here by myself? I don't even like soup that much!
</P>
<P>
   Well, the good news is that they're coming back on Sunday. The
bad news is, at this moment, it's only Friday morning, really early
on Friday morning. In consolation, I cling to one simple thought.
It is my beacon of hope and inspiration: Deep down inside I know
that no matter what else happens this weekend, no matter how
lonesome and bored I become, my feet are clean.
</P>
<P>
   They may not be decorated, but they are clean.
</P>

TAIWAN, SHRUGGING OFF CHINA THREAT, REACHES FOR PRACTICAL
SOLUTIONS

   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Unbowed by China's latest threat of force,
Taiwan on Tuesday called on the mainland to set aside fruitless
debates over sovereignty and resume talks over economic ties and
other practical matters to improve relations across the Taiwan
straits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call ourselves a sovereign country, and if they don't like
it, they'll have to live with it,'' said Su Chi, chairman of the
cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, in an interview. ``They
call us a province and we don't like it, but we live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taiwan problem is not solvable by force or the threat of
force,'' Su said.
</P>
<P>
   Su spoke in response to a report issued by China on Monday that
repeated longstanding demands that Taiwan embrace the ``one China''
principle and warned of military action if the island endlessly
puts off talks on political unification.
</P>
<P>
   China's stern report came less than one month before
presidential elections here and appears designed to warn the
contenders and electorate that China's patience is running thin.
The report did not set down a timetable or ultimatum, but railed
against what it termed the separatist scheming of Taiwan's current
president, Lee Teng-hui and condemned American arms sales to the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Among members of the public here, reactions to China's latest
warning ranged from anger to indifference. But the prospect of new
tensions caused the Taiwan stock market to slump, dipping more than
4 percent at one point before intervention by a special stabilizing
fund held the day's loss to 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   China's report, and Taiwan's ripostes Tuesday, repeated familiar
arguments in which seemingly minor rhetorical differences reflect
crucial divisions over basic principle.
</P>
<P>
   For the Taiwanese, who are proud of the advanced economy and
democracy they have achieved, China's offered formula of ``one
country, two systems'' is embedded with an utterly unacceptable
assumption: that Beijing heads the true national government and
that Taiwan _ even if granted remarkable autonomy _ is merely one
of its provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot negotiate on the basis that theirs is a sovereign
country while ours is a province.'' Su said. ``We're not electing a
governor here,'' he said, referring to the March 18 elections.
``We're electing a president, and they have to face it.''
</P>
<P>
   Su repeated previous invitations to resume talks on trade and
communications links, on a treaty to prevent use of force and on
other practical issues, noting that a large majority in Taiwan is
not ready to take the political leap that China demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the People's Republic of China thinks the time is right to
reunify China, to bring Taiwan into its fold, they are
miscalculating,'' Su said. ``The Taiwanese people don't want to
declare independence, but they don't want unification now either,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of China's threats of war, all three major candidates in
the presidential election here have already declared their desire
to resume talks with the mainland and foster closer economic ties.
China angrily halted a tentative dialogue across the straits last
summer, when President Lee said Taiwan would meet only on a
``state-to-state'' basis _ a formulation that China considers
tantamount to declaring independence.
</P>
<P>
   China's new warnings seemed to cause few ripples in public
opinion here.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Taiwanese, we still control our own destinies. and we can
find our own directions,'' said Shi Tang-te, 31, an employee of a
Japanese trading firm here, as he shopped for computer software.
Shi said he still supports the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, which has only recently tempered its calls for Taiwan's
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lai Ching-chi, a 44-year-old sales manager for a printing firm,
was more distressed. ``When I heard the news yesterday, I felt
powerless,'' he said. ``I accept the idea that we are all Chinese,
but the mainland is too aggressive about this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwan is very small and the mainland sets the rules,'' said
Lai, a supporter of the Nationalist Party. ``I only hope there is
no war among the Chinese.

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Silicon Valley is no longer shy about its
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   It favors free trade with China, an unlimited supply of
immigrant workers and a ban on Internet taxation.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, this year's leading presidential candidates
have no problem with those demands. In fact, they are working hard
to make one or more of those proposals a key part of their
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   All four of the leading candidates for the Republican and
Democratic party nominations have been vocal and visible in their
courtship of the technology sector. The extra attention is paying
off.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released last week by the Center for
Responsive Politics , a nonpartisan organization in Washington,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush has corralled the most donations from
Silicon Valley among the presidential hopefuls, with $698,033.
Former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey has pulled in $333,235;
Vice President Al Gore has raised $330,285; and Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., has attracted $140,536.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, President Clinton, as an incumbent, raised
$140,000 during his 1996 presidential campaign, said Holly Bailey,
a researcher who specializes in technology contributions for the
Center for Responsive Politics. And Sen. Bob Dole, the unsuccessful
Republican candidate for president in 1996, raised about $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The influence has grown tremendously, whether you look at
policy development, relationship building, being a player in the
state's capital or in Washington, D.C.,'' said Lezlee Westine,
general counsel and vice president of TechNet, a bipartisan Silicon
Valley organization that is generally recognized as the most
visible political organization representing technology interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people started out thinking Silicon Valley would only be
a major campaign contributor,'' Westine said. ``They've now evolved
into policy advisers and grass-roots campaign volunteers, as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Westine, who coordinates TechNet's relationship-building efforts
with the Republican Party, has witnessed the evolution firsthand,
coming aboard in 1997 after serving as an attorney and telecom
policymaker for California's governor at the time, Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the Silicon Valley's political activism started
about four years ago. At the time, the industry was experiencing
some of its first success on the political front, succeeding in its
efforts to block a California ballot initiative that would have
made it easier for shareholders to sue public companies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, a number of other issues emerged, among
them data encryption, Internet privacy and Internet taxation. While
those issues were important, many observers say it wasn't until
Microsoft Corp.'s antitrust case hit that the industry really took
notice of Washington's power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Microsoft antitrust case was a huge wake-up call,'' Bailey
said. ``That's when we saw campaign contributions step up, between
1997 and 1998. People were saying, 'Hey, this could happen to
us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the huge advance of technology stocks, the stage
was set for increased fund-raising activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unfortunate part of politics is money speaks,'' said Ted
Schlein, a general partner in the Menlo Park-based venture capital
firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of money here. Political power tends to focus,
then, on the money. Now that they're out here, the next question is
the ability to effect change.''
</P>
<P>
   To do so, the Silicon Valley is focusing on issues rather than
party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think political parties mean less to people here,'' said
Schlein, who is actively supporting Bradley in the presidential
campaign. ``What we're used to here is anyone, regardless of race
or gender, has a chance to rise to the top. Anyone can start a
company. Anyone can be a CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude speaks volumes on the area's libertarian roots.
``Content is valued over branding,'' said Schlein, applying some
Internet speak to his political views.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's refreshing that this industry takes a truly bipartisan
approach,'' said Mark Albertson, senior vice president of the
American Electronics Association, a trade organization representing
more than 3,000 technology companies nationwide. ``It's a good,
constructive way to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   It also is a good way to leverage one's influence, Westine said.
With the presidential race heating up, she said, the Silicon Valley
is in an even better position to work with the candidates on
crucial policy positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition for Silicon Valley support has produced very
positive policies for the new economy,'' said Westine, whose
organization has grown to more than 180 chief executives from the
high-tech industry including hardware, software, biotech, and
content providers, as well as leading partners from venture capital
companies, investment banks and law firms.
</P>
<P>
   TechNet is based in Palo Alto. The organization recently opened
operations in Austin, Texas, and Orange County, Calif. The group
also plans to expand into Oregon, Washington, Colorado, New York
and Pennsylvania.

 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TOTNES, England _ In this small town 200 miles southwest of
London, a retired vet, Chris Grimshaw, has persuaded the clergy,
the schools, the medical profession and town government _ ``the
whole community,'' as he puts it _ ``to work together to increase
the health of relationships.''
 &HT;    ``While stepfamilies and single parenthood can be made to
work,'' he says, ``neither has quite as good a chance _ or gives
children quite as good a chance _ as enduring marriage.''
 &HT;    Marriage is disintegrating in Great Britain, as it is in
America. While British divorces soared six-fold _ from 26,000 in
1961 to 171,000 in 1997 _ the nation's number of couples getting
married has plunged by a third, from 459,000 annually to 308,000.
 &HT;    To put it differently, Britain now has one divorce for every two
marriages, just like the United States.
 &HT;    That gives it one of the highest divorce rates in Europe, double
that of France or Germany. Further, Britain's cohabitation and
out-of-wedlock rates are even higher than the U.S.
 &HT;    British research reveals that a child living with unmarried
parents is 20 times more likely to be physically or sexually abused
than one with married parents, and 37 times more at risk if the
mother is living with a boyfriend.
 &HT;    Chris Grimshaw is committed to turn these trends around.
 &HT;    Several years ago, he and Claire, his vivacious wife of 27
years, attended a marriage-enrichment weekend ``with fear and
trepidation,'' along with several other couples from different
churches.
 &HT;    ``We all came back with our marriages greatly strengthened,'' he
told 110 people in his home town one recent weekend. They also came
back determined to do what they could to revive marriage in
Britain.
 &HT;    He was invited to attend a free weekend for pastors run by
Americans David and Teresa Ferguson of Intimate Life Ministries.
They taught how clergy and lay leaders can recognize the emotional
needs of one's spouse, and then, how to fulfill them.
 &HT;    Intimate Life identifies ten emotional needs, which if
unfulfilled, lead to relational problems: Acceptance, Affection,
Appreciation, Approval, Attention, Comfort, Encouragement, Respect,
Security and Support.
 &HT;    One exercise you might try: identify your own top three needs,
and those of your spouse. Few husbands know their wife's core
needs.
 &HT;    The Grimshaws own a small farm resort in Totnes that is
completely rented out in season. But in the winter it is unused. So
they began running marriage-enrichment weekends, charging very
small fees to encourage a maximum number of couples to attend.
 &HT;    So far, 350 couples have done so. They take eight couples at a
time, using either Intimate Life materials, or Marriage Review, a
form of Marriage Encounter.
 &HT;    Two years ago, from the Web site of Marriage Savers, Chris heard
of Community Marriage Policies being organized by clergy in the
United States. He told Totnes leaders: ``Whole towns have had their
divorce rates drop by rates of 25 percent or more. This was done
with very ordinary people working together across a community. I
thought, `That's what I want to do here.'''
 &HT;    He invited the mayor and 13 other leading citizens in Totnes to
a dinner with fine wine, and made a proposal far broader than
Community Marriage Policies, which are focused on how clergy can
cooperate to prepare, strengthen and save troubled marriages.
``What I am proposing is to teach relationship skills to every
adult and child in this community of 20,000 people.''
 &HT;    Four elements are in place:
 &HT;    1. When women give birth to children, health workers teach both
mother and father relationship skills. Tania West, who is training
midwives, says, ``Marital satisfaction expectations are high at the
beginning, but take a dip when the first baby comes. A crying baby
takes a lot of time. Couple communication becomes small talk about
nappies (diapers). Deeper sharing tends not to happen. We teach the
ten emotional needs, and how to meet them.''
 &HT;    2. Elementary school principals are very concerned about the
behavioral characteristics of 5-year-olds. Children don't want to
go out for recess because they don't know how to make friends.
Those skills are now being taught.
 &HT;    3. In secondary schools and community colleges, students are
taught communication and conflict resolution skills. Grimshaw says,
``I want every child leaving secondary school to be as emotionally
literate as they are computer literate.''
 &HT;    4. The clergy have agreed to require serious marriage
preparation.
 &HT;    The Totnes model has attracted national attention. Last week my
wife and I traveled with Chris Grimshaw to meet with a Committee of
Parliament and local religious and government leaders in London,
York and four smaller towns to help them launch similar
initiatives.
 &HT;    America and Britain have much to learn from each other.

 &HT;    Chris Grimshaw is committed to turn these trends around.
 &HT;    Several years ago, he and Claire, his vivacious wife of 27
years, attended a marriage-enrichment weekend ``with fear and
trepidation,'' along with several other couples from different
churches.
 &HT;    ``We all came back with our marriages greatly strengthened,'' he
told 110 people in his home town one recent weekend. They also came
back determined to do what they could to revive marriage in
Britain.
 &HT;    He was invited to attend a free weekend for pastors run by
Americans David and Teresa Ferguson of Intimate Life Ministries.
They taught how clergy and lay leaders can recognize the emotional
needs of one's spouse, and then, how to fulfill them.
 &HT;    Intimate Life identifies ten emotional needs, which if
unfulfilled, lead to relational problems: Acceptance, Affection,
Appreciation, Approval, Attention, Comfort, Encouragement, Respect,
Security and Support.
 &HT;    One exercise you might try: identify your own top three needs,
and those of your spouse. Few husbands know their wife's core
needs.
 &HT;    The Grimshaws own a small farm resort in Totnes that is
completely rented out in season. But in the winter it is unused. So
they began running marriage-enrichment weekends, charging very
small fees to encourage a maximum number of couples to attend.
 &HT;    So far, 350 couples have done so. They take eight couples at a
time, using either Intimate Life materials, or Marriage Review, a
form of Marriage Encounter.
 &HT;    Two years ago, from the Web site of Marriage Savers, Chris heard
of Community Marriage Policies being organized by clergy in the
United States. He told Totnes leaders: ``Whole towns have had their
divorce rates drop by rates of 25 percent or more. This was done
with very ordinary people working together across a community. I
thought, `That's what I want to do here.'''
 &HT;    He invited the mayor and 13 other leading citizens in Totnes to
a dinner with fine wine, and made a proposal far broader than
Community Marriage Policies, which are focused on how clergy can
cooperate to prepare, strengthen and save troubled marriages.
``What I am proposing is to teach relationship skills to every
adult and child in this community of 20,000 people.''
 &HT;    Four elements are in place:
 &HT;    1. When women give birth to children, health workers teach both
mother and father relationship skills. Tania West, who is training
midwives, says, ``Marital satisfaction expectations are high at the
beginning, but take a dip when the first baby comes. A crying baby
takes a lot of time. Couple communication becomes small talk about
nappies (diapers). Deeper sharing tends not to happen. We teach the
ten emotional needs, and how to meet them.''
 &HT;    2. Elementary school principals are very concerned about the
behavioral characteristics of 5-year-olds. Children don't want to
go out for recess because they don't know how to make friends.
Those skills are now being taught.
 &HT;    3. In secondary schools and community colleges, students are
taught communication and conflict resolution skills. Grimshaw says,
``I want every child leaving secondary school to be as emotionally
literate as they are computer literate.''
 &HT;    4. The clergy have agreed to require serious marriage
preparation.
 &HT;    The Totnes model has attracted national attention. Last week my
wife and I traveled with Chris Grimshaw to meet with a Committee of
Parliament and local religious and government leaders in London,
York and four smaller towns to help them launch similar
initiatives.
 &HT;    America and Britain have much to learn from each other.

READERS REJOICE: HARRY POTTER'S BACK, AND SO IS KAY SCARPETTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   At one time, publishers divided the book business into two
distinct seasons _ spring and fall _ with the idea being that the
best books were released just when consumers were most ready to buy
them for summer vacations or Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But the times, they are a changin', probably due to the advent
of customer-friendly mega-bookstore chains like Barnes &AMP; Noble and
Borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because bookstores have become a year 'round gathering place
with their coffee bars and reading areas, publishers have gotten
away from the idea of distinct time frames as (being) best for book
sales,'' says Kellie Lutz, a book industry analyst in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't just thinking about books as something they can
read on the beach or over the Christmas holidays. Now the so-called
big books by the best-known authors may come out any time from Jan.
1 to Dec. 31. I think it benefits the consumer, because you can
pretty much buy them on a steady pace throughout the year.''
</P>
<P>
   This new philosophy has never been more evident than in the
first months of 2000. Already, we've had fiction from Pulitzer
Prize-winner Robert Olen Butler (''Mr. Spaceman'') and perennial
bestseller John Grisham (''The Brethren'') as well as pointed
political commentary from Jeffrey Toobin (''A Vast Conspiracy'').
Also on store shelves are new novels by Carl Hiaasen (''Sick
Puppy''), John Updike (''Gertrude and Claudius'') and E.L. Doctorow
(''City of God'').
</P>
<P>
   From March through the beginning of next September, each month
promises to include publication of at least a few intriguing,
unmistakable bestselling titles. Attention from the media doesn't
guarantee success, as was demonstrated last year when ``Hannibal,''
Thomas Harris' sequel to ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' sold briskly
but was panned by critics and most readers. Edmund Morris'
semi-fictional ``Dutch,'' a long-awaited biography of Ronald
Reagan, earned comparable scorn, as did Susan Faludi's ``Stiffed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a subjective Top 20 list of upcoming titles seems to
offer something for everyone, particularly in fiction. From Harry
Potter to Kay Scarpetta, with Jack Ryan in between, old favorites
return. Critical favorites Jane Smiley, Thomas Sanchez, Jeff Shaara
and Alice Hoffman have new titles, and Texas' own Stephen Harrigan
may eclipse them all with his monumental novel ``The Gates of the
Alamo.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, are the books of spring by month of publication:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``The Gates of the Alamo'' by Stephen Harrigan (March,
Knopf). The subject: Texas during the revolution, particularly the
famous siege in San Antonio. The buzz: Industry insiders have been
anticipating this one for years. The prediction: It's a
masterpiece. Give Harrigan all the awards for fiction now.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Ravelstein'' by Saul Bellow (March, Random House). The
subject: A colorful nonconformist takes on the world. The buzz:
It's Bellow, so it must be good. The prediction: It is, and how
well ``Ravelstein'' sells will tell us a lot about the modern
hunger (or lack thereof) for fine literary fiction.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``The Remorseful Day'' by Colin Dexter (March, Crown). The
subject: Prickly Inspector Morse solves his final case. The buzz:
Readers ought to flock to learn how a beloved curmudgeon closes out
his career. The prediction: It was time for the old drunk to go.
Less-than-anticipated sales will confirm this. Morse was always
much more popular in England than America.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Ordinary Resurrections: Children in Years of Hope'' by
Jonathan Kozol (April, Crown). The subject: America's favorite
``bleeding heart'' journalist takes readers to live with poor kids
in the South Bronx. The buzz: Kozol writes so wonderfully he makes
liberals feel proud of their social philosophies. The prediction: A
bestseller, with literary prizes to come.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Pontius Pilate'' by Anne Wroe (April, Random House). The
subject: A nonfiction investigation of a controversial, and largely
unknown, life. The buzz: The book won all sorts of awards in its
author's native England, and Random House is going to push it hard
in the United States. The prediction: It's superbly written and
should attract a wide audience.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Horse Heaven'' by Jane Smiley (April, Knopf). The subject:
Two years on a fictional horse-racing circuit. The buzz: ``Jane
Smiley always sells, even if she's not writing well.'' The
prediction: not this time. Critics always like to turn icons into
punching bags, and this could be Smiley's turn.

S&AMP;P REAFFIRMS JAPAN'S TRIPLE-A RATING AFTER MOODY'S WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Less than one week after Moody's Investors Service
warned that it was considering lowering its rating of Japan's
creditworthiness, Standard &AMP; Poor's, the credit rating agency's
chief rival, reaffirmed its triple-A rating of the country's
sovereign debt.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's also said its outlook for Japan was stable,
citing the country's standing as the world's largest creditor
nation and the breadth of its economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency's assessment also carried a warning and an
implicit criticism of the current government's economic policies,
which have depended largely on pork barrel projects and other
spending aimed at avoiding the structural adjustments many
economists advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, the government's failure to bolster economic
prospects _ by allowing the pace of structural reform to slip and
by faltering in its efforts to boost consumer confidence _ suggests
that the economic sluggishness could continue indefinitely, with
the government debt burden rising to levels inconsistent with a
triple-A rating,'' Standard &AMP; Poor's said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been troubled by the potential of an increased
discrepancy between Moody's and Standard &AMP; Poor's assessment of
Japan's ability to handle its mounting pile of debt, which
currently stands at 100 percent of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inconsistent with a triple-A rating,'' said Robert Alan
Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo,
quoting the Standard &AMP; Poor's press release. ``That is a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   While the market has long been aware of Japan's debts, a recent,
subtle campaign by the Ministry of Finance to increase awareness of
the problem with politicians and the public has raised anew
questions about whether Japan has a strategy for pulling its
economy out of its decade-long slump.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Moody's raised the possibility that it would
downgrade Japan's credit rating yet again, having lowered it in
November 1998 to Aa1, one level below its top rating. It cited
Japan's rising debt as a major reason for its review.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things Moody's was talking about was a lack of
gross philosophy, meaning how Japan intends to get its economy
moving and deal with the fiscal issues it faces,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has warned repeatedly in recent
weeks that Japan cannot continue to expect to borrow at the low
interest rates it currently enjoys. Japanese government bonds with
a duration of 10 years have traded within a range of 1.6 percent to
2 percent interest for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Ministry officials have also quietly and persistently
made the point that tax revenues are falling dramatically as
companies lay off workers in an effort to overhaul their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the ratings agencies would be too concerned if
Japan were spending money to boost structural change and promote
long-term growth,'' said Ron Bevacqua, chief economist at Commerz
Securities. ``But Japan is spending money in a way that delays the
need for structural adjustment, and in that case, the money is
wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand for 1.4 trillion yen of 10-year government bonds Tuesday
was the weakest since August of last year, even though the
government raised the coupon to 1.8 percent from 1.7 percent in the
last 10-year bond auction in January. Traders said investors were
seeking a 1.9 percent coupon, and that some investors were waiting
to invest in several private placements of municipal debt that are
coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks, which are the major buyers of bonds here, have
bought heavily in recent months and may have lost some of their
appetite for bonds as the chance of a rise in long-term interest
rates increases, threatening their existing bond holdings.

&HT;     RESEARCH SPARKS NEW THEORIES ON EARLY AMERICAN IMMIGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The long-held view that the first Americans arrived
via a land bridge from northern Asia 11,500 years ago and quickly
spread throughout the New World is giving way to mounting evidence
that migration instead came in multiple waves beginning as many as
20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Skeletal remains, new archaeological discoveries, genetic
sleuthing and language analyses are all tending to back that up,
showing the early Americas as a busy crossroads of various peoples,
according to scientists gathered here for the American Association
for the Advancement of Science meeting.
</P>
<P>
   While there was agreement about how the old view is being
discredited, scientists also acknowledged that evidence coming from
their various disciplines does not always point to identical
answers.
</P>
<P>
   One conclusion, however, was shared: ``There are at least two
major groups and they are not closely related to each other at
all,'' said C. Loring Brace, an anthropologist at the University of
Michigan who uses precise measurements of skulls to determine their
relationships to human sub-groups.
</P>
<P>
   Brace contends that American Indian populations that settled
around the U.S.-Mexico border and farther south into Latin America
were the first to arrive, and probably came from central China.
</P>
<P>
   Another group, more dominant in North America, appears to be
comprised of descendants of the Jomon people, the prehistoric
occupants of modern Japan.
</P>
<P>
   That group, Brace suspects, came down along the Pacific Coast
fewer than 20,000 years ago and a branch of them began migrating
East as the ice sheet covering much of Canada melted, creating
rivers so they could navigate inland.
</P>
<P>
   What could be another branch of the Jomon people, with some
ancestry from Mongolia, came later to what is now Alaska and are
the ancestors of the Eskimo and Aleut peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Brace has not been able to measure the controversial
Kennewick Man, a skeleton dating back about 9,300 years found in
Washington state, his first reaction when he looked at it was, ``My
goodness, that comes straight out of Jomon, Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   The most startling evidence for archaeologists is the recent
discovery of a 12,500-year-old human settlement site in southern
Chile _ 10,000 miles from where scientists had thought the first
humans crossed over, and 1,000 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   David Meltzer, professor of anthropology at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas, said archaeologists are now focusing on
potential coastal routes that could explain how they managed to get
so far south while an ice sheet covered most of Canada. But they
are faced with a problem: when the ice melted about 12,000 years
ago, sea levels rose and the coastline became submerged.
</P>
<P>
   One researcher has been able to dredge up some archaeological
remains off the Pacific Coast, Meltzer said, but they have yet to
be dated.
</P>
<P>
   Meltzer and other scientists who spoke Friday at the scientific
conference tended to discount a recent hypothesis that some
precolonial early Americans came from Europe. The idea was based on
recent work that found a genetic marker found in European people _
but not Asians _ is also present in some American Indians.]
</P>
<P>
   Meltzer and Theodore Schurr of the Southwest Foundation for
Biomedical Research said they believe the more likely explanation
is that the marker was part of an ancient genetic code that died
out in Asian populations after the first immigrants came to the New
World.
</P>
<P>
   Schurr's work in genetics tends to suggest an earlier migration,
made up of multiple waves of people, some of whom are related to
the present-day occupants of parts of East Asia and Siberia.

   Esther Dyson's ``Release 3.0'' column to be released Wednesday
notes that just as the Internet has empowered the individual, it
has also offered economies of scale to criminal elements.
</P>
<P>
   The recent denial-of-service attacks on Yahoo! and eBay are a
case in point -- the poor security of a large number of people was
used to mount an attack on a few.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson writes: ``We need to understand that electronic security
costs money, just like regular security (locks, guards, alarm
systems). Power implies responsibility; if you buy a computer that
can be used as a weapon, you need to make sure that it is designed
and installed safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she writes, ``the average computer user doesn't know
how to set up a safe system, but he needs to demand service from
someone who does.''
</P>
<P>
   She expects that in an increasingly decentralized world, the
best security solutions will evolve to match the evolving,
decentralized risks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN _ The overwhelming victory of President Mohamed Khatami's
supporters in the new Iranian parliament is already being portrayed
by the United States as a ``hopeful sign for the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington claims it is on the side of Khatami's democratic
``reformists.'' But the new Iran emerging from last week's poll is
likely to diminish rather than increase American influence in the
region as its traditional allies in the Middle East lose their fear
of Tehran's Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
   With Iraq still under almost daily bombardment by American and
British aircraft and President Saddam Hussein supposedly
``neutralized,'' Western diplomats and arms salesmen have regularly
used the Iranian ``threat'' to justify the continuing presence of
United States troops in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Gulf
emirates _ as well as the purchase by Gulf states of billions of
dollars' worth of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But if Iranian democracy now becomes a reality, these arguments
are going to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Iranian parliamentary election was primarily
domestic in content _ about free speech, the lifting of personal
restrictions and freedom of information _ President Khatami has
consistently argued that peace in the Gulf must be decided by the
Arabs and Iranians who live there, not by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview he gave shortly before his own landslide
presidential election, Mohamed Khatami said that the peoples of the
Gulf must ``join hands'' to ensure peace and security in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe,'' he insisted, ``that strangers, with their
military forces, must leave the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arabs have been quick to understand the seismic shift which
the victory of the Khatamists in Iran represents. Only last
weekend, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia formally invited Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, to pay a state visit to
Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
   And with almost all European nations now maintaining good
relations with Tehran _ Britain reopened its embassy there last May
_ Iran's isolation in the region is fast turning into America's
isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Dutch Shell and the French oil group Total have each
concluded $800 million contracts with Iran since 1995, but the
United States allows American oil companies to invest only a
maximum of $20 million in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran's major hotels are now packed with European and Asian
businessmen, but there are precious few American accents to be
heard in the corridors of the Iranian oil ministry.
</P>
<P>
   True, Syria _ traditionally Iran's only ally in the Arab world _
is intensely concerned by the implications of the elections.
President Hafez Assad was one of the first foreign visitors to
arrive in Tehran after Khatami's presidential victory, and Damascus
may well send a senior delegation again in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Iran funds much of the Hezbollah guerrilla movement which is
fighting Israeli occupation troops in the south of Lebanon, and
Hezbollah officials are themselves asking what the future holds for
their movement if the new Tehran parliament allows President
Khatami a free hand in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has hitherto represented itself as the West's channel of
communication to Iran _ this was the basis of Syria's involvement
in the release of western hostages _ but what will be its role now
that Iran is itself being invited to talk directly to its old
enemies?
</P>
<P>
   A group of Hezbollah members were discussing this very issue at
Tehran airport last week as they waited for the arrival of
colleagues from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   If America holds out the prospect of a new relationship with
Iran, offering to unfreeze Iranian assets in return for an end to
the Islamic Republic's support for the Hezbollah, they were asking
themselves, would the guerrilla battle in southern Lebanon come to
an end?
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly what the Israelis are hoping, although Syria
will be in no mood to oblige. Without Israel's continued bleeding
in Lebanon, Damascus feels that Israel will be under no pressure to
withdraw from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah's existence thus underpins Syria's demand for an
Israeli retreat _ but the victory of Iran's reformists could yet
undermine the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   However, President Khatami has always expressed his support for
the guerrillas' struggle in southern Lebanon, and recently held
warm talks with Seyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah chairman,
promising Iran's continued assistance to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   With the danger of a radical Iran removed from their frontiers,
the Gulf Arabs are also likely to ask why they should repay
Washington for its military ``protection'' by supporting a
``peace'' process that gives ever greater rewards to the Israelis
at the expense of the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one dark suspicion that haunts both Arabs and
Iranians, and it is founded on the conviction that the United
States and Israel _ despite all their publicly-expressed enthusiasm
for democracy _ will find that a truly democratic Iran has no place
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran, they have been recalling once again the era of
Mohamed Mossadeq, freely elected but swiftly overthrown in 1953 by
a coup d'etat funded by the CIA and British intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, U.S. President Bill Clinton was demanding
democracy in Iraq so that its people would be ``democratically
represented'' _ a phenomenon that does not exist in any other Arab
state, saving perhaps Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   If America really supports democracy in Iran, why not in Saudi
Arabia? Does it really want free speech in Tehran and a parliament
which will be free to reject the policies which America wishes it
to adopt?
</P>
<P>
   What if Khatami persists in giving his support to the guerrillas
who are trying to drive Israeli occupiers from their land? Will
this be the sort of democracy that will be left to thrive in the
new Iranian dawn?
</P>
<P>
   This thoughtful, intelligent president, whom so many Iranians
admire, has spoken of peace many times. And of dialogue. And of
respect.
</P>
<P>
   But he had better keep his security men on their toes. &QL;

FOR BETTER OR WORSE, CONSULTANTS KNOW WHAT THE VIEWERS LIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 12 months have passed since our last trenchant
conversation with T.V. Skreen, Ph.D., eminent television industry
consultant and image-enhancement adviser to Ken Griffey Jr. In this
latest encounter, filmed entirely on location in the chat rooms of
my mind, Dr. Skreen touches on a recent development that has
unsettled some observers of the TV scene.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: So nice to see you again, Dr. Skreen. What have you been
up to lately?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: I sold the condo in Santa Monica and moved everything to
my new alpaca ranch in Idaho. It's on the Continental Divide, just
outside this lovely village with the most musical name. Say it with
me, would you? Lee-ah-dor-ay.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: Lee-ah-dor-ay. Sounds nice. How do you spell that?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: L-E-A-D-O-R-E.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: Forgive me, Doctor, but shouldn't that be pronounced Led
Orr? You know. Led, as in Led Zeppelin. Orr, as in Bobby Orr. Get
it? Lead Ore. I think it might have been a mining town.
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Ugh. You critics are all so literal. Can't you ever
think outside the box, try to see things a little differently?
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: I do. I like to watch ``Baywatch'' and ``Baywatch
Hawaii'' with the sound off. It's easier to follow without the
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: That's not what I meant. Well, OK, maybe it is what I
meant. But you people don't seem to do it often enough.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: Hey, it's not my fault that ``Baywatch'' is on only 12
times a week. I do what I can.
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Perhaps, but you've been absolutely silent on some
cutting-edge TV that shouldn't go unnoticed by the poo-bahs of
punditry.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: Like what?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Like ``Who Wants To Marry a Multi-Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: I wouldn't exactly say it went unnoticed. The show was
on in 23 million households. It gave Fox its biggest audience in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: But you didn't say a word.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: Sometimes a critic serves best by saying nothing.
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: What kind of copout is that?
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: I'm serious. Fox executives don't need me to tell them a
show like ``Who Wants To Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' is demeaning
to women, demeaning to rich people and demeaning to an industry
that already has more black eyes than a mascara test lab. They know
it all too well, but they also know America loves to watch people
lose their dignity. Whether it's ``Jerry Springer,'' ``Cops'' or
``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' millions will tune in to watch
misfortune befall other folks so they, the viewers, can feel
superior.
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Hogwash! This is about dream fulfillment and making
people unafraid to aim high. From the moment I pitched the concept
to Fox, that was the premise.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: This was your idea?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: But even Fox seems to be backing off now. It bagged a
rebroadcast of the show last night because there are now questions
surfacing about the multimillionaire's background. Seems he may not
be the tycoon of our dreams.
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: No big deal. Once we've refined the vetting process to
weed out con-persons, contrarians and concubines, these shows will
be back, bigger than ever. Nobody will be able to resist the
sequels we've got planned, like ``Who Wants To Marry a Milliner?''
Can't you just picture 50 eligible guys vying to be the lifelong
partner of a hat designer?
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: Um, actually ...
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: The beach-wear competition should be smashing! Speedos
in prime time! And then there's ``Who Wants To Marry a Barista?''
We're combing the espresso stands of Seattle right now. My own
favorite is probably ``Who Wants To Marry a Notary Public?''
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: A notary public?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Yup. Think of all the important documents you can have
notarized without leaving the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: You're missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: And that would be ...
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: That marriage is a serious, lifelong commitment between
two people, not a one-night game show pitting tux against tulle.
Anyone who would create such a show is disturbed and should
probably be put away for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Are you suggesting I'm a few tiles short of a successful
re-entry?
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: That's one way of putting it.
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: And that I should be institutionalized?
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: Well ...
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: You may have a future in this business after all.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: What do you mean?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Your mind works just like a TV consultant's. Who do yo
think suggested that Deborah Norville spend five days in a North
Carolina jail for ``Inside Edition''?
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: That was you?
</P>
<P>
   SKREEN: Bingo. Sometimes you have to go inside the box to get
outside the box.
</P>
<P>
   TV GUY: I see. Oh, God. Help me.

UNDATED: Smiley's turn. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   7. ``The Borderland'' by Edwin ``Bud'' Shrake (April, Hyperion).
The plot: Veteran Texas writer pens novel of early Texas. The buzz:
Shrake's always been a good writer; maybe this one will establish
him nationally. The prediction: maybe, in any other year. But in
2000, Stephen Harrigan's the Lone Star novelist who gets rich and
famous.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``The Book of Honor'' by Ted Gup (May, Doubleday). The
subject: Investigative journalist reveals the secrets of the CIA.
The buzz: It's going to be controversial, which usually translates
into sales. The prediction: lots of media coverage, but most
readers will yawn.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Omerta'' by Mario Puzo (May, Random House). The subject:
The late author had one last Mafia yarn to spin. The buzz: Maybe
fans of ``The Godfather'' still buy books. The prediction: No, they
don't.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Gone for Soldiers'' by Jeff Shaara (May, Ballantine). The
subject: More war fiction, this time pre-Civil War as the United
States takes on Mexico. The buzz: Shaara is a worthy successor to
father Michael, whose ``The Killer Angels'' launched this series.
The prediction: solid sales, but nothing spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   11. ``The Human Stain'' by Philip Roth (May, Houghton Mifflin).
The subject: A classics professor is forced to resign when he is
accused of racism. The buzz: Roth wants another Pulitzer for
fiction. The prediction: He stands a good chance of getting it.
</P>
<P>
   12. ``Day of the Bees'' by Thomas Sanchez (May, Knopf). The
subject: Details of a 50-year-old love affair stagger a scholar.
The buzz: Sanchez proves again he's one of our most talented
novelists. The prediction: Sanchez remains a critic's darling whose
books just don't sell much.
</P>
<P>
   13. ``The River King'' by Alice Hoffman (June, Putnam). The
subject: Small-town turmoil in Massachusetts. The buzz: Hoffman is
such a fine novelist that this time she'll sell a million copies.
The prediction: Kudos to Putnam for giving Hoffman time to ``grow''
a wider readership; ``The River King'' ought to be her breakout
book.
</P>
<P>
   14. ``Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit'' by Garry Wills (June,
Doubleday). The subject: Popes aren't saints, at least in the
author's opinion. The buzz: Had Wills written a similar book about
the the Ayatollah, he'd have been sentenced to death a la Salman
Rushdie. The prediction: a bestseller, and the most discussed
nonfiction of the year.
</P>
<P>
   15. ``In a Sunburned Country'' by Bill Bryson (June, Broadway).
The subject: Acerbic world traveler finds new annoyances in
Australia. The buzz: Bryson is gradually winning the travel book
audience from Paul Theroux. The prediction: another bestseller.
Bryson may be the funniest author currently at work.
</P>
<P>
   16. ``Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament'' by J.K.
Rowling (July, Levine/Scholastic). The subject: Everybody's
favorite wizard-in-training tries to lead his team to victory in an
oddball sport. The buzz: All three of Rowling's previous ``Harry''
titles remain bestsellers. Love the series or hate it, but don't
deny its sales dominance. The prediction: Harrymania continues.
</P>
<P>
   17. ``The Last Precinct'' by Patricia Cornwell (July, Putnam).
The subject: Kay Scarpetta and the usual cast get involved in
murders present and past _ in Jamestown, of all places. The buzz:
Readers can't get enough of Scarpetta's morbid adventures. The
prediction: no end in sight for Cornwell's popularity and
megasales.
</P>
<P>
   18. ``Hot Six'' by Janet Evanovich (July, St. Martin's). The
plot: No specifics from the publisher as yet, but we can be certain
diminutive bounty hunter Stephanie Plum will be bumbling her way
through another slapstick case. The buzz: Evanovich has made it to
the top sales tier. The prediction: bestseller. Readers love
Evanovich's breezy style.
</P>
<P>
   19. ``The Bear and the Dragon'' by Tom Clancy (August, Putnam).
The subject: President Jack Ryan battles liberals and foreign foes
to save America from disaster. The buzz: Clancy's Ryan backlist
isn't selling ``quite'' as briskly. It's being whispered that even
his staunchest fans may be sick of 700-page tomes that could be
edited to a brisker 400 pages. The prediction: another No. 1
bestseller, but its stay atop the list will be brief.
</P>
<P>
   20. ``Robert Kennedy: His Life'' by Evan Thomas (September,
Simon &AMP; Schuster). The subject: The first full-blown biography of
RFK since the '70s. The buzz: It's good, it's really good.
Prediction: short-listed for a Pulitzer.

CLOSING ARGUMENTS UNDERSCORE GAP BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY and STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In its closing argument in the Microsoft trial, the
government said Tuesday that it is ``simply impossible to imagine''
that the company will not be found to have violated the nation's
antitrust laws, based on the mountains of courtroom evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft Corp.,
antitrust experts say, were playing a stong hand after Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson issued findings of fact last November that
supported the government's version of the case in nearly every
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jackson has not yet issued his conclusions of law, which are
expected sometime in the next few months. Tuesday's presentations
were the final attempt by both sides to try to influence Jackson's
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement talks, mediated by Richard Posner, chief judge of the
federal appeals court in Chicago, are continuing, but the two sides
remain divided. Tuesday's courtroom statements _ uncompromising
attacks from each side _ only seemed to underline the gap between
the government and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial
lawyer, said Microsoft's business strategy was based on trying to
``bribe and coerce'' other companies in the computer industry. His
counterpart, John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, dismissed one of
Boies' arguments as ``entirely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, according to most antitrust experts, is sitting
on a big lead, while Microsoft is trying to limit its losses in
Jackson's court and planning to fare better on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In its courtroom presentation Tuesday, Microsoft seemed to have
elements of a loss-limitation strategy. Warden began by saying that
Microsoft ``respectfully disagreed'' with a large part of the
judge's findings of fact. He then went on to tell Jackson that his
ruling might well shape the ground rules for competition in the
high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft case, Warden noted, focuses on the company's
``fights with competitors in a highly competitive, fast-moving
industry.'' And antitrust doctrine, he observed, encourages
competition even when that rough-and-tumble competition hurts a
company's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law should not be rewritten to prevent Microsoft, or any
other company, from competing aggressively,'' Warden said.
</P>
<P>
   In the government's view, Microsoft is trying to change the
subject with such arguments. Fierce competition is one thing, the
government says, but the voluminous record including volumes of
e-mail, internal Microsoft documents and witness testimony show
Microsoft to have been an arm-twisting monopolist, whose corporate
behavior stifled competition and harmed consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Boies opened his remarks by stressing that the Supreme Court has
long recognized that antitrust cases are ``especially fact-based
cases.'' And throughout his presentation, he repeatedly made
reference to the judge's findings of fact, which sided so
emphatically with the government, using phrases like ``the court
has found,'' ``the evidence shows'' and ``Microsoft's own witnesses
and documents show.''
</P>
<P>
   And what that evidence showed, said Kevin O'Connor, an assistant
attorney general for Wisconsin, who represented the states, was
that ``Microsoft has used virtually every tool of the monopolist's
trade _ attempted collusion, exclusionary contracts, tying,
predation _ in a coordinated scheme to eliminate threats to its
monopoly.''

   NEW YORK _ Pasta with cauliflower may sound mundane, but it has
a lot going for it: the texture is rich and intriguing, soft little
bits of garlic and cauliflower get tangled in the pasta, and a
somewhat unusual cooking technique deepens and intensifies the
flavors. When I'm desperate to get something quick, healthy and
satisfying on the table, this is the dish I most often turn to.
</P>
<P>
   You begin by boiling cauliflower in a big pot of water until it
is nearly done; then you use the same water to cook the pasta until
it, too, is nearly done. The cauliflower and pasta finish cooking
in a quick saute with extra virgin olive oil, garlic, bread crumbs
and some reserved cooking water.
</P>
<P>
   The pasta and vegetables glaze and even brown slightly in the
oil while absorbing a bit more of the flavorful liquid, which
creates a light sauce.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be simpler. But be careful with the garlic: it
should not brown in the oil but just begin to color (to ``blond,''
as the Italians say). And in the first round of cooking, be sure
both to remove the cauliflower and to drain the pasta well short of
doneness. You don't want either to become mushy.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of preparation is popular in the south of Italy. It is
highly economical, but more to the point, it is delicious and
satisfying, though lean rather than rich.
</P>
<P>
   It's also easy to vary. For the cauliflower, you can substitute
broccoli, rape or even kale or collards. When you're simmering the
garlic, you can add anchovies, capers, pine nuts or dried red
pepper flakes _ some or all of them. You can toss crumbled cooked
sausage meat or chopped shrimp into the garlic mixture along with
the bread crumbs. Or you can garnish with chopped parsley, basil or
grated Parmesan.
</P>
<P>
   But all of these embellishments are unnecessary, because the
basic marriage is such a good one.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PASTA WITH CAULIFLOWER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 40 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 head cauliflower, about 1 pound
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   \ cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound penne, fusilli or other cut pasta &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup coarse bread crumbs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Trim the cauliflower,
and divide it into florets. Add about a tablespoon of salt to the
water, and boil the cauliflower in it until it is tender but not
mushy. Using a slotted spoon or strainer, remove the cauliflower
and set it aside. When it is cool enough to handle, chop it roughly
into small pieces.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, in a large deep skillet over medium-low heat,
saute garlic in olive oil, stirring occasionally, until garlic is
golden. Start cooking pasta in same pot and same water as was used
for the cauliflower.
</P>
<P>
   3. When the garlic is ready, add the cauliflower and bread
crumbs to skillet, and turn heat to medium. Cook, stirring
occasionally. When pasta is just about done _ it should be two or
three minutes short of the way you like it _ drain it, reserving
about a cup of cooking liquid.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add pasta to skillet containing the cauliflower, and toss
with a large spoon until they are well combined. Add salt and
pepper to taste, along with just enough pasta water to keep the
mixture moist but not soupy. When the mixture is hot and the pasta
is tender and nicely glazed, serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 3 or 4 servings. &QL;

ZINFANDELS PLAY THE CLOWN

   NEW YORK _ Everybody knows that wine is a serious, dignified
business. The fear of using the wrong word or the wrong glass or
even of liking the wrong wine has stifled the pleasure of more than
a few would-be wine lovers. Words like funny, silly, informal and
relaxed do not come to mind in a world of Chateau Grand Mal de
Tete, right?
</P>
<P>
   Yet, more than a few California wine producers have been joking
around with their wines for years, coming up with names and labels
that, if not exactly funny, are at least silly and occasionally
even ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   The comic turn is mostly applied to zinfandels. Robert Sin-skey
Vineyards of Napa Valley, for example, refrains from yuk-king it up
with its chardonnays, merlots and pinot noirs, but its zinfandel is
another matter.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``The Adventures of Zin-skey,'' and offers up the
winemaker as pulp superhero: ``Commander Zinskey must find and save
the exploited zinfandel vines before the White Zin Supremacists
subvert the world!''
</P>
<P>
   Commander Zinskey stands tall among his fellow zinfandel
infidels, including Cardinal Zin from Bonny Doon Vineyards, whose
owner, Randall Grahm, is an inveterate punster; Zebra Zin from
Harrison Winery; Grandmere Zin from Renwood; Gnarly Vine from Louis
M. Martini; and Mother Clone from Pedroncelli.
</P>
<P>
   Why zinfandel as an object of jest? Maybe it's the letter ``z,''
which seems inherently comical, or maybe it's the fact that
zinfandel is produced only in the United States, permitting
winemakers to behave subversively, making up for a perhaps overly
respectful attitude toward European wines like cabernet sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the silly names, the wines themselves are serious,
well-made and surprisingly good. Most cost $20 to $30, but the
nonvintage Barefoot Zin at $7 easily holds its own with the more
expensive bottles. These six bottles are listed in order of
preference. &QL;

 &HT;     McCAIN'S TONGUE GOT HIM IN TROUBLE BEFORE `GOOKS' REMARK  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Long before he unapologetically used the word
``gooks'' to describe his Vietnamese torturers, Sen. John McCain
had uttered several eyebrow-raising phrases.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the senior senator from Arizona who is seeking the
Republican presidential nomination, was a veteran Navy pilot who
was shot down and held captive during the Vietnam war. He also is
know for these remarks:
</P>
<P>
   _ When he first ran for Congress in the early 1980s, he referred
to the Leisure World community for senior citizens as ``Seizure
World.''
</P>
<P>
   _ He once said the nice thing about getting Alzheimer's disease
``is that you get to hide your own Easter eggs.'' Last year, he
said his party was about as popular as Jeffrey Dahmer, the
cannibalistic mass murderer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last summer in Washington, he asked fellow Republicans at a
fund-raiser if they knew why Chelsea Clinton was so ugly. ``Because
Janet Reno is her father,'' McCain said, referring to Attorney
General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   McCain certainly isn't the first politician to utter a mistake
of the mouth. But analysts say a pattern of off-color remarks may
cause voters to question a candidate's judgment and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all make mistakes and if we were judged by every single
slight, we'd all be in trouble. But what you look for is a pattern
of behavior,'' said Michael Genovese, an author on the presidency
and a professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ``He
is often indelicate in his language and it goes beyond political
correctness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the race) is a character test, then verbal references have
to become an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of McCain's remarks, including his reference to ``gooks''
nearly five months ago, had been widely reported in the mainstream
media. But last week, when McCain defended his use of the ethnic
slur to the large campaign press corps covering the South Carolina
primary, the issue hit the front pages.
</P>
<P>
   Republican analyst Tony Quinn of Sacramento, who served in
Vietnam, said that the word ``gooks'' has always been an
unmistakable ethnic slur and McCain's use of it may offend more
people in California, with its growing Asian population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was perfectly clear that the phrase was used by GIs to
refer to all Vietnamese. It applies not just to bad guys and
communists but it's generic and derogatory. When he comes to
California, he's going to have to be a lot more sensitive to
that,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Although unapologetic for his use of the word, McCain said he
was describing his captors during five years of imprisonment.
McCain spokesman Dan Schnur said the senator would no longer use
the word.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``it's beyond the pale,'' said Elaine Kim, a professor of
Asian-American studies at the University of California at Berkeley.
``To be mean-spirited and express misogynistic and racist views and
then people say, `Oh, the poor guy, don't take it too seriously.'
It's very low class and crummy. He stands for the dominant theory
that people in power can say whatever they feel like.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said that much of McCain's appeal is his willingness to
be candid and not to work from a script. ``Most voters would prefer
a candidate like John McCain who talks straight to them even if he
sometimes offends them,'' Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara O'Connor, a communications professor at California State
University in Sacramento, said ``the average person'' would not
hold the ``gooks'' remark against the senator. ``He's an
iconoclast, and he's quick at labeling; he's lively, but I think
that's what people like about him.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Conner said voter should delve more into McCain's record on
Vietnam, which has shown him to be at the forefront of normalizing
relations with the former enemy. But if McCain's main opponent for
the Republican nomination, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, makes it a
larger issue, she said, the context might be overshadowed by the
more immediate blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Margita Thompson said the issue hasn't been
raised in the Bush camp. But she gave McCain a slight jab, saying,
``We're focused on bringing people under the tent and not using
language that leaves them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnur defended McCain's past off-color remarks as joking and
said the senator uses the Alzheimer's remark on himself when he
forgets a point he wanted to make. And Schnur said McCain
apologized profusely for the Chelsea Clinton joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apology unaccepted,'' said Helen Grieco, president of the
California National Organization for Women.
</P>
<P>
   Grieco said calling Vietnamese ``gooks,'' then bragging about
normalizing relations is ``talking out of two sides of his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't support issues and have a `slip of the tongue' and
degrade people you purport to respect. This questions his
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is not alone among politicians:
</P>
<P>
   _ Jesse Jackson, a Democratic presidential hopeful, was roundly
denounced in 1984 for his use of the word ``hymies'' to describe
Jews in a private conversation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ronald Reagan was famous for telling off-color jokes as
California governor, and it never touched him. ``It was like,
`There goes ol Uncle Ron again,'' Genovese said.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1988, George Bush referred to his own Hispanic
grandchildren as ``the little brown ones.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz in 1976 resigned after saying
a black man was uninterested in the political process as long as he
had ``good sex, loose shoes and a warm place to s---.'' Butz said
the remark ``in no way reflects my real attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether McCain's language becomes an issue with voters is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Zia of Oakland, Calif., the author of a book on
Asian-Americans, said McCain's joke about Chelsea Clinton was
unpresidential and cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Zia said it could hurt the Arizona senator among women
voters, who made up 41 percent of his votes in his remarkable New
Hampshire primary victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he seems to not care about civility or courtesy and
respect for what his constituents might feel, then you have to
start wondering,'' she said.

CLINTON ORDERS HOSPITALS TO TAKE STEPS TO REDUCE MEDICAL ERRORS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday ordered all hospitals
in the United States to take steps to reduce medical errors that
kill tens of thousands of people each year and said he supports
mandatory reporting of all such errors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called for a nationwide system of reporting medical
errors, somewhat like the system used by airlines to report
aviation safety hazards. Rather than imposing a federal requirement
now, he is pressuring the states to adopt reporting requirements
within three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that if we do the right things, we can dramatically
reduce the time when the wrong drug is dispensed, a blood
transfusion is mismatched, or a surgery goes awry,'' Clinton said.
``I'm not here to find fault, I'm here to find answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association and the American Hospital
Association have vehemently opposed mandatory reporting of errors,
saying it could expose doctors and hospitals to more lawsuits. If
doctors and hospital employees fear being sued, they said, they
will be reluctant to discuss the lessons that could be learned from
their mistakes. Even Clinton's own advisers had suggested that the
administration move cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton endorsed virtually all the recommendations made
three months ago by the National Academy of Sciences in a report on
medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton endorsed the academy's goal of reducing medical mistakes
by 50 percent over five years. He also asked Congress for $20
million to create a Center for Quality Improvement and Patient
Safety, as part of the federal Agency for Health Care Research and
Quality, in the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to reporting, we want the federal government to
lead by example,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the president's recommendations require
congressional approval, he already has ample authority under
existing laws to require other steps.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the federal government is developing a regulation
to require more than 6,000 hospitals that participate in Medicare
to have programs to reduce medical errors. Under the regulation, to
be published this year, hospitals would, in most cases, have to
establish automated systems for ordering prescription drugs, to
avoid the mistakes caused by a doctor's bad handwriting or by
confusion over telephone orders.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals must meet federal standards as a condition of getting
Medicare money, which accounts for about 40 percent of hospital
revenue, on the average. Using this lever, the federal government
sets detailed standards covering every aspect of hospital activity,
from sanitation to fire safety to infection control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposals, or something similar, seem likely to become
reality for four reasons. The issue has great appeal to consumers,
and this is an election year. The government already has the power
to do much of what Clinton wants. Congress is eager to take action.
And lawmakers have a convenient vehicle, the ``patient's bill of
rights,'' now pending before a conference committee of House and
Senate negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The president asked the Food and Drug Administration to develop
new standards to prevent errors caused by drug names that sound
alike and packages that look alike. In addition, new labeling
standards will require drug makers to highlight dangerous drug
interactions and common dosage errors. ``No more handwritten
prescriptions that no one can read,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is also developing a system to allow doctors, nurses and
pharmacists to report medication errors online.
</P>
<P>
   All 500 military hospitals and clinics and more than 3,000 blood
banks will have to report serious errors under the president's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the most controversial element of the president's plan is
his support for mandatory reporting to the states of all medical
errors that cause serious injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals reporting errors would be publicly identified. The
names of doctors, nurses and patients would be kept confidential.
But doctors and hospitals said that such details could often be
inferred, and that even the public reports could be used to
strengthen the hand of plaintiffs' lawyers in malpractice lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president, like the National Academy of
Sciences, called for voluntary reporting of less serious errors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The White House obviously struggled to find the right balance
between mandatory and voluntary reporting, between secrecy and
disclosure. In interviews last month, federal health officials said
that they were unwilling to embrace the academy's call for a new
federal law requiring hospitals to report all mistakes that cause
serious injury or death. Despite such concerns, Clinton decided to
support mandatory reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced three basic conclusions on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   1. Patients should have access to information about
``preventable medical errors'' that cause serious injuries. If a
person dies because of such a mistake, the patient's relatives
should be able to get information about the error.
</P>
<P>
   2. Congress should pass legislation to prevent patients and
their lawyers from gaining access to a hospital's analysis and
investigation of the causes of medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   3. Patients should not lose any of the rights they now have to
sue doctors and hospitals for malpractice or negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said: ``These actions will significantly reduce the
likelihood of lawsuits and concerns about liability. We will avoid
errors and problems that might be subject to litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview on Monday, Dr. Nancy W. Dickey, former
president of the American Medical Association, said: ``We are
opposed to mandatory reporting. It may well drive underground the
very information you need to improve safety. A number of states
have mandatory reporting, and there's no evidence that they have
greater safety or fewer errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Davidson, president of the American Hospital
Association, said his group had been invited to the White House
event, but would not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had an agreement to work with the White House in
a public-private partnership, but there has been little or no
consultation,'' Davidson said. ``That's a serious disappointment.
The idea that a mandatory reporting system is going to change
behavior is naive at best. You need to focus on making a cultural
change in hospitals, to promote open discussion of errors, and
that's not possible if some plaintiff's attorney is climbing on
your back.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that several states already required
hospitals to report certain kinds of mistakes and ``adverse
events.'' However, in many states, the number of reports is
relatively small, because doctors and hospitals fear the data will
be used in lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's goal is to ensure that ``all 50 states have mandatory
reporting systems'' within three years, the White House said. If
that does not happen, federal health officials will offer further
recommendations on what should be done to achieve the goal. And if
research shows that mandatory reporting does not enhance patient
safety, the White House said, federal officials will reconsider
their recommendations.
</P>

<P>
   Dickey said: ``The president has the cart before the horse. He'd
put in place mandatory reporting, then study it and do something
different if it doesn't improve patient safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The report from the National Academy of Sciences last November
touched off a flurry of activity on Capitol Hill. Members of
Congress from both parties _ led by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. _ have
held a half-dozen hearings and drafted several bills to reduce
medical errors. Lawmakers say that passage of legislation this year
appears likely.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the academy's Institute of Medicine said that
medical errors caused 44,000 to 98,000 deaths a year _ more than
the number resulting from auto accidents, breast cancer or AIDS,
and far more than the numbers killed or injured in plane crashes
each year. More than 7,000 Americans die each year as a result of
``medication errors,'' the academy said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's initiative leaves some important questions
unanswered: What is the definition of a serious medical error? What
is the federal role in the proposed new reporting system? Will
states get additional money to catalog and analyze reports of
errors?

`THE COMING ANARCHY': DASHING HOPES OF GLOBAL HARMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review) 
(jt) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How long do eras last? To the people of the Tang dynasty in
China during the eighth century or those of the Ottoman Empire a
millennium later and probably to most Americans today, they might
seem to last forever. They don't, of course, or at least they
haven't. Yet it is difficult to imagine how, for example, the
stable, prosperous and powerful United States might turn into
something very different from what it is today. Might it defy the
historical rule and last forever?
</P>
<P>
   That is not exactly the question that Robert D. Kaplan addresses
in ``The Coming Anarchy,'' his analytically daring collection of
essays on the face of global things to come, but it lurks
nonetheless. Kaplan, a frequent commentator on foreign affairs and
the author of ``Balkan Ghosts'' and ``The Ends of the Earth,''
seeks to create ``an unrelenting record of uncomfortable truths, of
the kind that many of us implicitly acknowledge but will not
publicly accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among these ``uncomfortable truths'' is that a new kind of
global anarchy instigated by poverty, swelling populations and a
culture of militarized gangsterism and transnational corporations
is taking shape under our very noses. It is likely to change
forever the world of stable nation-states with stable borders that
most of us have come to see as pretty much permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan is a knowledgeable and forceful polemicist who mixes the
attributes of journalist and visionary. These terse, confident
essays (most of which have been published previously in magazines)
are often conceptually brilliant even if they are too fragmentary
and diverse to add up to a fully formulated defense of the author's
main postulate. Tossed into the mix, for example, is an essay on
Henry A. Kissinger's 1957 book on the Austrian diplomat Metternich
and another on Joseph Conrad's literary depiction of the third
world. While very worthwhile in themselves, the essays glance
tangentially on Kaplan's central theme. He ends with a bravura,
counterintuitive chapter called ``The Dangers of Peace,'' which
argues that a little bit of anarchy is a very good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there one wants to argue. Kaplan's title essay focuses
on the deterioration of life in West Africa and South Asia, where
pressure on land and resources, environmental degradation and the
availability of rootless young men to serve in private armies will
lead to a ``withering away of central governments, the rise of
tribal and regional domains, the unchecked spread of disease and
the growing pervasiveness of war.''
</P>
<P>
   This will affect the United States in many ways, he says, not
least because its government may feel obligated to police the
coming anarchy. The collapse of West Africa will also intensify
racial stereotypes in the United States, he argues, and increase
domestic political conflict. More generally, other forces will
``make the United States less of a nation than it is today,''
Kaplan says.
</P>
<P>
   Canada will eventually dissolve, he predicts, and the United
States will pick up some of its territory. Meanwhile, he asserts,
``many future regimes, ours especially, could resemble the
oligarchies of ancient Athens and Sparta more than they do the
current government in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Assertions like that are so sweepingly speculative that they are
both irrefutable and unprovable. The dire conclusion about coming
anarchy seems overdrawn. West African states may indeed face ``an
anarchic implosion of criminal violence,'' but it does not
necessarily follow that West Africa will prove a paradigm for
``most of the rest of the world'' or that its collapse would
profoundly shake the foundations of European and American
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ome of Kaplan's remarks are infused with such pleasure at the
force of his ideas that they acquire lives of their own. The notion
that ``the recently expanded NATO'' is ``a variation of the Western
Holy Roman Empire,'' illustrating how the world is ``awash in
dangerous new alliances,'' is one example. What new alliances
Kaplan does not exactly specify, though he does talk in other
essays of a looming clash of civilizations identified in 1993 by
Samuel Huntington, a political scientist at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kaplan's bold assertions do concentrate the mind. ``The
Coming Anarchy'' is informed by a rock-solid, unwavering realism
and an utter absence of sentimentality. One essay, ``Was Democracy
Just a Moment?,'' which enumerates the problems of a foreign policy
shaped by a yearning to spread American values, is a model of
clearheadedness.
</P>
<P>
   The book also conveys a historically informed tragic sense in
recognizing humankind's tendency toward a kind of slipshod, gooey,
utopian and ultimately dangerous optimism. This is most on display
in the final essay, on the dangers of peace. Several themes are
blended here, but Kaplan mainly warns against the rhapsodic notion
that we may one day live in a conflict-free world benignly governed
by some supranational U.N.-like body. This, he eloquently argues,
would not be the happy future so many envision but a dark one. A
society whose overriding goal is peace is a society unaware that it
must fight and make sacrifices for some principles and interests,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avoiding tragedy requires a sense of it,'' Kaplan writes. ``In
an era of extended domestic peace, those who deliver up pleasures
are the power brokers. Because pleasure is inseparable from
convenience, convenience becomes the vital element in society.''
</P>
<P>
   I cannot imagine a more succinct identification of the
underlying cause of so many broader cultural trends of American
life, from the substitution of documentary-style entertainment for
the broadcast news, to the high-altitude strategy of NATO's war in
Kosovo, to the loss of historical memory. ``Permanent peace, with
its worship of entertainment and convenience, will produce ever
shallower leaders,'' Kaplan contends. It is a disturbing thought,
like many of his thoughts, and it just might be true.

MORE MEALS THESE DAYS ARE BEING ACCOMPANIED BY COCKTAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So many wine snobs, so little patience. That's why
one of my favorite drinking buddies is Al Hirschfeld, the
96-year-old artist, who can't be bothered with sermons on grassy
undertones. He's a Jack Daniel's man. And when we go out together,
he prefers to keep drinking it past cocktails and through the meal,
which, by the way, he prefers to be steak.
</P>
<P>
   I love a guy who breaks the rules, almost as much as I love
breaking them myself. Because my dirty little secret is, I'm
drinking right along with him _ Maker's Mark bourbon. And while I'm
not as enamored of steak, I am enamored of sitting down to dinner
after a hard day's work and doing exactly as I please, which some
nights means having a drink. And another.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I would ever do so at a place like Montrachet, where
the food is perfectly paired with the wine. That would be
foolishness. But like many New Yorkers who dine out frequently
during the week, sometimes the last thing I have energy for is a
correct dinner with wine. Sticking with a cocktail constitutes a
break, a vacation from the conventions of dining. A few Maker's
Marks and a meatloaf sandwich at Joe Allen is my equivalent of
Linus' blanket. On those nights, it beats foie gras and Sauternes
every time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, admitting this in today's superserious world of food
and wine is nothing short of treason. And doing it as a woman has a
double whammy attached: Slugging booze instead of sipping wine has
always been barmaid behavior, pure and simple. At least Hirschfeld
has an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got used to drinking hard liquor during Prohibition,'' he
says. ``There were Virginia Dare stores, very popular in the city,
where you could buy an essence of gin, vodka, Scotch or bourbon,
then go to the drugstore with a prescription from the doctor for
alcohol. You poured the essence into it. The other kind of alcohol
was wood alcohol, which blinded you. Virginia Dare sold wine
essence too, but that was a more complicated process.''
</P>
<P>
   While I certainly can't plead Prohibition, as it happens, I have
increasingly more company in my wicked, wicked ways. As highly
spiced fusion and pan-Latino cuisines become more popular, spirits
are finally staying up past the cocktail hour and sitting down to
dinner. It only makes sense, really, that as traditions about food
bend and break, drink would follow. In polite society, it used to
be the mark of a heathen to sit at table with a cocktail, even
though that heathen had been a gentleman a scant half-hour earlier
in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drinking vodka or gin through the meal was the sign of a real
drunk,'' says Letitia Baldrige, the etiquette expert, who was
Jacqueline Kennedy's social secretary at the White House. ``It was
very frowned upon. Cocktails kill the taste of the food. You cannot
enjoy the subtleties of good food if you are deadening your tongue
while eating it.'' She sighed heartily. ``This is a new
affectation. That must be New York. Quelle horreur.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale DeGroff doesn't think so. The bartender extraordinaire,
late of the Rainbow Room and Blackbird, now consulting to Windows
on the World, introduced cocktail dinners at the Rainbow Room in
1994, matching a juniper-roasted venison chop and black olive
mashed potatoes with a Blood and Sand cocktail made of J&AMP;B Select
Scotch, Cherry Heering, sweet vermouth and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you see spice, the more you see spirits,'' he says.
``It's a coming thing. The rules are breaking down a little bit.
Thai, Chinese, Mexican, Ethiopian and Latin American food all go
well with spirits. In Mexico, tequila is a table beverage; in
Russia, vodka is a table beverage. They are meant to be paired with
food, in little tiny shots. In this country you're seeing it more
and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Immer, the corporate director of beverage programs for
Starwood Hotels, agrees. ``Pan-Latino is taking off, and that food
has a vibrant cocktail culture attached, with caipirinhas and
mojitos,'' she says. ``With Mexican food, people have been
automatically programmed to cocktails _ margaritas and daiquiris.
Where restaurants have really fused Asian foods, they've found that
cocktails are automatic connectors. The big thing with Generation X
has been sake martinis, which are lighter than traditional
martinis, with less alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually easier for a restaurant to pull off cocktails
than an interesting program of wines by the glass,'' she goes on.
``Thai or Chinese cuisine needs something like a Gewuerztraminer,
and the average person doesn't relate to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sticking with cocktails is also a way to keep the party going
through the night. And if the partyers are older than 25, there is
a nod to hangover prevention by avoiding the mix of liquor with
wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a second martini, you're inclined to have red
wine, then you're inclined to Cognac, then you're inclined to
morning pain,'' says Clark Wolf, a food and restaurant consultant
based in Manhattan. ``I'm a firm believer in drinking Scotch
through the meal, as long as you choose food that goes well with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He considers these to be smoked salmon, steak, hamburgers and
wild mushrooms. As for drinking martinis through the meal, Wolf
says gin martinis are too complex to mix well with food, but vodka
martinis ``with vestigial vermouth'' go well with light fish like
sole. With steak, he says, vodka martinis taste better with a bit
more vermouth and ``dirty olives,'' meaning a bit of the brine is
added to the drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to diminish the great pleasures of a meal with
wine,'' he continues, ``but we all eat out so often, we don't want
an epiphany five nights in a row. Look at people's faces when they
receive a cocktail. It's like the Yanks have landed.''

   At some places, like Lot 61, which is part restaurant, part
club, 61 is the number of flavors the martinis come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love to sip martinis with dinner,'' says its owner, Amy
Sacco. ``I've even seen people having vanilla martinis with their
dinner. A great wine really embraces a meal, more so than a
martini. But to each his own. What I always say is anytime is a
good time for one if you feel like it _ with lunch, through dinner;
there are no rules. In fashion and art and family life, the molds
have all been broken. Look at fusion cooking.''

   She gets no argument from Drew Nieporent, an owner of the Myriad
Restaurant Group, which includes Layla, the Middle Eastern
restaurant with belly-dancing floor shows, and Icon, at the W Court
Hotel. ``At Layla, liquor sales have skyrocketed since we started a
pomegranate margarita,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are other considerations, too, when it comes to sticking
with cocktails. Though no one would be quoted about it, there was a
consensus that the Wall Streeters with new money would rather play
it safe with mixed drinks than risk the humiliation of ordering the
wrong bottle of wine. And many women, myself included, prefer to
skip the experience of ordering wine by the bottle when a man is
not at the table; more often than not, the condescension of the
server still leaves a rotten taste. Cocktails make the evening
easier. And, I must say, I have never encountered a raised eyebrow
from a server by ordering cocktails in place of wine; no one is a
snob when the tip escalates with each additional drink.
</P>
<P>
   On the home entertaining front, Marian McEvoy, the editor of
Elle Decor, says she has noticed a marked decline in her male
guests' consumption of wine with dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``More men have been going through the meal with their Scotch
and soda or vodka,'' she says. ``Maybe they never did like wine,
and they've decided they're not going to pretend anymore to know
about it or to like it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McEvoy, who lived in Paris for 15 years, says the furthest the
French might go in deviating from wine with dinner is to start with
Champagne, then carry it through, a practice she does not follow.
``That's how to turn off a table of men,'' she says. ``Serve
Champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   You actually can order Champagne at Charlie Trotter's, the
celebrated restaurant in Chicago, but no mixed drinks of any kind.
``We don't have spirits in the house,'' said the reservationist who
answered the phone. ``They don't go with the food. And we've spent
a lot of money on our wine program, so we concentrate on that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in New York, thankfully, is nearly that rigid, though
more than a few restaurateurs bristled when I asked if they've
noticed an increase in cocktail drinking through dinner. They
seemed to perceive the question as an insult to their winehood.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Snyder, the restaurant manager at the ``21'' Club,
lectured me on his extensive cellar, and Michael Cetta, the owner
of Sparks Steakhouse, which has one of the most impressive wine
lists in the city, protested: ``Drinking martinis during dinner?
That's uncivilized.'' Julian Niccolini, an owner of the Four
Seasons restaurant, says he has noticed an increase in hard liquor
sales before dinner, but is selling more red wine tableside than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, cocktail dinners, whether comfort inspired, fusion
inspired or gourmet inspired, go forward, like them or not.
Wednesday night, for instance, the authors Gary Regan and Mardee
Haidin Regan, whose four books include ``The Book of Bourbon''
(Chapters) and ``The Martini Companion'' (Running Press), are
teaming up for one with Donna Hammond, the chef at Painter's Tavern
in Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y. They are beginning with a martini circa
1900, Regan says, which means ``50-50 vermouth and gin.''

   Though my husband the martini purist winced when I told him
this, the idea of it didn't bother me much. I never drink martinis
_ to me they smell like the doctor's office right before you get a
shot. And Regan was philosophical.

<P>
   ``It's not a martini as we would recognize it today,'' he said,
``but out of context as another drink, it works well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With it, as an appetizer, we're having tapenade,'' he added,
``because what goes better with a martini than olives?''

TENSIONS LINGER IN MITROVICA ON DAY AFTER MASSIVE DEMONSTRATION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Ethnic Serbs living on the
north side of this divided city were edgy Tuesday, a day after the
massive show of force by thousands of Albanian protesters. The city
was calm, slumped in a ``morning-after'' state, with mud and debris
on the streets the only sign left of the disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of young Serb men gathered by the main bridge that
connects the Serb north and Albanian southern district, and
suddenly erupted and attacked a German armored vehicle, pelting it
with stones as it swung by them in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small incident, over as quickly as it blew up, but a
sign of the anxieties and aggression that lie very near the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Serbs had gathered Monday to defend their district
on the north side of the bridge, as tens of thousands of Albanians
streamed into Mitrovica from all over the country. ``We were
worried, because of the huge number of Albanians and of course we
did not expect anything good of it,'' said Oliver Ivanovic, the
self-styled leader of the Serb community in Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting violence, they had evacuated some women and children
and had organized their own protest of 800 people by the bridge and
2,000 more further up the main street, he said. ``It was a clear
intention to show us they have a big number of people and that they
will one day come over the bridge,'' Ivanovic said. ``It was also a
message for us that we are not welcome here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although peacekeeping commanders were congratulating their
soldiers for containing the demonstration and preventing clashes
between the two ethnic communities, the Serbs complained that the
huge demonstration right on the bridge only proved that the
peacekeepers were doing little to protect the Serb community.
</P>
<P>
   With only some 10,000 Serbs on the north side of the city and
some 90,000 Albanians living on the south of the river, the sheer
demographics explain their fears. There are some 100,000 Serbs left
in Kosovo, more than half of them in the north around Mitrovica,
among a population of nearly 2 million Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the mood was muted on both sides. Some Albanian miners
made a brief protest on the south side of the bridge in the
morning. Some Serbs stood around, playing nationalist music on loud
speakers and lobbed a few stones at U.S. paratroopers who deployed
on the main bridge overnight. The Americans had arrived to
reinforce British troops, who had borne the brunt of the turbulent
demonstrations and had ten soldiers slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Nick Carter of the Royal Green Jackets, whose men had
the job of preventing the demonstrators breaking through to the
bridge, said he expected a week or two of calm now, at least on the
Albanian side of the city. The demonstration had been generally
good humored and only a hardcore of 2,000 had been intent on
pushing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made their point, to show the massive feeling that there
is among Albanians that Mitrovica cannot remain divided. The
international community has bought two weeks and now has to produce
some results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs, it was a more intractable problem and was a
question of their viewpoint. ``I personally don't think they will
feel secure while looking over a river,'' he said, comparing the
River Ibar with the Berlin Wall. In Pristina, where the Royal Green
Jackets have been guarding a small Serb community, there is no
dividing line between the ethnic communities and that has helped
the beginnings of normality.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he has been able to reduce the static guards on
houses as slowly the violence has been reduced and Albanians have
taken on the responsibility of ensuring the security of the Serbs.
But he admits, ``It's going very very slowly.''

LOOKING TO SONOMA FOR CABERNETS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sonoma County winemakers have nothing better to do, they
like to needle the folks over the mountain in Napa County,
particularly if there's a gullible audience. To hear the Sonoma
crowd tell it, Napa people are social-climbing pseudo-sophisticates
who wear designer clothes and get their cars washed.
</P>
<P>
   Sonomans, they will insist, are simple country folk,
warm-hearted, generous and close to the soil. Napa people make
elegant cabernet sauvignon, while Sonomans prefer earthier, more
accessible wines like pinot noir and zinfandel.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma's wineries do indeed make some of the finest zinfandels
and pinot noirs, but they make terrific cabernets, too. As a group,
Sonoma cabernets tend to be overlooked _ an indignity, and it needs
to go.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma County itself can be deceptive. It looks rural and open,
but its population is three times larger than Napa's. Napa is
neatly arranged: almost all the towns and wineries are distributed
along two parallel roads, Highway 29 and the Silverado Trail.
</P>
<P>
   From the city of Napa at the south end to Calistoga in the north
is a 30-minute drive when traffic is light.
</P>
<P>
   In Sonoma County, distances are great. From the town of Sonoma
north to Cloverdale is more than 50 miles; the western border of
the Sonoma coast region starts at San Pablo Bay and runs more than
70 miles, most of it along the Pacific Ocean, to the Mendocino
County line.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of soils and climates in this big county is
enormous, and winemakers are only beginning to learn how to exploit
such diversity. But there are patterns.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to generalize when so many variables are in play,
but as a rule, Sonoma cabernets are rounder and fleshier than the
Napa cabernets.
</P>
<P>
   If any comparison can be drawn, it should be between the wines
of the Medoc _ Pauillac and Margaux _ and the wines of St.-Emilion
and Pomerol. They are all Bordeaux wines, but traditionally, the
St.-Emilions and Pomerols are more approachable, less austere.
</P>
<P>
   Good cabernets are produced all over Sonoma County, but some of
the best are in the Sonoma Valley, north of the town of Sonoma but
still in the southern half of the county. Sebastiani, Buena Vista,
Gundlach-Bund-schu, Carmenet, Arrowood, Chateau St.-Jean, St.
Francis and Kenwood are among the best cabernet makers.
</P>
<P>
   In the north, centered on the town of Healdsburg, are three
famous cabernet-producing viticultural regions: Dry Creek, Chalk
Hill and the Alexander Valley. Simi, Chalk Hill, Rodney Strong,
Ferrari-Carano, Jordan, Bellerose and Gallo Sonoma are a few of the
wineries to look for.
</P>
<P>
   Benziger Winery, in the Sonoma Valley, once noted for its
inexpensive Glen Ellen label, has become an important name among
Sonoma's fine wines. The 1995 Cabernet Sauvignon shows why. With
merlot and cabernet franc to smooth it, this is a large-scale wine
with, it would seem, good staying power. It is rich, nicely
structured and worth its $35 price.
</P>
<P>
   In the same general region, but up on the western slope of the
Mayacamas range, Carmenet Vineyard, part of the Chalone group of
wineries, is dedicated to making Bordeaux-style wines. Theirs are
more concentrated and less opulent than some of their Sonoma
neighbors', but they are more approachable than most Bordeaux. Look
for the 1996 Moon Mountain Reserve, at about $40.
</P>
<P>
   B.R. Cohn is another Sonoma Valley winery skilled in fine cabs.
The Olive Hill Estate 1996, about $35, is loaded with intense fruit
flavor. Kenwood Vineyards draws on grapes from the nearby Jack
London Vineyard for its best cabernet (London lived and wrote in
the Sonoma Valley). The wine, about $30, has good body and an
intriguing bouquet of fruits and berries.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Vineyards may be the best-known Alexander Valley winery.
Its 1995 cabernet, about $35, is a typical Jordan wine: smooth,
velvety and easy to drink.
</P>
<P>
   Much more imposing is a wine from Kendall-Jackson's impressive
Single Vineyard Series, the 1996 Buckeye Vineyard cabernet
sauvignon. This is a big, elegant wine with layers of flavors and a
lovely, long finish. At $65, it's a wine for dedicated cabernet
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Benziger, using grapes from Ash Creek Vineyard, in the Alexander
Valley, produced a full-bodied 1996 cabernet in a slightly
different style (about $30).
</P>
<P>
   Simi Winery has a long, distinguished history in Healdsburg. It
is no longer owned by Moet-Hennessy, but its wines are still
notable, particularly the 1994 Reserve Sonoma County cabernet, with
immense character (about $40). It has a smoky quality, something
like a great Burgundy, although it most assuredly tastes like
cabernet and not like pinot noir.
</P>
<P>
   A unique entry on this list is the Herzog 1996 Alexander Valley
Special Reserve cabernet, at about $26. It is a kosher wine,
meaning it's pasteurized. Even so, it will easily hold its own with
nonkosher wines at higher prices, and the string of awards garnered
by Herzog wines in recent years is proof.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Strong's Northern Sonoma Reserve 1995 cabernet is another
fine issue from this well-known winery, with lots of fruit in a
medium-bodied concentrated wine. It sells for about $40, but the
winery also has a velvety 1996 cabernet with a Sonoma County
appellation that's a true bargain at about $16.
</P>
<P>
   Knights Valley, in northeastern Sonoma, is sandwiched between
the northern Napa Valley and the Alexander Valley _ and most of it
is planted by Beringer Vineyards. Beringer is one of the leaders in
offering genuine values in fine wine, and its Knights Valley
cabernet is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 sells for about $25 and is the equivalent of many wines
at $15 or $20 more. What's more, Beringer makes quite a bit of it.
It should be relatively easy to find.

 &HT;    TALL TALES and SHORT STORIES: Rabble over Rebel flag
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ In a recent column, I suggested that
African-Americans appropriate the Confederate flag, further
decorate it with a huge black circle that has a slash through it
and then fly it from a separate but equally prominent flag staff
over the Capitol of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   That way, white Southerners who revere the Rebel flag would have
some idea of the outrage blacks feel when seeing it flown in public
places.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail reaction was forthcoming. Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   First this, from sirgregory5(at)juno.com:
</P>
<P>
   ``Can it be that I am the only person in the world who has ever
read a history book?
</P>
<P>
   ``Your article only shows you've jumped on the latest bandwagon,
and like all these other protesters, didn't check your facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a staunch liberal Democrat. I'm not a redneck. I simply
speak the truth, and the truth is the Rebel flag is the last _ one
of many _ flags that stood for slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. flag, good Old Glory, besides standing for the
annihilation of Native Americans, the slaughter of Korean civilians
and the complete rip-off of Mexico, also stood for slavery for 100
years before there even was a Confederacy. Protest that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rebel flag flew for three years during the Civil War. The
U.S. 'slave' flag, along with others that waved over slave
auctions, flew for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Rebel flag thing is an ignorant knee-jerk reaction
by a few unread, ignorant people who need something new to protest
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard rebuttal is that the Rebel flag to blacks is like
the Nazi flag to Jews. It is not at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swastika is pure evil and there has never been or will
ever be anything that compares to it. It did not stand for one
single good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rebel battle flag is an easy scapegoat for ignorant people
who are too lazy to bother reading what really happened _ either
that, or they choose to ignore the straight truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to slavery, the Rebel flag ain't nuthin'
compared to that Yankee flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Next this, from SOUTHB(at)aol.com:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't figure out if you're on drugs or just stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Civil War, we defeated the forces of fascism that
tried to destroy our young country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent thousands of men's lives to stamp out that kind of
tyranny. As for the heritage of the Old South, screw the Old South
and every southern moron who revels in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old South should be spending centuries trying to get back
in the good graces of the intelligent and principled republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``White southerners should be our permanent sub-class, picking
fruit, living in shacks and pondering their colossal ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone displaying a southern flag should be seen for the
lunatic he or she is and ostracized by the good people of this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never met a white southerner with the intelligence of a
turnip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricanes, floods and twisters are just God's way of trying
to pull the handle and finally flush this scum-sucking part of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally this, from sotagal(AT)txucom.net:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for your article on the Confederate flag. I couldn't
have said it better. If even one person's opinion is swayed, your
good deed for the year is covered!''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, isn't it pretty to think so.

 &HT;    RILEY SUGGESTS YEAR-ROUND JOBS FOR TEACHERS
 &HT;    320&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ School systems should consider hiring teachers to
work a full year instead of nine or 10 months, Education Secretary
Richard Riley suggested Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In his seventh annual ``State of American Education'' address,
Riley said the United States has outgrown two assumptions:
</P>
<P>
   ``One assumption was that the job of a teacher lasted nine
months,'' he said. The other was that the nation ``would always
have a ready supply of dedicated teachers, mostly women, who for
relatively low wages would teach our children their lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said working year-round would raise teachers' annual
income and give them more time to plan courses, improve their
skills, and provide some students extra help.
</P>
<P>
   Riley did not propose a federal role in establishing or
financing a longer work year for teachers, and added, ``I am not
proposing year-round schooling for all children. These decisions
about school schedules are best left up to each individual school
district.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at Southern High School here, Riley also called
for more federal aid for education in return for a ``mid-course''
review of school reforms by the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no slowdown, no moratorium when it comes to
putting high standards in place,'' Riley said. ``At the same time,
we must not make the mistake of reducing our effort to raise
standards to a 'blame and shame' game _ blaming schools for not
doing enough, and shaming students, teachers and parents for a lack
of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   He announced new grants of $30 million from the Mott Foundation
for after-school programs and another $30 million by the GE Fund to
help high school students qualify for college.
</P>
<P>
   He also outlined President Clinton's plan for a 12 percent
increase in spending by Riley's department, which would be the
biggest in history and include $1 billion for programs to improve
teacher quality.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   His detailed list of proposals was quickly attacked by House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, in the first formal response
ever by Republicans to the annual addresses that Riley inaugurated
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Washington provides less than 10 percent of the money
for schools, it creates 80 percent of the paperwork,'' Riley said
in a speech at a charter school in Pasadena, Calif. Demonstrators
outside Riley's speech in Durham held aloft ``school choice'' signs
and distributed copies of Armey's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Armey called for consolidating federal education spending into
block grants and using some of the funds to finance vouchers, which
would help parents of children in failing public schools to pay for
their children's tuition at private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's create more choices for parents and teachers to do what
they find works with the children whose names they know,'' Armey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Armey's suggestions had been brushed aside by Riley in
his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no accountability when it comes to block grants and
vouchers,'' Riley said. ``I travel all over the country visiting
with teachers and parents, and I have never heard one parent tell
me, 'Go back to Washington and support block grants.' ``

REFORMERS APPEAR TO BE THE BIG WINNERS IN IRAN'S ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Many of the conservative parliamentarians who led
the opposition to President Mohammad Khatami's reform program
apparently were soundly defeated in voting on Friday, according to
independent analysts who tallied up the hardliners' losses Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vote-counting was nearly complete in the major cities, including
the capital, Tehran, although no official results will be announced
until the end of the week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But preliminary results in Tehran, plus the decided races in
provincial areas, already indicate that the conservatives have lost
most of their senior representatives in the Parliament, analysts
for several foreign embassies and Iranian political parties said.
</P>
<P>
   A runoff election will be needed to decide the winner of some 60
to 65 seats in the 290-member Parliament, they added. The runoff
has tentatively been set for sometime in April.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most closely watched races, the former president
of Iran, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was barely holding on to
30th, or last, place in Tehran, which accounts for 30 seats in the
Parliament. It was not clear whether he would even get the minimum
number of votes _ 25 percent of those cast in the capital _ to
claim a seat in the first round, or whether he would be forced into
a runoff election.
</P>
<P>
   The top 29 vote-getters in the capital appear to be from the
reform camp that supports Khatami and advocates cultural freedoms,
including liberating the press from clerical censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's brother, Mohammad Reza Khatami, has held onto his lead
as the top vote-getter in the capital since the counting started.
Most analysts, including those for the reformers, give the
pro-Khatami forces about 70 percent of the seats in the first round
and the conservatives about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The tallies differ according to the analyst, however, because
some independent candidates are claimed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the elections, a spokesman for the
defeated conservatives admitted publicly Tuesday that they have
suffered a damaging blow.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Mohammad Reza Bahonar, one of the most prominent
ideologues of the conservative side, suggested in an interview with
a Tehran newspaper that hard-liners have some soul-searching to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not change our principles and positions, but it is
natural that we should reconsider our policies and methods,'' he
was quoted as saying in the newspaper Iran Vig. Bahonar also lost
his parliamentary seat in Tehran, according to unofficial results.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Tuesday to proclaim victory in the
parliamentary poll, the reformers pledged to push for legalizing
satellite dishes and allowing a free public debate of religious and
social issues that hard-liners had tried to suppress.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger Khatami warned that normalization of relations
with the United States _ an issue that some of his allies have
suggested should be put to a public vote _ would depend on action
by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States supported the totalitarian regime of the
shah,'' he said. ``And now that Iran has become one of the most
free nations, it continues its policy of sanctions and continues
its baseless claims against Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States cut off relations with Iran during the 1979
revolution, after students seized its embassy in Tehran and held 52
diplomats captive. It also has classified Iran as a state that
sponsors terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the paradoxes of Iran's budding reform movement, some
of its most prominent advocates for opening the country to the
outside world and institutionalizing democratic values were either
hostage-takers or supporters of the seizure.
</P>
<P>
   The poor showing by Rafsanjani, a veteran political operator who
has held high government positions since the Islamic revolution 21
years ago, surprised even his reformist critics.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the Feb. 18 elections, most
commentators considered Rafsanjani a shoo-in not only for a
Parliament seat, but also for the post of speaker.
</P>
<P>
   He was described as a man who could provide balance in the
Parliament between the up-and-coming leftists and their adversaries
on the right. Many analysts had assumed that most Tehran voters,
who could choose 30 candidates, would include Rafsanjani as a
stabilizing factor.
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani had long been considered outside Iran as a political
moderate who allowed the publication of independent newspapers and
took steps to liberalize the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, some of the pro-Khatami activists have
openly accused him of steering government contracts to family
members during his presidency and failing to support the cause of
reformers jailed over the past two years for expressing their
political views.

RADICCHIO AND ENDIVE FREE OF THE SALAD BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By JACK BISHOP

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ American cooks have adopted radicchio and endive as
their own. Just try to find a restaurant that doesn't serve one or
both of these bitter ``lettuces,'' considered exotic just 10 years
ago and impossible to find in many parts of the country. Now, even
mini-marts carry bagged tricolor salad mixes with radicchio, endive
and some sort of greenery.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the radicchio revolution seems to have stopped at
the salad bar. That's a shame, because many cooks are missing out
on the best way to enjoy the delightfully distinctive flavors of
radicchio and endive _ by cooking them.
</P>
<P>
   Once you think of radicchio and endive as vegetables, and not
just salad greens, the possibilities are almost endless. Roasted
radicchio is smoky and crisp, but wilt it with pancetta and onions,
and radicchio becomes soft and even a tad sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Cider-braised endive is creamy and sweet, but bake it under a
blanket of cream and Parmesan and the result is a nutty rich dish
worthy of the finest prime rib or beef tenderloin.
</P>
<P>
   The directions for roasting, grilling and pan-searing radicchio
are basically the same: oil the wedges well to keep the leaves from
drying out, then cook, turning once, until lightly browned. Timing
is the only difference. In the oven, radicchio needs about 20
minutes to brown and soften. Over coals or in a hot skillet,
cooking time will be five minutes or less.
</P>
<P>
   Although grilling and pan-searing are quicker than roasting, you
must be vigilant, since radicchio can turn to ashes rather quickly.
Roasting is still relatively quick and goof-proof.
</P>
<P>
   The brash flavor of radicchio doesn't change much when cooked.
If anything, it is even more assertive, with smoky overtones from
the light charring that occurs. Don't try to compete with this
flavor. Some good olive oil, salt, pepper and maybe a drizzle of
balsamic vinegar just before serving are sufficient seasonings.
Beef is the ideal partner for crisp, lightly browned radicchio.
</P>
<P>
   When slicing radicchio into wedges, keep the core or stem end _
normally cut off when making salads _ to ensure that the layers of
leaves stay together when cooked. Start by cutting each head of
radicchio in half through the core end. Lay the halves cut side
down, and then cut each into two wedges for small to medium
radicchio, or three wedges for larger heads.
</P>
<P>
   These directions assume you have purchased the widely available
rossa di Verona variety, which is round and looks like a miniature
red cabbage. At specialty stores or farmers' markets you may see an
elongated variety (it looks like purple endive) called rossa di
Treviso. It should be sliced in half lengthwise through the stem
end, just like endive.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do want to tone down the bitter flavor of
radicchio, there is one option: treat it as if it were red cabbage.
Shred or coarsely chop it, then wilt it in a covered casserole with
some chopped onions, pancetta (or bacon, prosciutto or sausage) and
garlic.
</P>
<P>
   It will take about 10 minutes for the radicchio to collapse into
a soft mass. Add some wine or broth if the radicchio starts to
scorch, but as long as there are a couple of tablespoons of fat in
the pan and the heat is not too strong, the radicchio should wilt
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Wilted radicchio can be served with roast pork or duck, or
simmered with cream and used as a sauce for fresh fettuccine.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to build a risotto on top of wilted radicchio.
After 20 minutes of simmering with the rice and stock, the
radicchio will almost melt into the rice. But there is no missing
the effect of the radicchio _ the risotto will be mauve, and the
flavor will be rich and smoky but not bitter.
</P>
<P>
   If radicchio is almost always loud and brash, endive is more of
a chameleon. When cooked, its texture changes from crisp to creamy
and its bitterness mellows considerably. In fact, cooked endive can
taste sweet, making it an appropriate vehicle for a variety of
seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Endive can be braised in white wine, chicken stock, cider, heavy
cream or orange juice, and will soak up flavors from the cooking
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet and creamy cider-braised endive is the perfect partner for
pork or poultry. Grilled endive with a simple orange-honey glaze
pairs nicely with chicken, duck or even salmon. To change
directions completely, dot endive with butter, dust it lightly with
Gruyere and roast it until lightly browned. Gratineed endive takes
roasted chicken to new heights of luxury.
</P>
<P>
   At the market, choose endive with leaves that are mostly or all
white. Some yellow around the edges is fine, but avoid endive with
green edges, which indicates exposure to light and signals that the
endive will be especially bitter.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To prepare endive for cooking, remove any limp outer leaves, and
then slice the endive in half lengthwise through the core or stem
end. Because the leaves are still attached to the core, the endive
can be cooked without the individual leaves separating. &QL;

`SEASONS OF MY HEART: A CULINARY JOURNEY THROUGH OAXACA, MEXICO':
HOW OAXACA COOKS NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Seasons of My Heart: A Culinary Journey Through Oaxaca,
Mexico,'' Susana Trilling includes a recipe for coctel de camaron,
a pungent shrimp cocktail. The backbone of the dish is an intense
shrimp stock flavored with chilies, but it gains its sweet
undertone from orange soda and its satiny texture from ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   This type of dish illustrates the essence _ and integrity _ of
Trilling's recipes in ``Seasons'' (Ballantine Books, $25).
</P>
<P>
   She does not hesitate to show the true nature of the modern
Oaxacan kitchen. These are the dishes that her neighbors in Oaxaca
make, the dishes that she teaches at her cooking school (also
called Seasons of My Heart) near the city of Oaxaca, and they are
at once intriguing and transporting. Any seemingly out-of-place
ingredients these recipes occasionally call for are just as
authentic as the guajillo chilies, ground shrimp and dried avocado
leaves also used in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Trilling, an American chef whose grandmother was Mexican, was
captivated by the food of Oaxaca while traveling there in 1983.
Several years later she and her husband established a commercial
farm, a bed and breakfast and the cooking school. The book expands
on recipes first presented on Trilling's public television series.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes give a very real portrait of contemporary Oaxacan
cooking, a melding of pre-Hispanic and Spanish influences with a
few modern conveniences. Many Oaxacan cooks today use animal
crackers to thicken moles, as an alternative to more traditional
plantains, nuts, tortillas and fresh masa.
</P>
<P>
   But Trilling only suggests substitutes like crackers and ketchup
when they are used by Oaxacan cooks, not to spare Americans from
searching for obscure ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   And so amassing the ingredients to cook just some of her recipes
meant shopping at three specialty stores. Worse, some techniques
were time-consuming and laborious, even when a blender was
substituted for a metate, the Mexican mortar and pestle.
</P>
<P>
   The mole coloradito took me about four and a half hours. But the
results were unlike anything I had ever cooked, layered with fiery,
fruity, smoky and herbal tastes. Other recipes I tried were equally
enticing, including a salad of grilled cactus paddles, baked sea
bass with olive, caper and tomato salsa, and corn croquettes
stuffed with dried shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   But there were missteps, too. Cilantro rice was mushy and bland.
The sour-cream pound cake recipe was missing half its ingredients,
including flour and sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Trilling gives a vivid picture of Mexican culture,
underscored by the candid photographs that are much more engaging
than heavily styled beauty shots. They take readers right into
Trilling's community and, along with her headnotes and chapter
introductions, give a compelling sense of a way of life at once
ancient and modern. &QL;

<P>
   ROASTED POBLANO CHILI BISQUE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Seasons of My Heart: A Culinary Journey Through
Oaxaca, Mexico'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1{ hours &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7 poblano chilies
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   2 medium white onions, thickly sliced
</P>
<P>
   7 cloves garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs fresh epazote or 1{ teaspoons dried (available at
specialty spice stores or Mexican markets)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and black pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 quart chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces requeson (about one-third cup) or ricotta or farmer
cheese (with salt)
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups milk
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons Mexican fresh crema, heavy cream or creme fraiche
</P>
<P>
   4 corn tortillas, 8 inches in diameter, cut into strips and
fried
</P>
<P>
   1. In a large skillet or over a gas flame, roast chilies until
blistered and blackened, turning to roast all sides. Place in a
plastic bag, and set aside until cool enough to handle. Peel
chilies, and remove stems and seeds. Cut flesh into strips 1 inch
wide; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a heavy 4-quart pot, melt butter over medium heat. Saute
onion until transparent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, and cook
about 5 minutes, stirring so garlic does not brown. Add chili
strips, and cook 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the
epazote, salt and pepper, and stir well. Pour in the stock, cover,
and simmer 15 minutes over low heat.
</P>
<P>
   3. Puree with requeson in a blender or food processor until very
smooth. Return to pot, and add milk. Gently reheat; adjust
seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, divide soup among 6 bowls, and top each with a bit
of crema. Garnish with tortilla strips, and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings. &QL;

FROM THE SIDEWALK TO THE SUBURBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday Feb. 22) 
By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago I met Susan, a one-eyed red-haired homeless woman
with a yellow dog who stood almost daily outside a Trader Joe's
store asking for money.
</P>
<P>
   She did very well on that piece of sidewalk. People would drive
out of the parking lot and read her cardboard sign and pass over
some money, a bag of trail mix, an umbrella, some dog food. The
sign explained she couldn't work because of her missing eye but
didn't qualify for disability benefits because she wasn't blind
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Many were kind to Susan. Some were cruel, like the ones who
yelled at her to get a job or sell her dog.
</P>
<P>
   Susan always maintained that she would eventually get back to a
normal life, but she didn't know how long it would take. ``When you
get down to begging, the way back is real hard,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Susan is back to where she began. She's a ``homed'' person.
She is, in fact, virtually mainstream, a suburbanite, living in a
house with a swimming pool on a cul-de-sac in Hacienda Heights near
Los Angeles. It is not only a roof but almost a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Susan once said that after you stop being homeless the next
worry is finding a place and keeping it. This is the house Susan
grew up in, now owned by her sisters who inherited it when their
mother died. Susan and her boyfriend pay nominal rent and Susan
sleeps in the same bedroom she had as a girl.
</P>
<P>
   When I first started writing about Susan some people were
suspect. How did I know that she really used the $5 and $10 bills
people gave her to get a motel room? Maybe she bought liquor or
drugs. Maybe she wasn't really a former office manager,
housecleaner and landscaper with two grown kids.
</P>
<P>
   They're the ``free ride'' cynics, who when someone asks for a
handout want to know if the person really needs it, as if asking
for a handout wasn't proof enough of a need.
</P>
<P>
   What I liked about Susan was she had pluck. She knew she would
get off the sidewalk. ``I feel like I snowballed to the bottom and
now I'm going to snowball to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't feel sorry for herself, but neither did she apologize
for asking for help. This was only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   People like Susan often make the comfortable feel uncomfortable.
They try to rationalize the Susans away, make them someone they
would never be. They can't imagine that some Susans were once like
them, with a checkbook and a warm car to drive home.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Susan's one of them now. She started to pull her life
together while she was in Sonoma County with the help of others.
Someone helped her get an eye prosthesis, job training, first and
last months rent and a car that ran. Susan got a part-time job,
relinquished her spot on the sidewalk and moved into an apartment
with her dog and her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Her boyfriend came and went in her life and had his problems
too, working odd jobs. Susan never offered many details about him
but talked like they were a couple.
</P>
<P>
   Now they live together like Mr. and Ms. Hacienda Heights with
cable and a lawn mower bought for $2 at a yard sale. Susan's son,
who is a mailman, lives with them.
</P>
<P>
   Susan works for an agency that provides in-home care and her
last job was with a couple in their 80s named Slim and Marie.
They'd talk about their plumbing business and Susan told them about
all her lives, including the homeless chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Susan has found her own Susan, a woman who goes by the name of
Scotch and lives under the freeway. Susan gives her clothes and
spare change.
</P>
<P>
   Susan said to tell everyone at Trader Joe's hello for her. She
said the one near her neighborhood closed which is too bad because
she always wanted to shop in one.

A WHISPER OF SPRING IN A SPROUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: recipe in 2nd take)  
 (bl)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imagine if you took a beet, put it through a juicer,
then reduced its juice until all that was left was the pure sweet
essence of the vegetable. And then you found a way to inject that
essence into a frail little leaf, no longer than a blade of grass.
</P>
<P>
   What you would have would not be a clever invention. It would be
a beet sprout.
</P>
<P>
   What would be clever is if you took that sprout and placed it on
top of a pile of roasted baby beets in the center of a beet and
ginger soup, so that with each bite you would get three different
variations of beet flavor.
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Franklin Becker, the chef at Local, does. And
it is just that little sprout, bright with intense beet flavor,
that makes the dish shine.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, as winter lies in a deep, grey lull, months before
kohlrabi, beets, mustard, kale and daikon radishes start showing up
in the Greenmarkets, the sprouts of these vegetables are already
being harvested. In fact, they are about all that is green at the
markets these days. For chefs, they mean a whole new medium to work
with, and one that more and more are taking advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable sprouts _ sometimes called microgreens or shoots
depending on the variety _ are simply the vegetables in their early
stages of growth, when they are just a few inches long and the
first few leaves have formed. Frail as they may appear, their
flavor is powerful, and they often contain hints of sweetness,
acidity and grassiness not present in the vegetables themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At 71 Clinton Fresh Food, the chef Wylie Dufresne props beet
sprouts and shungiku, a mild Asian green related to chrysanthemum,
like a tumbleweed on top of a tall, tightly stacked root vegetable
``lasagna.'' They're bouncy and light and come across like a whiff
of optimism between bites of the delicious, though by now too
common, parsnips, potato, celery root and carrots that are in the
dish.
</P>
<P>
   Other chefs use vegetable sprouts as variations on a theme. At
Union Pacific, Rocco Dispirito serves mackerel with celery root
puree and celery oil, with celery sprouts laid over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really just accent the celery message that I'm trying to
deliver with that dish,'' he said. It works. You don't finish
wondering what the secret ingredient is. Celery is practically
ringing in your ears.
</P>
<P>
   There's the same layering of flavors in the crab cakes at Local.
The cakes themselves are textured with kernels of corn, the sauce
tastes of roasted corn and springing forth from the dish are what
look to be thin rods of pale yellow silk. They are corn sprouts,
and they taste like sweet corn dew, if there is such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   The corn sprout echoes the other flavors of corn and gives the
dish dimension, not just novelty. Unlike the ill-used parsley
sprig, vegetable sprouts have purpose. The corn sprout, Becker
said, re-enforces the corn as the core ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   These sprouts are different from alfalfa and bean sprouts, which
are typically cultivated in the dark in water so that both the
roots and tops can be eaten. Most other vegetable sprouts are grown
in soil, and only the part that grows above the soil is eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Growing techniques vary, but many involve seeding a plot
densely, so that the vegetable grows in patches like grass. Most
can be harvested in 4 to 6 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Jones, an owner of the Chef's Garden in Huron, Ohio, which
sells vegetables to chefs like Thomas Keller, Charlie Trotter and
Jean-Georges Vongerichten, grows his vegetable sprouts in compost
at low temperatures. The slower the sprouts grow, Jones said, the
better their flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The harvesting is the real backbreaker. Most farmers harvest the
sprouts by bending over and cutting them by hand. Jones harvests
his to order, using shears and packing them in individual
containers. For that, they cost just a small fortune. Jones sells
his for $48 to $120 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   At the Union Square Greenmarket, pints, or a few handfuls, are
about $3 at Windfall Farms and Hudson Valley Organic Gardens. They
may also be ordered by mail from Indian Rock Produce in Quakertown,
Pa., (800) 882-0512.
</P>
<P>
   Varieties differ from farm to farm, but some of the more common
choices include bull's blood beets, pink chard, radish, ruby chard,
corn shoots, broccoli, celery and red Russian kale.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a certain kind of farmer to harvest a vegetable when
it's hardly begun growing. Jones remembered the day his father,
also a farmer, came into the office when they were tasting corn
sprouts. ``He just shook his head and walked out,'' Jones said. Of
course, had he tasted them, he might have stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable sprouts are interesting to use, but challenging.
Because they lie somewhere between a vegetable and an herb, it is
not obvious which way to treat them. It's best not to be too
ambitious. A dish like the seared scallops, roasted fingerling
potatoes and braised leeks at the Grocery in Brooklyn is a good
choice. Charles Kiely and Sharon Pachter, the chefs, finish the
dish with a large pinch of purple broccoli sprouts. The tiny
broccoli leaves have a peppery kick, and they are meant to work as
a bright counterpoint to the mild, earthiness of the potatoes and
the sweetness of the scallops.
</P>
<P>
   At Nicole's, the chef Annie Wayte uses beet sprouts with deep
fuchsia-trimmed leaves alongside a crab salad. The color is
striking, the flavor supportive to the crab.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Palmer, the chef at Aureole, places daikon radish
sprouts on tuna tartare with a citrus dressing. That would be
difficult to make any simpler.
</P>
<P>
   At home, you could place a fluff of sprouts on top of grilled
fish, or mix something like sharply flavored curly cress or red
Russian kale into a salad, so that it acts like an herb.
</P>
<P>
   Some sprouts, like pea shoots, are much larger and meatier.
Rather than placing them on top of a dish suggestively, they can be
treated more like a full-grown green. At 71 Clinton Fresh Food,
they are scattered below a roasted chicken breast. They catch the
juices, stopping them from diluting a hazelnut sauce, and they wilt
a little, so you get some bites that crunch with fresh pea flavor
and others that are soaked with warm chicken juices.
</P>
<P>
   It's a delicious dish, and a spoil at this time of year. Peas in
the pod won't be around for another month or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could probably get sugar snap peas from Peru now, but
that's not the point,'' said Dufresne, the chef. ``It's guilt-free,
because it's local, and I don't feel it's some sort of
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, it's a compliment. Now, perhaps parsley can
redeem itself. &QL;

   SEARED SEA SCALLOPS WITH BROCCOLI SPROUTS AND BROWN BUTTER
VINAIGRETTE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from  &UR; the Grocery &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 50 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 fingerling potatoes, cut in half lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 medium leeks, white and light green part only, each trimmed to
4-inches
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons white wine
</P>
<P>
   8 large sea scallops
</P>
<P>
   1 handful broccoli sprouts
</P>
<P>
   1. Place a small roasting pan in oven and preheat to 350
degrees. In a medium bowl, combine potatoes with 2 tablespoons
olive oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Place potatoes
in roasting pan cut side down, and roast until bottoms are golden
brown, about 10 minutes. Turn potatoes over, and sprinkle with
lemon juice. Continue to roast until potatoes are tender, about 10
minutes more. Remove from oven and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a large pan over high heat, combine 2 tablespoons butter
with 1 cup water. Bring to a boil. Split leeks lengthwise, and
season with salt and pepper to taste. Place leek halves cut side

halves intact, transfer them to a plate, and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a small pan, combine remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and
cream. Place over medium heat, and cook at a lively simmer until
milk solids become nutty and brown, and clear, clarified butter
rises to top. Immediately remove from heat, and pour off and
discard clarified butter. Add vinegar and wine, scraping bottom of
pan to incorporate browned milk solids into sauce. Bring to a boil,
and season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat, and
keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   4. Season scallops with salt and pepper to taste. In a
well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over high heat, heat remaining 2
tablespoons of olive oil. When pan is smoking, add scallops, and
sear until springy to the touch and browned on both sides. Transfer
to a plate.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, on each of four plates place a piece of leek with a
potato half on each side. Place 2 scallops on each plate, with a
bouquet of broccoli sprouts between scallops. Spoon a little sauce
over potatoes, leeks and scallops, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the '40s and '50s, a sure sign that company was
coming to dinner was the sight of my mother carefully sectioning
white grapefruit halves with a serrated knife, a bottle of
maraschino cherries at the ready for topping. If grapefruits
weren't exactly exotic back then, they were certainly for special
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   I still have the serrated knife, and it got a workout last week
sampling more than two dozen varieties of unusual citrus that have
been making their ways to specialty markets and restaurant kitchens
over the last year or two. Finally, winter fruit is getting
interesting. Not to mention confusing.
</P>
<P>
   There are pear-shaped pomelos that look like misshapen
grapefruits. And pomelos that look like well-formed grapefruits _
not surprisingly, since the pomelo is one of the grapefruit's
ancestors. There is also the limequat, a cross between lime and
kumquat that is yellow or green instead of orange, and there are
yellow lemons with green stripes and pink flesh.
</P>
<P>
   All of them offer not just pleasurable eating, but also
significant levels of vitamin C, folic acid and potassium. Like all
citrus fruits, exotic or common, these fascinating new varieties
have high levels of the components called phytochemicals, which are
believed to be effective in reducing risks of certain types of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The botany and plant sciences department at the University of
California at Riverside has a collection of more than 900 different
kinds of citrus fruit from all over the world. But until recently,
said Ottillia Bier, a staff research associate, no one was paying
much attention to them. ``We have had things in our collection for
30, 40, 50 years, but in the past, farmers were just looking for
things they could plant 10,000 acres of and sell it,'' she
continued. ``Now, we've started showing them things that are a
little different, and they are interested. I think the interest is
consumer driven. It starts with the chefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers' markets and the influx of Asian populations are also
responsible, said David Karp, a California writer and expert on
citrus. Asian farmers grow pomelos for their fellow immigrants and
sell them at farmers' markets in California, where non-Asian
shoppers see them.
</P>
<P>
   And want them. It takes longer for these specialty items to
arrive in New York. But each year, Gourmet Garage has more _ most
domestic, some imported _ and Dean &AMP; Deluca and Eli's carry some.
Frieda's, which supplies exotic produce to supermarkets nationally,
is a good source by mail (800-241-1771 or www.friedas.com).
</P>
<P>
   Not all of these oddities are worth the time it takes to cut
them open, especially some of the pomelos. Others are so
interesting they make me wonder why it took so long for them to get
here. But the biggest surprise is that even though the textures and
flavors of these exotic citrus varieties are so different, all of
them descended thousands of years ago from three species: pomelo,
mandarin orange and citron.
</P>
<P>
   Today's grapefruit is the result of the crossbreeding of a
pomelo and a sweet orange. The flesh of pomelos can be white,
ivory, pale green, light red or intense pink. They all have the
same yellow to yellowish-green skin as a grapefruit, but they
generally have more seeds and thicker albedos, as the pith is
properly called. They frequently have flesh that is too dry for the
American palate, though it is much beloved in China.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most delicious exotic citrus I tried were the
Oroblanco, a cross between a pomelo and a grapefruit, and the
Sarawak pomelo. The former does not look much different from an
ordinary white grapefruit but has a superb balance of acidity and
sweetness. Sometimes it is extremely juicy, but even when it is
not, the flavor is much more complex than grapefruit's.
</P>
<P>
   The Sarawak pomelo, with pale lime-green flesh and luscious
tropical taste, has less sugar than the Oroblanco and a higher acid
content that makes the flavor intense and intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Melogold, another cross between a pomelo and a grapefruit, has
the same parents as the Oroblanco, but it is sweeter and less acid.
</P>
<P>
   Cocktail grapefruits, with a canary yellow skin and a deep
yellow flesh, are really sweet, very close in taste to oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Blood oranges no longer quite qualify as exotics in New York,
and of the three I tried, my choice would be the ones labeled
Moros, from Sunkist. They have a lovely balance of flavor and a
hint of flower.
</P>
<P>
   Seville oranges are also relatively common this time of year. If
you are into making your own marmalade, they offer an opportunity
to have it more bitter than the commercial kind. You certainly
wouldn't want to eat them out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Kumquats actually belong to the genus Fortunella, not Citrus,
but they are usually lumped in with oranges. The Meiwa kumquat has
a rounder shape and a much sweeter skin than the ordinary kumquat,
making it quite pleasing to eat in thin slices. (In both varieties,
and in limequats, the flesh is very sour.)
</P>
<P>
   Lemons with green stripes are called Variegated Pink Lemonade
lemons and are marginally sweeter than yellow lemons. A few wedges
of them alongside a piece of fish add a jaunty look to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   All these new citrus are for more than breakfast or a snack. At
Chicama, Douglas Rodriguez and his ceviche chef, Adrian Leon, use
them in superbly flavored ceviches. ``The fruits have very specific
qualities that enhance the flavor of the fish,'' Rodriguez said.
The bitterness of kumquats brings out the perfume of salmon; a
sweet pomelo enhances the sweetness of scallops; Seville oranges
provide the perfect counterpoint to the richness of cooked duck.
</P>
<P>
   If my mother had had Oroblancos, she would never have bothered
with maraschino cherries.

   HDEPOT-EARNINGS _ Home Depot reported a 38 percent increase in
fiscal fourth-quarter profit on higher sales. The largest home
improvement retailer said Tuesday that net income rose to $578
million, or 25 cents a share, from $418 million, or 18 cents a

<P>
   DOW _ Stocks continued the slide that began last Friday, but the
selling momentum slowed on Monday as analysts detected investor
sentiment to get back in the market when an opportunity occurs. But
some analysts, including Ralph Acampora of Prudential Securities,
looks for further weakness, especially in blue chips, before the
end of what he calls a bull market correction. Federal Reserve Alan
Greenspan makes another appearance before Congress this week _ the
Senate on Wednesday _ but is not expected to say anything different
from his House testimony last week, when he as much as promised
that the Fed would continue to raise interest rates until the
economy is safe from inflation. The good news for stocks is the
continued drop in 30-year Treasuryyields and a decline in oil
prices. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-BIZ _Women-owned businesses have increased by 103 percent
duringthe past decade. According to a report released Tuesday in

championship run during the early 1990's, has signed a minor-league
contract with the team and is expected to be in camp today. Avery,
the MVP of the 1991 National League Championship Series, spent last
season in Cincinnati after two years with the Boston Red Sox. If
Avery has fully recovered from an assortment of arm injuries, he
could be the fifth starter that the team has been searching for.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the saddest sights in politics is a fading
public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has
passed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest egotist to ignore reality is Ralph Nader, the aging
consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   He announced Monday that he will seek the presidential
nomination of the Green Party. The cheering was muted. It will be
his second try. He ran for the White House on that party ticket in
1996 and attracted a whopping 1 percent of the total votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   As a political force, the Green Party isn't much. It champions
environmental protection and has a small presence in California and
other western states.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader, 66, hasn't gotten over his earlier decades of fame as
the chief advocate of auto safety and other good causes and as the
relentless scourge of big business. He has settled into a role as
the ghost of causes past.
</P>
<P>
   These days he hangs around the fringes of what remains of the
old political left, trying to regenerate some of his former
publicity magic. Through a group called Global Trade Watch, he
helped plan the demonstrations in Seattle against the World Trade
Organization. He demands changes aimed at emasculating the
organization so it will be helpless to influence international
trade decisions.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the Nader of old, whose causes defied the vested
interests on behalf of the little guy for the broad public good.
Global protectionism does not fit there. Although Nader once
crusaded for all sorts of financial disclosure and openness in
government, his GTW does not reveal the names of its donors. One
financial backer is reported to be the protectionist U.S. textile
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nader achieved folk-hero status in 1965 after General Motors
hired private detectives to discredit him and his book ``Unsafe at
Any Speed,'' which criticized GM for shoddy car construction.
</P>
<P>
   But he began to lose moral authority in 1972 when he abandoned
his nonpartisan aura to endorse the politically doomed Sen. George
McGovern for president. Nader grew preachy and prickly. He lobbied
for a dizzying array of causes, some of which he won, some of which
he lost and some of which were tailored to his own individual
interests.
</P>
<P>
   About to be ejected by a rent increase from his downtown office
quarters, Nader even proposed a taxpayers' subsidy to provide
housing for nonprofit, volunteer citizens' public interest groups _
like his own. It went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Even liberals felt that his 1978 campaign to establish a
Cabinet-level Consumer Protection Agency was too much bureaucracy
for too little gain. After the measure was defeated in Congress,
his relations with Capitol Hill and the media soured. By 1982 a
Gallup Poll found that fewer than 40 per of those surveyed admired
Nader, a dramatic fall from a decade earlier, when he ranked among
the 10 most admired Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Nader is in the great tradition of political die-hards who
stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and
speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter. It's a
shame, but it's human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Stassen, of course, takes the grand prize. A former
Minnesota governor, he first ran for the Republican presidential
nomination in 1948 _ and then ran and ran and ran every four years
until 1992, when he was 84 and finally gave up the gig.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan is working toward that
record, making his third presidential run. This time he is moving
in on the chaotic Reform Party, with which he has no prior history
or even common policy goals. No popular groundswell for this
candidacy was detected, except in Buchanan's shaving mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes is in the mold as well, refusing to drop out of this
year's Republican primaries despite pitiful showings at the polls.
He's a broadcaster like Buchanan _ anything to maintain the buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the ostrich-head-in-the-sand routine takes the form of
holding an opponent hostage after an election has been lost. Recent
examples of sour grapes were Republican Ellen Saurbrey, who was
defeated by Democrat Parris Glendening for governor of Maryland in
1994 and Republican Rep. Michael Huffington, defeated for the
California Senate seat in 1996 by incumbent Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Saurbrey challenged the election outcome for two months although
the margin of victory was nearly 6,000 votes. She ran against
Governor Glendening again last year and deservedly lost again.
</P>
<P>
   Although Huffington was defeated by 165,562 votes, he did not
issue the pro-forma congratulation to Feinstein for three months.
Both losers charged that old standby, voter fraud, which when
examined almost never turns out to have been so one-sided as to
have changed an election outcome.
</P>
<P>
   But back to Nader. He was once so good. Why can't he leave it at
that?

`WONDER BOYS': MARIJUANA, MANUSCRIPT AND MARRIAGE EQUAL A MESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Chabon's 1995 novel, ``Wonder Boys,'' chronicles a
hectic weekend in the life of Grady Tripp, a frustrated,
concupiscent college teacher mired in at least three ill-starred
relationships: to marijuana, to his elephantine unfinished
manuscript and to the wife of his department chairman. More Anne
Tyler than John Updike, the book plays Grady's dilemma for gentle
comedy and lingers fondly over the quirky geography of a proud,
battered American industrial city, in this case Pittsburgh.
``Wonder Boys'' is intoxicated by its setting and enchanted by
writing: by the sweet, fizzy soda pop of its own style and also by
some unabashedly romantic notions of the literary life. Chabon's
characters tap out their manuscripts on old typewriters, are
reckless in love and loyal in friendship and suffer from the
creative agitation Grady calls ``the midnight disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In bringing ``Wonder Boys'' to the screen, Steve Kloves and
Curtis Hanson have tried to be faithful both to its spirit of
bittersweet farce and to its beguiling profusion of detail. Hanson
and his production crew have assiduously rounded up a Citroen
(though not, as in the book, a convertible) and a vintage Ford
Galaxie, an IBM Selectric and a pair of red cowboy boots. They
built themselves a Pittsburgh dive, complete with neon signs and
Naugahyde banquettes. And to their great credit, they allowed
Pittsburgh to play itself, a picturesque late-19th-century city of
red brick factories and dark, wainscoted interiors, whose weather
seems to consist of variations on snow, rain and wind.
</P>
<P>
   While Chabon's convoluted narrative has been streamlined and
some of its charming shaggy-dog tangents sheered away, the heart of
the novel _ a cat's cradle of comic entanglements involving Grady's
collapsing marriage, his monstrous manuscript and his duty to help
a troubled fledgling writer _ has been carefully preserved. Kloves
has lifted chunks of dialogue from the pages of the book and placed
them in the competent mouths of a cast that includes Michael
Douglas as Grady, Frances McDormand as his paramour, a college
administrator named Sara Gaskell, and Tobey Maguire as James Leer,
Grady's wayward prize student. And yet the words that seem so
artful and lively in print have a way of becoming lifeless and
artificial when uttered aloud. Hannah Green, a student who rents a
room in Grady's house and has a half-requited crush on him, gushes
to him, ``It's like all your sentences seem as if they've always
existed, waiting up there in Style Heaven or wherever, for you to
fetch them down.'' Reading this may elicit a smile. Hearing it,
even as uttered by the charming Katie Holmes in her
character-defining red cowboy boots, is more likely to produce a
wince.
</P>
<P>
   This, in a nutshell, is the mystery of ``Wonder Boys.'' It
boasts a first-rate cast, a credible literary source and a director
whose last film, ``L.A. Confidential,'' showed a prodigious ability
to capture both the headlong rhythms of a complex plot and the
particularities of a motley assortment of characters. With so much
going for it, how could the movie be such a dud? There's no
shortage of screwball material _ a dead dog, an errant tuba and a
very tall drag queen, for starters _ but Hanson, perhaps aiming for
wry understatement, has smothered whatever antic rhythm the story
might have had. ``Wonder Boys'' is like a George Cukor movie with a
bad head cold _ slow, muffled and vague.
</P>
<P>
   The same three words might describe Douglas' performance. To be
fair, he is playing a pothead, a merciful change of pace for an
actor who typically performs as if he is coming off a three-day
Viagra binge. But Douglas seems not to be enacting the hazy
confusion that is Grady's dominant trait; he seems to have
succumbed to it. His scenes with McDormand, whose character
kick-starts the plot by telling Grady she's pregnant with his
child, lack the erotic heat, the sense of longing, that might lend
pathos to their predicament. You never quite shake the sense that
you are watching movie actors freshly arrived in a strange city and
awaiting further instructions.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of ``Wonder Boys'' _ as phony and conventional here as
it was in the book _ is rescue. And just as the book was saved from
banality by its author's mordant whimsy, the film is rescued from
complete dullness by the manic insouciance of Robert Downey Jr. He
plays Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree, who blows into Pittsburgh to
participate in a college-sponsored event called WordFest and sets
about seducing James Leer. Downey and Maguire, whose improvisatory,
ironical acting styles seem to belong in a different movie, might
have found some real chemistry, but they don't get much time
together on screen. What occupies the screen is a well-intentioned
muddle. The problem with ``Wonder Boys'' is not that it's a bad
movie, though if it had risked becoming one it might have been a
lot more. The problem is that everyone involved seems to have
agreed that it was a great idea for a movie and pretty much left it
at that.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Wonder Boys'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains some sexual
situations, clouds of marijuana smoke and the the senseless killing
of a blind dog.
</P>

CONGREGATION EAGERLY AWAITS RESTORED TORAH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Torah in the Phoenix synagogue's lobby is
displayed exactly the way Hitler would have wanted _ in a museum
case, behind glass.
</P>
<P>
   For years, this bothered many at Beth El Congregation. But the
Torah, once stolen for Hitler's planned museum of artifacts from
``a liquidated race,'' could not be used in worship because of its
deteriorated state.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the congregation's restoration project will be complete,
and this sacred text of the Jewish people will never be behind
glass again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Torah, like the people it represents, was programmed to
die and it refused to die, the same way we refused to die. Hitler
is dead. I am alive, and the Torah is alive,'' said Helen Handler,
a Beth El congregant and the only member of her family to survive
Nazi death camps.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Nazis destroyed thousands of Torahs
publicly to demoralize the Jewish community, said Rabbi Rick
Sherwin, spiritual leader of the 850 families at Beth El.
</P>
<P>
   Many others were stolen for Hitler's planned museum.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, the Beth El Torah and about 1,500 others
were left for two decades in a neglected synagogue outside Prague
in what is now the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   An English businessman and philanthropist discovered them, and
the Torahs were rescued, although many were beyond repair. Beth El
was one of the congregations around the world to receive one in
fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   A Torah is written in Hebrew and contains the first five books
of the Old Testament. The books were given to Moses on Mount Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish law prescribes that only a perfect Torah may be used in
worship. The Beth El parchment scroll was brittle, yellowed and
torn, its Hebrew letters no longer crisp and black. The
congregation preserved the Torah behind glass as a memorial to
Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it in my stomach. It bothered a number of people,''
Sherwin said. ``With the help of Cathy Wolf and Jody Jones, we
devised a plan to get the Torah out of that case and into the hands
of a scribe to fix it, letter by letter, and bring it back to the
synagogue so we can use it.''
</P>
<P>
   The scroll spent a year and a half in Brooklyn, N.Y., at Klein
Bros. where the two sibling rabbis restore and write Torahs
following strict religious guidelines. They spent about 1,500 hours
on the project.
</P>
<P>
   The Torah is estimated to be between 200 and 400 years old. The
parchment was softened and reinforced, then each letter redrawn,
following its original style, a task more difficult and expensive
than writing a new one.
</P>
<P>
   There is also more joy, said one of the brothers, Rabbi Moshe
Klein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is one of the most important things that a Jewish
congregation can do,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Handler and more than 300 members of Beth El greeted
the nearly restored Torah with great anticipation. Handler was one
of the first to hold the Torah, wrapped in a prayer shawl, and she
smiled as she clasped it. Then she couldn't stop crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides my son, it is the most precious thing I have ever held
in my arms. I have nothing from my background, not even a picture,
to pass on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Torah could have returned completed, but the synagogue has
dedicated this year to understanding the Torah's history, studying
it more deeply, and seeking inspiration from its message.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Wolf, members of Beth El, have worked with the
synagogue in the restoration project and in the educational
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The programs will continue through May when Klein will come to
the congregation, and the rabbi and congregation will complete the
Torah together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is bringing in the congregation, from the youngest
kids. It's hard not to feel the joy and the spirit and the energy
that surrounds this,'' said Wolf, program manager for the Downtown
Neighborhood Learning Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Handler, now a retired owner of a Phoenix drapery shop, was born
in the former Czechoslovakia, the country where the Torah was
found. At 15, she was separated from her family at Auschwitz, where
10,000 were gassed every 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, the Nazi women would make them stand in line for
two or three hours, barely clothed in the cold, waiting to see who
would die that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stood in front of us in their fresh crisp uniforms. I
could smell the toothpaste in their mouths,'' Handler said. ``We
were standing absolutely dying in front of them, and they were
talking about their dates from the night before. . . .
</P>

RICE PUDDING WITH A JAPANESE TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the eighth of eight columns by Tadashi Ono, the chef at
Sono in Manhattan. They are written with Mark Bittman.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many people are surprised to find rice pudding, a
classic American comfort food, on my menu. But to me, it seems a
natural choice. Rice is tremendously important in Japanese cuisine,
and I knew we could create a rice pudding that departed from the
ordinary. What Christine Chang, our pastry chef, and I came up with
follows the typical technique, which is to simmer rice in sweetened
milk until it is soft and creamy. But the result has a flavor and
texture that are completely unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   My simmering liquid is half coconut milk, which is richer than
milk and adds its own flavor. I use short-grain sushi rice, which
becomes softer and creamier than long-grain rice and, because of
its high gluten content, has a chewier texture. I cook the rice
until it can hold a shape. The result is less like American rice
pudding than a creamy version of Asian sticky rice.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to simmer the rice in a wide-bottomed pot so that the
liquid can evaporate quickly; this keeps the rice from becoming too
mushy, and it leaves the core of each grain distinct as the entire
mixture becomes creamy. The technique is very much like that for
risotto _ the pudding requires near-constant stirring, too _ and in
fact the results are not dissimilar.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, we lay shallow 5-inch rings on a no-stick
surface and pack the pudding into the rings, smoothing the top. At
home, it's probably easier to spoon the pudding into custard cups
or ramekins. They can sit at room temperature for a few hours, or
be refrigerated for up to a day.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, we grate a layer of palm sugar on top and
caramelize it with a propane torch; at home, brown sugar can
substitute. Caramelize it under the broiler (set the rack as close
to the heat source as you can and watch carefully).
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, rice pudding is topped with whipped cream, but
instead of adding more creaminess and sweetness I created a tart,
bright-green syrup with lime juice and zest that adds a spark of
color and cleanses the palate of the pudding's richness.
</P>
<P>
   COCONUT RICE PUDDING WITH LIME SYRUP
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 1 hour  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 limes
</P>
<P>
   3 cups whole milk
</P>
<P>
   3 cups canned coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   1 vanilla bean
</P>
<P>
   } cup short-grain (sushi) rice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   6 teaspoons palm or brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1. Set a small pot of water to boil. In a separate pot, combine
{ cup sugar and { cup water and bring to a boil. Cook for a few
seconds, until sugar dissolves. Zest the limes and place zest in
boiling water for 10 seconds, no more; drain through a strainer and
plunge into ice water to chill. Set aside. Juice limes, and add
them to sugar syrup; cook over medium heat, stirring only
occasionally, until it darkens and thickens, about 20 minutes.
Cool, then stir in lime zest and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Put the rice in a deep bowl, and run cold water on it,
stirring with your hand. Drain and repeat until excess starch is
removed and water runs clear. Combine milk and coconut milk in a
wide, deep, heavy bottomed saucepan, and turn heat to medium-high.
Split vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out seeds; add them to the
mix, along with the rice, 1 cup sugar and salt. When liquid begins
to boil, adjust heat so that it bubbles steadily but not
vigorously; if at any point the mixture browns, turn heat down a
little more. Stir occasionally at first, then more and more
frequently, until mixture becomes thick and much like oatmeal,
about 25 minutes total.
</P>
<P>
   3. Spoon rice pudding into six ramekins, and cool to room
temperature (you can refrigerate for up to a day, but these are
best at room temperature). Before serving, sprinkle top of each
pudding with palm or brown sugar and use a propane torch or run
under broiler until sugar bubbles and begins to burn. Serve,
drizzled with lime syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: six servings.

&HT;     THE DEER POINT TO AN EARLY SPRING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Maybe flowers, trees and deer can't predict the
future, but from Monterey to the Oregon border, nature seems to be
forecasting a warm, early spring in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cannonade procession of storms the past month, the
temperatures have been extremely mild. In the Bay Area, it has the
foothills turning green, spring fruit trees blooming and the
magnolias on the Peninsula ready to pop their purple blooms any
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Valley is also greening up, and in the mountain
foothills at elevations up to 2,500 feet, sprouting tulips and
gladiola are already 5 inches tall, another anomaly for
mid-February. In the north state, at the town of Mount Shasta
(3,400 feet), there is no snow on the ground, a
once-in-a-hundred-year aberration.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to my wilderness cabin this past week on the flank of
Shasta, I saw sprouting tulips, vegetation and a dozen deer
browsing, unheard of for what is usually peak winter. What are the
deer doing here? Looking for food, that's what, and finding it.
</P>
<P>
   On the north coast, Humboldt County might have been deluged with
rain, but there are apricot and plum trees that are green.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with nature, you never know what will happen next:
The polar jet stream could suddenly dip down and deliver a
procession of Arctic storms that turns Northern California into an
ice box. Or a massive high pressure system could take hold, force
the jet streams into Canada, with 70-degree temperatures arriving
in March.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the deer are betting on the latter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOOR NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   Record trout: A 17-pound rainbow trout, a new lake record for
Shadow Cliffs Lake in Pleasanton, was caught Thursday by Gene
O'Connor of San Leandro. The trout measured 30 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   One way to solve it: In the Salt Lake City area, some parks have
solved hiker vs. biker trail conflicts by reserving days where
trails are for the exclusive use of hikers, as well as others for
the exclusive use of bikers. Sounds good on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   This just in: A landmark funding bill for wildlife and wild
places, H.R. 701, won congressional committee approval last week
with 294 co-sponsors from both parties, which virtually assures its
future passage. The bill, co-authored by Rep. George Miller,
D-Martinez, would provide $2.8 billion per year for 15 years for
on-the-ground restoration and enhancement projects for wildlife
across America.
</P>
<P>
   Bonus salmon: Shasta Lake near Redding has received a bonus of
100,000 king salmon stocked since last November, providing the
opportunity to expand a new trophy fishery at California's biggest
reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Great freebie: Cal/North, a directory of sources for boating,
fishing and diving, is available for free by writing Cal North
Marine, P.O. Box 410483, San Francisco, CA 94141-0483, or phoning
(415)243-0426.
</P>
<P>
   Live animal sales: Eric Mills has emerged as the leader to
promote and enforce laws to prohibit the inhumane treatment of
wildlife in live animal markets. He can be reached at P.O. Box
20184, Oakland, CA 94620.
</P>
<P>
   Learning from California's mistakes: After studying California's
live fish markets, now legal in San Francisco and Oakland
Chinatowns, the Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission voted
unanimously to ban the sale of live fish.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness world record: On a single gallon of fuel, a light
trimaran-type skiff traveled 67.27 miles powered by a Yamaha
4-horsepower, 4-cycle outboard, a new fuel economy record for
boating.
</P>
<P>
   Learn-to-fish clinics: Beginner clinics are set for Saturday and
March 11 at Shadow Cliffs Lake in Pleasanton, limited to 13 people,
$5, advance registration required at (510) 636-1684.
</P>
<P>
   There they go again: Two wild parrots flew over my parents'
house on the Peninsula, then an hour later, there went 16 more,
beautiful and powerful, like a squadron of fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Now full: Lakes filling and spilling this past week in Marin
were Lagunitas, Bon Tempe and Alpine lakes, all set in a row on the
flank of Mount Tamalpais, and in Santa Clara County, Uvas, Vasona,
Guadalupe and Almaden, with Calero and Stevens Creek likely to fill
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Trees don't lie: Hydrologists are privately stunned that
according to tree ring studies, Northern California hasn't had six
straight years of above-normal precipitation since the 1500s _ yet
with another month of average rain, they point out that is exactly
what will have occurred since the winter of 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   And that means: California's 383 lakes you can drive to and 483
significant lakes you can hike to will be full again this spring
and summer, making for a banner nine-month season for camping,
hiking, boating and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Circle this date: Audubon Canyon Ranch near Bolinas Lagoon will
open on March 11, providing an extraordinary view of herons and
egrets courting, mating, nesting and raising their young.
(415)868-9244.
</P>
<P>
   Why sport anglers protest: In 1996, the total landings of marlin
in the Atlantic was 38.2 tons, while the total discard of dead
marlin by commercial fishermen was 335.7 tons, according to the
International Game Fish Association.
</P>
<P>
   Closings &AMP; openings: The fishing season for rockfish off the Bay
Area coast will be closed in March and April. The sport salmon
season opens April 1 in Monterey Bay and Santa Cruz, and April 15
out of the Bay Area ports.

<P>
   QOM, IRAN _ The voice was friendly, elderly, avuncular, so close
to me _ Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri was just three meters (10
feet) away, behind a dividing wall _ that I not only heard his
words through the interphone but the murmur of his actual voice
from the next room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the mouthpieces of the revolution,'' he said.
``But when they treat me, me, like this, how must they be treating
the others?''
</P>
<P>
   It was an eerie experience. To interview the man whom Ayatollah
Khomeini once anointed as his chosen successor is one thing. To
talk to him through a wall after he has spent more than two years
under house arrest in this gold-domed holy city _ two Revolutionary
Guards watching his front door and his every visitor _ was
positively surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the parliamentary elections that have handed
Iran's revolution back to its people, the stubborn old cleric was
still patiently awaiting his freedom _ and condemning the elderly
Islamic clergymen who put him there, who ``did not keep the promise
of the revolution,'' who refuse to yield political power to the
president of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   This was his first interview in captivity _ house arrest was
meant to shut him up.
</P>
<P>
   We had to walk quickly through the back door of the house of
Ayatollah Montazeri's son Ahmed and persuade him to let us talk to
his father through the white cord telephone attached to an inner
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to my home,'' the Ayatollah growled at me in English.
It was one of the few kind things he said. Because the reasons for
Montazeri's house imprisonment _ and the contents of his
extraordinary interview Sunday _ go to the very heart of the crisis
behind last week's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Ayatollah believes that the Supreme Leader of Iran, the
unelected Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, should not hold political power,
should not be able to hinder the reformist movement of President
Mohamed Khatami _ who appears to have received an overwhelming vote
of support in last week's poll.
</P>
<P>
   Did he still believe that the velayat e-faqih _ the institution
of religious guide created by Khomeini and once awarded to him _
had been misused? The voice growled again, this time in Farsi.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an Arabic expression that says: `There's a limit to
all things _ and everything that passes its limit destroys itself.'
If the institution of the Supreme Guide was one of an observer, it
would remain. But if there is dictatorship, it cannot continue...
</P>
<P>
   ``People like me and Mr. (Mohsen) Kadivar (a `reformist' cleric
in Tehran) are sent to prison because these people cannot tolerate
criticism. Yet the Imam Ali always said: `You should criticize me.'
These gentlemen should behave the same way (as the Imam).''
</P>
<P>
   All the while we were speaking to each other through that
whitewashed wall in Qom Sunday, the Ayatollah's son Ahmed stood
beside us, bearded and turbaned, turning at one point to mutter
that ``this is the first time he has given such an interview.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Montazeri expect now to be freed, in the aftermath of
last week's election, to be spared the Ayatollah Khamenei's charge
of ``treason against the revolution?''
</P>
<P>
   Back came the disembodied voice. ``All my hope is in God. But
these people (the conservative clergy) should take note that
keeping me in prison is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Husseiniya (religious teaching school) class next to
my home where I have many Korans and books _ and they took them
from me. I have 3,000 cassettes and audio-equipment and they took
all of it. Even if a person is convicted, they're not allowed to
confiscate his belongings...
</P>
<P>
   ``Our revolution was Islamic and (came about) through the will
of the people. And we asked for independence, for freedom and for
an Islamic Republic. It seems that they (the clergy) have forgotten
freedom. They did not keep the promise of the revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his habit of speaking out which lost Ayatollah Montazeri
the favor of Imam Khomeini. Once described by Khomeini as ``the
fruit of my life,'' he dared to write a letter to the founder of
the Islamic Revolution after the end of the Iran-Iraq War,
condemning the hanging of thousands of young Iranian men and women
accused _ often without proof or fair trials _ of joining the
violent pro-Iraqi ``mujahedin'' opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Khomeini, whose son Ahmed _ also now dead _ is said to have
intercepted the letter, allowed the executions to continue and
dismissed Montazeri as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatollah Khamanei, the man who now holds the job Montazeri was
destined for, was enraged by the latter's subsequent criticism of
his powers.
</P>
<P>
   Our talk Sunday in a tiny apartment off an alleyway in the
suburbs of Qom, suggested that the voice will not be stilled. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 300 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have another expression in Persian that says: `Rights are
something you must seize _ they're not given to you.' The people
had to elect good representatives and oblige them to work in the
people's interest. Violence brings negative results. But they (the
conservative clergy) have created what are called `force groups'
who used violence and attacked people when they wanted to speak
publicly. And they attacked me too. These kinds of action make
people hate religion. But you can never serve the interests of
religion through violence.''
</P>
<P>
   And had he changed his views on the ``velayat e-faqih,'' the
all-powerful institution of the nation's Islamic Guide?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote four books about this,'' came the voice down the
interphone. ``But right now it's not (about) what I wrote in my
books. In our constitutional law, the executive power is separate
from the institution of the Supreme Leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things now are not according to constitutional law here. The
president is supposed to be responsible but the tools of power are
in other people's hands. According to Islam, they should be
separate.''
   And he began to talk about issues he had not chosen to address
so far, the 100 intellectuals and writers, for example, who were
``disappeared'' under the presidency of Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani in the decade up to 1998, the authorities' attack on
Tehran University dormitories last year that led to student riots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election should be enough to stop the bad things they have
been doing in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's said that they have killed 100 innocent people. The
judiciary must follow this up. And when they invaded the
university, they did nothing about those who violated the campus.
But they arrested some of the students. So people should ask for
justice. Our constitution says so.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he agreed, Iranians were happy after their election. ``They
really did their duty and they went to take hold of their destiny.
But if they want to do this, they shouldn't let others decide for
them. Thank God, the people participated well in this election _ I
wish them all success.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,175, OR CONTINUE TO 1,275) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In the meeting room across the tiny hallway, there were
photographs of Montazeri with the murdered Iranian Justice Minister
Ayatollah Behesti _ killed by a ``mujahedin'' bomb after the
revolution _ and of Montazeri's son Mohamed who died in the same
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The voice down the telephone was a lonely one and we gently
offered the only surviving son, Ahmed, the hope that our next
interview would be conducted in a more civilized way. He smiled but
remained silent. I could see why. The family's future depends on
those elections. &QL;

unelected Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, should not hold political power,
should not be able to hinder the reformist movement of President
Mohamed Khatami _ who appears to have received an overwhelming vote
of support in last week's poll.
</P>
<P>
   Did he still believe that the velayat e-faqih _ the institution
of religious guide created by Khomeini and once awarded to him _
had been misused? The voice growled again, this time in Farsi.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an Arabic expression that says: `There's a limit to
all things _ and everything that passes its limit destroys itself.'
If the institution of the Supreme Guide was one of an observer, it
would remain. But if there is dictatorship, it cannot continue...
</P>
<P>
   ``People like me and Mr. (Mohsen) Kadivar (a `reformist' cleric
in Tehran) are sent to prison because these people cannot tolerate
criticism. Yet the Imam Ali always said: `You should criticize me.'
These gentlemen should behave the same way (as the Imam).''
</P>
<P>
   All the while we were speaking to each other through that
whitewashed wall in Qom Sunday, the Ayatollah's son Ahmed stood
beside us, bearded and turbaned, turning at one point to mutter
that ``this is the first time he has given such an interview.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Montazeri expect now to be freed, in the aftermath of
last week's election, to be spared the Ayatollah Khamenei's charge
of ``treason against the revolution?''
</P>
<P>
   Back came the disembodied voice. ``All my hope is in God. But
these people (the conservative clergy) should take note that
keeping me in prison is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Husseiniya (religious teaching school) class next to
my home where I have many Korans and books _ and they took them
from me. I have 3,000 cassettes and audio-equipment and they took
all of it. Even if a person is convicted, they're not allowed to
confiscate his belongings...
</P>
<P>
   ``Our revolution was Islamic and (came about) through the will
of the people. And we asked for independence, for freedom and for
an Islamic Republic. It seems that they (the clergy) have forgotten
freedom. They did not keep the promise of the revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his habit of speaking out which lost Ayatollah Montazeri
the favor of Imam Khomeini. Once described by Khomeini as ``the
fruit of my life,'' he dared to write a letter to the founder of
the Islamic Revolution after the end of the Iran-Iraq War,
condemning the hanging of thousands of young Iranian men and women
accused _ often without proof or fair trials _ of joining the
violent pro-Iraqi ``mujahedin'' opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Khomeini, whose son Ahmed _ also now dead _ is said to have
intercepted the letter, allowed the executions to continue and
dismissed Montazeri as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatollah Khamanei, the man who now holds the job Montazeri was
destined for, was enraged by the latter's subsequent criticism of
his powers.
</P>
<P>
   Our talk Sunday in a tiny apartment off an alleyway in the
suburbs of Qom, suggested that the voice will not be stilled. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 300 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have another expression in Persian that says: `Rights are
something you must seize _ they're not given to you.' The people
had to elect good representatives and oblige them to work in the
people's interest. Violence brings negative results. But they (the
conservative clergy) have created what are called `force groups'
who used violence and attacked people when they wanted to speak
publicly. And they attacked me too. These kinds of action make
people hate religion. But you can never serve the interests of
religion through violence.''
</P>
<P>
   And had he changed his views on the ``velayat e-faqih,'' the
all-powerful institution of the nation's Islamic Guide?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote four books about this,'' came the voice down the
interphone. ``But right now it's not (about) what I wrote in my
books. In our constitutional law, the executive power is separate
from the institution of the Supreme Leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things now are not according to constitutional law here. The
president is supposed to be responsible but the tools of power are
in other people's hands. According to Islam, they should be
separate.''
</P>
<P>
   And he began to talk about issues he had not chosen to address
so far, the 100 intellectuals and writers, for example, who were
``disappeared'' under the presidency of Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani in the decade up to 1998, the authorities' attack on
Tehran University dormitories last year that led to student riots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election should be enough to stop the bad things they have
been doing in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's said that they have killed 100 innocent people. The
judiciary must follow this up. And when they invaded the
university, they did nothing about those who violated the campus.
But they arrested some of the students. So people should ask for
justice. Our constitution says so.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he agreed, Iranians were happy after their election. ``They
really did their duty and they went to take hold of their destiny.
But if they want to do this, they shouldn't let others decide for
them. Thank God, the people participated well in this election _ I
wish them all success.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,175, OR CONTINUE TO 1,275) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In the meeting room across the tiny hallway, there were
photographs of Montazeri with the murdered Iranian Justice Minister
Ayatollah Behesti _ killed by a ``mujahedin'' bomb after the
revolution _ and of Montazeri's son Mohamed who died in the same
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The voice down the telephone was a lonely one and we gently
offered the only surviving son, Ahmed, the hope that our next
interview would be conducted in a more civilized way. He smiled but
remained silent. I could see why. The family's future depends on
those elections. &QL;

 &HT;    NEW JUDGE ASSIGNED IN ELIAN CASE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A new judge was assigned the case of 6-year-old Cuban
rafter Elian Gonzalez Tuesday after his predecessor fell ill, a
move that will likely delay for two weeks a crucial hearing that
could determine the boy's fate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Michael Moore was randomly assigned the case
by computer after Judge William Hoeveler suffered a stroke over the
weekend. Hoeveler, 77, was scheduled to preside over a hearing
Tuesday on jurisdictional issues, but Chief Judge Edward Davis told
attorneys that Judge Moore will be taking the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Moore assured me he would be able to meet the deadline
Judge Hoeveler set,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   That deadline calls for a final hearing on the matter to be held
the week of March 6. But Moore could decide _ or could be asked by
attorneys _ to hold a hearing earlier than March 6 to consider the
question of whether the federal courts have jurisdiction over
immigration matters, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The court proceedings came as the furor over the boy continued
on both sides of the Florida Straits _ in Miami and Havana _ with
charges of spying, secret desires to defect and family intrigue
swirling around a custody battle that has become a nasty
international tug-of-war.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found floating in an inner tube off Fort Lauderdale on
Thanksgiving Day, after his mother and 10 other people died when
their boat sank as they attempted to flee Cuba for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The boy has been living in Miami since then with the family of
his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. Federal immigration officials
have ruled that Elian should be returned to his father in Cuba, but
his Miami relatives have gone to court to try to keep the boy in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Cuban tourism worker Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has
repeatedly demanded that the U.S. government return his son. But he
has refused to come to the United States country to claim him,
saying he fears for his safety in Miami's volatile exile community.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez has also asked U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno to move the boy to the Miami home of Manuel Gonzalez, a
relative who favors returning Elian to Cuba. Immigration officials
have denied the request, saying it would be too disruptive for the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Gonzalez appeared in court Tuesday with lawyers who filed
a motion on his behalf asking for custody of Elian. As he left the
federal courthouse, Manuel Gonzalez was rushed by several dozen
angry, flag-waving Cuban exiles shouting ``traitor,'' and
``communista.''
</P>
<P>
   He met with his brother, Lazaro Gonzalez, to discuss the case
Monday night. But neither side would say what happened during the
family conference. After the meeting, Manuel Gonzalez, a bus
mechanic for the Miami-Dade School System, suffered heart
palpitations and was taken to a hospital. He was later released.
</P>
<P>
   In another legal move in the case, the American Civil Liberties
Union filed a friend-of-the-court brief Tuesday, asking the court
to reject arguments on both sides and to respect the principle that
parents have a constitutional right to custody of their children.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives' lawyers wished Hoeveler a speedy recovery
and welcomed Moore to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tries a lot of cases. He moves very firmly and
decisively,'' Kendall Coffey, a member of their legal team, told
Reuters of Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Cuban officials denied stunning allegations
leveled by a Miami nun, Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, who hosted a
high-profile reunion between Elian and his grandmothers in late
January. O'Laughlin told the Miami Herald that she believes Elian
should stay in the United States because one of his grandmothers
wants to defect, and because his father allegedly physically abused
the boy's mother. She also says the Cuban family knew of Elian's
mother's plans to flee the island.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin has refused to say where she learned the information,
but has given a sworn affidavit to the Miami family's attorneys
that reveals her sources. Since hosting the reunion as a ``neutral
observer,'' O'Laughlin has become a strong advocate of keeping
Elian in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section in Washington denied
O'Laughlin's charges. The official also said there was no
connection between the Elian case and a Cuban diplomat who was
given seven days to leave the country last Saturday, because of his
alleged involvement with a federal immigration official arrested
two days before in Miami and charged with spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The wild gyrations in the case have become almost routine, as
Elian has come to symbolize the deep hatred between Cuba's
communist government and Miami's Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials decried the arrest of the immigration official
and the expulsion order for the diplomat, saying the moves were
part of a plot to keep Elian in the United States. The unnamed
diplomat has been the ``victim of a brutal provocation and a vile
calumny,'' said a statement issued by the Cuban government, which
has refused to call him home.

BRINGING UP BABY VERY CAREFULLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The four-hour Academy Award show is tedious. The
jokes often fall flat. The musical numbers can be _ let's face it _
embarrassing. The scripted patter between movie stars is silly. And
the plethora of awards leaves television viewers _ especially on
the East Coast _ numb and sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet who doesn't endure the Oscar show?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a show that everyone has an opinion about,'' said Richard
D. Zanuck, the new co-producer of the 72nd annual Academy Awards
which will be televised on March 26 on ABC. ``We're putting
ourselves on the line on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   His co-producer and wife, Lili Fini Zanuck, was blunter. ``It's
a thankless job. It's like we had a baby and everyone was giving us
advice on how to raise it.'' She laughed. ``The day after the
Oscars we may just go flee to the Antarctic. Or start making movies
in Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful that the Zanucks _ who won an Academy Award
themselves for producing the 1989 film ``Driving Daisy'' _ will
wind up in Antarctica or Hong Kong. But they are aware that as a
television production, the Oscar show, while still very successful,
has suffered audience erosion in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Oscar broadcast saw a significant ratings drop
over 1998, drawing at least 10 percent fewer viewers. The numbers
were still huge _ by ABC's own estimate the number of viewers who
watched at least some part of the show was 78 million. But this was
down from 87 million a year before. Even more worrisome to ABC and
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which presents the
Oscars, was that the telecast _ the longest on record at four hours
and five minutes _ was the lowest rated Oscar show since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   To Oscar aficionados, the show is essentially an extravaganza of
glitz, drama, bad jokes, tackiness and genuine emotion. ``The
patter between stars is always horrible _ and those dance
numbers!'' said Damien Bona, co-author with Mason Wiley of ``Inside
Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bona added: ``But people love watching the show because it's a
contest _like the Super Bowl or `Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'
There's still suspense. And as jaded as people may be, you can't
deny the glamour of it. It's a chance to see famous movie stars
more or less be themselves, and there's always the possibility that
someone will make a fool of themselves. That's always fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In taking over the show from Gil Cates, who produced the last
three Oscar presentations _ and a total of nine in the last 15
years _ the Zanucks made it plain that this year's program at the
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles will seek to be, first and
foremost, shorter. The goal is three and a half hours, not four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually watch the show at home with friends, and we're
using that as a barometer for the decisions we're making,'' said
Zanuck. ``We're saying, `Is this the place we would have gotten up
to get some food?' When did we start talking during the show? When
did we lose interest? When did interest peak?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've changed everything to some degree,'' Zanuck added.
``We've put some spin on every aspect of the show. And the pacing
will be much closer to what the audience today expects.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the Zanucks cut out all the dance numbers
_choreographed in recent years by Debbie Allen _ that exasperated
many viewers. There have been such blunders as a kind of
jitterbugging Daisy (as in ``Driving Daisy'') and a singing Telly
Savalas. In 1986 Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin were asked to sing a
version of Frank Loesser's ``Fugue for Tinhorns from ``Guys and
Dolls.'' After being rejected by the crooners, the Academy was left
with an incongruous trio: Dom De Luise, Pat Morita and, once more,
Telly Savalas.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most famous, or infamous, dance number was on the
1989 show, produced by Allan Carr, the impresario whose earlier
projects included ``Grease'' and the Broadway msical ``La Cage aux
Folles'' and who died last year. The opening sequence, borrowed
from a campy San Francisco musical called ``Beach Blanket
Babylon,'' saw an actress playing Snow White alongside a singing
and dancing Rob Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the worst,'' said Robert Osborne, author of ``70
Years of the Oscar: The Official History of the Academy Awards,''
``Rob Lowe said he looked out at the audience and saw Meryl Streep
making a face.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse for Carr, he produced an elaborate nightclub sequence
designed to show great elderly movie stars. But the only stars he
managed to snare were Roy Rogers, Dale Evans, Vincent Price, Coral
Browne, Tony Martin, Alice Faye, Cyd Charisse and a few others.
``That show was a train wreck,'' said Osborne. ``Poor Allan Carr.
He never got over it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With Carr's disaster very much in their minds the Zanucks
resolved not only to eliminate all dance numbers (unhappy
choreographers have sent protest letters to the academy as well as
to the Zanucks) but to simplify the musical selections for the five
nominated songs. The performers from the soundtracks _ such as Phil
Collins singing ``You'll Be in My Heart,'' from ``Tarzan,'' or
Aimee Mann singing ``Save Me,'' from ``Magnolia,'' will perform.
The new music directors will be the Oscar-winning Burt Bacharach
and Grammy-winning Don Was.
</P>
<P>
   Zanuck spoke diplomatically about the issue. ``We just don't
think dance is part of the vocabulary of motion pictures today,''
she said. ``It works for the Tony Awards, which honors Broadway
shows. It works for the MTV awards. It's organic to their process.
It's no longer organic to the filmmaking process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zanucks have also decreed that there will not be any
politicians or government officials at the show: last year, Gen.
Colin L. Powell and Sen. John Glenn made separate appearances, and
both men _ as well as the audience _ seemed a little perplexed
about why they were there. Billy Crystal will return for a seventh
stint as the Oscar host, a relief to the Zanucks after last year
when the host, Whoopi Goldberg, was criticized by newspaper
reviewers for her sometimes raunchy jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Zanuck, who is 65, said he had probably been present at more
Academy Award shows than anyone else. He began attending them at
age 7, riding in a limousine with his father, Darryl F. Zanuck, the
legendary producer and chairman of 20th Century Fox. He recalled
that his father won three Irving Thalberg awards, was nominated
numerous times for top awards and won the Oscar three times. As a
studio chairman himself, the younger Zanuck won best picture awards
for ``The Sound of Music,'' ``Patton'' and ``The French
Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Zanuck said there will be no written dialogue for the presenters
_ critics often said the patter was lame and unfunny. And to speed
up the proceedings, presenters will have three ways of entering the
stage: quickly, not-so-quickly and slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly will be for glamour queens, divas and most popular
younger female stars like Gwyneth Paltrow. Audiences want to see
what these actresses are wearing. Quickly, will be for those
presenters (picture, say, an older actor or a director) whose black
tie outfit may not be a source of fascination but whose comments
may be. At this point, no one is quite sure what types of
presenters will fall into the middle category.
</P>
<P>
   Most certainly, a highlight _ and almost guaranteed to produce a
standing ovation _ will be the appearance of Jane Fonda, who
retired from acting years ago. Fonda won best actress Academy
Awards for ``Klute'' in 1971 and ``Coming Home'' in 1978. She has
not made an appearance on the show since 1992. After her recent
separation from her husband, Ted Turner, she agreed to attend the
ceremonies in what some Hollywood producers see as, perhaps, an
attempt to return to movies. Zanuck said she asked Paula Weinstein,
a producer and friend of Fonda's, to invite the actress. Fonda will
present an honorary Oscar to the Polish filmmaker Andrzej Wajda,
whose films include ``Ashes and Diamonds'' and ``Kanal.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Zanucks seek is, of course, drama and surprise on the
part of the winners. ``It's those moments you remember _ Charlie
Chaplin coming back, last year when Sophia Loren appeared, the year
the streaker showed up onstage, Cuba Gooding winning, Jack Palance
doing his pushups,'' said Zanuck. ``Those are the great moments of
the Oscars.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's the not-so-great moments the producers worry about.
``Allan Carr never got over it,'' said Zanuck. ``People were so
mean. You can fail in such a public way. And that's a little
frightening.''

 &HT;    NEW JUDGE ASSIGNED IN ELIAN CASE

   MIAMI _ A new judge was assigned the case of 6-year-old Cuban
rafter Elian Gonzalez Tuesday after his predecessor fell ill, a
move that will likely delay for two weeks a crucial hearing that
could determine the boy's fate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Michael Moore was randomly assigned the case

O'Laughlin's charges. The official also said there was no
connection between the Elian case and a Cuban diplomat who was
given seven days to leave the country last Saturday, because of his
alleged involvement with a federal immigration official arrested
two days before in Miami and charged with spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The wild gyrations in the case have become almost routine, as
Elian has come to symbolize the deep hatred between Cuba's
communist government and Miami's Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials decried the arrest of the immigration official
and the expulsion order for the diplomat, saying the moves were
part of a plot to keep Elian in the United States. The unnamed
diplomat has been the ``victim of a brutal provocation and a vile
calumny,'' said a statement issued by the Cuban government, which
has refused to call him home.

page-turners for summertime beach enjoyment and more thoughtful
books for stuffing Christmas stockings. But now, publishers are
blurring the lines, and more and more books by bestselling authors
are being released periodically during the year. Some say this is a
result of the reader-friendly environment created at
mega-bookstores, which have become combination Starbucks/libraries.

<P>
   &UR; TWO VIEWS OF SAN FRANCISCO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One person loved San Francisco and one hated it, and they both
wrote essays in last week's travel section of the Toronto Globe &AMP;
Mail, forwarded to Personals by  &UR; Bob Burgess &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco fan was  &UR; Steve Wright &LR; , who described one
delicious afternoon here, in what he calls ``the crown jewel of the
West Coast.'' After eight hours in the city, writes Wright, ``San
Francisco's sights and sounds dance through your head. Before your
head hits the pillow, think of the cafes of North Beach, the seals
lounging at the bay, the stunning vistas and architecture ... the
pleasures of a day stolen in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Anne Fenn &LR; , on the other hand, responds to Conde Nast
Traveler's having named San Francisco the No. 1 city in the United
States. ``Either there's a mono-cultural conspiracy at play,'' she
writes, ``or someone's asleep at the wheel of the Zeitgeist
Commission, because the truth is that Haight-Ashbury, Berkeley and
Castro have been usurped by Banana Republic, Starbucks and the
Gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenn calls San Francisco ``the workaholic domain of Ikea Boy.
The most successful `alternative' city in North America is the
victim of its own success, its dynamic countercultural dimensions
all but consumed by consumerism. ... The coolest thing left in San
Francisco is the fog.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PEGGY LEE SENDS COMFORT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marc Huestis  &LR; forwards &UR; Rex Reed &LR; 's New York Observer
description of spending a horrendous night in jail after being
charged (erroneously and unfairly, he says claims &LR; ) with
shoplifting some CDs, including one by  &UR; Peggy Lee &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   On Valentine's Day, he writes, two days after the incident, ``I
got a call from Peggy Lee's press agent, who told me she was so
thrilled I wanted one of her CDs enough to put myself through so
much hell that she was sending me her entire collection.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `BUG SONGS' AND OTHER GIGS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Reading about the barbershop quartet that turned down a gig to
sing bug songs, a first-grade teacher in the neighborhood says that
her students would have filled the gig readily. ``We are rife with
bug songs,'' she writes, ``and always in need of a bit of extra
cash.'' And  &UR; Byron Bolling &LR;  suggests, &LR;  ``Bee My Love,'' ``Ant
Misbehavin,'' ``Gnat Now My Love,'' ``Shoo Fly'' and ``Glow Little
Glow Worm.''
</P>
<P>
   And  &UR; Joshua Raoul Brody &LR;  says that his group, the Stupeds, has
accepted a gig to dress as ``revolutionaries'' _ berets and combat
gear _ for a party celebrating some ``revolutionary'' high-tech
innovation. The group has been practicing songs by the Beatles,
 &UR; Tracy Chapman &LR; , the Jefferson Airplane, Rolling Stones and
Temptations that have ``revolution'' in the name or lyrics, ``or
even remotely related to protest (`People Got to Be Free') or
rebellion (`Rebel Yell').'' The Stupeds aren't sure, though, that
anyone will get the concept.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Inspired by BART ticket machine signs that warn ``Soft Old
Bills Jam,''  &UR; Gar Smith &LR;  is trying to assemble a Dixieland band
``comprised exclusively of pudgy retirees named William.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE VOGUE FOR UGLY &LR;  With Americans by the SUV-full flocking to
Target, Restoration Hardware and Ikea, the masses are honing in on
good taste. In response, says the Wall Street Journal, hip
tastemakers are going for the ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good taste is a bore,'' said  &UR; Joe Holtzman &LR;  of New York, whose
neighbors looked into his apartment across an alley and put up a
sign that said ``Ugly.'' Holtzman had covered everything in his
kitchen (floors, ceiling and walls) with a loud '70s geometric
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be the cognoscenti had style and everyone else was
out of date. Now, everything has gone too tasteful and groovy,''
said  &UR; Simon Doonan &LR; , creative director of Barneys New York. Doonan
quoted style icon  &UR; Diana Vreeland &LR; : ``Vulgarity is a very important
ingredient in life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard her version, and I think it is sensual and
mystical. I also feel that she's chosen autobiographical verses
that reflect her career and personal history. I hope it will cause
people to ask what's happening to music in America. I have received
many gifts from God, but this is the first time I have ever
received a gift from a goddess.''
</P>

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Two Brands of Spinach Leave Others Behind   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  After mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese,
there may be no more comforting food than creamed spinach. Thanks
to companies making convenience products, it's possible to have
creamed spinach any time in a matter of minutes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted five brands of creamed spinach from the
freezer section. All were cooked in the microwave according to
package directions. All of the products can also be boiled in their
bags or baked in a conventional oven.
</P>
<P>
   Two brands ranked quite well, but the others fell seriously
short. The biggest complaint was the texture of the spinach, which
many panelists found tough and stringy. The panel also thought many
of the products were too salty _ sodium content ranged from 270 mg
to a whopping 1,170 mg, which is almost half of the recommended
daily allowance of sodium.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stouffer's &LR;  (nine ounces, $2.69 at Andronico's) was the panel's
favorite. Four panelists particularly liked the flavor, two of them
also commenting on the nice texture. But one panelist thought there
was too much sauce in proportion to the spinach, and another
thought the spinach tasted old. Four would buy it; one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular brand among panelists was  &UR; Seabrook Farms &LR;  (nine
ounces, $1.55 at Safeway). Two panelists thought it had the most
true spinach taste and was nicely seasoned, but one described it as
bland. Others detected a metallic finish. Three would buy it, one
might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Scores dropped by more than thirty points to third place which
went to  &UR; Green Giant &LR;  (10 ounces, $1.89-$2.19 at many
supermarkets). Some panelists liked the larger leaves, but others
found them cumbersome. Tasters also complained about the chemical
butter flavor. One pointed out that some of the spinach leaves were
flecked with brown, as though they were old. One might buy it; four
would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Boston Market &LR;  (10 ounces, $1.89-$2.09 at many supermarkets)
came in fourth. Panelists disliked the heavy garlic flavor and the
saltiness (this brand had the highest sodium content). Some also
complained that the spinach tasted undercooked and stringy. One
might buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists also tasted Tabatchnick but it scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Lynne Bennett, California Culinary Academy
graduate; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Marc Halperin, culinary
director, Center for Culinary Development; Kim Severson, Chronicle
staff writer; Roland Passot, chef-owner of La Folie in San
Francisco and Left Bank in Larkspur and Menlo ParkKirk Webber,
chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are tasted
blind. &QL;

 BEST WAY: Olive Oil-Red Wine Vinaigrette   By Margarita Camacho 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Vinaigrette is just a basic salad dressing of oil
and vinegar with salt _ or is it? Although it's simple to make,
there's a lot more to it than just whisking the three ingredients
together.
<P>
   The types of oil and vinegar play major parts in making a good
vinaigrette. But what about the ratio of oil to vinegar? What
amount of salt should be added? And when? We set out to answer
these questions, using packaged spring mix to test several
vinaigrettes.
</P>
<P>
   Food department staffers liked the flavor of extra virgin olive
oil and chose Fini brand; it was not bland yet did not have overly
fruity or woody characteristics. Paired with the greens, it didn't
overpower them.
</P>
<P>
   For the vinegar, we chose Eden Selected Red Wine Vinegar from
among several supermarket varieties for its flavor balance.
</P>
<P>
   After determining which oil and vinegar to use, the fun began.
We tested six ratios of olive oil to vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   By unanimous decision, the winning ratio was 1 part vinegar to 2
parts olive oil. Not only did this blend have the best balance of
flavor, but it was also the easiest to emulsify.
</P>
<P>
   After picking this ratio, we tested how much salt to add and
when to add it. We added kosher salt, in various amounts, at the
beginning, middle and end of making the dressing, and found that,
for one cup of dressing, one teaspoon added at the end of
emulsifying the oil and vinegar produced the best flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The best vinaigrette was 1 part vinegar to 2 parts olive oil,
with one teaspoon of kosher salt added at the end of
emulsification. Adding freshly ground black pepper to taste
completes it.

COURT TO TAKE CASE OF DRUG-SNIFFING DOGS AT ROADBLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mich., Ind., Ill.)   (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A decade after upholding the use of roadblocks to
catch drunken drivers, the Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide
whether adding a drug-sniffing dog to the checkpoint renders the
practice unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The justices accepted an appeal from the city of Indianapolis,
where the use of drug-detection roadblocks was declared
unconstitutional last year by a federal appeals court. Courts
around the country have differed on the legality of this
increasingly popular law-enforcement technique.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Judge Richard Posner, writing for the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in Chicago, said that in contrast to the
safety rationale that justified the sobriety checkpoints, the
drug-detection roadblocks appeared to be little more than ``a
pretext for a dragnet search for criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Posner said the Indianapolis program ``belongs to the genre of
general programs of surveillance which invade privacy wholesale in
order to discover evidence of crime,'' amounting to an unreasonable
search under the Fourth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis set up the drug roadblocks six times during 1998,
stopping 1,161 cars and making 55 arrests for transporting
narcotics as well as 49 arrests for other misconduct. The program
was challenged in a class-action lawsuit brought by the Indiana
Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   In its Supreme Court appeal, Indianapolis vs. Edmond, No.
99-1030, the city is arguing that the relatively high number of
arrests demonstrates the program's usefulness as well as dimension
of the drug problem it was designed to attack.
</P>
<P>
   The city noted that the Supreme Court had ruled in 1983 that a
``canine sniff'' by a trained drug-detecting dog involves such a
minimal intrusion that it is not a search for purposes of the
Fourth Amendment, which bars unreasonable search and seizure.
Consequently, the city is arguing, adding this element to a lawful
roadblock could not logically result in a Fourth Amendment
violation.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in a 1990 case, Michigan vs. Sitz, that
a sobriety checkpoint, while constituting a seizure, was not
unreasonable because the interest in public safety outweighed the
minimal intrusion on a driver's time and privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion for the appeals court panel, in which he was
joined by Judge Diane P. Wood, Posner said the Michigan case stood
for the principle that the general rule requiring the police to
have a specific basis for stopping someone could be relaxed for a
purpose other than crime detection, such as public safety.
``Catching crooks'' was not such a purpose, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting in the 2-1 decision, Judge Frank H. Easterbrook said
that state and local governments should have the flexibility to
choose the law enforcement methods they prefer. ``The real threat
to civil liberties comes from the national government, not from
law-enforcement variations that can be avoided by driving a few
miles to the east or west,'' he said.

 Chefs Flock to San Francisco to Vie for $1 Million Prize
in  Pillsbury's 50th Bake-Off   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Forget the World Series, the Super Bowl and the
Final Four. The mother of all competitions hits San Francisco
Monday when 100 home cooks from across the country go
spatula-to-spatula in the Pillsbury Bake-Off.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's battle for kitchen bragging rights promises to be
bigger and better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the prize money: A cool million bucks for the
kitchen gladiator whose dish beats out 99 other casseroles, cakes
and canapes, plus $54,000 in prize money for the runners-up.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it's the 50th anniversary of the contest, which has been
growing in popularity and prize money ever since Eleanor Roosevelt
handed out the first check in 1949. To commemorate a half-century
of Poppin' Fresh Barbecups and Tunnel of Fudge cakes, Pillsbury has
created a Hall of Fame featuring the all-time 10 most popular
Bake-Off recipes and donated a package of memorabilia to the
Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pillsbury Bake-Off contest reflects changing tastes and
lifestyles in the United States over the last three generations,''
says Fath Davis Ruffins, Smithsonian museum historian.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes reveal America's moves into convenience food in the
'60s, into health food in the '70s and into microwave cooking and
more ethnic ingredients in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   This year's entries show that American cooks have fully embraced
cooking styles and ingredients already common in many Bay Area
kitchens. Roasted vegetables are popular. Portobello mushrooms,
which barely registered a blip among the tens of thousands of
recipes submitted to the Bake-Off two years ago, are prominent.
Butter, after taking a back seat to margarine, is back. And
desserts have gone through a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like after going through the death-by-chocolate '80s
and early '90s, we're seeing a lot of fruit everywhere,'' says
Pillsbury spokeswoman Marlene Johnson, a 20-year veteran of the
Bake-Off. ``Chocolate is number one but, boy, is there a lot of
fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Most striking, however, is that middle America's home cooks are
wading into the world of fusion and ethnic flavors. Mexican and
Latin American flavors show up in force, although that could be in
part because eight of the 29 official ingredients contestants had
to pick from were Old El Paso brands. (Pillsbury flour _ the
product the Bake-Off was invented to promote _ is not among the
official qualifying ingredients.) Salsas and chutneys abound, and
recipes use ingredients such as coconut milk, tamarind and lemon
grass.
</P>
<P>
   Bake-Off recipes, which are usually more suited for Women's Day
than Gourmet, are the most sophisticated and diverse ever. Gone are
the days when cheddar and Swiss were the most exotic cheeses. This
year, Asiago, feta and Gorgonzola are in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recipes reflect what happens when fusion meets the
heartland. Consider Mandarin Chicken Salad Pizza from a Kansas
contestant or Thai Chicken Crescent Potsticker Sandwiches from a
Michigan finalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting boldness and authenticity from ethnic
ingredients and they aren't afraid to mix and match styles,''
Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   A supper recipe submitted by one of the 11 California finalists
reflects that boldness, Johnson says. Julie Stutzman, 41, from
Martinez, the only finalist from the Bay Area, hopes her
Turkey-Mango Picadillo Wraps will catch the judge's fancy. She's
competing in the ``Easy Weeknight Meals'' category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping the mango-raisin combination is innovative enough,
but I don't know,'' she says. ``It's a little unique in that it's
not casserole-y. It's a lot lighter.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Stutzman's first venture in the world of cooking contests,
but she's been around them all her life. Her mother, 72-year-old
Barbara Morgan of Concord, is a two-time Pillsbury Bake-Off
finalist and a winner of several other, smaller competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Mother told daughter that becoming one of a hundred finalists
among tens of thousands of entries is really the prize. And
already, Stutzman, executive development director of the non-profit
Ruth Bancroft Garden in Walnut Creek, received $100 and a new
General Electric Advantium oven that's supposed to cook food in a
quarter of the time a conventional oven does.
</P>
<P>
   She is looking forward to four days of being pampered and
catered to in her free room at the Marriott Hotel, the event's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're treated like royalty,` Stutzman says.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants spend Monday cooking in fully stocked,
individual kitchenettes built around new stoves trucked in by GE
especially for the contest. Each will be calibrated and leveled, so
no one can complain about having bad equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury staffers buy enough ingredients so each finalist can
make as many as three batches before selecting one for the judges _
12 food writers and editors _ who are sequestered nearby.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the winner will be announced on national television.
The show airs live at 11 a.m. on the East Coast and is tape-delayed
to be shown at 10 a.m. on the West Coaston KPIX (Channel 5).
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically we pre-empt half of `The Price is Right,''' Johnson
says.
</P>
<P>

judges only, but the public can attend the following two events
and, of course, watch the announcement of the winner on television.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Creamy Lemon Pasta Dances on Your Tongue   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  I'm in love with the Linguine with Lemon Cream at
Mescolanza, a charming neighborhood Italian restaurant in the
Richmond District.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's so simple _ only six ingredients, counting the pasta _ but
the end result is extraordinary. The flavors of cream, butter and
Parmesan cheese set off the fresh lemon. And the amazing thing is,
the dish has an intense taste without having to add lemon zest: the
flavor comes from the juice alone.
</P>
<P>
   In the restaurant, the dish is served without any garnish. At
home, this pasta can become the base for many versions. I love it
with fresh lemon thyme or tarragon sprinkled on top. It's also
exceptional with sauteed shrimp or broccoli rabe.
</P>
<P>
   Mescolanza opened in 1987, but was purchased in 1998 by Maria
and Ruben Macedo, who had been cooking at the restaurant since it
opened.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are reasonable _ most items are less than $12 _ and the
recently redone interior makes this restaurant a cut above the
typical neighborhood trattoria.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Mescolanza, 2221 Clement St. (between 23rd and 24th &LR; 
 &LR; streets), San Francisco; (415) 668-2221. Dinner nightly. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECRETS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Lots of lemon. &LR;  The juice of five lemons seems like a lot,
but this amount gives the sauce a fresh intensity without having to
grate or chop the zest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ The utter simplicity. &LR;  The play between the cream, butter,
Parmesan and lemon juice is invigorating.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LINGUINE WITH LEMON CREAM
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound dried linguine
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt + salt for cooking pasta
</P>
<P>
   21/2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 5 lemons
</P>
<P>
   1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground white pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Cook the linguine in a large pot of generously salted water
until tender but still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, combine the cream, lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt
in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. Add the
cheese and butter. Stir constantly until the sauce thickens, about
5 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the pasta. Transfer to a large serving bowl. Pour sauce
over; toss to coat. Season with white pepper.
</P>

   Serves 6.

   With nearly 100 categories, there will be plenty of winners at
tonight's Grammy Awards. With nearly 1,000 nominees, there will be
plenty of losers, too.
</P>
<P>
   For both, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences,
which sponsors the Grammys, is putting on one big party down the
street so nominees can either a) celebrate their victories or b)
drown their sorrows.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Grammy party, produced by veteran entertainment
industry party-giver Mary Micucci of Along Comes Mary Productions,
will take over the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It will feature performances by several nominees, including
trad-country stalwarts Asleep at the Wheel with Dwight Yoakam;
jazzbos Manhattan Transfer with Marty Stuart; revived '60s rockers
Eric Burdon &AMP; the New Animals with Spencer Davis and John Mayall;
r&AMP;b classicists the Bar-Kays; Latin jazzers the Pete Escovedo
Orchestra, Poncho Sanchez and Tito Puente; and other jazz, techno,
zydeco and chamber-music artists.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrants will be dining on some of the area's top food,
too, with a spread presided over by the Biltmore's executive chef,
Roger Pigozzi.
</P>
<P>
   They include Southwestern chefs (and radio hosts) Mary Sue
Milliken and Susan Feniger of Border Grill and Ciudad; postmodern
sushi star Nobu Matsuhisa of Matsuhisa; Takashi ``Fred'' Iwasaki of
Wolfgang Puck's Chinois on Main; Euro-eclecticist Hans Rockenwagner
of Rockenwagner and Rock; Cuban-Asian experimentalist Xiomara
Ardolina of Pasadena's Xiomara; Angelo Auriana of the Italianate
heaven Valentino and the chefs of two of Joachim Splichal's
sterling restaurant group, Walter Manzke of Patina and Joseph

<P>
   &UR; TWO VIEWS OF SAN FRANCISCO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One person loved San Francisco and one hated it, and they both
wrote essays in last week's travel section of the Toronto Globe &AMP;
Mail, forwarded to Personals by  &UR; Bob Burgess &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco fan was  &UR; Steve Wright &LR; , who described one
delicious afternoon here, in what he calls ``the crown jewel of the
West Coast.'' After eight hours in the city, writes Wright, ``San
Francisco's sights and sounds dance through your head. Before your
head hits the pillow, think of the cafes of North Beach, the seals
lounging at the bay, the stunning vistas and architecture ... the
pleasures of a day stolen in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Anne Fenn &LR; , on the other hand, responds to Conde Nast
Traveler's having named San Francisco the No. 1 city in the United
States. ``Either there's a mono-cultural conspiracy at play,'' she
writes, ``or someone's asleep at the wheel of the Zeitgeist
Commission, because the truth is that Haight-Ashbury, Berkeley and
Castro have been usurped by Banana Republic, Starbucks and the
Gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenn calls San Francisco ``the workaholic domain of Ikea Boy.
The most successful `alternative' city in North America is the
victim of its own success, its dynamic countercultural dimensions
all but consumed by consumerism. ... The coolest thing left in San
Francisco is the fog.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PEGGY LEE SENDS COMFORT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marc Huestis  &LR; forwards &UR; Rex Reed &LR; 's New York Observer
description of spending a horrendous night in jail after being
charged (erroneously and unfairly, he says claims &LR; ) with
shoplifting some CDs, including one by  &UR; Peggy Lee &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   On Valentine's Day, he writes, two days after the incident, ``I
got a call from Peggy Lee's press agent, who told me she was so
thrilled I wanted one of her CDs enough to put myself through so
much hell that she was sending me her entire collection.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `BUG SONGS' AND OTHER GIGS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Reading about the barbershop quartet that turned down a gig to
sing bug songs, a first-grade teacher in the neighborhood says that
her students would have filled the gig readily. ``We are rife with
bug songs,'' she writes, ``and always in need of a bit of extra
cash.'' And  &UR; Byron Bolling &LR;  suggests, &LR;  ``Bee My Love,'' ``Ant
Misbehavin,'' ``Gnat Now My Love,'' ``Shoo Fly'' and ``Glow Little
Glow Worm.''
</P>
<P>
   And  &UR; Joshua Raoul Brody &LR;  says that his group, the Stupeds, has
accepted a gig to dress as ``revolutionaries'' _ berets and combat
gear _ for a party celebrating some ``revolutionary'' high-tech
innovation. The group has been practicing songs by the Beatles,
 &UR; Tracy Chapman &LR; , the Jefferson Airplane, Rolling Stones and
Temptations that have ``revolution'' in the name or lyrics, ``or
even remotely related to protest (`People Got to Be Free') or
rebellion (`Rebel Yell').'' The Stupeds aren't sure, though, that
anyone will get the concept.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Inspired by BART ticket machine signs that warn ``Soft Old
Bills Jam,''  &UR; Gar Smith &LR;  is trying to assemble a Dixieland band
``comprised exclusively of pudgy retirees named William.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE VOGUE FOR UGLY &LR;  With Americans by the SUV-full flocking to
Target, Restoration Hardware and Ikea, the masses are honing in on
good taste. In response, says the Wall Street Journal, hip
tastemakers are going for the ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good taste is a bore,'' said  &UR; Joe Holtzman &LR;  of New York, whose
neighbors looked into his apartment across an alley and put up a
sign that said ``Ugly.'' Holtzman had covered everything in his
kitchen (floors, ceiling and walls) with a loud '70s geometric
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be the cognoscenti had style and everyone else was
out of date. Now, everything has gone too tasteful and groovy,''
said  &UR; Simon Doonan &LR; , creative director of Barneys New York. Doonan
quoted style icon  &UR; Diana Vreeland &LR; : ``Vulgarity is a very important
ingredient in life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard her version, and I think it is sensual and
mystical. I also feel that she's chosen autobiographical verses
that reflect her career and personal history. I hope it will cause
people to ask what's happening to music in America. I have received
many gifts from God, but this is the first time I have ever

 WINE POTPOURRI: What's Best to Drink With A Grilled Cheese 
 Sandwich?  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; When I was a young boy, one of my fondest food
memories was my mother fixing me a grilled cheese sandwich for
lunch. If I was lucky, and we had butter in the house, she would
spread it liberally on one side of a piece of white bread, place
the bread, buttered-side down in a cast-iron frying pan, top it
with two thick slices of American cheese, then complete the
sandwich with another slice of bread, buttered-side up.
<P>
   A tall glass of cold milk was my beverage of choice in those
days, but today I'd be happy to savor my grilled cheese sandwich
with a tall glass of cold ale or lager, an aromatic dry white wine
or a glass of light red wine.
</P>
<P>
   Just about any lager or ale will do, but I like Anchor Steam,
Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Red Hook Old India Pale Ale. The buttery
richness of melted cheese is a good match with a dry Riesling or
Chenin Blanc, a light red Beaujolais-Villages or Napa Gamay or even
a dry Tavel Ros &LR; e &LR;  from the Rhone Valley of France.
</P>
<P>
   Matching wine with cheese is not difficult, and melted or not
makes little difference. Just follow the same basic rule as you
would with wine and other foods; the seasonings and sauces are more
important than the type of meat or fish.
</P>
<P>
   Since cheese usually is not sauced or seasoned, simply remember:
The fresher and drier the cheese, the lighter, less complicated the
wine. Herbed goat cheese is great with a nonoaked Sauvignon Blanc,
but a creamy Camembert cries out for a bigger more complex Cabernet
Sauvignon, especially if the cheese is just starting to ``melt''
out of the rind.
</P>
<P>
   European cousins of the American grilled cheese sandwich include
fondue and raclette. Fondue, traditionally made in Switzerland with
Emmentaler, calls for a light red like Chianti, a Swiss Dole (Pinot
Noir and Gamay), or even a light-medium Zinfandel. Raclette, made
in Switzerland with a mild rustic cheese called raclette, works
nicely with a light Swiss white like Chasselas, an Italian Pinot
Grigio, or a dry California Sauvignon Blanc.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh Rarebit, an English cheddar-based dipping sauce made with
a hearty beer is best with beer, not wine.
</P>
<P>
   Italian melting cheeses that are favorites among Americans
include mozzarella and provolone. Slices of nutty flavorful
provolone melted in a casserole or open-face sandwich marry nicely
with a medium to full-bodied red like California Sangiovese,
Italian Chianti and Gattinara or a Mourvedre from the south of
France.
</P>
<P>
   Mozzarella, of course, means pizza, although the cheese is much
more versatile. Personally, I prefer a crisp lager with pizza, but
a light-medium red like Chianti or a California Nebbiolo is a nice
match with a cheese-y pizza.
</P>
<P>
   For all dishes with melted cheese, the bottom wine-line is: Stay
with light and dry, whether red or white, or opt for a hearty lager
or ale, and you can't go wrong.

from major wine reviewers and medals won in 1998 and 1999 wine
competitions.

Petaluma Vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture will produce a line of super-premium Australian
wines that will be marketed under the Petaluma name in North
America. The first vintages are expected to be released this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Crosner, who received his winemaking degree from the University
of California at Davis, liked the name of the town Petaluma
(California) so much, he named his winery in South Australia after
it.

</P>
<P>
   Has American-made Viognier hit its peak? Could be that
Viognier's 15 minutes of fame are up, and it's time to step aside
for the next hot white wine, like Pinot Gris. Viognier is native to
the Northern Rhone where it stars in the lively wines of Condrieu.
Rarer still is the Viognier from the seven-acre estate of
Chateau-Grillet. So famous is Grillet, that it has its own
appellation, one of the smallest in France.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you recently won the lottery and have connections, pass
on the ultra-expensive Chateau-Grillet and opt for a less-expensive
Condrieu.

 COOK'S BOOKS: `Pot Pies' Promises More Than It Delivers  &HT;       
 By David A. Steinberg  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Most people would agree that the lowly potpie is a
quintessential part of the American culinary landscape. Long before
Julia Child taught Middle America how to stop worrying and learn to
love French cuisine, there were potpies.
<P>
   Though often dismissed as a catch-all way of reinventing
leftovers, most of us when we were growing up couldn't wait for
those wintry days when mom would either make one from scratch or
(as in my case) heat one up courtesy of Safeway's freezer section.
Potpies are the very definition of comfort food.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine my surprise when I discovered that Diane Phillips'
``Pot Pies: Comfort Food Under Cover'' not only stretched the
definition of a potpie, but also failed to deliver anything
remotely resembling the classic potpie we have grown to know and
love.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Phillips extrapolates the concept of a potpie past
recognition. It seems like a case of false advertising. Maybe I'm
reacting to some sort of existential loss of childhood, but then
again, if someone labels a cookbook ``pot pies'' I think it is not
unreasonable to expect some of the classics to appear out of
courtesy, if nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the recipes were, indeed, imaginative and edible. The
Portobello Mushroom Pie was oddly interesting, though the recipe
was time consuming and labor intensive. The result, however, was
far more like a phyllo-wrapped calzone than a potpie, especially
considering there was nary a pot to be found anywhere in the
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   The promising sound of Old-Fashioned Chicken Pot Pie with Chive
Mashed Potato Crust ended up being more recognizable as a
shepherd's pie, but even with a change in nomenclature, the recipe
was adequate at best in the end.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot was the Pot Roasted Lamb with Rosemary White
Bean Crust. With a more-than-passing resemblance to cassoulet, the
result was every inch comfort food: hearty, rich and satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   While this cookbook is far from a failure, the overall effect is
that it promises more than it delivers. Many recipes appear to
resemble other types of comfort foods such as casseroles, stews and
that tried-and-true staple of Midwestern potlucks _ the hot dish.
</P>
<P>
   While trying to shoehorn everything under the potpie rubric,
Phillips ends up muddling the flavors and textures. The results
vary from good to extremely disappointing. My recommendation is to
get the recipe from your mom if you want a truly heart-warming
potpie, or at least pick up a Marie Callender's at Safeway.

beans on top of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the breadcrumbs, the remaining teaspoon of rosemary and

MOUNSEY TEARS KNEE LIGAMENT, OUT FOR SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tara Mounsey, a defenseman on the 1998 women's Olympic ice
hockey team that won the gold medal in Nagano and now a captain for
Brown University, will miss the rest of the season after tearing
the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee during a loss to
Harvard Saturday. She is scheduled to undergo surgery March 8.
</P>
<P>
   A junior from Concord, N.H., and the Bears' leading scorer this
season with 14 goals and 10 assists, Mounsey said Tuesday she was
fighting off a Harvard defender midway through the second period
when ``I felt it go.'' She crumpled to the ice and was helped off.
An MRI on Monday confirmed the tear.
</P>
<P>
   Mounsey is no stranger to the injury: She missed her junior
season at Concord High School while recovered from a torn ACL in
her left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to know how much therapy I have that lies ahead of
me,'' she said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As for this season, ``I was feeling so good and getting ready
for the playoffs,'' said a subdued Mounsey, who missed the first
four games of the ice hockey season while she was leading Brown's
field hockey team to the NCAA tournament and being named an
All-American. ``I guess life isn't always simple. I'll get through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury is a blow to Brown, which lost Saturday, 2-1, for the
first time in 16 games. It clings to first place in the ECAC by
just a point over Dartmouth with four games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll definitely miss Tara, but I think the other kids can
pick up the slack,'' said coach Digit Murphy, who added that she
was encouraged by the Bears' 4-0 victory in a nonconference game
against Providence the next day.
</P>
<P>
   With an average recovery time of 4-6 months, the injury
shouldn't severely handicap Mounsey's chances of making the 2002
Olympic squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to take it one day at a time and maybe I'll be
able to go to camp this summer,'' she said, referring to a festival
Aug. 13-22 during which evaluations will be made for a pre-Olympic
touring team. ``I want to get back 100 percent and be ready to
go.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, temperatures soared to 70 degrees as far north as
St. Louis, as gusty breezes from the south imported unseasonably
warm air north into much of the central states. During Wednesday,
the axis of warmth will shift eastward. Indeed, amid partial
sunshine afternoon readings will reach the 60s from the Ohio Valley
to the southern Middle Atlantic states. Sunshine and very mild
conditions will also cover the Northeast, though clouds will
prevail from the eastern Great Lakes to the mountains of New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms will erupt across the
lower Mississippi Valley as a flow of humid air from the Gulf of
Mexico intercepts a jet stream disturbance passing overhead. A few
of the storms could be severe, replete with hail and damaging
winds. These storms will spread east into the Tennessee Valley by
evening. Showers will also dampen portions of the central Plains
and upper Mississippi Valley Wednesday as moist air is drawn into
the circulation of low pressure over Kansas. Farther south, morning
showers and thunderstorms will yield to afternoon sunshine across
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A plume of moist air will take aim on portions of the West Coast
Wednesday, bringing heavy rain to much of western California from
near Los Angeles to the Oregon border. As the damp air ascends the
higher terrain of the interior mountains, it will cool setting the
stage for heavy snow across the Sierra. Lighter showers and
mountain snow will also occur in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Rainy California
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, record daily rainfalls were measured from Los Angeles
to San Diego. As it does nearly every year, the heart of the rainy
season has arrived in California. Weather stations from Arcata in
the north to San Diego in the south report their greatest average
rainfall in January and February with a sharp decline in wet
weather thereafter. Early in the cool season, the jet stream
typically sends Pacific storms toward the Northwest coast. At this
time of year, the jet stream has reached its southernmost position
of the winter, directing the parade of Pacific storms toward
California.

&HT;     DAVIDIAN FOLLOWER DISCUSSES EVENTS IN WACO SIEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DICK J. REAVIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a fall afternoon in 1993, Derek Lovelock, a 38-year-old
Briton, suddenly found himself standing on the sidewalks of Waco,
three hours before the flight that would take him home.
</P>
<P>
   He was wearing a secondhand T-shirt, jeans whose origin were a
mystery to him _ and rubbery jail sandals. His own clothing had
been taken, presumably as evidence, when he was jailed seven months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelock had never been charged with a crime. Federal
authorities had held him, without bond, as a material witness to
the 1993 gunfight and fire at David Koresh's Branch Davidian
compound near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The British Consulate in Houston intervened to obtain Lovelock's
release from jail, because his father had died.
</P>
<P>
   Once back in Manchester, he was not recalled, either by
prosecutors in the 1994 San Antonio trial of 11 other survivors,
nor in 1995, when Congress investigated the federal siege of
Koresh's religious compound.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelock was in Houston last week for an interview with lawyers
for special counsel John Danforth, the former U.S. senator from
Missouri who is investigating the Waco events for the Justice
Department. Lovelock also returned to Texas to be deposed in a
wrongful death lawsuit, slated for trial in May, that other
survivors of the Branch Davidian attack filed against the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   In his sworn statements and in an interview, the British witness
gave an account of his time at the Branch Davidian compound that
challenges several points of the official version of the Waco
events _ and also debunks some claims that conspiracy theorists and
government critics have raised.
</P>
<P>
   Like most survivors of the siege, whenever the chance presents
itself, Lovelock also sought to reaffirm his faith in the religious
message that first brought him to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1980s, Lovelock, a member of a Seventh-day
Adventist Church, ran across a publication that warned about
Koresh, who had gone to the United Kingdom to recruit Adventists
for his flock. Lovelock was intrigued, despite the church's
warning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he went to the Koresh compound, where, he said, ``From
the Scriptures, David showed me things that no man had shown me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some two years later, he took up residence at the compound
again, even though there were aspects of its life that displeased
him _ first among them, guns. When other males volunteered for
lessons in weaponry, he stayed away. ``I just don't like guns,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that he didn't take up a weapon, as others did, on
the morning of Feb. 28, 1993, when some 75 agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms raided the property in search of a
cache of weapons. Lovelock said he was in the building's cafeteria
when ``I heard the helicopters. They got louder and louder, almost
as if they were landing on the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleadings in the wrongful death suit allege that federal agents
in the aircraft fired upon the Branch Davidian compound. Lovelock
did not see bullets strike where he was, nor did any shots come
through the walls of the bedroom in which he took cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran to the room and threw myself on the floor,'' he said,
not looking up until the shooting stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Four ATF agents and six followers of the Branch Davidian
religious cult died in the Feb. 28 gun battle. Koresh and more than
70 Branch Davidians, including some 21 children, died during the
inferno that ended the siege on April 19. (What caused the deadly
fire continues to be a source of speculation and investigation.)
</P>
<P>
   ATF agents who testified in the 1994 criminal trial denied that
they fired at unseen targets, and the House of Representatives,
during 1995 queries into the events at Waco, looked into charges
that shots were fired from the helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   While the House found no evidence to substantiate allegations
about helicopter gunfire, its report noted that ``there is
insufficient evidence to determine with certainty as to who fired
the shots'' that witnesses say left holes in the roof of the
Davidian complex.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelock said what he saw in the aftermath of the gun battle
convinced him that the helicopters fired at the building and that
ATF raiders fired through its doors.
</P>
<P>
   He drew these conclusions partly from viewing the body of
Winston Blake, a fellow Briton who had been his roommate. Blake was
shot dead, his autopsy and an ATF report say, by a bullet fired at
close range.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelock contests that finding. He believes Blake was felled by
shots fired from the helicopters toward vinyl water storage tanks
that stood in front of a window in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the bullet holes in the tanks,'' Lovelock said. ``There
were three of them, in a straight line. There was water coming into
the room.''
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's 1993 report on the Waco incident lists
Perry Jones, 64, as a second murder or suicide victim. The official
view is supported by a coroner's report, noting only one wound in
Jones' body _ in the roof of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Davidians who witnessed the raid admit that one of their number,
now dead, killed Jones, but they insist that his killing was an act
of mercy. Jones, they say, had been wounded by ATF fire as he stood
at the front door of the Branch Davidian building in the early
minutes of the raid. He begged to be put out of his misery, they
have testified.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelock said he saw Jones before his death, ``lying on his bed,
blood on his abdomen. He had been shot by the ATF.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Feb. 28 raid was over, Lovelock did not seriously
consider coming out, he said, because ``my fear of God was greater
than my fear of man. God is in control of my destiny, not man, and
I could have lost my soul eternally.''
</P>
<P>
   He presumed Koresh would eventually arrange an exit with the
FBI, which took over the siege shortly after the members of the
religious cult repelled the ATF.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would end up like it did,'' he said, ``and I
didn't think that I would be put in jail, because I hadn't done
anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The seven years since have not been kind ones, the survivor
says. A cook before he joined Koresh, Lovelock has not resumed life
in the workaday world. He is undergoing counseling and treatment
for depression, and flashbacks beset him, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I see something on TV, like a policeman dressed like
the ATF, it all comes back to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even on better days, he says, he is not up to par. ``I've lost
my get-up-and-go, my concentration and my confidence,'' he said.
Today, Lovelock lives on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   If there is light in his life, it antedates the events of 1993.
Lovelock, like others who survived the Waco ordeal, is steadfast in
his faith that Koresh was a prophet.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Waco messiah's scriptural interpretations, much on
Lovelock's mind during the 51-day siege, remains fresh in his mind
today.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh told his flock that what lay ahead was foretold in the
Bible's Book of Nahum, a book that many scholars think is
historical, not predictive, describing events in the seventh
century B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The text the Davidian preacher cited says ``The chariots shall
rage in the streets ... they shall seem like torches, they shall
run like the lightnings.'' Koresh told his followers that those
``chariots'' would be military tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the wicked fulfill prophecy,'' Lovelock said. ``As David
said to the FBI, `You guys made Nahum come true.'''

<P>
   What appears to be a major victory for President Mohamed
Khatami's supporters in the new Iranian parliamentary elections
confirms that the Islamic regime that seized power in 1979 is
unlikely to survive in its current, strict theocratic form.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, after the shah was deposed, the coterie around the
newly powerful Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini purged its more
egalitarian members and crafted a theocracy instead of a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights were virtually ignored in Iran for a decade, until
Khomeini's death in 1989. With typical revolutionary excess, the
regime's zealots were obsessed with winning converts to their
cause, both at home and in the region.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, today in Iran, the most innovative movement is the
Islamic reformation. Iranian thinkers have injected energy and
ideas into a disparate effort, from Egypt to India, to somehow
reconcile a 7th-century religion with modern life.
</P>
<P>
   By using Islam as a popular political idiom, by weaving Islamic
tenets into a modern, Western-style constitution, and by putting
clerics in charge of the state, Iran has actually become a live
test and a venue for debate on the proper relationship between
Islam and the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Any aim to empower Iran's people was hijacked in the early days
of the Ayatollah's regime. Yet, ironically, the failure of the
world's only theocracy to empower its people has provided the
biggest boost for new, progressive ideas about the modern Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the most profound discourse within Islam today is taking
place in the newspapers, courtrooms and classrooms of Iran. Even
clerics who once held high office and intellectuals who were
proteges of the late Ayatollah Khomeini are now challenging the
religion's basic precepts as well as the specifics of theocratic
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran was engrossed last autumn in the trial of Abdollah Nouri,
a cleric, former Khomeini aide and editor of the newspaper Khordad
who had served as vice president, interior minister and Tehran city
councilor.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Court for the Clergy, which operates as an
independent agency, charged Nouri with multiple counts of
``insulting'' Islam, the prophet Mohammad and Khomeini. Nouri's
specific offense was running articles in Khordad that questioned
everything from the Islamic concept of eye-for-eye justice to the
clergy's automatic right to hold power.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial Nouri, dressed in a white turban and clerical
robes, astonished Iranians by taking the stand and denying the
court's right to judge him: ``I totally reject the court, its
membership and its competence to conduct this trial, and any
verdict you reach will have no legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   After his conviction he refused to appeal, on the same grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Nouri was sentenced to five years in prison
and was also barred from political activity for five years, a
punishment tacitly designed to prevent Iranian President Khatami's
closest ally from running for speaker of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And Nouri's newspaper was banned, although his staff defiantly
pledged to launch another publication _ the people's new way of
getting around forced shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Six months earlier, Tehran had been absorbed in a similar trial
_ that of Mohsen Kadivar, a popular young cleric and seminary
professor whose sister was an adviser to Khatami and another Tehran
city councilor; his brother-in-law served as Khatami's minister of
culture and Islamic guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Court for the Clergy charged Kadivar with
``disseminating lies and disturbing public opinion'' for writing
articles that advocated the separation of political and religious
institutions. Kadivar also dared to compare practices in the
Islamic republic with the former shah's repressive controls on
freedom of expression and questioned the powers and righteousness
of the theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``From both a legal and religious point of view, it's quite
permissible to criticize the Supreme Leader or the ruling
establishment,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nouri, Kadivar rejected the clergy's right to judge:
``Investigation into political and press offenses must be carried
out in the presence of a jury and by a qualified court of the
judiciary,'' he told the court. He was convicted and received an
18-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kadivar's case gained him celebrity status. Posters of the young
cleric, who came from a noted religious family in the city of
Shiraz, were plastered all over Tehran. Students held a candlelight
vigil in the hills near Evin prison, where he was being held
without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ``freedom of thought, forever, forever,'' they released
doves as a symbol of liberty. More than 200 journalists also signed
a petition that condemned Kadivar's arrest as unconstitutional and
called it an ``offense'' against Iran's writers and intellectuals.
These responses to Kadivar's imprisonment reflected a newly
emboldened population.
</P>
<P>
   Both trials involved an issue even more fundamental than the
freedom of expression: the separation of religion from government.
In an Islamic society, who has the ultimate power _ the elected
officials or the clergy?
</P>
<P>
   Since Islam is a monotheistic religion that offers not only
spiritual values but also a set of rules by which to govern
society, sorting out the distribution of power is critical to any
genuine, lasting reform. So political change and religious reform
are often tightly intertwined in Muslim societies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, Iran's leading philosopher, Abdul
Karim Soroush, has fueled public debate by offering a framework _
on the basis of faith _ to blend Islam and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that to be a true believer, one must come to the faith
without coercion or pressure _ in other words, freely. That
principle is the origin of all other freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Soroush has not abandoned the tenets of his faith; he believes
that ``sharia'' _ pure Islamic law _ can be a basis for modern
legislation. But he breaks from Iran's theocrats in his declaration
that Islamic law is not static, but instead is flexible and
adaptable because it has only begun to be understood by imperfect
human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Soroush was a long-time follower of Khomeini, who appointed him
to the Committee of the Cultural Revolution to set about being
certain that all Iranian university curricula were in conformity
with Islam.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade after the revolution, even Soroush, who initially
was so close to Khomeini, began to see the Ayatollah as an
instrument of transition, not as the goal. In books, magazine
columns and lectures at the three universities where he taught,
Soroush warned that Islam, like any other religion, should never be
relied upon to rule a state.
</P>
<P>
   To use religion as state law, he argued, opens the door to
totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Often called the Martin Luther of Islam by students, Soroush is
also widely popular among today's young intellectuals, reformers
and the clergy. Many of his former students and followers launched
new, reform-oriented newspapers _ most notably Jameh, Tous, Neshat
and Asr-e Azadegan, or ``Era of the Emancipators'' _ all of which
were closed down, one after another, by the current Islamic-based
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the goal of Soroush, Kadivar, Nouri and other Iranian
reformers is to be religious _ to be Muslim _ without being
fundamentalist, to be reverent but free, and to find a world-view
that is both Islamic and modern.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes Iran quite unique in the Muslim world. And the
work of Iran's reformers is spreading rapidly throughout the
53-nation Islamic bloc. Indeed, this is the last group of countries
to hold out against the wave of democracy that in recent years has
swept the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is still undergoing a transformation. After the elections,
more internal turmoil lies ahead, as the revolution's early
passions are replaced by hard-earned pragmatism, and as arrogance
gives way to realism among many believers in Iranian society.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the government of God is being forced to cede to
secular statecraft _ and to empower Iranians. In the process, Iran
has begun contributing to the spread of public empowerment around
the world.

`WONDER BOYS' OFFERS PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS YOUNG AND OLD MEN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Feb. 25) 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The press materials for the new movie ``Wonder Boys'' describes
the title phenomena as men who've had great success at an early age
but then have trouble living up to their reputations.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't precisely what the film shows us. It's more a
story about talented but confused youths and their similarly
uncertain, late-blooming elders, a thoroughly more complex take on
what nurturing creativity requires in an age of overhyped acclaim
and celebrity and similarly extreme exile to the cultural margins
should you fall out of style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder Boys''' three main men _ stars Michael Douglas and
Tobey Maguire and director Curtis Hanson _ offer an even broader
perspective on the artist's condition in an ever-changing culture.
</P>
<P>
   At 55, Douglas has achieved just about everything a Hollywood
player could dream of: youthful success as a producer (his 1975
``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' is among only three pictures
ever to win the top five Academy Awards), the acting Oscar that has
even eluded his legendary father Kirk (for ``Wall Street''),
international superstardom and, now, the hand of the most
attractive actress to hit the screen in years, Catherine
Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In the film he plays Grady Tripp, a Pittsburgh college professor
who wrote a great novel in his early 40s but, seven years later, is
lost in a haze of personal and creative confusion. Although he's
played against his superslick smoothy image before in such films as
``Falling Down'' and ``The War of the Roses,'' Douglas reveled in
the chance to gain some weight, wear ugly clothes and otherwise
impersonate a loser this time out.
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't you know it? Early reviews are giving the
unsinkable golden boy the best notices of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has to do with how you understand your screen
image,'' Douglas says about aging gracefully _ or, at least,
entertainingly _ on camera. ``I think, having had some producing
experience, I know that if a movie is good, it benefits everybody.
I've watched too many actors be more concerned with their images
rather than making the picture work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's from a different generation, but I think the image
thing hurt him to an extent,'' Douglas adds, clenching his jaw in
imitation of the aggressively intense Kirk. ``He had that thing
going there, and it worked. Yet my favorite movie of his was
`Lonely Are the Brave,' which was a more vulnerable character.''
</P>
<P>
   Easygoing vulnerability is working well, so far, for Maguire.
The 24-year-old actor, who spent some of his childhood in the San
Fernando Valley, has been overshadowed by his good friend,
worldwide heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio, for the past few years. But
the spotlight on Maguire has grown bright in recent months,
following wide acclaim for his work in the Civil War drama ``Ride
With the Devil'' and all the Oscar momentum in the world for ``The
Cider House Rules,'' even as Leo's star appears to be sinking off
the poorly received ``The Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of us as competitors,'' says Maguire, who has
ended up appearing in movies DiCaprio turned down. ``I suppose
there is some competition, but I feel more like we're all on the
same team. I want someone like him, who's a great guy and a great
actor, to do well. And many other actors, too. I look forward to
seeing Ed Norton and Giovanni Ribisi's films, a lot of people my
age who are talented.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the idealism of youth. And the optimism. Maguire, who plays
Grady's best writing student and most troublesome charge, says he
has difficulty relating to ``Wonder Boys''' themes of blown chances
and creative inertia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really worried about that,'' Maguire says. ``All I can
do is work hard and try to choose wisely. To some extent, the
results are out of my hands, but at the same time I'm fairly
confident. And my confidence comes from faith; I just feel like
I'll be taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Hanson probably understands what it's like to be a
wonder boy better than his stars do. Although he began making
movies in the late 1960s, Hanson had done more screenwriting than
directing before hitting the commercial jackpot with ``The Hand
That Rocks the Cradle' in 1992. He'd received some polite acclaim
as an astute, if minor latter-day Hitchcock before then. But his
last picture, the period-noir spectacular ``L.A. Confidential,''
was the unexpected critical smash of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On the far side of 50, Hanson had suddenly attained auteur
status. But his change-of-pace follow-up to that breakout work took
awhile to present itself (``Wonder Boys,'' which is based on
Michael Chabon's novel, was scripted by ``The Fabulous Baker
Boys''' Steve Kloves before Hanson came on board).
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the characters in this story, even though they're not
all writers, they're all the same in that they all have this
yearning for connection and either past promise or future success,
things that we all feel,'' the L.A.-raised director says. ``And yet
they were funny. That's what the fun of it was.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also fun to accent the story's romantic angle. When we
first encounter the disheveled Grady, the latest in a series of
much younger wives has just walked out on him, and he soon
discovers that his married lover, played by ``Fargo's'' more
age-appropriate Frances McDormand, is pregnant with his child. Not
only did this provide a kind of built-in response to criticisms of
Douglas' last movie, ``A Perfect Murder'' _ in which his character
was married to Gwyneth Paltrow _ it also reflected humorously on
the romance that was budding during production last winter between
Douglas and Zeta-Jones, who is 25 years his junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the book, but we added dialogue to emphasize it,''
Hanson explains. ``To me, part of the confusion Grady has is that
he's drawn to these beauties, but as Bob Dylan says in the song
that he wrote for us, `I'm in love with a woman that doesn't appeal
to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, who proposed to the Welsh actress on New Year's Eve and
recently announced that they were expecting a child, has had more
than his share of life-following-art experiences in the last year.
While some of the press intrusion has rankled (Zeta-Jones was a
tabloid target in her native Britain before coming to Hollywood),
he understandably feels pretty darn ecstatic about the whole
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The age difference thing disappears very fast in this kind of
relationship,'' he notes. ``We don't even think about it anymore,
although it's always there in the British tabloid press because
they insist on putting your age in parentheses after your name. But
it's not this insane thing; it's basically gone on throughout
civilization, not just something that started with Frank Sinatra
and Mia Farrow. And there are, basically, genetic and other reasons
why there's an age for women to have children and all that, and why
men of all ages are attracted to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, regarding that...
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of being a dad again is just fabulous,'' says
Douglas, who has an adult son from his multi-decade marriage to
wife Diandra, from whom he separated several years ago. ``And
obviously it's wonderful, because you don't have to tear yourself
between career and family now. You feel like you've done it all,
and although I love working, now I'll be able to focus that much
more time on the kid and on the marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonder boy indeed. Speaking of which, didn't Hanson mention
Dylan? The rock legend composed the film's title song, ``Things
Have Changed.'' It's his first movie songwriting since Sam
Peckinpah's 1973 ``Pat Garrett &AMP; Billy the Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the decades _ I'm sad to say! _ I've been a fan of his,
and seen him more than any other performer by far,`` Hanson says of
Dylan. ``I'd heard he'd liked `L.A. Confidential,' and I'd always
dreamed of working with him, so I figured this was the movie to
approach him with. I mean, who is the quintessential wonder boy in
the music world, a guy who has met that challenge of reinventing
yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   Through all of this celebratory wonderama, however, one sad note
sounds. Shortly after returning to L.A. from the film's Pittsburgh
location, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Grady's flamboyant editor,
was sent to Corcoran State Prison for drug-related parole
violations. It was a shockingly personal example of how even the
most talented young artist _ and all agree that Downey was terrific
to work with _ can lose his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert has a problem; who knows if he'll ever lick it,''
laments Hanson, who visited Downey at the ominous institution
during the holidays. ``I think that, in the future, people are
going to look back on our era and go, `What were they thinking,
sending people with addiction problems to prison?'''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some wonder boy will come up with a better way. &QL;

   GRAMMYS-PRODUCER _ Superproducer Walter Afanasieff, at 41, is at
the top of his game. He's got records by Mariah Carey, Celine Dion,
Michael Bolton, Kenny G, Ricky Martin, Whitney Houston, Babyface,
Marc Anthony, Barbara Streisand and more under his belt. Last
year's Grammy-winning ``My Heart Will Go On''? Yep, that's him.
He's competing for the highly regarded producer of the year Grammy.
By Fred Shuster (moved on the ``e'' entertainment wire).

<P>
   GRAMMYS-SCHIFRIN _ For Mr. ``Mission: Impossible'' Lalo
Schifrin, it's the music that matters. Sure, he's been nominated
for 20 Grammys over the years, winning four, but he'd rather be in
the guest house behind his Beverly Hills home plinking away on the
Bosendorfer piano. And what about this Latin explosion thing? He's
been blazing a trail for those kinds of sounds _ and an advocate

 &HT;    MICROSOFT WARNS JUDGE IN FINAL ROUND OF TRIAL
 &HT;    480&AMP;add. Moving in the (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Microsoft Corp. lawyer Tuesday urged U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to consider the harm a
sweeping guilty verdict in the high-profile antitrust case could
cause to the most dynamic sector of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Jackson issued ``findings of fact'' that that
Microsoft does have an operating system monopoly, and has leveraged
that monopoly to stifle competition and harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   With that ruling having all but sealed the outcome of the trial,
Microsoft sought to persuade the judge to look beyond the narrower
legal issues and focus on the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   Lead attorney John Warden, citing Microsoft's all-but-universal
operating system for personal computers, said: ``I find the
government's assaults on Windows to be truly remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a critical element to the PC,'' Warden said. ``It is the
modern paradigm of a product that not only promotes commerce but
creates wealth. It is the engine that has driven our economy to new
heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden's appeal came toward the close of nearly five hours of
oral arguments over how Jackson should apply the antitrust laws as
they relate to the already established facts in the case.
</P>
<P>
   His position was promptly countered by David Boies, the chief
government litigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an attack on success,'' Boies informed Jackson.
``It is an attack on practices that have no other purpose but
anti-competitive, monopolistic behavior. You have been told that
you ought to give the (Microsoft) PC operating system a pass
because it is a creative engine. But I think the contrary is true.
If the heavy hand of monopoly were lifted, this industry would
thrive and prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden, however, insisted on having the last word.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of nothing doesn't add up to something,'' he boomed.
``The government is stuck with a chain of suppositions. We've heard
about a miscellaneous ragtag of acts. That's not proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling a halt to proceedings. Jackson said: ``Gentlemen, after
two and a half years, it's still a pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   He then summoned the litigants _ including Joel Klein, chief of
the Justice Department's antitrust division, and four attorneys
general representing the 19 states that are also parties to the
case _ to his chambers.
</P>
<P>
   For some months, at Jackson's behest, a federal mediator in
Chicago has been seeking to broker an out-of-court settlement that
would absolve Jackson of having to issue a final ruling and impose
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was called to assess how well Richard Posner, the
presiding chief of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, was doing in
cutting a deal. If Jackson believes there's a good chance for an
accord, he might be inclined to delay his ruling, which is
otherwise expected in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Deal or no deal, Boies dwelled at length on a litany of U.S.
Supreme Court rulings that he maintained fit the facts in the
Microsoft trial. These cases could leave Jackson with the
reasonable prospect that he would not be reversed were he to drop a
legal hammer on the company, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson gave Microsoft a small glimmer of hope when he pressed
the opposing attorneys on how he might fit to the facts of this
case a previous setback by a federal appeals court. In 1998, the
higher court rejected Jackson's finding that Microsoft had
illegally tied its Internet Explorer Web browser to the Windows 95
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   While the appeals' panel ruled for Microsoft largely on
technical grounds, it also stated that the union of Windows 95 and
Explorer was a legal ``genuine integration'' because it was done
for efficiency's sake and had positive consequences. That is not
now the government's view.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson's overall skepticism as to the worthiness of
Microsoft's claims was display when he likened Microsoft's actions
to the classic Standard Oil monopoly, which the Supreme Court
dissolved nearly 90 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Rockefeller had fee simple (absolute) control over his
oil,'' Jackson told Warden. ``I don't really see a distinction
here.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Big clash in Michigan
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain, seeking to bounce back from a staggering weekend
defeat in South Carolina, clashed Tuesday with George W. Bush in
primaries in Michigan and Arizona. ``Every day is do or die,''
McCain said. Heading into a high-stakes run of 16 primaries and
caucuses in 14 days, Bush and McCain agreed that Michigan's voting
was pivotal. ``That's why I'm still here in the state working to
turn out the vote,'' Bush told a suburban Detroit crowd.
</P>
<P>
   KEEP THOSE BALLOTS ROLLING
</P>
<P>
   In some areas of southwest Michigan, they were having to print
more ballots because of the heavy turnout in Tuesday's GOP primary.
Earlier, though, turnout was said to be light in much of the state.
There are 58 delegates at stake in Michigan _ where the primary
isn't limited to Republican voters _ and another 30 in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   THIS TIME HE COULD EVEN VOTE
</P>
<P>
   John McCain was in Phoenix on Tuesday with one primary-day
advantage over George W. Bush: He got to cast a vote. ``I think
that it's kind of nice to be the first presidential candidate in
this campaign to vote for himself,'' McCain said after he and wife
Cindy cast ballots at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT UP AFTER TODAY
</P>
<P>
   With Michigan and Arizona behind them, the Republicans will now
square off next Tuesday in Virginia, North Dakota and Washington
state. The Democrats will also compete in Washington. George W.
Bush has his eye on Virginia, politically similar to South
Carolina, where he beat John McCain decisively. At stake in
Virginia are 56 delegates, winner take all. McCain has his sights
on Washington, an independent-minded state that will allocate 12 of
its 37 delegates by percentage of ballots. For the Democrats, the
Washington primary is a ``beauty contest''; all of its 75 delegates
will be assigned during a March 7 caucus. North Dakota Republicans,
with 19 delegates at stake, are shifting from a primary to a caucus
this year.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYING THE DOZENS IN HARLEM
</P>
<P>
   The race for the Democratic presidential nomination has become
very angry, with the two candidates slamming each other
continually. In their debate Monday night at Harlem's Apollo
Theater, Al Gore and Bill Bradley attacked each other relentlessly
on racial and urban affairs issues and challenged each other's
commitment to racial justice. In their ninth face-to-face meeting,
each attempted to knock out the other and portray himself as the
candidate best equipped to bridge racial divides and champion
federal programs that are important to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   SHOWTIME AT THE APOLLO
</P>
<P>
   The red velvet seats in the orchestra section and two mezzanines
of the Apollo Theater were dotted with celebrities _ and celebrity
attorneys _ for the big debate between Al Gore and Bill Bradley. As
movie director Spike Lee was being interviewed, the Rev. Al
Sharpton waited for a photo-op with Lee. Whoopi Goldberg held Lee's
leather jacket and waited for her turn with the press. Also there
were Dallas Cowboys veteran Calvin Hill and Los Angeles Lakers
coach Phil Jackson, both Bradley supporters. Gore acknowledged
Martin Luther King III of Atlanta midway through. There also was
O.J. Simpson defense lawyer, Johnnie Cochran. His favorite was
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   PREACHING VIA TELEPHONE
</P>
<P>
   Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson is using a recorded
telephone message to attack John McCain's national campaign chief,
former Sen. Warren Rudman (R-N.H.), as ``a vicious bigot who wrote
that conservative Christians in politics are anti-abortion zealots,
homophobes and would-be censors.'' ``John McCain refused to
repudiate these words,'' Robertson added in the message that was
taped Monday by a Michigan man and shared with the McCain campaign.
Rudman angered leaders of the religious right in 1995 by defending
retired Gen. Colin Powell against their attacks over abortion.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON RIPS BUSH ON REBEL FLAG
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson excoriated George W. Bush, warning that his
stances on important racial issues _ particularly the question of
whether South Carolina should fly the Confederate flag over the
state Capitol _ has reframed the primary season as ``not Bush vs.
McCain, but Bush vs. the history of our nation.'' Jackson said he
was not prepared to endorse a Democrat, but he criticized Bill
Bradley for ``offering no leadership in a crunch time'' when the
issue of racial profiling surfaced in his home state of New Jersey
last year.
</P>
<P>
   AND FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY
</P>
<P>
   Film director Spike Lee will be in a TV ad aimed at helping Bill
Bradley make a comeback in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just got to take the gloves off,'' Lee said.
``It's for real now. Bill will come out smoking.'' The ad has not
yet been filmed, he said. Lee said he's concerned that black voters
are blindly supporting Al Gore. ``Right or wrong, black people
think President Clinton can do no wrong. But I don't think that
means we should automatically transfer that allegiance from Clinton
to Al Gore,'' Lee said. Basketball legend Michael Jordan already
stars in a Bradley ad.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR A BIG TRUMP CARD
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Jordan now on TV for Bill Bradley's team, Al Gore
wants to trump that with, well, Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and The Donald _ New York developer Donald Trump _ talked
by telephone last weekend, and Gore asked for his endorsement,
according to The Associated Press. Trump, who recently decided not
to run himself as a Reform Party candidate, was said to be
considering the request. Gore's spokesman Chris Lehane confirmed
that the pair had talked.
</P>
<P>
   THAT'S THE WASHINGTON WITHOUT THE BELTWAY
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is shifting his insurgent's campaign to Washington
state in hopes that it's independent-minded voters will give him a
lift in next week's nonbinding Democratic ``beauty contest''
primary. Starting Wednesday, Bradley plans to spend six days in the
state with the West's second-largest bloc of national convention
delegates, after California. Backers say the Feb. 29 showdown could
give Bradley a boost heading into the pivotal round of
coast-to-coast contests a week later.
</P>
<P>
   S O WHERE'S THE HOME-COURT ADVANTAGE?
</P>
<P>
   Even in his home state, Missouri, Bill Bradley appears to face
daunting odds against Al Gore. Bradley trailed Gore 48 percent to
31 percent in Missouri, according to a St. Louis Post-Dispatch poll
published Sunday. The outlook was even worse across the Mississippi
River in Illinois, where Gore was holding a 59 percent to 24
percent lead. Among Republican voters in Missouri, George W. Bush
held a 55 percent to 26 percent lead over John McCain. The poll did
not include Republicans in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   A BIGGER RUN ON DONUTS EVERY FOUR YEARS
</P>
<P>
   The Gore-Bradley debate produced one quick benefit for Harlem: a
big boost for donut sales across the street from the Apollo
Theater. The customers were security police. But the manager of the
Krispy Kreme shop wasn't all that impressed with the Democratic
contenders in the neighborhood. ``Parachuting in and out is not the
way to get the black vote,'' said Tyrone Grant. ``They should spend
more than a few hours here, and come more often than every four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   YOU GOTTA HIT THE OPEN MAN
</P>
<P>
   The Harlem neighborhood is sprinkled with big corporate chains,
many of them new arrivals in a boom economy: Duane Reade.
Starbucks. McDonald's. Blimpie's. But Bill Bradley's foray into the
crowd opposite the Apollo Theater on 125th Street lost him at least
one vote: He missed a computer software store under construction
alongside the Apollo. ``At first, I was for Bradley. But just now
he passed us, didn't even look our way,'' said store worker Philip
Reed. Meanwhile, Gore walked into the store ``and he shook hands
with all of us. I'll probably vote for him. I like being
acknowledged.''
</P>
<P>
   RACE ISSUE OF A DIFFERENT KIND
</P>
<P>
   On a routine flight with John McCain between campaign stops in
Michigan, the staff passed out a form to the media types asking
such things as name, birth date, Social Security number, etc. But
the form also asked ``race,'' with most members filling in
``white'' or ``Caucasian.'' When a few reporters questioned the
appropriateness of that, according to the Washington Times,
campaign staff sheepishly explained that they meant only to ask in
which state the reporter was covering the Republican primary race.
</P>
<P>
   A LORAL MISSILE OF HIS OWN
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's campaign accused Rudy Giuliani of having
``cornered the market on hypocrisy'' after records showed his
Senate campaign took money from a source he criticized Clinton for
tapping. A PAC linked to Loral Space and Communications Ltd.
donated $750 in September to Giuliani. After a reporter questioned
the donation, Giuliani spokeswoman Kim Serafin said the money would
be returned. Loral is under Justice Department investigation for
allegedly providing China with information that could help make its
nuclear missiles more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   TRYING NOT TO LET THE WOMEN GET AWAY
</P>
<P>
   It is not the problem that she or anyone else expected. A year
ago, Hillary Clinton's most enthusiastic supporters were women who
sympathized with her marital plight. Democratic, independent and
even Republican women also shared her concerns about education,
health care and children. Today, her support among these women,
even some of the Democrats, has dropped, forcing her Senate
campaign to make a priority of bringing them back. Her advisers
insist that she will.

 &HT;    Local music gurus weigh in on who's Grammy worthy
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's music's biggest night tonight as the recording
industry hands out the 42nd annual Grammy Awards, recognizing the
best music in the past year. The three-hour show, broadcast live
from Los Angeles, is shaping up to be a lively cross-mix of sounds
and stars.
</P>
<P>
   Sixties guitar legend Carlos Santana leads the nominations with
10, followed by Atlanta-based TLC with seven. But it's likely to be
some of the live performances that scorch the tube, from the
outrageous Kid Rock to the smooth Afro-Cuban jazz of Buena Vista
Social Club to the Backstreet Boys performing with Elton John.
</P>
<P>
   Only professionals were allowed to cast votes. But we asked a
cross section of metro Atlanta music experts, none of them actual
Grammy voters, to pick their winners:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rob Perkins, owner of Spin Street music store: ``I have a
special place in my heart for Santana, because I grew up with him,
and his latest album is just remarkable. As far as new artists, I
hope to see Macy Gray win this year. She has a smooth blues sound
in her music that's appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Steve Goss, program director at WPCH-FM : ``By far the best
rock album was `Dosage' by Collective Soul. The Sarah McLachlan is
pretty good, and the Backstreet Boys album is better than a lot of
people think.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Camille Love, director of the city of Atlanta's Bureau of
Cultural Affairs: ``My favorite album last year and right now is
the Isley Brothers' compilation, `It's Your Thing: The Story of the
Isley Brothers.' I grew up on their sweet sounds and the loving
messages, and to me it was black men speaking to black women and I
just loved it!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Leslie Fram, program director of new rock station 99X: ``I
think R.E.M. should get an award for `The Great Beyond' from the
`Man on the Moon' soundtrack. It's the first R.E.M. song in a very
long time that has evoked so much emotion from an audience. I think
the song was overlooked, and it deserves recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Michael Krohngold, co-owner of Deux Plex, Mumbo Jumbo, Tongue
and Groove, and Fusebox: ``Beck's `Midnite Vultures,' because of
the diversity in the music. He's kind of a chameleon of sorts and
on some of the songs he sounds a little bit like Prince.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Frank Ski, morning announcer on WVEE-FM (103.3): ``Santana's
album. First of all because he did it and I'm such a fan. But also
I just thought it was a great thing to come back with that album,
and with artists like Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Speech, of Arrested Development: ``I want to see people like
Santana, TLC and Will Smith win. (Will is) a musical legend of his
own, but what's kind of wack is that America is just now giving him
his props when he's been making great music for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jason Orr, creator of FunkJazz Kafe: ``Outside of reissues, I
wasn't too impressed with 1999. But if I had to pick, Meshell
(Ndegeocello's) `Bitter,' without a doubt. ... It was just an
emotional record.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rhubarb Jones, Y-106.7 morning man: ``I think Martina McBride
put out the best album of the year, in any category. It's an album
that shows the real, honest, beautiful clarity this woman has. When
she hits those notes, she's singing from her heart and not her
larynx.''

 &HT;    Don't be left there when selecting, planting and maintaining
trees
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Feb. 24.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine how it would feel to have a set of weights fall on your
chest. Or a towel crammed down your throat. Or how about a garden
tiller roll over your feet?
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like scenes from a bad horror flick, but trees
experience those sensations every day, all at the hands of humans
either ignorant or insensitive to their needs. Roots are the most
important part of a tree, because if something prevents them from
providing oxygen, water and food to the tree, it will suffer and
eventually die.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing so many trees because they are so easy to
harm,'' said Melissa Merlino, newly named ``treekeeper'' in
Atlanta's Ansley Park neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs, they're falling victim to developers'
bulldozers; in the city, old age, cramped conditions and wear and
tear are the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the perfect time to replace trees, which seem to make the
news every day, especially in Atlanta, a city known as much for its
canopy as its sprawl. In the suburbs, local governments are beefing
up ordinances to protect trees from development. In the city, power
companies are struggling to explain the dilemma of burying utility
lines _ and uprooting older trees _ in the aftermath of storms that
blew limbs onto wires, leaving residents in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   An equally big problem, tree experts say, is that homeowners
don't understand a tree's needs and buy the wrong kind. Or they
plant it incorrectly. Or they plant it in the wrong place or at the
wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two big areas where homeowners miss the boat:
inappropriate tree selection and maintaining, preserving and
protecting our existing tree canopy,'' said Merlino.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs, new homeowners rush out to buy mature,
fast-growing varieties for the instant gratification of providing
beauty or shade to barren lots. But in less than 20 years, many of
those trees will deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   In town, the opposite is occurring. Trees planted 50 to 100
years ago have outgrown their space, their roots spilling onto
streets and sidewalks. In popular neighborhoods, they're suffering
from vehicles and construction equipment that come with traffic
congestion and home renovations.
</P>
<P>
   If you own a home _ regardless of where _ here's how you can
help:
</P>
<P>
   KNOW WHY YOU'RE PLANTING
</P>
<P>
   First, understand how a tree grows. Its most important roots are
within the top 6 to 8 inches of the ground, extending outward from
the trunk to about the width of its canopy. The tree gets its
nutrients from those roots, so if something damages or obstructs
them _ vehicles, cement, mounded soil _ it can spell disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Before hitting the nursery, know the reason you're planting.
Trees serve many purposes _ providing shade, focal points, screens
_ so learn which varieties will accomplish your goals. If seasonal
interest is important, choose accordingly instead of opting for all
evergreens.
</P>
<P>
   Trees require different temperatures, soil types and amounts of
sunlight, depending on their variety. Ask your nursery if your
choice will grow in this area. If the nursery doesn't carry it, ask
that it be ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more diversity in our trees, and the only way that's
going to happen is if customers demand it of their nurseries,''
said Jane Bath of Land Arts, a Monroe nursery.
</P>
<P>
   CHOOSE A TREE FOR THE SITE
</P>
<P>
   When choosing a tree, consider its ultimate height and shape in
relation to nearby structures or utility lines.
</P>
<P>
   For height, power companies classify trees as small, medium and
large.
</P>
<P>
   Small trees generally grow to less than 25 feet and are best
planted 15 to 20 feet from a house, in narrow planting strips (less
than 4 feet) between sidewalks and streets, and on power company
rights of way.
</P>
<P>
   Medium trees typically are 25 to 50 feet when mature. They are
best planted 20 to 25 feet from the house, in medium strips (4 to 8
feet wide) and at least 30 feet from power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Large trees generally grow to more than 50 feet and are best
planted 30 to 35 feet from a house, in strips wider than 8 feet and
at least 40 feet from power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Choose a shape _ columnar, conical, spreading or weeping _
appropriate for your space and purpose. In the tight quarters of an
intown garden, columnar varieties may be more suitable, while on
large suburban lawns, spreading canopies have plenty of room to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one looks up to see what's overhead anymore,'' Bath said,
noting the mistakes consumers make.
</P>
<P>
   One reason homeowners in new subdivisions plant so many common
varieties, such as Bradford pears, red maples and willow oaks, is
they want fast-growing trees. So most nurseries cater to the demand
by offering only the mainstays that can be grown on site, Bath
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell maybe 300 crapes myrtles to every oak,'' she said.
``That's pathetic, a tragedy, that people are ignoring the need for
diversity. We have to encourage them to experiment'' _ and to plant
young trees.
</P>
<P>
   She cited the allure of stately old trees that shade magnificent
estates. ``What people don't realize is that those trees were
planted small, not dropped in there by a bird. The point is we need
to think more about the future and less about the present.''
</P>
<P>
   PROTECT MATURE TREES
</P>
<P>
   For neighborhoods with mature trees, the ``present'' means
battling two enemies: tight spaces and home improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Oaks, hickories and other hardwoods, planted after the turn of
the century to create the shaded streets sought by home buyers,
have come of age. Their knees _ those shallow roots _ are buckling
sidewalks and hugging curbs because they've outgrown the narrow
planting strip between the sidewalk and street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a wide root area so with being shallow,
there's not a lot of room to go,'' Merlino said.
</P>
<P>
   Paving over or piling dirt on roots stifles their oxygen supply.
Combine that with the weight of vehicles and a location typically
dry from the heat of pavement, and the trees have a struggle at
best.
</P>
<P>
   In neighborhoods buzzing with remodeling, construction is
another problem. Trucks, building materials and portable toilets
compact the soil, further harming roots, said Merlino, who has a
degree in horticulture and is charged with teaching homeowners how
to select and protect trees.
</P>
<P>
   It could prove a big job. Neighbors recently halted a homeowner
from cutting down a century-old red oak to make way for a home
renovation because the owner had not secured a city tree permit.
(In Atlanta, trees larger than 6 inches in diameter require
approval for cutting.) And during last month's ice storm, another
80-year-old oak, planted in the sidewalk strip, heaved, knocking
out power to much of the Ansley Park neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to discourage any kind of tree planting, but if
people can plant the trees in their front yards so that they shade
the sidewalk, instead of the strip by the street, it's such a
better option,'' Merlino said.
</P>
<P>
   Trees Atlanta, a nonprofit organization that donates some 1,300
young trees annually to residential neighborhoods and commercial
thoroughfares, will plant in sidewalk strips and medians. But the
area has to be at least 2 feet wide and planted with only small
appropriate varieties, such as redbud, Trident maples, Florida
maples, serviceberry and yaupon hollies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be the ideal situation, but a treeless street is
even less ideal,'' said Greg Levine of Trees Atlanta. ``Those trees
will bring benefit for about 80 years, though environmental
stresses will kill the majority of them before they fall on their
own.''

<P>
   THE RIGHT WAY TO PLANT IN SIX EASY STEPS
</P>
<P>
   Trees Atlanta isn't just a nonprofit organization that donates
and plants trees along neighborhood streets and at commercial
intersections. Part of its mission is educating people about the
importance of trees, said Marcia Bansley, its executive director.
</P>
<P>
   One important lesson is the proper way to plant, and the group
begins each of its Saturday plantings with one for its volunteers
and neighborhood residents.
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, the best time to plant trees is between
November and March, cold months when the trees aren't faced with
the stresses of heat, insects and disease. ``Spring is the worst
time to plant because trees are real active then in sending out
sugar,'' said Greg Levine, program coordinator for Trees Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The group's step-by-step recommendations are sure to get your
trees off to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   _ Danny C. Flanders
</P>
<P>
   STEP ONE: Using a spade, dig a hole at least twice the size of
the tree's rootball. Slant the sides of the hole inward and make
sure the bottom is flat. The hole should be deep enough so that
when the rootball is placed in it, the top of the ball is about
1/4-inch above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   STEP TWO: To measure the depth of the rootball, hold the
shovel's handle against it, then place the handle upright in the
hole to determine if the hole is deep enough.
</P>
<P>
   STEP THREE: Place tree in the hole, lifting the tree by its
rootball, as are Greg Levine (right) and volunteer Brian Harris.
</P>
<P>
   STEP FOUR: Remove any grass from the remaining soil, then fill
in the hole. (Though some experts recommend adding soil amendments,
Trees Atlanta says trees need to adapt to existing conditions
instead of being ``teased'' by amendments.) Break up any clumps of
soil, being careful to avoid damaging the rootball.
</P>
<P>
   STEP FIVE: Build a ``dirt doughnut'' around the tree, about the
diameter of its top, to prevent runoff. (Once the tree is
established, remove that barrier for proper drainage.)
</P>
<P>
   STEP SIX: Add several inches of mulch, such as pine bark or
straw, to help the soil retain moisture. But keep the mulch at
least 3 inches away from the trunk because mulch can spread
insects, fungus and disease. Depending on conditions, give new
trees at least 10 gallons of water every few days until
established.
</P>

   A WIDE RANGE OF IDEAS FOR INTERNET TAX LAWS
</P>
<P>
   NO TAXES, PERIOD
</P>
<P>
   This position, championed primarily by Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio,
and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., calls for a permanent ban on
federal, state or local taxes on the sale of goods or services over
the Internet. This plan would pre-empt even in-state taxes on
Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   NO TAX DISCRIMINATION
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., have
introduced the Internet Non-Discrimination Act, which would
permanently prohibit lawmakers from creating new and discriminatory
Internet commerce and access taxes. For example, states could not
put a tax on an online newspaper subscription if there is no tax on
traditional newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   NO 'REMOTE' TAXES
</P>
<P>
   Gov. James Gilmore, R-Va., chairman of the Advisory Commission
on Electronic Commerce, is the primary backer of a plan that would
block states from taxing ``remote'' sales occurring in other states
via the Internet. In addition, he would eliminate the 3 percent
federal excise tax on telecommunications and replace it with a
three-year, 1 percent telecommunications tax. While the tax lasted,
those revenues would be turned over to the states.
</P>
<P>
   EXTEND TAX BAN WHILE SIMPLIFYING
</P>
<P>
   The six corporate leaders who make up the business caucus of the
Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce want Congress to extend
the current Internet tax moratorium until 2006 to give states time
to simplify their tax systems. Then in 2006, on-line companies
would collect and remit the simplified sales and use taxes. The
caucus also wants Congress to immediately establish a five-year ban
on all taxation, both in stores and on line, of products that could
be delivered through the Internet. Finally, they want Congress to
eliminate the 3-percent federal excise tax on telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   STATES SIMPLIFY TAXES
</P>
<P>
   The National Governors' Association wants states to make their
tax systems simpler and more uniform, without help from Congress.
In addition to pushing for tax uniformity among states, the group
would make the tax collection process easier for business owners by
establishing state-certified software and ``trusted third parties''
to compute and remit taxes. The governors would offer incentives to
on-line businesses that voluntarily register and agree to collect
taxes under the simplified system.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL TAX ON INTERNET SALES
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., has introduced a bill to establish
a national tax for out-of-state Internet sales. Revenues would be
sent back to the states. This plan would establish a system to
gather up the taxes that now go uncollected because of limits on
states' powers.
</P>
<P>
   RADICAL REFORM OF ALL TAXES
</P>
<P>
   Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, R-La., has sponsored a bill to
replace the federal income tax with a 15 percent national sales
tax. His idea has helped stir talk about radical reform of the
nation's tax system, with income taxes being eliminated in favor of
national, uniform sales taxes on all retail transactions, whether
online or not and the revenues remitted to federal, state and local
treasuries.

 &HT;    INTERNET TAXES: WHERE DO THE WHITE HOUSE RIVALS STAND?
 &HT;    With INTERNET-TAXES. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Feb. 27.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress tries to make up its mind what to do
about taxing Internet sales, little guidance is coming from this
year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates _ especially the Republicans _ do have
different approaches, the debate is muted because all of them
oppose any early action to alter current law.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona takes the most forthright approach
toward the application of sales and use taxes to sales across state
borders: He's against them.
</P>
<P>
   As the New Hampshire primary approached, the McCain camp posted
a ``Just Say No to Internet Taxes'' banner ad on the Slate Web
site. The idea was to embarrass Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who
had called for a three- to five-year moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was the chief sponsor of the current three-year
moratorium on Internet taxation, which expires in October 2001. In
the Senate, he has fought for a permanent ban.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, McCain signed an ``E-Freedom Declaration,''
saying, ``I support a permanent ban on Internet taxes because the
Internet is the greatest economic engine the world has ever seen.
As president, I will not let the Internet become a tax collection
machine for politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain assailed Bush for failing to take same pledge. By not
doing so, the senator charged, Bush ``is endorsing a tax increase
that could total over $160 billion by 2003.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as governor of a state that collects more than half its
revenues from sales taxes, cannot easily afford to ignore the
rapidly growing online market. Sheltering those sales from taxes
could pose a serious revenue problem to many Texas communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the current moratorium on Internet sales taxes and
would extend it for several more years to determine the full impact
of e-commerce on our society,'' Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   The no-tax pledge is the handiwork of a lobbying group known as
the E-Freedom Coalition, closely aligned to the Americans for Tax
Reform.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor the two Democratic presidential contenders,
former Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore, have taken the
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the Associated Press where he stood on the issue of
Internet taxes, Gore responded: ``I supported the (1998) Internet
Tax Freedom Act, which President Clinton signed into law.'' Bradley
noted that he also backs that three-year moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic candidates cited the ongoing work of a
congressional advisory panel known as the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he backs the panel's ``efforts to develop a tax
policy which encourages the astonishing growth of the Internet and
electronic commerce, but is fair to bricks-and-mortar companies and
doesn't erode the state and local revenue stream.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Gore said while he did not want to prejudge the
panel's conclusions, ``I will tell you that I am committed to
finding a solution to this issue that will allow the Internet and
e-commerce to flourish, but without stripping states and localities
of the revenue they need to educate our children and fight crime.''

 &HT;    CROSS-CURRENTS OF INTEREST ROIL THE INTERNET TAX DEBATE
 &HT;    With INTERNET-POLITICS, INTERNET-PLAYERS, INTERNET-PLANS,
INTERNET-Q&AMP;A, INTERNET-TIMELINE and INTERNET-STATES.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Feb. 27.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As more Americans begin using the Internet each
day, they are discovering that online shopping can be convenient,
fast and _ perhaps best of all _ free of sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Now some political leaders want Congress to guarantee that the
Internet will remain a tax-free zone. They say the lost sales tax
revenues are a small price to pay for today's robust ``new
economy,'' which is generating other revenues as incomes and
property values rise.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of governors, mayors and Main Street
merchants are asking: is this fair? Why should one group of
retailers escape the burden of collecting taxes, while others must
gather the revenues needed for schools, roads, police and more?
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when the gap between rich and poor is so wide,
many question whether it's good public policy to allow
Internet-savvy consumers to avoid sales taxes while poorer people
without computers bear a hefty tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy may get more attention this week as the nation's
governors gather for the annual winter meeting of the National
Governors' Association.
</P>
<P>
   The governors, who will meet Monday with President Clinton and
Tuesday with senators, are promoting a plan to make online
retailers begin collecting more taxes. At the same time, they want
to push state legislatures to simplify local tax rules and rates to
better fit the borderless Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   The governors' proposal is just one of many different plans
being floated in Washington, but virtually everyone agrees that old
laws, drawn to fit the business environment of the 1900s, must be
updated for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who think this is a great time to
overhaul the tax system,'' said Steve Papermaster, an Austin,
Texas, high-tech entrepreneur and member of the executive council
of Technology Network (TechNet), a political action group. ``We now
have a significant lag between old legislation (and) the reality of
today's digital economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no other taxes are less in sync with the global Internet
than local sales taxes, imposed by roughly 7,500 taxing
jurisdictions. When ``special purpose'' taxes for certain
districts, such as downtowns, are counted, the country may have
more than 30,000 different sets of sales tax rules, creating a
potential nightmare for online merchants who ship goods everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when sales taxes were first imposed in the 1930s,
they were seen as a simple way to tax the rich, who were the only
people who could afford to shop in those depressed times.
</P>
<P>
   To help poor families, many states provided exemptions for food.
But today, tax officials find themselves struggling to define what
is a food.
</P>
<P>
   In California, ``a bottle of still water like Evian is not
taxed, but a bottle of Perrier is taxed because it has bubbles,''
and that makes it a snack, said Richard Prem, a partner with
Deloitte &AMP; Touche, an accounting firm. Such exemptions ``make it
very tough to comply with the rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though complicated, sales taxes are popular because they take
pressure off of income and property taxes. Today, 45 states impose
sales taxes, which collectively raise more than $150 billion
annually, or about a third of state revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But the drawbacks of sales taxes are becoming more apparent as
commerce shifts to cyberspace, where merchants sell to people in
all states.
</P>
<P>
   For now, online retailers operate like mail-order companies that
send packages around the country. Supreme Court rulings have
determined that a company can be forced to collect sales taxes only
from customers who live in a state where the company has a
``physical presence,'' such as its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   While mail-order companies never significantly threatened state
coffers, the frenzied growth of online sales is raising concerns.
Internet sales are expected to total roughly $20 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Such commerce is still so new that projecting sales growth over
several decades is impossible, but ``the trend is definitely
upward,'' said Donald Bruce, an economist at the University of
Tennessee. He recently completed a study that estimates states will
be losing $10.8 billion annually because of Internet sales by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Congress has been willing to ignore the fears of
governors and mayors. In 1998, Congress passed the Internet Tax
Freedom Act, imposing a moratorium on any new Internet taxes until
October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   To provide a blueprint for online commerce after 2001, Congress
also created the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, a
group of 19 people drawn from businesses, statehouses and federal
agencies. That group, which will hold its final meeting in Dallas
next month, is supposed to make recommendations to Congress by
April 21.
</P>
<P>
   Many tax experts fear that commission members' opinions vary so
widely, no consensus will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter what the commission suggests, it's far from clear
what Congress will do.
</P>
<P>
   Many people assume Republicans object more than Democrats to
Internet taxes. But many Republicans hate state income taxes even
more than sales taxes, and fear that if the Internet erodes the
sales tax base, then income taxes might have to make up the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Internet debate does not split neatly into
``conservative'' and ``liberal'' sides, corporate lobbying efforts
have been somewhat muddled. Many retailers themselves are divided
on the tax issue because they operate both traditional stores and
online outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Another potentially powerful lobbying group, affluent
homeowners, may also have conflicting interests: they wouldn't want
to see property taxes rise, but they like buying electronics, books
and other goods from online merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Given how tangled the issue is, congressional action seems
unlikely in 2000, said Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow and sales
tax expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research
center. ``It's an election year, so I don't think much will
happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Congress may want to push the issue to the back
burner, the National Governors' Association plans to turn up the
heat. The organization wants states to take the initiative by
streamlining and standardizing tax definitions, forms, rules and
audit requirements. Once taxes have been simplified, the
association would have online merchants collect taxes with the help
of state-certified software and ``trusted third parties'' to
compute and remit taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But not every governor agrees. For example, Virginia's Gov.
James Gilmore, a Republican and the chairman of the advisory
commission, says Internet companies ought to continue operating
under the rules for mail-order companies because that arrangement
has allowed Internet companies to create millions of jobs.
Internet-generated prosperity is boosting state revenues from
income, corporate and property taxes, making online sales taxes
unnecessary, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And while lawmakers and governors bicker among themselves over
sales taxes, Internet entrepreneurs also are split. Some say
cyberspace should be a tax-free zone, while others believe states
do need sales tax revenues to provide the services and
infrastructure needed in a fast-growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   But even those online retailers who would be willing to collect
taxes say Congress or the states must vastly simplify taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to collect taxes for thousands of jurisdictions ``would
be a nightmare,'' said Andrew Busey, founder of living.com, an
Austin-based online retailer. ``You could get software to do
anything, but it's a matter of how long it takes to build and how
long it would take to integrate it with your existing systems and
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   All that effort would slow the growth of the Internet, Busey
said. But a simple, uniform tax system would raise revenues while
taking minimal time away from building the new economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would certainly make it a lot easier on us,'' he said.

   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ In its closing argument in
the Microsoft trial, the government said Tuesday that it is
``simply impossible to imagine'' that the company will not be found
to have violated the nation's antitrust laws, based on the
mountains of courtroom evidence against the company. The Justice
Department and 19 states suing Microsoft Corp., antitrust experts
say, was playing a stong hand _ after Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
issued findings of fact last November that supported the
government's version of the case in nearly every respect. Yet
Jackson has not yet issued his conclusions of law, expected
sometime in the next few months. Tuesday's presentations were the

   SCI-DRUGS-PRESCHOOLERS (Undated) _ In a finding that medical

the number of preschoolers taking stimulants, antidepressants and
other psychiatric drugs rose ``dramatically'' between 1991 and
1995. Prescriptions for stimulants _ most commonly methylphenidate,
the generic form of Ritalin _ increased two to three-fold among
children, ages 2 to 5, enrolled in two state Medicaid programs and
one northwestern HMO, the researchers found. Prescriptions for
antidepressants doubled in the Medicaid programs. By Erica Goode.

their part,'' attorney John Patten said in closing arguments at the

President Vladimir Putin is expected to win. The citizens of this

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The battle over Internet taxation is being fought
by political leaders at both the state and federal levels. These
are some of the dominant voices in the debate:
</P>
<P>
   STATE LEADERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Gov. James Gilmore, R-Va., chairman of the congressionally
appointed Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce. Unlike most
governors, he believes Congress should protect online retailers
from new taxes. He points to his state's healthy coffers to show
that online companies, such as home-grown America Online Inc., can
create enough prosperity to compensate for any lost sales tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gov. Michael Leavitt, R-Utah, chairman of the National
Governors' Association and a member of the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce. He believes that unless online sales are
taxed, many states soon could face a revenue crisis. He has been
quietly pursuing a compromise that would extend the current tax
moratorium until 2003, giving states a chance to develop new
software and computer networks to help businesses collect taxes on
remote sales.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE LEADERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Bob Goodlatte, R-VA., co-sponsor of the Internet
Non-Discrimination Act, a bill introduced in February to block new
Internet taxes. As chairman of the Congressional Internet Caucus,
he is widely recognized as a champion of high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Christopher Cox, R-Calif., a longtime advocate of curbing
federal regulation of the Internet. He says that California's sales
tax revenues have skyrocketed because of the prosperity generated
by the growth of mostly tax-free online commerce. He wants to
convert the current moratorium on new Internet taxes into a
permanent ban.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE LEADERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., sponsor of the Internet Tax Freedom

 &HT;    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT INTERNET TAXES
 &HT;    With INTERNET-TAXES. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Feb. 27.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In terms of taxes, do online companies follow the same rules
as other retailers?
</P>
<P>
   A. Rather than collect sales taxes as traditional local
retailers are obligated to do when customers make purchases, online
merchants follow the laws that govern catalog companies and other
direct marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the sales tax rules for direct marketers?
</P>
<P>
   A. Ordinarily, mail-order and online companies in one state do
not collect taxes on merchandise shipped to another state. But if a
merchant has a physical presence in your state, then it will
collect sales tax. If you buy an item from the Sears' Web site, you
mostly likely would have to pay tax on the sale, because Sears has
stores all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does that mean customers have no tax obligations when they
buy online from an out-of-state company?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Internet and catalog customers are supposed to pay state
sales taxes, even if the taxes aren't collected at the point of
sale. In most states, you are supposed to fulfill your obligation
by calling your state tax authority and requesting a tax form. In
reality, virtually no one does this, and few states even try to
collect the sales taxes they should be getting.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It seems a little crazy to think people would voluntarily
mail in sales taxes. Why are the rules like that?
</P>
<P>
   A. The tax obligations of direct marketers and their customers
were spelled out by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1992 case called
Quill Corp. v. North Dakota. The court held that imposing a tax
collection obligation on an out-of-state vendor with no physical
presence in North Dakota was unconstitutional because the high cost
of complying with the myriad rules and rates of different states
put an undue burden on interstate commerce. Back in 1992,
electronic commerce was virtually unknown, and mail-order sales
were only a small part of the retail world, so not many people took
much notice of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If catalog companies have been getting along under the Quill
ruling for years, and most states are reaping record sales tax
revenues, why bother changing anything?
</P>
<P>
   A. States didn't worry much about catalog companies because
those transactions didn't put a significant dent in state budgets.
But with the Internet growing so quickly, no one can safely predict
the impact on state revenues. For example, this past holiday
season, online sales surpassed $7 billion, more than doubling the
previous year's results. If that growth rate were to continue,
sales tax revenues could plummet. A recent study by economists at
the Univeristy of Tennessee predicted that electronic commerce
would cost states about $10.8 billion in lost revenues by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible that traditional retailers could use the
Internet to escape sales taxes. For example, they could let a
customer view merchandise in the store, then go to a computer
kiosks to purchase it online _ tax-free _ from a separate, but
affiliated, company in a different state.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Given that states are facing the prospect of dramatic
declines in revenues, what are they doing?
</P>
<P>
   A. So far, most state and local leaders are just fretting. But
in a few places, lawmakers are debating solutions. In Texas, Lt.
Gov. Rick Perry has created the Advisory Council on the Digital
Economy, a group of business leaders and state senators that will
recommend tax changes to the Legislature by January. Some
legislators in Virginia say the state should eliminate the state's
4.5 percent sales tax to help attract Internet retailers who
otherwise might be reluctant to lose taxable sales from its 7
million residents.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is Congress saying about the issue?
</P>
<P>
   A. In 1998, Congress passed a moratorium on new state or local
taxes on Internet sales through October 2001. But the political
pressure from governors and mayors is growing. Given what a hot
topic this is becoming, Congress soon may consider Internet tax
bills being floated by a number of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is Congress getting any input from business leaders?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. The 1998 law also created the federal Advisory
Commission on Electronic Commerce. The 19-member committee, with
representatives drawn from industry and government, will have its
final meeting March 20 and 21 in Dallas. The group is supposed to
make recommendations to Congress by April 21.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What action might Congress take?
</P>
<P>
   A. One possibility is a national sales tax on remote sales. In
this scenario, the Internal Revenue Service would receive tax
revenues collected by online retailers, and then Congress would
appropriate the money back to the state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one idea; there are lots of others. For example, the
six companies whose representatives make up the ``business caucus''
of the federal advisory committee recently suggested that Congress
exempt books, music, records and other information and
entertainment products from all sales taxes, both in stores and on
the Internet. In exchange for this exemption and a new tax break
for telecommunications companies, state governments would gain the
authority to collect other sales taxes from direct marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But that possible solution still would have online retailers
collecting sales taxes. Isn't that supposed to be too complicated
for them?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some experts believe that a combination of streamlined tax
rates and better software could solve revenue collection problems.
They say new software could match each ZIP code with its sales tax
rate and rules, making it easier for businesses to collect the
right taxes from each customer. Other experts suggest creating new
firms, licensed by the states and dedicated to administering tax
software and handling the revenues.

JUSTICES DECIDE TO STAY OUT OF DISPUTE OVER CUBAN BOY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trims) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday opted to stay out of
the international dispute over whether 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez
must be returned from Miami to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, without comment, rejected the unusual appeal of an
Arizona man who had urged them to order that Elian be sent home.
Robert Hirschfeld, a disbarred Phoenix lawyer, bypassed lower
federal courts in directly urging the justices to ``cut short'' the
political dispute that has swirled around Elian ever since he was
plucked from the Atlantic Ocean after a desperate voyage from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The legal dispute over Elian began Nov. 25, when fishermen found
the boy clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast. His mother
and 10 other people had drowned during the voyage from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered Elian to
be returned to his father, Juan Gonzalez, who was divorced from the
boy's mother. But Elian's great uncle and other relatives in Miami,
with whom the boy has been living, are seeking a court order to
have him stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Michael Moore in Miami said he will hold a
hearing on the family's lawsuit the week of March 6. Moore was
assigned to the case by random computer selection Tuesday after the
original judge, William Hoeveler, suffered a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld, the self-proclaimed founder of the National Congress
for Fathers and Children, argued to the justices in vain that their
early intervention was needed to preserve the father-child bond.
</P>
<P>
   In other high court action, the justices agreed to decide
whether the Constitution permits police, in their zeal to catch
drunken drivers and drug traffickers, to stop all motorists and
check for narcotics in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, expected in July 2001, will have no effect
on Texas. The state Court of Criminal Appeals in 1994 ruled that
police could not establish so-called sobriety checkpoints until the
Texas Legislature passes a law allowing the practice, a move
lawmakers have not made.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision to hear the case from Indianapolis
brings into question the legality of roadside checkpoints, a common
law-enforcement tactic against drunken driving and the drug trade.
As part of the practice, officers stop motorists and conduct quick
visual examinations of whether the driver is impaired or is
carrying illegal narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis, whose police have conducted the checkpoints since
August 1998, told the justices that the checks only briefly delay
law-abiding motorists and are necessary to keep roads safe and
discourage drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The city is pressing the justices to overturn a 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals decision that the checkpoints are
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the high court refused without comment to hear a
condemned Alabama man's challenge to the constitutionality of the
state's exclusive use of the electric chair for executions.
</P>
<P>
   The court's conservative and liberal wings were divided over the
decision of whether to hear murderer Robert Lee Tarver Jr.'s
argument that the electric chair is cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas
refused to hear the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David H. Souter
and John Paul Stevens and voted to consider the case. But under
Supreme Court rules, a majority of five justices must agree to
accept a death-row appeal before the case will be heard.
</P>
<P>
   In his unsuccessful appeal to the justices, Tarver's attorney,
Bryan Stevenson, called the electric chair ``antiquated'' and said
it can cause ``excessive burning, disfigurement and ... pain and
suffering'' before death. Alabama countered that the electric chair
administers an almost painless and instantaneous death.
</P>
<P>
   The court's refusal to hear the case sets no binding legal
precedent as to the constitutionality of executions in Alabama,
Georgia and Nebraska, the states that use the electric chair as the
exclusive means of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Texas relies solely on lethal injection for executions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court's refusal, however, allows Alabama officials to set a
new execution date for Tarver, who had been scheduled to be put to
death earlier this month until the Supreme Court granted a stay
pending its consideration of his appeal.

 &HT;    CROSS-CURRENTS OF INTEREST ROIL THE INTERNET TAX DEBATE
 &HT;    With INTERNET-POLITICS, INTERNET-PLAYERS, INTERNET-PLANS,
INTERNET-Q&AMP;A, INTERNET-TIMELINE and INTERNET-STATES.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As more Americans begin using the Internet each
day, they are discovering that online shopping can be convenient,
fast and _ perhaps best of all _ free of sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Now some political leaders want Congress to guarantee that the
Internet will remain a tax-free zone. They say the lost sales tax
revenues are a small price to pay for today's robust ``new
economy,'' which is generating other revenues as incomes and
property values rise.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of governors, mayors and Main Street
merchants are asking: is this fair? Why should one group of
retailers escape the burden of collecting taxes, while others must
gather the revenues needed for schools, roads, police and more?
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when the gap between rich and poor is so wide,
many question whether it's good public policy to allow
Internet-savvy consumers to avoid sales taxes while poorer people
without computers bear a hefty tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy may get more attention this week as the nation's
governors gather for the annual winter meeting of the National
Governors' Association.
</P>
<P>
   The governors, who will meet Monday with President Clinton and
Tuesday with senators, are promoting a plan to make online
retailers begin collecting more taxes. At the same time, they want
to push state legislatures to simplify local tax rules and rates to
better fit the borderless Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   The governors' proposal is just one of many different plans
being floated in Washington, but virtually everyone agrees that old
laws, drawn to fit the business environment of the 1900s, must be
updated for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who think this is a great time to
overhaul the tax system,'' said Steve Papermaster, an Austin,
Texas, high-tech entrepreneur and member of the executive council
of Technology Network (TechNet), a political action group. ``We now
have a significant lag between old legislation (and) the reality of
today's digital economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no other taxes are less in sync with the global Internet
than local sales taxes, imposed by roughly 7,500 taxing
jurisdictions. When ``special purpose'' taxes for certain
districts, such as downtowns, are counted, the country may have
more than 30,000 different sets of sales tax rules, creating a
potential nightmare for online merchants who ship goods everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when sales taxes were first imposed in the 1930s,
they were seen as a simple way to tax the rich, who were the only
people who could afford to shop in those depressed times.
</P>
<P>
   To help poor families, many states provided exemptions for food.
But today, tax officials find themselves struggling to define what
is a food.
</P>
<P>
   In California, ``a bottle of still water like Evian is not
taxed, but a bottle of Perrier is taxed because it has bubbles,''
and that makes it a snack, said Richard Prem, a partner with
Deloitte &AMP; Touche, an accounting firm. Such exemptions ``make it
very tough to comply with the rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though complicated, sales taxes are popular because they take
pressure off of income and property taxes. Today, 45 states impose
sales taxes, which collectively raise more than $150 billion
annually, or about a third of state revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But the drawbacks of sales taxes are becoming more apparent as
commerce shifts to cyberspace, where merchants sell to people in
all states.
</P>
<P>
   For now, online retailers operate like mail-order companies that
send packages around the country. Supreme Court rulings have
determined that a company can be forced to collect sales taxes only
from customers who live in a state where the company has a
``physical presence,'' such as its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   While mail-order companies never significantly threatened state
coffers, the frenzied growth of online sales is raising concerns.
Internet sales are expected to total roughly $20 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Such commerce is still so new that projecting sales growth over
several decades is impossible, but ``the trend is definitely
upward,'' said Donald Bruce, an economist at the University of
Tennessee. He recently completed a study that estimates states will
be losing $10.8 billion annually because of Internet sales by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Congress has been willing to ignore the fears of
governors and mayors. In 1998, Congress passed the Internet Tax
Freedom Act, imposing a moratorium on any new Internet taxes until
October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   To provide a blueprint for online commerce after 2001, Congress
also created the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, a
group of 19 people drawn from businesses, statehouses and federal
agencies. That group, which will hold its final meeting in Dallas
next month, is supposed to make recommendations to Congress by
April 21.
</P>
<P>
   Many tax experts fear that commission members' opinions vary so
widely, no consensus will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter what the commission suggests, it's far from clear
what Congress will do.
</P>
<P>
   Many people assume Republicans object more than Democrats to
Internet taxes. But many Republicans hate state income taxes even
more than sales taxes, and fear that if the Internet erodes the
sales tax base, then income taxes might have to make up the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Internet debate does not split neatly into
``conservative'' and ``liberal'' sides, corporate lobbying efforts
have been somewhat muddled. Many retailers themselves are divided
on the tax issue because they operate both traditional stores and
online outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Another potentially powerful lobbying group, affluent
homeowners, may also have conflicting interests: they wouldn't want
to see property taxes rise, but they like buying electronics, books
and other goods from online merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Given how tangled the issue is, congressional action seems
unlikely in 2000, said Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow and sales
tax expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research
center. ``It's an election year, so I don't think much will
happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Congress may want to push the issue to the back
burner, the National Governors' Association plans to turn up the
heat. The organization wants states to take the initiative by
streamlining and standardizing tax definitions, forms, rules and
audit requirements. Once taxes have been simplified, the
association would have online merchants collect taxes with the help
of state-certified software and ``trusted third parties'' to
compute and remit taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But not every governor agrees. For example, Virginia's Gov.
James Gilmore, a Republican and the chairman of the advisory
commission, says Internet companies ought to continue operating
under the rules for mail-order companies because that arrangement
has allowed Internet companies to create millions of jobs.
Internet-generated prosperity is boosting state revenues from
income, corporate and property taxes, making online sales taxes
unnecessary, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And while lawmakers and governors bicker among themselves over
sales taxes, Internet entrepreneurs also are split. Some say
cyberspace should be a tax-free zone, while others believe states
do need sales tax revenues to provide the services and
infrastructure needed in a fast-growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   But even those online retailers who would be willing to collect
taxes say Congress or the states must vastly simplify taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to collect taxes for thousands of jurisdictions ``would
be a nightmare,'' said Andrew Busey, founder of living.com, an
Austin-based online retailer. ``You could get software to do
anything, but it's a matter of how long it takes to build and how
long it would take to integrate it with your existing systems and
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   All that effort would slow the growth of the Internet, Busey
said. But a simple, uniform tax system would raise revenues while
taking minimal time away from building the new economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would certainly make it a lot easier on us,'' he said.

   A WIDE RANGE OF IDEAS FOR INTERNET TAX LAWS
</P>
<P>
   NO TAXES, PERIOD
</P>
<P>
   This position, championed primarily by Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio,
and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., calls for a permanent ban on
federal, state or local taxes on the sale of goods or services over
the Internet. This plan would pre-empt even in-state taxes on
Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   NO TAX DISCRIMINATION
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., have
introduced the Internet Non-Discrimination Act, which would
permanently prohibit lawmakers from creating new and discriminatory
Internet commerce and access taxes. For example, states could not
put a tax on an online newspaper subscription if there is no tax on
traditional newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   NO 'REMOTE' TAXES
</P>
<P>
   Gov. James Gilmore, R-Va., chairman of the Advisory Commission
on Electronic Commerce, is the primary backer of a plan that would
block states from taxing ``remote'' sales occurring in other states
via the Internet. In addition, he would eliminate the 3 percent
federal excise tax on telecommunications and replace it with a
three-year, 1 percent telecommunications tax. While the tax lasted,
those revenues would be turned over to the states.
</P>
<P>
   EXTEND TAX BAN WHILE SIMPLIFYING
</P>
<P>
   The six corporate leaders who make up the business caucus of the
Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce want Congress to extend
the current Internet tax moratorium until 2006 to give states time
to simplify their tax systems. Then in 2006, on-line companies
would collect and remit the simplified sales and use taxes. The
caucus also wants Congress to immediately establish a five-year ban
on all taxation, both in stores and on line, of products that could
be delivered through the Internet. Finally, they want Congress to
eliminate the 3-percent federal excise tax on telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   STATES SIMPLIFY TAXES
</P>
<P>
   The National Governors' Association wants states to make their
tax systems simpler and more uniform, without help from Congress.
In addition to pushing for tax uniformity among states, the group
would make the tax collection process easier for business owners by
establishing state-certified software and ``trusted third parties''
to compute and remit taxes. The governors would offer incentives to
on-line businesses that voluntarily register and agree to collect
taxes under the simplified system.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL TAX ON INTERNET SALES
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., has introduced a bill to establish
a national tax for out-of-state Internet sales. Revenues would be
sent back to the states. This plan would establish a system to
gather up the taxes that now go uncollected because of limits on
states' powers.
</P>
<P>
   RADICAL REFORM OF ALL TAXES
</P>
<P>
   Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, R-La., has sponsored a bill to
replace the federal income tax with a 15 percent national sales
tax. His idea has helped stir talk about radical reform of the
nation's tax system, with income taxes being eliminated in favor of
national, uniform sales taxes on all retail transactions, whether
online or not and the revenues remitted to federal, state and local
treasuries.

 &HT;    LEADERS IN THE INTERNET TAX DEBATE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The battle over Internet taxation is being fought
by political leaders at both the state and federal levels. These
are some of the dominant voices in the debate:
</P>
<P>
   STATE LEADERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Gov. James Gilmore, R-Va., chairman of the congressionally
appointed Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce. Unlike most
governors, he believes Congress should protect online retailers
from new taxes. He points to his state's healthy coffers to show
that online companies, such as home-grown America Online Inc., can
create enough prosperity to compensate for any lost sales tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gov. Michael Leavitt, R-Utah, chairman of the National
Governors' Association and a member of the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce. He believes that unless online sales are
taxed, many states soon could face a revenue crisis. He has been
quietly pursuing a compromise that would extend the current tax
moratorium until 2003, giving states a chance to develop new
software and computer networks to help businesses collect taxes on
remote sales.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE LEADERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Bob Goodlatte, R-VA., co-sponsor of the Internet
Non-Discrimination Act, a bill introduced in February to block new
Internet taxes. As chairman of the Congressional Internet Caucus,
he is widely recognized as a champion of high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Christopher Cox, R-Calif., a longtime advocate of curbing
federal regulation of the Internet. He says that California's sales
tax revenues have skyrocketed because of the prosperity generated
by the growth of mostly tax-free online commerce. He wants to
convert the current moratorium on new Internet taxes into a
permanent ban.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE LEADERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., sponsor of the Internet Tax Freedom
Act of 1998, which put a three-year moratorium on new Internet
taxes. As a presidential candidate, he continues to push for a
permanent ban all Internet-related taxes, even on in-state
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., sponsor of the Internet
Non-Discrimination Act. He has long been a leader in the effort to
ban taxes on the Internet.

 &HT;    INTERNET TAXES: WHERE DO THE WHITE HOUSE RIVALS STAND?
 &HT;    With INTERNET-TAXES. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Feb. 27.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress tries to make up its mind what to do
about taxing Internet sales, little guidance is coming from this
year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates _ especially the Republicans _ do have
different approaches, the debate is muted because all of them
oppose any early action to alter current law.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona takes the most forthright approach
toward the application of sales and use taxes to sales across state
borders: He's against them.
</P>
<P>
   As the New Hampshire primary approached, the McCain camp posted
a ``Just Say No to Internet Taxes'' banner ad on the Slate Web
site. The idea was to embarrass Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who
had called for a three- to five-year moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was the chief sponsor of the current three-year
moratorium on Internet taxation, which expires in October 2001. In
the Senate, he has fought for a permanent ban.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, McCain signed an ``E-Freedom Declaration,''
saying, ``I support a permanent ban on Internet taxes because the
Internet is the greatest economic engine the world has ever seen.
As president, I will not let the Internet become a tax collection
machine for politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain assailed Bush for failing to take same pledge. By not
doing so, the senator charged, Bush ``is endorsing a tax increase
that could total over $160 billion by 2003.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as governor of a state that collects more than half its
revenues from sales taxes, cannot easily afford to ignore the
rapidly growing online market. Sheltering those sales from taxes
could pose a serious revenue problem to many Texas communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the current moratorium on Internet sales taxes and
would extend it for several more years to determine the full impact
of e-commerce on our society,'' Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   The no-tax pledge is the handiwork of a lobbying group known as
the E-Freedom Coalition, closely aligned to the Americans for Tax
Reform.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor the two Democratic presidential contenders,
former Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore, have taken the
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the Associated Press where he stood on the issue of
Internet taxes, Gore responded: ``I supported the (1998) Internet
Tax Freedom Act, which President Clinton signed into law.'' Bradley
noted that he also backs that three-year moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic candidates cited the ongoing work of a
congressional advisory panel known as the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he backs the panel's ``efforts to develop a tax
policy which encourages the astonishing growth of the Internet and
electronic commerce, but is fair to bricks-and-mortar companies and
doesn't erode the state and local revenue stream.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Gore said while he did not want to prejudge the
panel's conclusions, ``I will tell you that I am committed to
finding a solution to this issue that will allow the Internet and
e-commerce to flourish, but without stripping states and localities
of the revenue they need to educate our children and fight crime.''

 &HT;    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT INTERNET TAXES
 &HT;    With INTERNET-TAXES. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Feb. 27.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In terms of taxes, do online companies follow the same rules
as other retailers?
</P>
<P>
   A. Rather than collect sales taxes as traditional local
retailers are obligated to do when customers make purchases, online
merchants follow the laws that govern catalog companies and other
direct marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the sales tax rules for direct marketers?
</P>
<P>
   A. Ordinarily, mail-order and online companies in one state do
not collect taxes on merchandise shipped to another state. But if a
merchant has a physical presence in your state, then it will
collect sales tax. If you buy an item from the Sears' Web site, you
mostly likely would have to pay tax on the sale, because Sears has
stores all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does that mean customers have no tax obligations when they
buy online from an out-of-state company?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Internet and catalog customers are supposed to pay state
sales taxes, even if the taxes aren't collected at the point of
sale. In most states, you are supposed to fulfill your obligation
by calling your state tax authority and requesting a tax form. In
reality, virtually no one does this, and few states even try to
collect the sales taxes they should be getting.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It seems a little crazy to think people would voluntarily
mail in sales taxes. Why are the rules like that?
</P>
<P>
   A. The tax obligations of direct marketers and their customers
were spelled out by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1992 case called
Quill Corp. v. North Dakota. The court held that imposing a tax
collection obligation on an out-of-state vendor with no physical
presence in North Dakota was unconstitutional because the high cost
of complying with the myriad rules and rates of different states
put an undue burden on interstate commerce. Back in 1992,
electronic commerce was virtually unknown, and mail-order sales
were only a small part of the retail world, so not many people took
much notice of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If catalog companies have been getting along under the Quill
ruling for years, and most states are reaping record sales tax
revenues, why bother changing anything?
</P>
<P>
   A. States didn't worry much about catalog companies because
those transactions didn't put a significant dent in state budgets.
But with the Internet growing so quickly, no one can safely predict
the impact on state revenues. For example, this past holiday
season, online sales surpassed $7 billion, more than doubling the
previous year's results. If that growth rate were to continue,
sales tax revenues could plummet. A recent study by economists at
the Univeristy of Tennessee predicted that electronic commerce
would cost states about $10.8 billion in lost revenues by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible that traditional retailers could use the
Internet to escape sales taxes. For example, they could let a
customer view merchandise in the store, then go to a computer
kiosks to purchase it online _ tax-free _ from a separate, but
affiliated, company in a different state.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Given that states are facing the prospect of dramatic
declines in revenues, what are they doing?
</P>
<P>
   A. So far, most state and local leaders are just fretting. But
in a few places, lawmakers are debating solutions. In Texas, Lt.
Gov. Rick Perry has created the Advisory Council on the Digital
Economy, a group of business leaders and state senators that will
recommend tax changes to the Legislature by January. Some
legislators in Virginia say the state should eliminate the state's
4.5 percent sales tax to help attract Internet retailers who
otherwise might be reluctant to lose taxable sales from its 7
million residents.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is Congress saying about the issue?
</P>
<P>
   A. In 1998, Congress passed a moratorium on new state or local
taxes on Internet sales through October 2001. But the political
pressure from governors and mayors is growing. Given what a hot
topic this is becoming, Congress soon may consider Internet tax
bills being floated by a number of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is Congress getting any input from business leaders?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. The 1998 law also created the federal Advisory
Commission on Electronic Commerce. The 19-member committee, with
representatives drawn from industry and government, will have its
final meeting March 20 and 21 in Dallas. The group is supposed to
make recommendations to Congress by April 21.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What action might Congress take?
</P>
<P>
   A. One possibility is a national sales tax on remote sales. In
this scenario, the Internal Revenue Service would receive tax
revenues collected by online retailers, and then Congress would
appropriate the money back to the state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one idea; there are lots of others. For example, the
six companies whose representatives make up the ``business caucus''
of the federal advisory committee recently suggested that Congress
exempt books, music, records and other information and
entertainment products from all sales taxes, both in stores and on
the Internet. In exchange for this exemption and a new tax break
for telecommunications companies, state governments would gain the
authority to collect other sales taxes from direct marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But that possible solution still would have online retailers
collecting sales taxes. Isn't that supposed to be too complicated
for them?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some experts believe that a combination of streamlined tax
rates and better software could solve revenue collection problems.
They say new software could match each ZIP code with its sales tax
rate and rules, making it easier for businesses to collect the
right taxes from each customer. Other experts suggest creating new
firms, licensed by the states and dedicated to administering tax
software and handling the revenues.

MCSORLEY'S SHAMELESS ACT OF ASSAULT UP FOR REVIEW BY NHL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever it was that got into Marty McSorley's head, and
ultimately into his arms and stick, he will have a chance to
explain Wednesday when he sits before National Hockey League
disciplinarian Colin Campbell at league headquarters in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley can talk. He can justify. He can apologize. He can
invoke the devil-made-me-do-it defense. Maybe he'll say he was
still feeling the drain of jet leg, the long haul from Boston to
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever he says, or how he says it, it just won't be good
enough. There is nothing he can say. The days when violence was an
accepted part of hockey, thankfully, are long gone. If only it
could be eradicated, too.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley lifted his stick, clearly intent on hurting Donald
Brashear, and if not for his helmet, the Canucks' 28-year-old
forward could have been paralyzed or killed. The replay, shown
thousands of times across North America Tuesday, showed Brashear's
head bouncing off the ice Monday night like a hard rubber ball, the
end result of McSorley chopping at his temple and knocking him
backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in shock,'' McSorley said immediately following the
incident, sounding as if some demon had leased his soul. ``I have
to come to terms with what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   In short order, Campbell will do that for him. Based on the Dale
Hunter decision of '93, McSorley will have to be hit with no less
than a 21-game suspension. Hunter, a Washington thug, ambushed
Pierre Turgeon from behind, some three seconds after Turgeon, arms
up and rejoicing, scored a playoff goal for the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman handled the Hunter-Turgeon case
personally, and in truth, he let Hunter off lightly. It was nothing
less than a street mugging and Hunter, no stranger to the dark side
of the game, should have been turfed for at least half a season.
Personally, I would have benched Hunter for a year and then allowed
him to apply for reinstatement, subject to the review of a panel
that included league and union employees, and a group of his
playing peers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what of McSorley? Frankly, I think the Hunter mugging was
worse. No one knows what either individual truly was thinking, but
Hunter's hit _ a crash from behind _ looked more aggravated.
Nonetheless, McSorley's two-hander falls into the same family of
heinous misbehavior, because he was clearly headhunting and he
clearly connected. Brashear was down, bleeding and twitching. The
end result looked far worse than the crumpled deck of cards that
was Turgeon the day he was crushed by Hunter (who, by the way, in
his Quebec days, delivered a pitchfork-like spear directly to Terry
O'Reilly's groin).
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (thankfully) have but 23 games remaining in what has
turned out to be a season worse than even their dead-last campaign
of 1996-97. If the league does the right thing _ and I am certain
it will _ McSorley's suspension will encompass at least the rest of
the regular season and all of the playoffs (increasingly a moot
point here in the Hub).
</P>
<P>
   Boston fans have seen worse over the decades. McSorley's chop
doesn't come close to the paralyzing crackdown Oakland's Jack Tatum
delivered to the Patriots' Darryl Stingley in a 1978 exhibition
game. Who could forget the look in Ted Green's eyes, caught by
camera, as Wayne Maki sliced into his skull with a two-hander in a
1969 Bruins-Blues exhibition game? Compared with those incidents,
McSorley's swing looks like a love tap.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when McSorley's conduct was du rigueur on the
rink. Vivid in my mind is an afternoon game in the '60s, televised
by CBS, when Boston's Wayne Cashman (we give you loose cannon,
Exhibit A) barreled into a mid-ice scrum, and came ripping down
with a wild-swinging two-hander aimed at some faceless Flyer.
Cashman missed the guy's skull by a couple of inches and cracked
him across the collarbone. It was frightening. Two inches from a
certain homicide. Remember, those were the days before the helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday night, the worst thing McSorley ever did with a
stick was carry an illegal blade into the 1993 Stanely Cup finals.
Keen-eyed Montreal coach Jacques Demers called for a measurement
that night at the old Forum, and the minor penalty against McSorley
cost the Kings the game _ and, in the view of many, the Stanley
Cup. It was McSorley's 15 seconds of Buckneresque infamy.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cashman days, McSorley's misdeed probably wouldn't have
drawn more than a five-minute major. In fact, if Brashear had been
the only guy with a helmet, the referee might have been willing to
let the final three seconds burn off the clock and sweep the whole
thing under the Zamboni. Quotes the next day would have referenced
the perils of playing in a man's game with, of all things, head
protection.
</P>
<P>
   But here in February 2000 we all expect better. That especially
includes the players, even the game's tough guys like McSorley and
Brashear, who have to be assured they can play an inherently
dangerous game without the threat of someone turning it into an
open audition for ``NYPD Blue'' shooting at Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if McSorley is ashamed of what he did. At least he
has that much right. It is the second ridiculous, inexcusable act
by a Bruin this season. The other was Joe Murphy leaving the bench
in St. Louis to corral, mug, and pummel Blues forward Tyson Nash.
This is some disciplined bunch, isn't it? No wonder they're sitting
in Edmonton with 18 wins, dressed in black, veiled in shame.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURNDALE, Fla. _ ``You want to look at oranges?'' Jim Walker
asked. ``Well, let's go look at oranges.'' Walker, lean and fit at
70, jumped into his red minivan. I joined him, and minutes later we
were deep into Walker Groves, a 70-acre spread of citrus trees
midway between Tampa and Orlando that his family has cultivated for
more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   Here in central Florida, the citrus groves form a sea of dark
green foliage stretching to the horizon. Unfortunately, the horizon
is limited; the land is so flat that there are hardly any places
high enough to see more than a mile or two. The growers and the
bureaucrats who watch over the crop use helicopters to keep an eye
on the groves and, in fact, to count the oranges. Not one by one,
of course, but by using educated guesses about how much fruit a
tree will produce. The crop for the growing season from fall 1997
through late spring 1998, the most recent count available, came to
about 48 billion oranges, according to the Florida Citrus
Department.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, we bumped along past rows of 12-to-15-foot-high
trees thick with glossy, dark green leaves but bereft of fruit.
``Early varieties,'' Walker said, ``all picked.'' Abruptly, we came
upon row after row of trees laden with fat orange fruit.
``Valencias,'' my host remarked, ``not quite ready yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I had recognized them. In fact, it was their imminent
arrival in my local supermarket that lured me down here last week
in the first place. I am, I must confess, an orange-juice addict.
Only two or three fresh-squeezed oranges a day will do it for me,
and Valencias are my orange of choice. I await their annual debut
the way some people yearn for the start of spring training. In
fact, the ballplayers and the Valencias turn up around here every
year at about this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best juice oranges in the world,'' Walker agreed.
</P>
<P>
   You might not know it by looking at them. These happen to be
pretty good looking oranges, but not all Valencias are. Valencias
are thin skinned, making them susceptible to nicks and bruises.
When they are ripe, they may be a brilliant orange or tinged with
yellow or even green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color has nothing to do with ripeness,'' Walker said. ``A
green orange can be fully ripe and an orange one far from ready to
be picked. What makes an orange orange is cold weather. When it
gets a little warmer around here in a few weeks, these Valencias
could turn green again. But they'll be ripe.''
</P>
<P>
   But they are heavy with juice. They have been bred that way,
although the Florida weather helps. California oranges, navels
mostly, develop thick skins because they are grown in a dry
climate. They are light in weight and drier in texture. Florida
oranges are juicier because Florida is wetter. The water table is
high, and the rainfall is one of the heaviest in the United States.
In Florida, water is everywhere, even in the oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it's the navel that is considered the eating orange, by
growers and consumers alike, because it peels so easily and looks
so much more attractive in the produce bin. It's too bad; a
Valencia sliced into wedges or circles is a fine thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Valencia was once known as the Rivers Late, after the
Englishman who first shipped the seeds here in the 19th century. It
came to be known as the Valencia when, it is said, a Spanish grower
saw some Rivers Late trees in this country and claimed them to be
his country's Valencias. (The navel orange has a less romantic
history: it is known formally as the Washington Navel, not for the
state but for Washington, D.C., where it was propagated by the
Agriculture Department after arriving from Brazil in the 1870s.)
</P>
<P>
   Today, Valencias are the world's most popular orange, and they
grow in every part of the world where oranges thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Orange trees have a lot in common with grapevines. With wine
grapes, the noble European vinifera vines _ cabernet sauvignon,
chardonnay and others _ are grafted onto disease-resistant American
roots that, left on their own, would produce relatively useless
grapes. Similarly, fruit-bearing citrus branches are grafted onto
rootstock derived from, among others, the Rough Lemon tree. On its
own, the Rough Lemon will produce unusable fruit. Paired with good
plant material, it produces high-quality fruit: oranges, lemons,
grapefruit or limes.
</P>
<P>
   A grafted orange tree comes into maturity in five years; a tree
grown from seeds takes at least 15 years. Seedling trees are rare
in Florida these days. Growing lemon tree rootstock is itself a
major business. Much of Florida's citrus is grown in sand, which
contributes little or nothing to the tree's well-being. Most of its
nutrition, aside from what it gets from sun and water, comes from
hefty doses of manufactured nutritives.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy tree can be economically viable for 50 years, a Citrus
Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida a century ago, the groves began much farther north,
not all that far from the Georgia border. Frequent devastating
frosts prompted the industry to move farther and farther south.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fewer frost problems,'' the spokesman told me. ``But
lots of the groves are in hurricane territory now, and a hurricane
can be just as deadly as a bad frost.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in an ideal season, there is a long period, from late
summer through winter, when there are no Valencias to be found.
Since oranges, including Valencias, are grown all over the world,
they are always in season somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In northern European cities, it's not uncommon to find oranges
from all over the world in the markets. Why don't we see oranges
from Morocco or Uruguay or South Africa or Brazil in this country?
Spanish clementines do show up, but other foreign oranges are
scarce because they compete with the domestic product. French
supermarkets may put on a dazzling display of imported oranges, but
there are no domestic growers to complain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, tariffs protect Florida Valencias;
California navels, which ripen in the early fall; and other
varieties that ripen between those two main seasons. The only times
we are short of oranges in this country is when Florida is hit by a
bad freeze, as happened in 1990, when more than a third of the crop
was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The juice business also has had a profound effect. The
year-round availability of good _ and infinitely cheaper _ frozen
and bottled juice has all but squeezed out the fresh-orange
business. Sales of fresh citrus fruit are almost an afterthought in
the orange-juice business, a $3 billion-a-year industry. Oranges
are counted in 90-pound boxes, the way they are picked in the
groves. In 1997-98, more than 230 million boxes of Florida oranges
went into pasteurized, chilled juice, most of it from reconstituted
frozen concentrate, according to the Citrus Department. Fewer than
9 million boxes were sold as fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh grapefruit fared better. From the same harvest, some 28
million 85-pound boxes went into chilled juice, and 20 million were
shipped as fresh fruit, the department says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, when John McPhee wrote a monumental two-part essay on
oranges for The New Yorker magazine, he was surprised to discover
how difficult it was to get fresh orange juice in Florida.
State-run tourist offices offered every sun-starved visitor a cup
of juice, McPhee reported, but it was all made from concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has changed. Tourists arriving at the portals of the
Sunshine State are still offered free orange juice, and it still
isn't fresh squeezed, even though an orange, presumably a fresh
one, is featured prominently on the state license plate. Some
Florida hotels offer fresh juice, at a price, but rarely does
anyplace else. At both the Florida Citrus Department in Lakeland
and at Tropicana Products' vast headquarters and bottling plant in
Bradenton, cordial receptionists offered me orange juice, but none
of it fresh squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Walker said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Oranges have been grown in Florida since the 16th century.
Columbus took citrus seeds on his first voyage and spread them
around the Caribbean. Ponce de Leon is supposed to have taken them
from Spain to Florida. ``He came looking for the Fountain of
Youth,'' the juice people like to say, ``but in fact he brought it
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred years later, some Florida scientists invented
frozen concentrate. By the time McPhee wrote his essay, the
changeover from fresh fruit to frozen concentrate was almost
complete. The 6- and 12-ounce cans whose contents were diluted with
three equal amounts of water were in millions of home freezers.
Minute Maid, a pioneer in the concentrate business, became the
country's largest producer of processed orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, however, consumers began to move away from
frozen concentrate toward chilled juice, both pasteurized
not-from-concentrate and reconstituted concentrate. Chilled-juice
sales passed frozen concentrate in 1986, and the gap has continued
to widen. Chilled juice now accounts for more than 60 percent of
all orange-juice sales, the department says.
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana, which produces chilled juice, both from fresh fruit
and from concentrate, is now first in the industry, with between 37
percent and 38 percent of the market, said Jim Dwyer, Tropicana's
senior vice president for North American operations. Florida is the
nation's largest producer of oranges, and each year Tropicana buys
about 25 percent of the state's orange crop. In the 1998-99 season,
the company produced some 320 million gallons of orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast is the United States' biggest orange-juice market,
consuming some 40 percent of all the orange juice the country
makes. The New York metropolitan area alone consumes about 17
percent of the national output. Just to serve the metropolitan
market, Tropicana dispatches five full trainloads of orange juice
each week to its bottling plant in Jersey City, N.J. Each train
carries more than 5.2 million gallons of juice. Tropicana also has
production plants in France, Britain and China.
</P>
<P>
   The Tropicana plant in Bradenton is a technological marvel.
Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, millions of oranges are
squeezed, turned into rivers of juice and bottled, some with no
pulp, some with a bit of pulp and some with a lot of pulp. ``Kids
hate pulp,'' said Steven Lezman, a Tropicana executive, who showed
me around.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he didn't just say it; he shouted it, the only way to
be heard over the ceaseless, ear-splitting roar of the plant
machinery. Like all dedicated Tropicana people, Lezman is immune to
the lure of fresh juice, even though he has his own private orange
tree in his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep two kinds of Tropicana juice in the refrigerator at
home,'' Lezman said. ``No pulp for the kids and pulp for the
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Auburndale, where the only noise is an occasional
blackbird and where hawks wheel lazily in the warm, late winter
air, Walker squeezes his juice in a stainless-steel machine about
half the size of a player piano. It's in a back room of the little
shop on Route 599, where he welcomes tourists who are loyal fans,
newcomers lured by his billboards out on the Interstate and a
surprising number of Floridians who refused to take the dearth of
fresh juice in their state lying down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got people coming all the way up from Hollywood,'' he
said, chuckling. ``They want a few gallons of the real stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Walker is no stranger to the more commercial side of the
business. What he doesn't sell at his shop, or ship around the
country in gift packages, he sells to local processors to be turned
into pasteurized juice or concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just so I can keep this way of life going for a while,'' he
said, as we walked among his fruit-laden trees. ``My grandfather
came down here from Tennessee in 1884. He was 30 years old and
suffering from what they used to call consumption. They'd told him
he wasn't going to live long in any case but that he might live a
little longer in Florida. Well, this life must have agreed with
him; he lived to be 87.''
</P>
<P>
   I returned to my car and headed for Tampa, pulling on a quart
bottle of Walker juice and thinking about that old man. Could it
have been the orange juice? It seemed distinctly possible. &QL;

HOW THE RICH ARE DIFFERENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; John Loring &LR; , design director of Tiffany &AMP; Co., is in San
Francisco this week with his new book, ``Tiffany Jewels'' (Abrams;
$60).
</P>
<P>
   Are the rich of today different from the tiara-wearing rich of
yesteryear? ``There are a lot of young people all over the world
who have been remarkably successful,'' he said, ``especially in
technology. We have a very large population of very young people
who have the means to have whatever they want. They can be very
lavish, and buy perfectly wonderful gemstones at prices not
available to everyone, but they want to wear these things in their
own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, says Loring, he gives a ``big lunch party for the
Save Venice charities. I will tell you right now that the very
aristocratic Venetian woman wears denims and a white T-shirt and a
magnificent string of pearls. The clothing will be absolute
minimum, but she'll be wearing a breathtaking string of pearls or
jeweled pin at the waistline.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that the clothes are simple, the jewelry
expensive. Tiffany sales over the holidays were ``stupendous,''
said Loring, ``absolutely astonishing. ... It was partly due to the
fact that ready-to-wear fashion has become so exorbitantly
expensive that women think, look, for that amount of money I could
buy a beautiful piece of jewelry. We've been helped by the fact
that ready-to-wear fashion has priced itself out of the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. ``In this era of luxe,'' writes Vogue magazine columnist
 &UR; Camilla Nickerson &LR; , ``affordable clothes have sort of been
forgotten.'' And so the latest issue of the magazine launches ``The
Look for Less,'' a column that spotlights ``stylish clothing that
can be found for under $2,001.'' The debut spread includes bargain
trench coats for just under $900.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. A Town &AMP; Country spread on San Francisco Arts Commission
head  &UR; Stanlee Gatti &LR; , who's in the party-creating business, says
that his low price for a wedding nowadays is $50,000, and the price
for the most fancy ``has blasted to an outrageous $7 million.''
</P>
<P>
   DO have a cascading bridal bouquet, advises Gatti; DON'T have
too many glasses and too much silverware on the table. ``There's a
part of me,'' says this renegade, ``that loves to see one glass on
the table, one knife and fork, and silverware served before each
course.''
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. Socialite  &UR; Nan Kempner  &LR; told the New York Daily News how
she broke her shoulder. During one of her dinner parties, she
tripped on a phone cord, ``lassoed my foot and went forward. I fell
on my shoulder to avoid falling face first.'' That was a considered
decision, she said, because she had just gotten a face-lift.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile,  &UR; Fran Lebowitz &LR;  gave the online magazine Senses her
own opinion of women who try to turn back the clock with surgery.
``What's the goal here?'' she asked, in comments quoted in the New
York Post. ``To get invited to the prom? It's a crazy thing to do
in middle age. If you're in your 40s or 50s and you think your life
will change because of a nose job, you are a moron.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHEN THE WIND BLOWS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tom Geller &LR; , whose office is on the Embarcadero in San
Francisco, at the foot of Howard Street, poses a science (?)
question.
</P>
<P>
   Geller, who works for GCI Group, and his office mate have a
glass door that opens toward the Bay Bridge. They often leave the
door open to get some fresh air. Somehow, the building's position
allows papers to remain on their desks, undisturbed by gusts of
wind. ``Except,'' writes Geller, ``every day, at precisely 5:06
p.m., a wind whips up for about 30 seconds and scatters the
detritus from our desks.''
</P>
<P>
   The instant wind doesn't seem to be the result of cooling caused
by the sun going down, says Geller. The time never changes, even as
the days grow longer.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone have any idea as to what causes this?
</P>
<P>

HOW THE RICH ARE DIFFERENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; John Loring &LR; , design director of Tiffany &AMP; Co., is in San
Francisco this week with his new book, ``Tiffany Jewels'' (Abrams;
$60).
</P>
<P>
   Are the rich of today different from the tiara-wearing rich of
yesteryear? ``There are a lot of young people all over the world
who have been remarkably successful,'' he said, ``especially in
technology. We have a very large population of very young people
who have the means to have whatever they want. They can be very
lavish, and buy perfectly wonderful gemstones at prices not
available to everyone, but they want to wear these things in their
own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, says Loring, he gives a ``big lunch party for the
Save Venice charities. I will tell you right now that the very
aristocratic Venetian woman wears denims and a white T-shirt and a
magnificent string of pearls. The clothing will be absolute
minimum, but she'll be wearing a breathtaking string of pearls or
jeweled pin at the waistline.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that the clothes are simple, the jewelry
expensive. Tiffany sales over the holidays were ``stupendous,''
said Loring, ``absolutely astonishing. ... It was partly due to the
fact that ready-to-wear fashion has become so exorbitantly
expensive that women think, look, for that amount of money I could
buy a beautiful piece of jewelry. We've been helped by the fact
that ready-to-wear fashion has priced itself out of the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. ``In this era of luxe,'' writes Vogue magazine columnist
 &UR; Camilla Nickerson &LR; , ``affordable clothes have sort of been
forgotten.'' And so the latest issue of the magazine launches ``The
Look for Less,'' a column that spotlights ``stylish clothing that
can be found for under $2,001.'' The debut spread includes bargain
trench coats for just under $900.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. A Town &AMP; Country spread on San Francisco Arts Commission
head  &UR; Stanlee Gatti &LR; , who's in the party-creating business, says
that his low price for a wedding nowadays is $50,000, and the price
for the most fancy ``has blasted to an outrageous $7 million.''
</P>
<P>
   DO have a cascading bridal bouquet, advises Gatti; DON'T have
too many glasses and too much silverware on the table. ``There's a
part of me,'' says this renegade, ``that loves to see one glass on
the table, one knife and fork, and silverware served before each
course.''
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. Socialite  &UR; Nan Kempner  &LR; told the New York Daily News how
she broke her shoulder. During one of her dinner parties, she
tripped on a phone cord, ``lassoed my foot and went forward. I fell
on my shoulder to avoid falling face first.'' That was a considered
decision, she said, because she had just gotten a face-lift.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile,  &UR; Fran Lebowitz &LR;  gave the online magazine Senses her
own opinion of women who try to turn back the clock with surgery.
``What's the goal here?'' she asked, in comments quoted in the New
York Post. ``To get invited to the prom? It's a crazy thing to do
in middle age. If you're in your 40s or 50s and you think your life
will change because of a nose job, you are a moron.''

<P>
   &UR; WHEN THE WIND BLOWS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tom Geller &LR; , whose office is on the Embarcadero in San
Francisco, at the foot of Howard Street, poses a science (?)
question.
</P>
<P>
   Geller, who works for GCI Group, and his office mate have a
glass door that opens toward the Bay Bridge. They often leave the
door open to get some fresh air. Somehow, the building's position
allows papers to remain on their desks, undisturbed by gusts of
wind. ``Except,'' writes Geller, ``every day, at precisely 5:06
p.m., a wind whips up for about 30 seconds and scatters the
detritus from our desks.''
</P>
<P>
   The instant wind doesn't seem to be the result of cooling caused
by the sun going down, says Geller. The time never changes, even as
the days grow longer.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone have any idea as to what causes this?

GILLETTE SEEKS SALE OF BRAUN DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gillette Co. has hired J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. to explore a
possible sale of a portion of its Braun division.
</P>
<P>
   The review will focus on Braun's household appliance and home
diagnostics business. Braun also makes electric shavers and
power-assisted oral-care products. Those businesses will not be
part of the review.
</P>
<P>
   The move, announced Tuesday, was not unexpected. In the fall,
Boston-based Gillette had said it would consider several options,
including a possible sale, for business lines that were not
performing as well as its razors and battery divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gillette said it had hired Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. to
conduct a similar review of its stationery business.
</P>
<P>
   Challenged by economic troubles in some of its key overseas
markets, Gillette has been under pressure from Wall Street
investors to sell some of its noncore product lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the decision is made to divest the businesses, we will not
sell at fire-sale prices,'' said Gillette spokesman Eric A. Kraus.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette bought Braun in 1967 for $68 million.
</P>
<P>
   With razors and blades, Gillette has perfected a winning
strategy. It uses innovative technology to differentiate its razors
from the competition. Then it relies on big marketing campaigns to
convince consumers that a razor is not a commodity product and that
a Gillette razor is well worth a premium price.
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of acquisitions, Gillette has looked to apply
that strategy to other consumer product categories.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has worked for Gillette's Duracell battery
division, as well as for Braun razors and oral-care products. But
Gillette has had a harder time trying to introduce technological
innovations to low profit-margin categories with products such as
Paper Mate pens, Braun blenders, and Braun ear thermometers.
</P>
<P>
   These product lines, while of high quality, don't have ``a
synergistic fit'' with Gillette's core categories of razors,
batteries, and oral care, said Fredric E. Russell of Fredric E.
Russell Investment Management Co., a Gillette investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud the decision'' to hire J.P. Morgan to review options
for Braun's underperforming business lines, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Braun accounted for $1.58 billion of Gillette's total
sales of $9.9 billion. The portions of the Braun business that are
subject to review accounted for about $500 million in 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   If Gillette were to sell the underperforming Braun product lines
and its stationery business, it could reduce overall sales by just
over $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Gillette fell 7/16 to
close at 37 1/8.

MARSALIS MAKES JAZZ MORE THAN JUST A WORD IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JONATHAN ANSFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In their first 48 hours of music making here, Wynton
Marsalis and his Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra put on two smooth
performances before well-dressed audiences, two educational events
for Chinese jazz colleagues and schoolchildren, and two smoking jam
sessions with local musicians for a small, ravenous circle of fans.
</P>
<P>
   They received uncommonly nice treatment from the Ministry of
Culture and had their pictures taken with local music personalities
ranging from the rock legend Cui Jian to the People's Liberation
Army Jazz Band.
</P>
<P>
   And all this after a climb up the Great Wall. Tuesday and
Wednesday they will be in Guangzhou, their last stop on the China
leg of a world tour celebrating Jazz at Lincoln Center in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, we made it up to that first tower,'' Marsalis said
of the climb. ``That was good. It took a lot of dedication to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take a lot of work to open up the small market for jazz
in China, where a home-grown jazz album has never been produced and
most people know the form only by name.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, home of China's only real jazz scene, a few veteran
musicians, Chinese and foreign, make their music at several bars
and international hotels. It is usually limited to improvising by
one of a dozen bands whose members have picked up what they know
from smuggled John Coltrane or Louis Armstrong CDs.
</P>
<P>
   The city was the first stop on a tour loftily intended to expose
much of the world's population to the wonders of jazz. The China
part of the tour was sponsored by the Sony Corp. and locally
organized by the China National Culture and Art Co. The orchestra
goes next to Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Japan and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Ellington never got to China, nor did Louis Armstrong, so
this trip is a milestone, said Rob Gibson, executive producer and
director of Jazz at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra has faced some obstacles. Officials in Shanghai
initially refused to let the ensemble play at the Shanghai Center
Theater over the weekend because ``they have to think that it's
high art before they let it take the stage,'' said Chen Jixin,
executive vice president of the local organizing company. Officials
relented after the local organizer sent a packet of material
documenting the prestigious places Lincoln Center Jazz has played,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's arching 700-seat Century Theater was about 90 percent
full for the two opening shows, but Chen indicated that hundreds of
tickets had been given to the media and officials. Ticket prices
ran from $15 to $95. Permits for the event did not come until Jan.
24, and many white-collar workers had left town for the Chinese New
Year by the time promotions were under way.
</P>
<P>
   After Marsalis and company, dapper in charcoal suits and navy
polka-dot ties, enchanted an evening crowd with a potent rendition
of Ellington's ``Chinoiserie,'' The Beijing Evening News compared
their level of mastery to that of the NBA All Stars or the wulin
masters, a reference to a martial arts tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis spent a few minutes at each concert explaining the
onomatopoeia of his latest album, ``Big Train,'' and his remarks
seemed to have an effect. Li Zhixin, 35, noted that trains in
different places sound very different. But ``I knew it was a train
when I heard that hoo-hoo,'' he said, adding that with Marsalis'
introduction, ``I think I have a deeper understanding of what he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis said he had come to China with no preconceived notions
of the musical tastes or the level of jazz in China. ``It's
something my daddy always taught me. He said `Son, if you don't
know, you don't know. You got to go to know.'''
</P>
<P>
   During an educational concert on Wednesday, the orchestra leader
had young students stomping their feet in rhythm. To teach them the
concept of shifting out of beat, he had them repeat the word
syn-co-pa-tion.
</P>
<P>
   Li Xiaopeng, 16, a junior high school student, said he normally
listened to Flower, a Chinese pop alternative that is a sensation
with teen-agers here. But he said, ``I think Chinese my age should
be able to accept this music because it's pretty vigorous.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu Yuan, formerly the saxophonist for Cui Jian and now the only
real name in Chinese jazz, said that no amount of new information
could make up for the scarcity of bands and clubs. ``We've seen
what's happened in Taiwan and Hong Kong,'' he said. ``What's the
use of being able to read about it if you can't go listen to it?''
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring jazz musicians face stumbling blocks from the beginning
of music school, where there are practically no teachers with jazz
backgrounds, said Zhang Longyun, a saxophonist who graduated from
the Central Academy of Music and has a day job selling antique
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis' workshop for musicians at the CD Cafe, Beijing's one
established jazz hangout, was packed.
</P>
<P>
   Liu, who played at the event, said: ``A lot of people thought
that he might come down hard on us, but I didn't find that at all.
He was incredibly patient.'' The main lesson he took from Marsalis,
he said, was to be forceful.
</P>
<P>
   The concert tour opened with repeated reminders to audiences to
turn off videotape recorders and cell phones, which are ubiquitous
here. There was the odd jing-a-ling, but Marsalis was not about to
pass judgment. Paraphrasing words uttered by Ellington during a
taping of ``Chinoiserie,'' he said: ``No one knows who's in the
shadow of whom. Every cliche comes from someone's perspective.''

LOCAL PHONE COMPANY TO ENTER E-COMMERCE VIA MAJOR ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (bl)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the biggest move by a major local phone company into the
torrid electronic commerce business, SBC Communications said
Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire Sterling Commerce for almost
$3.9 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   As competition increases in every sector of the communications
industry, established companies like SBC and AT&AMP;T are trying to
de-emphasize the sale of raw communications pipes and offer instead
more complex services that can carry richer profits.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling, based in Dallas, is a leader in developing systems
that link businesses to one another so that they can electronically
exchange information. In the last year, the so-called
business-to-business part of e-commerce has become a newly popular
and heavily traveled stomping ground for both public investors and
private institutions like venture capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, based in San Antonio, is the No. 1 local phone company (at
least until Bell Atlantic completes its pending acquisition of
GTE). It is spending billions of dollars to enhance systems that
deliver Internet data to customers at high speeds. But the company
also wants to sell and profit from the software applications that
can ride on top of its Internet infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling, which has as its clients large corporations like ,
including Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Wal-Mart Stores, would give SBC an
advantage in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This instantly gives SBC the skill sets, software, products
and services needed to take the lead in one of the most rapidly
growing segments of the e-commerce market,'' Edward E. Whitacre,
SBC's chairman, said in a statement. ``Sterling Commerce's highly
skilled information technology teams also will help us in the
future, as we continue to capitalize on Internet-driven
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Sterling's shareholders would receive $44.25 in
cash for each of their Sterling shares, a 40 percent premium over
Sterling's closing share price Friday of $31.5625.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling's shareholders were obviously pleased Tuesday as the
company's shares rose $12, to $43.5625. But SBC's shareholders had
doubts about the deal, sending SBC's shares down $2.25, to $36,
despite the company's assurances that the acquisition would not
dilute SBC earnings.
</P>
<P>
   To their chagrin, the big local phone companies are generally
valued by investors on their per-share earnings growth and dividend
payments. At this moment of sky-high Internet valuations, that can
sometimes make it difficult for the old-line local phone giants to
pull off big acquisitions. &QL;

JEWISH MUSEUMS FROM BERLIN TO THE BAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: In lead, Jewish Museum San Francisco is the official title of
the museum. No words are missing.) 
jt) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Jewish Museum San Francisco has unveiled a design by the
Berlin-based architect Daniel Libeskind _ his first project in the
United States _ to be built in the Yerba Buena cultural district
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is scheduled to reopen in a renovated power
substation in 2002. The $60 million project will include more than
100,000 square feet of space for a core exhibition, temporary
shows, offices, a theater, media lab, bookstore and cafe. The
museum has been designed in association with Gordon H. Chong &AMP;
Partners, architects in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Libeskind is best known for the new Jewish Museum in Berlin,
which is widely judged the most important of the many buildings
that have risen in the German capital since the destruction of the
Berlin Wall. A dramatic composition of zinc-clad, zigzag-shaped
wings, the Berlin Jewish Museum has brought wide public attention
to the work of an architect previously known for theoretical
projects. For the Berlin museum, Libeskind's floor plans
incorporated shapes that evoke lightning bolts, surgical sutures
and the Star of David. The museum's interior and outdoor garden are
so powerfully expressive that the building began to draw crowds
long before any art had been installed.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco design is a parabuilding, or an addition that
radically transforms a structure. An angular construction of
complex geometric forms, clad in metal, will be inserted inside the
Jessie Street substation, built in 1907 and vacant for two decades.
The addition will straddle the building's roof and clamp onto the
red brick facades at either end, inserting a highly visible
architectural identity into the cityscape.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a classical musician before he came to the United
States to study architecture, Libeskind has often used musical
motifs in his unbuilt works. In 1988 the Museum of Modern Art
included his projects in its show on deconstructionist
architecture, whose curator was Philip Johnson. Titled ``City
Edge,'' the project featured a gigantic concrete slab, tilted on
one end, that rose 10 stories to peer over the Berlin Wall. In 1998
Libeskind won a competition to design an addition to the Victoria
and Albert Museum in London. Titled ``The Spiral Extension,'' the
project is scheduled for completion in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco visitors will pass through the power station's
imposing entrance to arrive in a soaring lobby dominated by large
metal renderings of the two letters that form the Hebrew word chai,
or life. Libeskind has also used the two letters to create
three-dimensional spaces inside the substation. Galleries derived
from the letter chet will contain the museum's core exhibition.
Spaces based on the letter yud will provide vertical and horizontal
circulation throughout the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Libeskind was born in Lodz, Poland, in 1946. Jewish and
cabalaistic themes have figured in his previous work. In a design
statement Libeskind writes: ``In the Jewish tradition, letters are
not mere signs, but are substantial participants in the story they
create. Thus the spatiality of chai _ a fundamental emblem of
Jewish life _ will be experienced as a full dynamic movement
responding to the many levels of interpretation this word
possesses.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the Yerba Buena area has become a major focus
for the ethnically diverse cultural life of San Francisco. It is
already home to several institutions designed by distinguished
architects. They include the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art,
designed by Mario Botta; the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, by
Fumihiko Maki; and the Center for the Arts Theater, by James
Stewart Polshek &AMP; Partners. A Mexican Museum is planned for a site
next to the new Jewish Museum, which will be at 701 Mission Street
and Third Street.

   JAPANESE-EDO-PAINTINGS (Indianapolis, Ind.) _ Over 20 years,

one of the largest and finest of its kind in private hands. From
the start, when he bought his first scroll painting _ which showed
a tiger gazing at the moon (prompting him later to call his Edo
works the Tiger Collection) _ Strassman was dazzled by, as he put
it, the ``unique flat perspective'' in Japanese art. Their
fragility and his space limitations made it impossible to view all
of his collection at one time. But Strassman will finally be able
to see most of these Edo paintings when they go on view in ``300

&HT;     HIGH COURT WEIGHS HUBBELL'S GUILTY PLEA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Whitewater prosecutors urged the Supreme Court
Monday not to throw out former Associate Attorney General Webster
Hubbell's guilty plea to a misdemeanor tax charge.
</P>
<P>
   But a court majority appeared to believe that the prosecutors
had unconstitutionally used incriminating financial documents that
Hubbell had provided them under an immunity agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very serious problem of prosecutorial over-reach
possible in this case,'' Justice Anthony Kennedy said. Justices
Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter and Sandra Day
O'Connor expressed similar views.
</P>
<P>
   Under investigation in 1996 by former Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr for possibly accepting money to change his testimony
in the Whitewater case, Hubbell decided to accept the immunity deal
to shield him from prosecution on that charge.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell was the No. 3 official at the Justice Department early
in Clinton's first term and has been a close friend of the
president and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, since their
Arkansas days. As part of his agreement, Hubbell was required to
turn over almost all of his business, financial and tax documents
from 1994 to 1996. Although the documents proved unrelated to the
so-called Whitewater probe of the Clintons' Arkansas land deals,
Starr's team discovered that Hubbell had not disclosed several
thousand dollars of his income on his 1994 income tax return. Starr
then decided to prosecute Hubbell for that, and in 1998 Hubbell was
indicted on tax-evasion charges.
</P>
<P>
   But later that year, U.S. District Judge James Robertson threw
out the case, saying that Starr had violated Hubbell's Fifth
Amendment rights by using documents provided under the immunity
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution's Fifth Amendment protects people from having
to testify against themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia affirmed Robertson's decision.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Hubbell pleaded guilty to the tax charge on condition
that his plea would be dismissed if the Supreme Court upheld the
lower court ruling. Therefore, Hubbell's plea will remain in place
only if the justices rule for the prosecutors. A decision is
expected by July. On Tuesday Hubbell's lawyer, John W. Nields Jr.,
said his client had turned over the documents with the
understanding that nothing he produced or said would be used
against him. The independent counsel's office is now trying to
``get out'' of its agreement, Nields charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what they consider to be immunity, then that is a
terrible kind of immunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a prosecutor, you want to tell (witnesses) that it's in
their interest to tell you everything they know and turn over every
document they have because the only way they can get into trouble
is by not being completely open and honest,'' he said. ``This would
turn that logic on its head.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said she had ``problems'' with the fact that the
independent counsel's office did not know about Hubbell's income
tax evasion until its prosecutors began looking into the documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only by virtue of the production of the documents that
you learned the facts that enabled you to carry out the
prosecution,'' she said.However, Ronald J. Mann, representing the
independent counsel's office now headed by Robert W. Ray, argued
that prosecutors should be able to use the contents of documents
against people who are forced to produce them under a grant of
immunity,
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution isn't concerned about what you do with the
documents,'' he insisted. ``It's only concerned with how you got
them, and we got them in a perfectly legal manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann said the immunity privilege such as the one given to
Hubbell does not bar prosecutors from using the contents of the
documents once they are handed over.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misleading federal
regulators about legal work he performed with the first lady on a
failed Arkansas real estate development. It was part of the
Whitewater probe, which began in 1994, into the land dealings of
then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and his wife during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell's plea in the felony case will not be affected by the
Supreme Court's decision. He was sentenced last June to a year of
probation.
</P>
<P>
   He previously served 16 months in prison for stealing almost
$500,000 his former Arkansas law firm and its clients. That charge
resulted from an earlier investigation by Starr.

&HT;     DAVIDIAN FOLLOWER DISCUSSES EVENTS IN WACO SIEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DICK J. REAVIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a fall afternoon in 1993, Derek Lovelock, a 38-year-old
Briton, suddenly found himself standing on the sidewalks of Waco,
three hours before the flight that would take him home.
</P>
<P>
   He was wearing a secondhand T-shirt, jeans whose origin were a
mystery to him _ and rubbery jail sandals. His own clothing had
been taken, presumably as evidence, when he was jailed seven months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelock had never been charged with a crime. Federal
authorities had held him, without bond, as a material witness to
the 1993 gunfight and fire at David Koresh's Branch Davidian
compound near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The British Consulate in Houston intervened to obtain Lovelock's
release from jail, because his father had died.
</P>
<P>
   Once back in Manchester, he was not recalled, either by
prosecutors in the 1994 San Antonio trial of 11 other survivors,
nor in 1995, when Congress investigated the federal siege of
Koresh's religious compound.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelock was in Houston last week for an interview with lawyers
for special counsel John Danforth, the former U.S. senator from
Missouri who is investigating the Waco events for the Justice
Department. Lovelock also returned to Texas to be deposed in a
wrongful death lawsuit, slated for trial in May, that other
survivors of the Branch Davidian attack filed against the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   In his sworn statements and in an interview, the British witness
gave an account of his time at the Branch Davidian compound that
challenges several points of the official version of the Waco
events _ and also debunks some claims that conspiracy theorists and
government critics have raised.
</P>
<P>
   Like most survivors of the siege, whenever the chance presents
itself, Lovelock also sought to reaffirm his faith in the religious
message that first brought him to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1980s, Lovelock, a member of a Seventh-day
Adventist Church, ran across a publication that warned about
Koresh, who had gone to the United Kingdom to recruit Adventists
for his flock. Lovelock was intrigued, despite the church's
warning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he went to the Koresh compound, where, he said, ``From
the Scriptures, David showed me things that no man had shown me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some two years later, he took up residence at the compound
again, even though there were aspects of its life that displeased
him _ first among them, guns. When other males volunteered for
lessons in weaponry, he stayed away. ``I just don't like guns,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that he didn't take up a weapon, as others did, on
the morning of Feb. 28, 1993, when some 75 agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms raided the property in search of a
cache of weapons. Lovelock said he was in the building's cafeteria
when ``I heard the helicopters. They got louder and louder, almost
as if they were landing on the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleadings in the wrongful death suit allege that federal agents
in the aircraft fired upon the Branch Davidian compound. Lovelock
did not see bullets strike where he was, nor did any shots come
through the walls of the bedroom in which he took cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran to the room and threw myself on the floor,'' he said,
not looking up until the shooting stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Four ATF agents and six followers of the Branch Davidian
religious cult died in the Feb. 28 gun battle. Koresh and more than
70 Branch Davidians, including some 21 children, died during the
inferno that ended the siege on April 19. (What caused the deadly
fire continues to be a source of speculation and investigation.)
</P>
<P>
   ATF agents who testified in the 1994 criminal trial denied that
they fired at unseen targets, and the House of Representatives,
during 1995 queries into the events at Waco, looked into charges
that shots were fired from the helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   While the House found no evidence to substantiate allegations
about helicopter gunfire, its report noted that ``there is
insufficient evidence to determine with certainty as to who fired
the shots'' that witnesses say left holes in the roof of the
Davidian complex.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelock said what he saw in the aftermath of the gun battle
convinced him that the helicopters fired at the building and that
ATF raiders fired through its doors.
</P>
<P>
   He drew these conclusions partly from viewing the body of
Winston Blake, a fellow Briton who had been his roommate. Blake was
shot dead, his autopsy and an ATF report say, by a bullet fired at
close range.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelock contests that finding. He believes Blake was felled by
shots fired from the helicopters toward vinyl water storage tanks
that stood in front of a window in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the bullet holes in the tanks,'' Lovelock said. ``There
were three of them, in a straight line. There was water coming into
the room.''
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's 1993 report on the Waco incident lists
Perry Jones, 64, as a second murder or suicide victim. The official
view is supported by a coroner's report, noting only one wound in
Jones' body _ in the roof of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Davidians who witnessed the raid admit that one of their number,
now dead, killed Jones, but they insist that his killing was an act
of mercy. Jones, they say, had been wounded by ATF fire as he stood
at the front door of the Branch Davidian building in the early
minutes of the raid. He begged to be put out of his misery, they
have testified.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelock said he saw Jones before his death, ``lying on his bed,
blood on his abdomen. He had been shot by the ATF.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Feb. 28 raid was over, Lovelock did not seriously
consider coming out, he said, because ``my fear of God was greater
than my fear of man. God is in control of my destiny, not man, and
I could have lost my soul eternally.''
</P>
<P>
   He presumed Koresh would eventually arrange an exit with the
FBI, which took over the siege shortly after the members of the
religious cult repelled the ATF.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would end up like it did,'' he said, ``and I
didn't think that I would be put in jail, because I hadn't done
anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The seven years since have not been kind ones, the survivor
says. A cook before he joined Koresh, Lovelock has not resumed life
in the workaday world. He is undergoing counseling and treatment
for depression, and flashbacks beset him, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I see something on TV, like a policeman dressed like
the ATF, it all comes back to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even on better days, he says, he is not up to par. ``I've lost
my get-up-and-go, my concentration and my confidence,'' he said.
Today, Lovelock lives on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   If there is light in his life, it antedates the events of 1993.
Lovelock, like others who survived the Waco ordeal, is steadfast in
his faith that Koresh was a prophet.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Waco messiah's scriptural interpretations, much on
Lovelock's mind during the 51-day siege, remains fresh in his mind
today.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh told his flock that what lay ahead was foretold in the
Bible's Book of Nahum, a book that many scholars think is
historical, not predictive, describing events in the seventh
century B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The text the Davidian preacher cited says ``The chariots shall
rage in the streets ... they shall seem like torches, they shall
run like the lightnings.'' Koresh told his followers that those
``chariots'' would be military tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the wicked fulfill prophecy,'' Lovelock said. ``As David
said to the FBI, `You guys made Nahum come true.'''

&HT;     RAIDERS ARE IN OAKLAND TO STAY (FOR NOW) 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAT RATTO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The headline in Saturday's Oakland Tribune,
the newspaper representing the community most in touch with the
travails of doing business with Al Davis, read simply, ``Raiders
Must Stay 11 Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's putting the best face forward on it. Apparently,
``Parole Denied For Raiders,'' or ``Back To The Hoosegow For Al''
didn't fit the allotted space.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to question the Tribune's headline writing skills _
to the contrary, those five words captured the facts and the mood
from both plaintiff and defendant in the Raiders' attempt to break
their lease with Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the owner of the Oakland Raiders can't go to Los
Angeles, no matter how much he claims he was hoodwinked by those
Machiavellian slyboots in the Oakland political establishment, no
matter how many spoons he sharpens to dig to freedom, no matter
whether he holds his breath until Carmen Policy turns blue.
</P>
<P>
   He's just going to have to be a man about it and take his
regular checks from the taxpayers until his claim that he was duped
by the Oakland politicians into returning to his vision of hell is
adjudicated.
</P>
<P>
   No, we're still not done yet. Davis gets to press his claim for
nearly a billion scoots in damages based on the hilarious notion
that the pols tricked him. This is not exactly the same thing as
Stephen Hawking being bamboozled by a flock of geese, but it comes
close enough.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, emitted by Superior Court Judge Joe S. Gray, a man
with a rich if slightly perverse sense of humor, was preliminary,
but unless he rescinds his ruling, the Raiders really will remain
in Oakland for 11 more fun-filled seasons.
</P>
<P>
   So we are back where we began, with Davis fuming over his
reception in Oakland, the politicians fuming over his obstinate
Al-ness, and the rest of us sick to death of the whole ghoulish
mess.
</P>
<P>
   Only now, the argument has reverted to money. Davis, never a man
to misunderstand the value of a dollar, is asking for $800 million
from the city and Alameda County to soothe his hurt feelings at
being lured from Los Angeles _ although ``lured'' isn't entirely
accurate. Davis has never been lured anywhere he didn't want to go,
as long as the money was right.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' chief defenders claim he has never been motivated by
money. This is, of course, monumental nonsense, because everybody
is motivated by money. Maybe Davis' chief interest is still winning
football games, but money has always been 1-A.
</P>
<P>
   How else did he deduce years before anyone else that the NFL TV
contract would be worth billions? How else has he been able to get
top buck and a dime beyond out of every negotiation he ever
entered? How has he taken a minority stake in a football team and
become one of the most influential men in the entire NFL? Well,
money. He knows how to make it, how to use it and how to replace it
with even more money. This trait does not make him a bad person; in
fact, it makes him a smart person. A very smart person.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes his claim that he was buffaloed into coming back an
interesting one, to put it kindly. Unless, of course, he wants to
make the case that spending all that time with the Oakland pols
eroded his brainpower, which would be a matter not only for a jury
but for a neurologist.
</P>
<P>
   And the number $800 million is interesting as well, since there
seems no way for Oakland to come up with that kind of scratch save
selling off Piedmont for the parts _ or, say, nullifying the lease
the city just won the right to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   The trial for that little argument is tentatively scheduled for
April 24, although Davis might want to challenge Gray's ruling,
call other witnesses or see how Policy is coming with that turning
blue business.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, your hope of making the sniveling stop is doomed.
Davis has just lost a round in a fight that has already gone longer
than Jack Johnson's last bout, and he takes losing in court about
as well as losing to Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   At least with Shanahan, though, Davis is up against an equal, at
least on the football plane. Here, he is trying to outwit people by
claiming they outwitted him, a legal triple Salchow that would put
Michelle Kwan into a full body cramp only gallons of hot water and
a crowbar could cure.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, though, has tackled bigger and more fearsome game, and
among the things he doesn't take is no for an answer. He has
nothing but time, and plenty of geese to get in his sights.

DRIVERS AND RIDERS SEE NO RELIEF FOR THE GREAT TAXI DROUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is as inexorable as the tides, as reliable as the
setting sun. And it happens every weekday afternoon around 5, just
as office buildings are beginning to empty out, just as hundreds of
hands are being raised into the air on hundreds of crowded
Manhattan street corners: the Great Taxi Drought begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, guy!'' yelled Don Ciliotta, waving, leaning into traffic,
trying to catch the eyes of a cabbie tearing down Ninth Avenue.
``Guy! Hey guy!''
</P>
<P>
   The driver waved back, which was nice of him, considering that
more than a dozen taxis had simply roared past Ciliotta, a tile
importer from Long Island, suffering for more than 20 minutes in a
subfreezing wind with his brother and their wives.
</P>
<P>
   Atop each passing cab glared the familiar amber off-duty light,
as forlorn as a no-vacancy sign buzzing in the dead of night.
</P>
<P>
   The Ciliottas, far from alone, were caught in the gears of the
dreaded taxi shift change. It happens when daytime drivers end
their 12-hour work day and hit their off-duty lights to give
themselves time to gas up and return to their garages to hand the
cab to the night drivers, who are anxious to start their own
12-hour shifts to catch as much of the evening rush as possible.
</P>
<P>
   As New York phenomena go, the changeover approaches a kind of
natural law, and one that seems to have been handed down from God,
like alternate-side-of-the-street parking rules and 20 percent
tips.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it has been around so long and has become so ingrained
in most taxi drivers' lives that explaining it seems, to them, as
unnecessary as explaining why their cars have tires. ``It's been
around, like, forever, for eons,'' said Mike Higgins, a longtime
cabbie who publishes the trade newspaper Taxi Talk. ``It's just a
traditional thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the cab-hailing public, it is a natural law that makes
about as much sense as the one that compels salmon to swim
upstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't follow any kind of supply and demand laws,'' said
Nathana Josephs, a public relations consultant who practically
lives in taxis and has, in desperation, talked police officers and
once even firefighters into giving her rides when she could not
find a cab during a shift change.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 53rd and Fifth Avenue to 57th and Fifth, you could die
before you get a cab at 5 o'clock,'' said Josephs. ``Or you could
get killed because of the competition to get the ones out there
that are on duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Taxi industry historians say that the weekday late-afternoon
shift change _ or at least the version that has become so
noticeable and roundly reviled _ started happening in the early
1980s, when the large taxi fleets began leasing cabs to drivers
instead of hiring the drivers as employees and paying them on
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The change, the result of a taxi industry policy adopted in
1979, made drivers into independent contractors who generally
worked longer hours _ 12-hour shifts instead of 9-hour shifts, to
make more money _ but who had more control over when they worked.
</P>
<P>
   In order to keep the cabs occupied with drivers, fleets and
other companies that leased taxis needed to divide the two 12-hour
shifts so that there would always be a roughly equal number of
drivers to fill day and night shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that if the day drivers started their shifts
when they really wanted to _ at around 7 a.m. or even 8, when the
streets begin to fill with people _ they would hand off to the
night drivers too late for those drivers to reap the busiest time
of their shift, when people left work. This would mean fewer
drivers willing to take on night shifts.
</P>
<P>
   So widespread shift changing around 4:30 or 5 o'clock began to
evolve, giving both groups of drivers the benefit of a rush hour.
And to make sure that the system was fair to night drivers, fleets
also began to assess late fees from day drivers who stayed out too
long and cut into night drivers' business.
</P>
<P>
   But, in truth, night drivers are always complaining that day
drivers should start earlier and hand off earlier because so many
of their precious evening fares are simply evaporating, into the
subways or into private car services, while the handoff takes
place.
</P>
<P>
   Day drivers, who hate starting as early as they do, are not
budging.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sherman, president of the Midtown Operating Corp., one of
the city's largest fleets, with about 200 cars, recalled a heroic
effort a few years back to move the shifts so that more of his
drivers would change over earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it made sense and we'd give it a try,'' he said. The
result? ``We completely lost our whole day line.'' He said that
about 70 percent of his drivers now change at 4:30 p.m. and others
work out changes among themselves that are earlier or later.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much he can do, he added, because the healthy
economy has prompted many taxi drivers to leave for more lucrative
work at private livery companies and has increased competition
among taxi fleets for drivers. So the drivers who lease his cabs,
Sherman said, pretty much ``do what they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really no different from Hertz or Avis,'' he said. ``I
can't tell you when to come in and rent a car from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman's drivers insist that, sure, they feel for the stranded
pedestrian with a late afternoon meeting or a plane to catch or a
child waiting at day care. But there is really not much they can
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's rough out there, and of course everybody wants
to go home, but I want to go home, too,'' said Anthony Tilelli, 58,
who stood in Sherman's Long Island City garage last week after his
day shift, while restless night drivers played ``Ms. Pac-Man'' in
the waiting room behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Tilelli, a 20-year taxi veteran, said that when he is off duty
and angry pedestrians begin knocking on his window at a stop light,
threatening to report him to the Taxi and Limousine Commission for
refusing service, he generally rolls down his window and spells his
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them to make sure and get it right,'' he said. ``I
don't care.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the commission has no exact figures to show exactly how
many cabs are changing shifts around 5 p.m., the indications are
that more are doing so than several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is because the number of taxis being driven by individual
owner-drivers _ those who work for themselves and tend to drive
from the morning rush through the evening rush, filling in the gap
_ is dropping, said Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant who
studies the taxi industry. From 1994 to 1998, the proportion of all
taxis driven by owner-drivers fell from about 28 percent to 18
percent, and the percentage is believed to be lower now.
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with the fact that more discretionary income
means more people competing for the fraction of the 12,187 cabs
remaining on duty, means one thing: some very mean streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't really a lot we can do about it,'' said Diane
McGrath-McKechnie, the chairwoman of the Taxi and Limousine
Commission. ``Except make it very hurtful for the drivers, and
we're not going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ugliest manifestation of the increase, said Higgins,
the Taxi Talk publisher, is the rising occurrence of what he calls
``the big double cross,'' when an off-duty driver, motivated by
both commercial and humanitarian impulses, decides to pick up a
passenger who swears his destination is in the direction of the
driver's garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `Yeah, I'm going to 49th Street. This works out
great!' And then they get in and say, `OK buddy, take me to
Brooklyn Heights,' and what are you going to do because they're
already in the cab?''
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, Higgins says, he doesn't take the risk
anymore. He does exactly what all those cab drivers who whooshed
past the poor Ciliottas on Ninth Avenue did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if it's Jesus Christ or a little old lady,'' he
said. ``I've got to get to the garage on time.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Ciliottas, who had a dinner reservation in
the West Village? When a reporter left them, they were still
waiting, and beginning to shiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going to do?'' Ciliotta said. ``We're not going to
 &UR; walk &LR;  40 blocks.''

CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE CRITICIZE CHINA'S THREAT ON TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHINA-TAIWAN) 
(nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration and Congress on Tuesday
sharply criticized a threat by China to forcibly reunify Taiwan
with the mainland if Beijing determines that negotiations between
the two are dragging on too long.
</P>
<P>
   Senior lawmakers said the official Chinese statement released on
Monday could increase the chances that Congress would approve
legislation expanding ties between the U.S. military and Taiwan,
despite President Clinton's threatened veto of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House overwhelmingly passed the measure, called the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act, earlier this month, but the Senate has up
to now viewed the measure more skeptically. China's report could
also imperil the administration's effort in Congress, especially in
the House, to win permanent trading status for China.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who want to kill this trade deal with China,
and China is playing right into their hands,'' said Sen. Gordon
Smith, R-Ore., who supports normal trading relations with China.
``This is tugging our loyalties to trade and to Taiwan in opposite
directions.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Tuesday urged China and Taiwan to resolve
their differences over unification without resorting to force, and
issued a veiled warning to Beijing to temper its bellicose
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have repeated, in I think both actions and words, that we
view any threat to Taiwan with grave concern,'' said the White
House spokesman, Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   The United States officially supports the concept of ``one
China,'' but under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act is also committed
to providing Taiwan with means to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services Committee,
said he had summoned top Pentagon experts to testify about China in
a closed session on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said it was ``a slap in face'' for China to issue its
provocative 11,000-word report just after a high-level American
delegation, led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, had
left China. The delegation, Warner said, had been ``trying to calm
the waters.''
</P>
<P>
   But some other leading Republicans cautioned against reading too
much into the report. ``It's bad judgment to put out that statement
at this time,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi. ``But we'll factor that in to all our thinking. It's
not determinative.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other administration officials contrasted China's
statements with its even more menacing actions in 1996, when it
fired missiles off Taiwanese waters in the run-up to the island's
first direct presidential elections. The United States responded by
sending two aircraft carrier battle groups near the Taiwan Straits
to show support for Taipei.
</P>

   ``One should be careful not to exaggerate the significance of
this,'' a State Department spokesman, James Rubin, told reporters.
``We've had much worse periods on this question in the past. This
is a new formulation. We find the formulation troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Beijing's words do not alter the administration's
continuing review of Taiwan's request for sophisticated weaponry.
``The decision about arms sales is a complicated calculation, and
isn't necessarily affected by any one statement on paper,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But across Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats urged the
administration to send a tougher message to Beijing, and assailed
China's statements as unduly provocative.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's white paper communications are unacceptable,'' said
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., on the Foreign Relations Committee.
``There's no other way to put it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ To Quebec nationalists, the proposal seemed
suspicious from the start: to rename one of the 15 highway bridges
leading into this city after an Italian.
</P>
<P>
   But after two years of petitions from representatives of some of
Montreal's 200,000 people of Italian background, Quebec's official
place names commission voted two months ago to take a walk on the
ethnic wild side. They renamed a 32-year-old suspension bridge
after Pietro Rizzuto, a Sicilian who arrived here penniless in
1955, made a fortune in road construction, and died three years
ago, a federal senator in his adopted land.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the commissioners reasoned, of the city's other
bridges, 12 carry French names, one carries the name of a pope,
and, in deference to Montreal's dwindling English-speaking
minority, one is called Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Sciortino, a lawyer here, promoted the name change as a
way to bridge the gap, symbolically and literally, between
Montreal, an increasingly ethnically diverse city, and Laval, a
northern suburb with a strongly separatist largely homogeneous
French Canadian population. In 1968, Rizzuto's construction company
built and paved the access lanes to the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The commission apparently did not expect much of a reaction to
removing the bridge's old name, Papineau-Leblanc. In the ethnic
coding here, these family names are ``pure laine,'' literally
``pure wool,'' or old stock Quebecois families that go back before
the time of the British conquest of 1759.
</P>
<P>
   The Leblancs were pioneers, settling Laval in 1666. The
Papineaus were political nationalists of the first hour, arguing
for French language rights as early as 1793. But, with ``Je me
souviens,'' or ``I remember,'' on their license plates, modern
Quebecers are driving into the 21st century, still smarting over
events in the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really mad,'' said Gilles Leblanc, a Laval
businessman who is descended from the first settlers. After
delivering a protest petition with 4,000 signatures to the
commission in January, he warned them: ``Don't step on the
ancestors. You don't touch that.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls of complaint were so numerous that the Laval
City Council, which had unanimously supported the name change,
reversed itself and voted unanimously against it. Laval's four
representatives to the provincial assembly, all members of the
separatist Parti Quebecois, denounced the name change.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the commission, one representative, David Clichi,
noted that the six-lane highway bridge carried the names of
``illustrious families'' and suggested something ``more
appropriate'' for the Sicilian.
</P>
<P>
   Getting down to specifics, the Societe Saint-Jean-Baptiste de
Montreal, a nationalist group here, proposed that an appropriate
memorial for Rizzuto, a federalist, would be a subway stop in
Saint-Michel, an Italian part of town.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Montreal's ethnic and linguistic minorities,
supporting the name change, asked for tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``History evolves,'' argued Anna Mancuso, Quebec president of
the National Congress of Italian Canadians, a national group based
here. ``Senator Rizzuto also influenced Quebec society.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Robinson, a columnist for The Gazette, an English
language newspaper that carries little weight with separatists,
noted that, in Quebec, Papineau is used 106 times to name streets,
parks, boulevards and creeks and that Leblanc is similarly used 179
times. Rizzuto is nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Don Macpherson, another Gazette columnist, wrote that the
commission approves about 100 name changes a year, almost all in
``the `right' direction, in favor of the old-stock
French-Canadians'' whose interests the Party Quebecois ``has
consistently favored.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely controlled by nationalists, the place name commission
has ignored English complaints and purged dozens of historic
English place names from English-speaking areas. It changed the
name of Montreal's central boulevard from Dorchester, the name of
an early British governor, to Rene Levesque, the name of the man
who founded the Parti Quebecois in 1968. Two years ago, the
commission overruled Cree Indian objections and gave Quebecois
names to 101 deserted islands that the Cree said already had Indian
names.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the editorial page of Le Devoir, a separatist newspaper,
Michel Venne argued that nationalism should no longer be synonymous
with ethnicity, asking if ``a symbol of recognition for New
Quebecers is going to be become a symbol of our being closed to
others?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We often discuss the integration of immigrants and the
pluralistic nature of Quebec society theoretically,'' said Venne,
who recently organized a well-attended round table here to spin an
inclusive, multi-cultural vision of an independent Quebec.
Referring to the name change, he added: ``We have before our very
eyes a concrete case of an attempt to include and to recognize.''
</P>
<P>
   But such pleas fell on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Lysiane Gagnon, a columnist for La Presse, a newspaper that
favors Quebec staying within Canada, wrote that ``it is normal and
legitimate to cherish the memory of a history which goes back close
to 400 years,'' and urged readers to ignore ``those who profit from
this false debate to start circulating again these tiresome
insinuations about the congenital xenophobia of the `French
Canadians.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By the end of January, the controversy had become so bitter that
the Rizzuto family asked the commission to cancel the name change.
The commission complied immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But if Quebecois nativists have trouble digesting European
ethnic groups that have been here for over 30 years, such as
Italians, Greeks and Portuguese, they are in for a real demographic
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In central Montreal, home to 1 million people, almost one third
of children under 15 are what Canadian census takers officially
classify as ``visible minorities'' _ Arabs, Asians, Blacks and
Latin Americans. This portion will rise to one half of school age
children in about a decade, predicts Jack Jedwab, executive
director of the Association for Canadian Studies.
</P>
<P>
   In a turnaround, the majority of these children of immigrants
now attend French language schools instead of English-language
schools. But a CROP poll taken last fall of 2,000 Canadian adults
found more Quebecois respondents _ 51 percent _ favored more limits
on immigration than other Canadians _ 44 percent. In Montreal,
members of minority groups increasingly complain about
discrimination over skin color or their accent when they speak
French.
</P>
<P>
   Nadia Zouaoui, an Algerian immigrant who is a free-lance
reporter, complained recently that she was turned down for a job at
a Montreal television station because her accent ``was not Quebec
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of racism that's hard to denounce,'' Zouaoui
said last month at the start here of a privately funded campaign
called United Against Racism. ``In France, there is racism, but
people say it out loud. Here, people don't talk about it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the bridge debate highlighted unspoken divisions, some
analysts suspect that, in the Machiavellian world of Quebec
politics, the controversy also represented payback time.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Sciortino was the token ``ethnic'' on the
executive board of the Parti Quebecois. In November, 1995, Jacques
Parizeau, Quebec's premier, blamed his razor thin loss in a
referendum on whether Quebec should separate from Canada on ``the
ethnic vote,'' and vowed, ``We will have our revenge.'' After a
general outcry, alarmed party leaders accepted Parizeau's
resignation and propelled Sciortino before television cameras to
say, in lightly accented French, that ethnic minorities were
welcome in the separatist movement.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sciortino tried to win his party's nomination for a
legislative Assembly seat, he lost out to a ``pure laine''
Quebecer, Robert Perrault. During the nomination debate, one
delegate suggested that Sciortino might feel more comfortable
``among his own people, in Little Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after trying to run the Parti Quebecois operation for
Montreal Island, the city core, Sciortino tired of constant
challenges to his leadership. He resigned from the party, charging
in an essay in La Presse, that the separatists were not welcoming
to ``New Quebecers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the emotions bared over the bridge dispute, Jim Duff,
an analyst for The West Island Suburban, an English weekly, wrote
recently, ``If I was a conspiracy buff, I'd say Giuseppe set out to
deal a masterful slap to the faces'' of his former party
colleagues.''

<P>
   Unlike most of the Ivy League, Brown University has not added a
business school to its campus, despite the obvious perk: wealthy
alumni. No matter. Brown's students and faculty got a lesson from
the business world this month. The school's barely broken-in
president, E. Gordon Gee, stunned the community when he announced
that after just two years in office, he had accepted an offer to
run Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, he was telling The Chronicle of Higher
Education that it takes two years for schools to warm to him, but
that he had the vision and passion to carry the institution
forward. There was another interview earlier about how this was the
summit of his career, his last college presidency. He had made an
8-to-10-year commitment.
</P>
<P>
   So clearly not just Brown, but all of academia, was at a loss.
Gee explained. But the more he explained, the more the world seemed
to spin.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he said, there was always a question of fit. He never
felt quite at home in Providence. He liked his residences, a
historic home in town and an $850,000 country house that he would
sorely miss in the coming months, he said. It was the job that was
vexing. ``There were days I'd wake up and not feel as committed or
as passionate as I should,'' he told the student paper. Vanderbilt
was a bigger canvas than Brown, more like what he had grown used to
in the years he ran West Virginia University, then the University
of Colorado and finally Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   The money was also about two to three times the $300,000 a year
he made at Brown. Not that he cared, but Brown refused to match it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was his wife, Constance. She had been given a
teaching position at Brown, but it was not a tenured position, like
the one Vanderbilt had offered. She looked happy when her husband
first ascended at Brown and introduced her as one of the ``biggest
assets we had at Ohio State'' and ``an equal partner'' at Brown.
Visitors to Brown's Web site are still greeted with a color photo
of the beaming couple, holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   Gee also took pains to explain how much he struggled over his
dilemma. When he first told a member of Brown's board that
Vanderbilt had approached, he was advised that the conversations
were inappropriate. But Vanderbilt kept coming. Before long, Gee
(the ``g'' is hard) was furtively visiting the Nashville campus,
and consulting an ethicist to help him weigh his choices. It must
have worked. By the time the parting was official, he was saying it
took ``courage'' to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter? Martha Ingram, the businesswoman who helped
recruit Gee to Vanderbilt, says she does not see what all the fuss
is about. ``People take people from my company all the time,'' said
Ingram, who runs a powerful wholesale book business.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it isn't any different. Sports, entertainment and business
personalities job-hop all the time. Character seems not to be what
people expect from their leaders anymore. Maybe prosperity has
changed the rules for universities too. Gordon Gekko, Hollywood's
notion of the consummate corporate raider, certainly would applaud
Gordon Gee.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of imprint will it leave on those who graduate from
Brown this year, with an interim president as master of ceremonies?
What does it say to them about honoring one's obligations, choosing
meaning over money, being satisfied when life is sweet enough?
</P>
<P>
   Gee delivered ably on his promise to throw himself into the
business of the institution, chiefly fund-raising and recruiting.
He was the very definition of a professional president. With no
previous ties to Brown, he amassed college trophies for his office
the way investment bankers collect tombstones from deals they've
closed.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say people ought to feel trapped in ill-fitting
jobs. A long time ago, I landed what seemed like a dream job out of
college in advertising. But a year into it, I started fretting. It
was not for me. So I tiptoed into my boss' imposing corner office
to let him know I would be taking a job as a copy girl at The New
York Times, a job that paid about $4,000 less than the $17,000 I
was making on Madison Avenue. He led me to believe I was letting
him down. Loyalty and all. Then, a few weeks later, he quit for a
better job in advertising. I made a note to myself that loyalty is
a concept business likes to toss around, but seems to vanish the
moment the proverbial better offer comes along.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad college presidents don't come with money-back guarantees
or employment contracts. Then Brown could do one thing companies
and consumers do all the time when feeling burned: claim a refund
or sue.

   REAL-EVENTS-THEATER (Undated) _ Theater, a medium reliant on
flights of imagination, is not exactly a place where precise
depictions of real events are common. But this season, a handful of
plays on New York stages and beyond are demonstrating a strong
adherence to the facts, with documentary-style texts that have been
drawn verbatim from interviews and transcripts. By Jesse Mckinley. &QL;

   KURT-WEILL-MUSIC (Undated) _ Kurt Weill rarely wrote for the
notorious Weimar-era cabarets of Berlin. Still, the popular
misimpression that identifies him with the Berlin haunts of
Isherwood and Sally Bowles is understandable. Weill's music from
this period simply sounds so deliciously dangerous. Its harsh
beauty and dissonant lyricism embody everything we believe Berlin
cabaret to have been: sardonic, sophisticated, gorgeously profane.
It is therefore tempting in this, Weill's centennial year (his
100th Birthday is Thursday), to look to his musical world for
instruction: How can our own less-than-scintillating cabaret scene
rediscover the passion, the artfulness and the engagement of
Weill's time? By Barry Singer. &QL;

   MUSIC-WORDS (Undated) _ Words have been much on music's mind
lately, and the two have been as much opponents as colleagues.
Watching important literary properties (``The Great Gatsby,'' ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'') being wrestled to the ground musically
has become a sporting event. For better or worse, words seem to be
coming out on top. New operas have to have selling points, and
music is not first among them. By Bernard Holland. &QL;

   AUDRA-MCDONALD-MUSIC (Undated) _ For better or for worse, Audra
McDonald, the extraordinary mezzo-soprano whose performances in
``Master Class,'' ``Carousel,'' ``Ragtime'' and ``Marie Christine''
have drawn the kind of acclaim on which legends are built, is
nothing if not a singer of impeccable taste. Listening to her
exquisitely phrased, finely shaded performances of a program of
mostly show tunes on her second solo album, ``How Glory Goes,'' you
come away captivated by as lofty a vision of nonclassical American
theater music as any singer has dared put forth. By Stephen

   RUBELLS-ART (Miami) _ At the opening of a new exhibition at the
Rubell Family Collection's gallery. A mile and a half northwest of
downtown, the 40,000-square-foot warehouse once served as a storage
facility for contraband seized by the Drug Enforcement
Administration. But on this night, when many new acquisitions by
the New York collectors Donald and Mera Rubell were on display for
the first time, most of the comments centered on how the Miami art
scene was coming of age. Running through June, the exhibition,
curated by Bill Begert, 29, demonstrated how thoroughly the Rubells
have scoured the contemporary art market. Only 105 pieces from a
collection of more than 1,100 works were on display. By David Hay. &QL;

   JAPANESE-EDO-PAINTINGS (Indianapolis, Ind.) _ Over 20 years,
Alan Strassman, a Boston investment manager, collected 95 Japanese
paintings from the Edo period (1615-1848). His collection became
one of the largest and finest of its kind in private hands. From
the start, when he bought his first scroll painting _ which showed
a tiger gazing at the moon (prompting him later to call his Edo
works the Tiger Collection) _ Strassman was dazzled by, as he put
it, the ``unique flat perspective'' in Japanese art. Their
fragility and his space limitations made it impossible to view all
of his collection at one time. But Strassman will finally be able
to see most of these Edo paintings when they go on view in ``300
Years of Japanese Painting: New Treasures for Indianapolis,'' an
exhibition that opens at the Indianapolis Museum of Art on May 20
and remains until Aug. 6. By Rita Reif. &QL;

   WILD-MAN-ART (Chestnut Hill, Mass.) _ The piece is called ``The
Wild Man,'' and it comes from a late-14th-century choir stall in
Cologne, Germany. Human in form but animal in its sculptured curly
hide, the 11}-inch oak figure is a denizen of the medieval
imagination. For Germans in the Middle Ages, this figure, seen in
its ecclesiastical setting, evoked the fond myth of the German
people descending from a land of rural tribesmen in prelapsarian
synthesis with nature. Nancy Netzer, director of the McMullen
Musuem of Art at Boston College. Netzer is one of five Boston
College professors who organized the show ``Fragmented Devotion:

   EISEMAN-ARCH (New York) _ Peter Eisenman's design for the Staten

project partly straddles the St. George terminal of the Staten

   UNITED NATIONS _ An international narcotics control agency that
is better known for raising alarms about the narcotics trade and
drug abuse has turned its attention this year to a severe shortage
of morphine and other pain killers in poor countries, where many
are left to die in agony from cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The International Narcotics Control Board, a U.N. agency based
in Vienna, said in a report to be published Wednesday that it has
been tracking the rising but uneven use of morphine and other
natural or synthetic drugs with similar structures and effects for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   The board and the World Health Organization encourage the use of
morphine, which is derived from opium, or similar drugs to relieve
cancer-related pain. The board said there is no evidence that these
drugs are widely diverted for illicit use, and therefore no reason
to caution against increased production.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the 26-member board made up of experts and
diplomats found great disparities in access to strong pain killers
among countries and also within them _ usually for economic
reasons, but not always. Cultural or social attitudes and medical
philosophies also play a part. Treating pain has gained more
attention in the United States and Europe in recent years, but for
other countries, morphine may still be an unaffordable luxury,
experts said. ``The 10 largest consumer countries accounted for as
much as 80 percent of analgesic morphine consumption,'' the report
found. In those countries, all richer nations, the annual average
consumption of such drugs was 31 grams for each 1,000 people. At
the other end of the scale, in 120 mostly poor countries, there was
little or no consumption of these painkillers, called opiods.
Eighty other countries fell somewhere between these extremes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a large proportion of the countries and territories of the
world,'' the report said, ``insignificant amounts of these
medicines are available for medical purposes and it is generally
agreed that the treatment of chronic or acute pain caused by cancer
is still inadequate. Only about 10 to 30 percent of patients
suffering from severe cancer-related pain may be receiving adequate
treatment, even in many technologically advanced countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But the situation is often starkest in the poorest countries,
the report found. ``In developing countries, the relief of pain and
suffering is given much lower priority than other, more urgent,
health and social problems,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization, which is represented on the
narcotics board, predicts that by 2015, two-thirds of an estimated
15 million new cancer cases each year will be in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Like calls made by others for cheaper and more readily available
drugs for HIV-AIDS in the Third World, the narcotics board report
recommends making more painkillers accessible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The use of morphine for medical purposes was relatively low and
stable until 1984, the report said. In the last 15 years, it has
risen tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   The country with the highest consumption of morphine for medical
use in 1998 was Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the narcotics control board also surveyed the use
of legal mind-altering drugs and found that Europe far outstripped
America and all other regions in the medical use of hypnotics and
sedatives. Americans, on the other hand, continued to lead the
world in the use of amphetamines, which act as stimulants, and, in
fact, increased their intake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few decades, accepted therapeutic uses of
amphetamines have become rare and as a result almost all countries
in the world report declining medical use of such substances,'' the
report found. ``Not so the United States.'' U.S. consumption of
amphetamines for medical use is ten times higher than in any
European country, the narcotics board said.
</P>
<P>
   The board said the issue of possible oversupply and
overmedication with these drugs will be the focus of next year's
annual report.

   ETERNAL-ROAD-MUSICAL (New York) _ After 63 years of dormancy if
not oblivion, ``The Eternal Road,'' Kurt Weill's vast, emotionally
gripping musical pageant of Jewish history, is returning to the
city of its premiere, but in a form that may perplex and even
infuriate its audience. Beginning Monday evening, the Brooklyn
Academy of Music will present the complete four-act version of the
work, known in German as ``Der Weg der Verheissung'' (``The Road of
Promise''), in a production that originated last year in Chemnitz,
Germany. Under the musical direction of John Mauceri, it will be
sung and acted in German (with supertitles). The original text,
written in 1934 by the Austrian novelist Franz Werfel, has been
rewritten in a way that will either assuage or outrage
post-Holocaust sensibilities by reflecting horrors that neither
Werfel, nor Weill, nor Max Reinhardt, the original director, could
have foreseen. By David Schiff. &QL;

   JEWS-IN-PALESTINE-FILM (Undated) _ ``The Life of the Jews in
Palestine'' _ which was produced in 1913 by the Odessa-based
Mizrakh Company and presumed to be lost for some 80 years _ has
resurfaced in New York. Showing on March 6 and 7, in an excellent
new print with English intertitles at the Museum of Modern Art,
Noah Sokolovsky's 78-minute silent film is quite likely the rarest
of the rarities featured in the museum's 10-program tribute to

throwaway, but graceful, style and no-budget economy, ``Stranger''
helped pioneer the American independent film movement. By Laura

<P>
   MORRISSEY-FILMS (New York) _ Paul Morrissey disdains rock music,
abhors recreational drugs and thinks even less of liberal politics.
Such sentiments may seem surprising coming from a director whose
films luxuriate in the libertine lives of heroin users,
masturbating transvestites and polymorphous-perverse male
prostitutes. Yet Morrissey _ who from 1966 to 1972 directed more
than half a dozen movies produced by Andy Warhol, discovered the
avant-garde rock band the Velvet Underground and once saw a court
label his work ``obscene, vulgar and profane'' _ believes he's
misunderstood, to say nothing of misrepresented. ``Every movie I've
ever made says the same thing,'' said Morrissey, 61, recently at
Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel. Presumably, that includes ``Trash,''
which will be shown at the New York Underground Film Festival at
Anthology Film Archives on Friday and open in New York and Los
Angeles on March 17 to mark its 30th anniversary. By David Bahr. &QL;

   BROADWAY-MUSICALS-FORM (Undated) _ At the beginning of a new
century, the only formulas regularly exploited by Broadway
producers, an unimaginative lot by and large, involve rote
recycling. The anthology format, in which old songs and dance steps
are combined into synthetic theme packages (``Smokey Joe's Cafe,''
``Fosse,'' ``Swing''), has become popular, as have, pathetically,
freeze-dried stage adaptations of movie musicals (``Footloose,''
``Saturday Night Fever''). And there are always, as there should
be, revivals of musical classics. But signs of fresher, more vital
life are stirring in shows that have, for the most part, originated
Off Broadway. They are different enough from one another to
preclude any ideas of sweeping trends with coattails to cling to.
They each, however, meet the criterion demanded of any successful
musical, and most successful works of art in general: the ability
to seduce us into an alternative reality that is utterly consistent
on its own terms. By Ben Brantley. WITH PHOTO. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE-ARREST-THEATER (Undated) _ Anna Deavers Smith tried not to
get up there onstage and do it herself. For the first time since
she became famous for recreating _ to the last gesture and vocal
tic _ dozens of real-life individuals, based on her actual
conversations with them, she decided not to perform her own work.
Instead, she cast actors in ``House Arrest,'' her latest foray into
the nation's psyche, this time focusing on the role of the American
presidency, from Thomas Jefferson to Bill Clinton. By Robin
Pogrebin. WITH PHOTO. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LARAMIE-PROJECT-THEATER (Denver) _ Could the town of Laramie,
Wyo., ever return to its docile anonymity, or would it forever
carry a murderous stigma as a place of intolerance, where a gay
man, Matthew Shepard, was killed for being gay? Who could really
know? Most of the cameras left. But a curious group of
interrogators stayed behind, and out of what they learned over a
year of visits, during which they tape-recorded interviews with 200
Laramie residents, Moises Kaufman has crafted his latest play. The
artistic director of the Tectonic Theater Project in New York,
Kaufman has created ``The Laramie Project,'' an attempt to unpeel
the layers of a town to understand how ordinary people might be
affected by extraordinary events. The play was scheduled to open
Saturday night at the Ricketson Theater in Denver and run through
April 1. By Michael Janofsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRUE-WEST-THEATER (New York) _ In 1980, before ``True West,''
his play about the contorted reunion of two estranged brothers,
opened at the Magic Theater in San Francisco, Sam Shepard was asked
by a reporter why he wrote it. ``I wanted to write a play about
double nature, one that wouldn't be symbolic or metaphorical or any
of that stuff,'' Shepard replied in an interview in The New York
Times Magazine. Twenty years later, there is something
prescient-sounding in that; the third of three family-nightmare
plays Shepard wrote in the 1970s (``Curse of the Starving Class''
and ``Buried Child'' are the others), ``True West'' has lingered, a
favorite of student productions and small theater companies, as a
work of impact and influence. As a new revival gets set to open on
March 9 at Circle in the Square. By Bruce Weber. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   MUSIC-MAN (Mason City, Iowa) _ Driving along the snow-encrusted
streets of Mason City recently, Carl R. Miller, executive director
of the preservation-minded Mason City Foundation, could not have
been prouder of the inspirational role this old northern Iowa
industrial town played in the history of the American musical
``Music Man.'' As the model for the place immortalized in Meredith
Willson's musical, it is, in a sense, a landmark of the
imagination, a locality redrawn in the mind of one of its most
illustrious natives and reinvented on a stage as an emblem of
prairie innocence and brass-band sentimentality. The show, which
tells the story of a con man who sells the citizenry on the dream
of a boys' band he has no intention of leading, was the smash hit
of the 1957-58 season. ``The Music Man'' is back, in a major new
production directed and choreographed by one of the theater's
reigning talents, Susan Stroman. The musical opens at the Neil
Simon Theater on April 27. By Peter Marks.

   REAL-EVENTS-THEATER (Undated) _ Theater, a medium reliant on
flights of imagination, is not exactly a place where precise
depictions of real events are common. But this season, a handful of
plays on New York stages and beyond are demonstrating a strong
adherence to the facts, with documentary-style texts that have been
drawn verbatim from interviews and transcripts. By Jesse Mckinley. &QL;

   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KURT-WEILL-MUSIC (Undated) _ Kurt Weill rarely wrote for the
notorious Weimar-era cabarets of Berlin. Still, the popular
misimpression that identifies him with the Berlin haunts of
Isherwood and Sally Bowles is understandable. Weill's music from
this period simply sounds so deliciously dangerous. Its harsh
beauty and dissonant lyricism embody everything we believe Berlin
cabaret to have been: sardonic, sophisticated, gorgeously profane.
It is therefore tempting in this, Weill's centennial year (his
100th Birthday is Thursday), to look to his musical world for
instruction: How can our own less-than-scintillating cabaret scene
rediscover the passion, the artfulness and the engagement of
Weill's time? By Barry Singer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-WORDS (Undated) _ Words have been much on music's mind
lately, and the two have been as much opponents as colleagues.
Watching important literary properties (``The Great Gatsby,'' ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'') being wrestled to the ground musically
has become a sporting event. For better or worse, words seem to be
coming out on top. New operas have to have selling points, and
music is not first among them. By Bernard Holland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUDRA-MCDONALD-MUSIC (Undated) _ For better or for worse, Audra
McDonald, the extraordinary mezzo-soprano whose performances in
``Master Class,'' ``Carousel,'' ``Ragtime'' and ``Marie Christine''
have drawn the kind of acclaim on which legends are built, is
nothing if not a singer of impeccable taste. Listening to her
exquisitely phrased, finely shaded performances of a program of
mostly show tunes on her second solo album, ``How Glory Goes,'' you
come away captivated by as lofty a vision of nonclassical American
theater music as any singer has dared put forth. By Stephen
Holden. &QL;

the start, when he bought his first scroll painting _ which showed

MARKET PLACE: SEC BRINGS CASES AGAINST THREE INVESTMENT FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The nation's top securities regulator brought civil
cases against two stock day-trading firms Tuesday and turned a hat
trick by also accusing an unregistered hedge fund manager of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission found that all three
investment firms violated regulations designed to protect investors
in some of the financial markets' most speculative arenas.
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech Direct Inc., one of the leading providers of rapid-fire
daytrading services, was accused of violating regulations governing
the practice of lending money to customers to buy stocks. A second,
smaller daytrading firm, Investment Street Co., was accused of
similar loan violations, indicating that the practices of such
firms remain under close scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In the third case, the SEC contended that David M. Mobley Sr.,
manager of Maricopa Investment Fund Ltd., and three related hedge
funds, defrauded investors of at least $59 million. While Mobley,
43, of Naples, Fla., claimed to be producing returns of 51 percent
a year he diverted investor funds to buy a $98,000 Porsche, a
$864,000 home in Naples and a $2 million vacation home in Vail,
Colo., the regulators said. The money he did invest for his clients
since 1993 went into his own ill-fated business ventures, including
a cigar lounge, a country club development and a stadium on a golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   In the day-trading actions, All-Tech Direct, of Montvale, N.J.,
its president and six of the firm's managers were charged with
making 103 loans exceeding $3.6 million to customers throughout
1998 in violation of federal rules. Regulators also contend that
All-Tech management failed to advise its customers of the loan
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Investment Street Co. of Miami and two of its principals
extended $250,000 in credit improperly to customers, the SEC
contended, and allowed people to conduct business as registered
stockbrokers even though they were not registered.
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech is fighting the regulatory action. Investment Street
and its principals settled the SEC matter without admitting or
denying guilt. The firm and the individuals paid $36,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say both firms made the loans to keep their customers
trading stocks even when the value of their accounts fell below
required levels. This allowed both All-Tech and Investment Street
to continue generating commissions as their customers traded on
what is called margin. All-Tech generally charges $25 a trade,
although active traders receive discounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margin magnifies both the risks and costs of daytrading,''
said Richard H. Walker, director of enforcement at the SEC. ``We
will not allow daytrading firms to overextend margin and keep
customers afloat so the firms may continue to generate
commissions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's regulatory actions are an outgrowth of a broad,
18-month investigation by the SEC into the practices at daytrading
firms. Many of the firms have seemed to operate by their own rules,
and regulators are working to rein them in.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on lending coincides with increased concern among
regulators that investors are borrowing too heavily to buy stocks
and may not understand the risks inherent in the practice. Last
month, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
asked the SEC to study a troubling spike in the amount of debt
accumulated by investors in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who borrow money to buy stocks must meet two separate
requirements, one set by the Federal Reserve, the other by the
brokerage firm where they do business. The Federal Reserve requires
that investors put up 50 percent of a stock's initial cost.
According to the SEC, both All-Tech and Investment Street lent
money to their customers to meet this initial requirement.
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech's founder took issue with the regulatory complaint.
``The SEC has spent many hours investigating everything they can
think of and came up with something that is not true,'' said Harvey
Houtkin, All-Tech's founder. ``They're trying to twist and turn
things to come up with something to justify their investigation. We
believe the charges are baseless, and we believe we will be
exonerated when the facts will come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Those named in the complaint were Mark Shefts, 42, All-Tech's
president; Harry Lefkowitz, 43, vice president of the firm's
operations; Lisa Esposito, 34, head of All-Tech's margin loan
department; Ralph Zulferino, 40, manager of the firm's Edison,
N.J., branch office; David Waldman, 58, an All-Tech employee; Adam
Leeds 31, a broker in All-Tech's San Diego office, and Barry
Parish, 46, manager of the San Diego branch.
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech Direct, with 22 offices where traders furiously buy and
sell stocks many times during the day, is one of the better-known
daytrading firms. The firm made headlines last summer when a
disgruntled investor opened fire in its Atlanta office, killing
five people. Houtkin, who considers himself the father of
electronic daytrading and a champion of the individual investor,
was not named in the SEC's complaint Tuesday. The SEC said that its
investigation into the firm's practices is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, which breathlessly pitched daytrading as an investment
strategy almost anyone could succeed at, has softened its message
somewhat. For example, though securities regulators estimate that
nine out of 10 daytraders lose money, All-Tech's Web site once
answered a question about losses this way: ``If you are disciplined
in following the techniques you will be taught, losses can and
should be kept to a minimum.'' Now the site says: ``Active
electronic stock trading is risky and not for everyone. Because of
the use of margin, losses may exceed the amount invested.''
</P>
<P>
   In the civil case against the hedge fund manager, the SEC and
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission contend that Mobley had
conducted an elaborate seven-year fraud in which he told investors
that he managed $450 million of clients' funds and made bets on
which direction the stock market would take using computer trading
models that he had developed.
</P>
<P>
   According to regulators, more than 170 investors, most of them
wealthy, gave Mobley $140 million to manage. He attracted clients
with a promotional brochure that shows monthly returns on a
hypothetical investment in his funds. The returns were ``plucked
out of thin air,'' according to the regulators' complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Although he returned approximately $48 million to some
investors, the bulk of the $59 million in losses came from
investments in Mobley's failed business ventures. He also paid
himself well _ a $1 million annual salary and a $2 million bonus
last month. Mobley also gave approximately $3.5 million of
investors' funds to charity, according to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, who by early evening Tuesday did not have a lawyer,
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mutual fund managers, hedge fund managers are not
required to register with regulators or to file financial
information because their wealthy investors are considered to be
sophisticated and capable of evaluating risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action demonstrates the importance of investors assuring
themselves that their investments are being handled by responsible
persons and being appropriately managed,'' said Phyllis J. Cela,
acting director of the enforcement division at the CFTC. ``People
obviously thought their money was in good hands and clearly had not
done enough checking to be sure of that.''

SUPREME COURT REJECTS CHALLENGE TO ALABAMA'S ELECTRIC CHAIR 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ala., Tenn., Fla., Pa., Ariz.) (With SCOTUS) 
(nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court justices returned from a
mid-winter recess on Tuesday and disposed of hundreds of cases.
Because the argument calendar for the current term is now full, the
cases granted Tuesday and for the next four months will be argued
after the new term begins next October.
</P>
<P>
   The court took the following action on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   Sports Rule Makers
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed to decide whether the statewide athletic
associations that in many states regulate interscholastic sports at
the high school level should be considered ``state actors,'' even
though they are nominally private organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The practical significance of the public-private distinction is
that if the organizations are deemed to be public, they will be
governed by the same constitutional constraints that apply to
government agencies; the Constitution places limits on government,
but not on private, behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The justices accepted an appeal by the Brentwood Academy, a
private school in Brentwood, Tenn., that ran afoul of the Tennessee
Secondary School Athletic Association's restrictions on recruiting.
The school sued the association on the ground that the rule against
coaches' communicating with prospective student athletes violated
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The school won in federal District Court in Nashville, but the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Cincinnati, overturned that
ruling on the ground that as a private organization, the athletic
association was not bound by the First Amendment. The same question
has come up in six other federal appellate circuits, with all the
other courts finding that the statewide athletic associations were
state actors.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association, founded in
1925, has 290 public and 55 private schools as its members. Nine
public high school officials constitute its rule-making legislative
council. For years, its role in governing interscholastic sports in
the state was officially designated by the state board of
education; its role became unofficial in 1995, as the state action
issue began to be litigated around the country.
</P>
<P>
   One issue the court may address in this case, Brentwood Academy
vs. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Assoc., No. 99-901, is the
extent to which the secondary school athletic associations differ
from the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The court ruled
in a 1988 case that the NCAA, as a national organization not
confined to any one state, was not a state actor, at least in the
context of a disciplinary action against a state university, in
that case, the University of Nevada at Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   A new challenge to the NCAA, concerning its academic
prerequisites for freshman eligibility, is likely to reach the
Supreme Court soon. The federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled
two months ago, in dismissing a case brought by four black
athletes, that because the NCAA was not a direct recipient of
federal money, it was not bound by the provision of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 that bars racial discrimination in schools and
colleges that receive federal money.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Electric Chair
</P>
<P>
   Without explanation, the court lifted the stay of execution it
had granted on Feb. 4 to an Alabama death row inmate, Robert L.
Tarver Jr., who challenged the state's use of the electric chair as
cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The court had granted the stay, hours before Tarver's scheduled
execution, in order to decide whether to hear his case on the
merits. Earlier this term, the court agreed to hear, and then
dismissed, a challenge to Florida's use of the electric chair after
the state passed a new law to make lethal injection the preferred
method of execution. Similar legislation is moving through the
Alabama Legislature but has not yet passed either house.
</P>
<P>
   Four justices _ John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer _ voted to hear the Alabama inmate's
case. Ordinary, four votes are all that are required for the court
to hear a case. But Tarver's case was procedurally unusual, seeking
a writ of habeas corpus directly from the Supreme Court rather than
as an appeal from a lower court. Although the Supreme Court has not
disclosed its internal rules for acting on habeas corpus petitions,
and did not do so Tuesday, the court evidently regards five votes
rather than four as necessary to grant such a petition. The case
was In re Tarver, No. 99-8044.

IN SLAP AT LAPD, OFFICERS' UNION SEEKS INDEPENDENT PROBE OF
BRUTALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an extraordinary step that reflected the
plummeting public confidence in the Los Angeles Police department
over a growing corruption scandal, the union representing police
officers undercut the department's chief Tuesday and demanded an
independent investigation of the growing evidence of police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   The union noted that, since its creation in 1925, it had never
advocated the creation of an outside body to investigate the
department. But it said such a step was needed now because the
scandal had so tainted the department, as reports emerge that
corrupt officers framed perhaps several hundred people, and in at
least two instances shot unarmed suspects and then planted guns on
them.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was also a political shot at the chief of
police, Bernard C. Parks, who has staunchly fought any outside
interference but is now clearly losing the confidence of his
uniformed officers, some of whom have said they fear the chief may
make some of the wrongdoers scapegoats and not thoroughly
investigate the department's senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   The police department has established an internal Board of
Inquiry, composed of top officers, that has been investigating the
scandal for several months separately from the criminal
investigation at the district attorney's office. The Board of
Inquiry is expected to deliver its report to the police commission,
a civilian oversight body, on March 1.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Parks did not comment on the announcement and Commander David
Kalish, the department spokesman, did not return calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents a great leap forward for the police union and
it's also the first step in reinforcing to the public that
restoring the credibility of the police department is our single
biggest priority,'' said Ted Hunt, the president of the Los Angeles
Police Protective League, which represents about 9,500 officers.
</P>
<P>
   The call for an investigation outside the board of inquiry's was
also considered Tuesday by the City Council. Joel Wachs, a city
councilman who is also running for mayor, proposed that the city
consider such a body to ensure that the police brutality was being
thoroughly investigated, particularly accusations of culpability by
the department's top officers.
</P>
<P>
   His motion was voted down, 8-6, but several other members of the
council said that over the past week a more militant mood had
developed, as confidence in the police chief tumbled and concern
grew over the extent of the brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could this go on so long and be so bad and nobody at the
top knew about it?'' asked Wachs in an interview. ``It just doesn't
pass the smell test to do something from within.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the scandal ``a moral and a financial crisis,'' and
said that what had sobered politicians and the public were the
reports that the civil suits by those unjustly imprisoned could
cost the city $200 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   The new mood marks a major shift, since politicians, especially
the mayor, had generally watched quietly since the first reports of
corruption emerged last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those whose views are evolving, particularly in the
last week or so,'' said Laura Chick, a member of the City Council
who voted for Wachs' motion. She said she now believes that
restoring public confidence in the tarnished police department
cannot be achieved by the police commission alone.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal began last September when a former officer, Rafael
Perez, had agreed to disclose evidence of the corruption in return
for a lighter sentence in a case in which he admitted to stealing
about 8 pounds of cocaine from the department. He told how the
police had framed scores of innocent people, many of them gang
members, lied in court and, in at least two instances, shot unarmed
gang members, one of them while he was handcuffed, and then had
them framed on trumped-up charges.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the scandal was focused on his old inner-city
station, the Rampart Division, but evidence is emerging that the
brutality may have been more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 criminal cases have been overturned so far, with
the police saying that at least 99 have been tainted.

   RAMPART-REBUFF (Los Angeles) _ A sharply divided Los Angeles
City Council rebuffed a proposal to create a new independent panel
to look at the Rampart Division scandal on Tuesday, saying it
wanted to wait to see what is developed by the LAPD and what steps
are taken by the Police Commission. The 8-6 vote against the
proposal from Councilman Joel Wachs, however, did not kill it
outright. Instead it was sent to the council's Public Safety

MCCAIN, BRADLEY POLL LEADERS IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Arizona Senator John McCain holds a commanding lead
over Goverrnor George W. Bush among likely Massachusetts Republican
presidential primary voters, while Vice President Al Gore has
expanded his lead over Bill Bradley in the Democratic contest, a
new University of Massachusetts poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, taken between Saturday and Monday, gives McCain 58
percent of the GOP vote, with Bush getting 34 percent. Alan Keyes
received 1 percent. The remainder were undecided in the poll sample
of 400 Republicans and independents who expect to vote in the
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic contest, Gore, who trailed Bradley in a
similar poll last October by an 8 percentage-point margin, now
leads the former US Senator by a 50-to-35 margin, the UMass poll
found in a separate opinion sample. Another 15 percent were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Each sample has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent.
The state's presidential primary takes place March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Lou DiNatale, the polls' director, said the McCain lead reflects
the unprecedented switch in party registration by Democrats to
Republican this year.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State William F. Galvin announced Monday that as
many as 30,000 voters have moved to the Republican or independent
rolls in the weeks since McCain stunned Bush in New Hampshire's
Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
   The sampling for the UMass survey was begun after Bush was
declared the winner of Saturday's South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's lead over Bush in the poll is based on his strong
showing among independents. He leads the Texas governor by 43 to 28
percent among such voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can find some good news in the poll. He maintains a better
than a 2 to 1 lead among those voters who describe themselves as
``mostly Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strong showing also seems to be undercutting Bradley's
once strong position in Massachusetts. ``The independent bloc is
currently heading to the Republican primary and that's bad news for
Bradley,'' DiNatale said.

RUIZ-HOLYFIELD IS SET FOR MAY 27 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ May 27 is the time. Las Vegas is the place. The only
question is, will it be John Ruiz's time when he's in that place?
</P>
<P>
   That's because Don King said Tuesday he has finalized a deal for
Ruiz to fight Evander Holyfield at Caesars Palace for either a
vacant World Boxing Association title or the right to be considered
the true No. 1 contender in heavyweight boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz was recently elevated to the No. 1 spot by the WBA, making
him the top contender both in that organization and the World
Boxing Council. Both Holyfield and undisputed heavyweight champion
Lennox Lewis had agreed prior to their rematch to fight the WBA's
leading contender or its highest-rated available opponent if then
top-rated Henry Akinwande was unavailable. With Akinwande dropping
to No. 4 because of inactivity due to health problems, Ruiz was
elevated, and King now will push the WBA to declare its title
vacant because of Lewis's decision to fight Michael Grant April 29
instead of Ruiz despite the prior agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the rematch, both fighters agreed the winner was to
fight Akinwande or the leading available contender,'' King said
while watching welterweight champion Felix Trinidad work out at the
Church Street gym in lower Manhattan Tuesday. ``Now they come up
with some b.s. not to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't be selective with the rules when they become
inconvenient. John Ruiz has been put where he rightfully belongs.
He deserves the opportunity to fight for the WBA title. Both guys
agreed to fight the leading contender with no intervening bouts. If
they don't do it, they're working with two sets of rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Failing that, however, King said he would still stage
Ruiz-Holyfield as a 12-round fight in a so-called title eliminator
to make one the undisputed contender. Although International Boxing
Federation No. 1 David Tua might dispute that pronouncement, King
did not.

   ``If the WBA refuses, I don't care,'' King said. ``We fight them
12 rounds anyway. But just because you're the undisputed champion,
it doesn't give you the right to abuse the law. The undisputed
champion should uphold the law. You can't destroy the rules so a
Boston kid can't get his opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the fight seems assured, and the Chelsea, Mass.,
heavyweight who has seldom gotten his due in local circles is
finally on the cusp of boxing's big reward _ the million dollar
payday and a shot at the big-time.

   ``I'm bringing big-time boxing back to Caesars Palace,'' King
said. ``We're going to do that with Felix Trinidad on March 5 (vs.
WBA super welterweight champion David Reid) and we're doing it with
Johnny Ruiz on May 27.''

   BRITAIN: MEDICAL REPORT CHALLENGED
</P>
<P>
   Belgium, France, Switzerland and Spain registered formal
challenges to a British report suggesting that Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, 84, is medically unfit for extradition to Spain to stand
trial on torture charges. Jack Straw, the home secretary, promised
a response ``as soon as possible.''

   SPAIN: CAR BOMB KILLS 2
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Buesa, a leader of the opposition Socialist Party, and
his bodyguard died when a car bomb exploded as they walked in the
Basque regional capital of Vitoria. The government blamed the
Basque separatist group ETA, and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
vowed to resist the rebels.

   Several media companies, including the BBC, CNN, ABC and CBS,
asked a Scottish court to allow them to televise the trial of two

<P>
   The Supreme Court heard a challenge to a law that would require
all Canadians to obtain licenses by the end of the year and
register all their guns by the end of 2001. The challenge,
initiated by six provinces, asserts that the federal government is
invading their right to regulate private property. Since the new
law went into effect 15 months ago, roughly 5 percent of Canada's
estimated 3 million gun owners have applied for licenses. A ruling
is expected this spring.

   Federal authorities arrested Nicolas Caletri Lopez, 44, whom

   Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland, the Israeli army's chief of operations,
told reporters that he expected Israeli troops to leave Lebanon by
year's end, but expressed doubt about Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
July 7 deadline for a withdrawal. The July date is based on the

   The U.N. war crimes prosecutor argued for the reversal of a

took the lives of at least 500,000 ethnic Tutsi and moderate Hutu
in Rwanda. The prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, said new evidence
proves that it was not the fault of prosecutors that the suspect,
Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, a former Hutu government official, was not
charged for the crimes in a timely manner. But Barayagwiza's
lawyers said that the evidence was not new and that Barayagwiza
should be released, as ordered by an appeals court late last year.

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES REJECT NEWEST CHINA THREAT

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Taiwan responded defiantly to China's latest threat
to invade, with Taiwan's top presidential candidates declaring
Tuesday they would not be bullied by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, meanwhile _ eager to avert a military
confrontation that would destabilize Asia and almost certainly rope
in the United States _ also chided China for its belligerent
statement, which raised tensions three weeks before Taiwanese
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The latest dustup could alter the course of reunification talks
with Beijing and the prospects for a stable regional environment
for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   China, after its absorption of Hong Kong in 1997 and Macao in
December, is determined to speed up talks about unifying Taiwan
with China.
</P>
<P>
   The US government recognizes Beijing as the only ``one China,''
and wants to protect its delicate relations with the communist
leadership and promote trade with China _ while at the same time
defending its longtime friends in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reject any use of force or any threat of force in this
situation,'' Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said in Washington.
``We have repeated, I think, in both actions and words that we view
any threat to Taiwan with grave concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has considered Taiwan a renegade province ever since the
Nationalist Party retreated to the island and set up a government
in exile following the 1949 civil war. China has long threatened
war if the island declares independence or if a third country
intervenes, but Monday was the first time it threatened attack over
delays in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan says it favors eventual reunification, but only when
China is a democratic, capitalist nation. Until then, Taiwan's
leaders say the two should be regarded as separate states.
</P>
<P>
   When Taiwan held its first presidential elections in 1996 _ a
move that underscored the island's de facto independence _ an
infuriated China conducted war games and fired two nuclear-capable
missiles across the 100-mile-wide Taiwan Strait to intimidate
voters from supporting independence-minded candidates. Washington
sent two aircraft carriers and other battleships to nearby waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will remember that in 1996 we responded appropriately to
what was viewed as a threat,'' Lockhart told reporters. ``That
should give you some indication of how we view this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Beijing has not resorted to military muscle-flexing,
but some Taiwan analysts say the latest rhetoric from China's
cabinet could be just as damaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a paper missile,'' said Andrew Nien-dzu Yang,
secretary-general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies
in Taipei. ``Beijing wants to send a very strong message to the
international community that Taiwan is part of China.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Hong Kong Tuesday, Yang said the panic in
Taiwan over the 1996 missile tests subsided after a few weeks,
while this ``well-calcuated policy of hard-line approach could be
sustained for much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yang said China's military is ``sharpening their
knives and at the same time, updating missile systems ... China
wants to show that the next time (the United States) wants to come
to Taiwan's rescue, it won't be so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chao Chien-min, of the Sun Yat-sen Graduate Institute for Social
Sciences and Humanities at National Chengchi University in Taipei,
agreed the message was directed as much at the US as at Taiwan.
``Beijing is trying to circumvent Taiwan and negotiate with
Washington directly. The white paper was meant for Washington's
ears, and probably for (China's) own people's ears...to appease
hard-liners in Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   Chao also warned that the white paper, compared to earlier
policy statements from Beijing, ``abandoned good will. In the past,
maybe there was a group'' of leaders who were ``softer'' on Taiwan,
but apparently not now.
</P>
<P>
   China this month sailed its newly-purchased Russian destroyer
through the Taiwan Strait, and Chinese President Jiang Zemin last
weekend toured military bases in southern China that would be key
in any invasion of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's government, meanwhile, Tuesday accused Beijing of
stalling unification talks itself by insisting that Taiwan is not a
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1949, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been under
separate rule, neither subordinate to the other,'' said Lin
Chong-pin, of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council. ``The Chinese
Communists' continued denial of the existence of (Taiwan's
government) can only bring more trouble to cross-strait relations
and deepen tension.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's top presidential contenders _ who had all proposed
plans to improve ties with China _ reacted Tuesday by distancing
themselves from Beijing and denouncing the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not go to China to negotiate terms for our
surrender,'' declared independent candidate James Soong, a former
Nationalist leader. ``We will not be intimidated.''

EDUCATION SECRETARY PROPOSES TEACHERS WORK YEAR-ROUND TO BUILD PAY,
STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JODI WILGOREN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying public schools are plagued by ``an old agrarian schedule,
an outdated factory model and an antiquated wage system,''
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley proposed Tuesday that teachers
work year-round to boost their pay and their status.
</P>
<P>
   In his seventh annual address on the state of American
education, Riley also called for a review of the standards movement
that has swept the nation over the past decade, suggesting that
states use a range of assessments rather than a single
multiple-choice test, and that high achievement goals required for
promotion or graduation be phased in slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers need extra time for professional development to master
the ambitious new standards and integrate technology into the
curriculum, Riley said in proposing the extended calendar. He said
he would leave it up to school districts and states to decide
whether students should spend additional days in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never really improve American education until we
elevate the teaching profession and come to grips with the issue of
teacher compensation,'' Riley told a crowd of 1,500, mostly adults
in suits, packed into a high school gymnasium in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that experienced teachers with master's degrees earn an
average of $32,000 a year less than their counterparts in other
fields, he called for a ``dramatic overhaul of how we recruit,
prepare, induct and retain good teachers,'' adding that, ``With
knowledge all around us, available anytime and anywhere, the role
of the teacher is going to be fundamentally transformed in the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   In an hour-long speech that touched on many policies outside his
purview, from paid maternity leave to gun control, the secretary
named the persistent achievement gap between white and minority
students as one of the nation's profound problems, and worried that
a ``growing digital divide'' is widening the gulf. He renewed his
call for universal preschool, urging parents to read daily to their
babies. He reiterated his position that vouchers, publicly funded
coupons that students can take to private schools, ``are simply a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   His boldest proposal, to extend teachers' calendars, was hailed
by the nation's two teachers unions as a long overdue remedy for
two of their chief complaints _ low salaries and lack of time for
professional development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demands are such that we need more time than you can fit
in the normal school year,'' said Donna Fowler, a spokeswoman for
the American Federation of Teachers. Asked whether it might deter
people attracted by teaching's schedule, Fowler said many teachers
take second jobs because they cannot afford summers off. ``I'm sure
they would rather spend that time doing what they do during the
year and getting paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley's comments on standards were more vague. He declared
himself a supporter of high-stakes tests, yet said states should
``incorporate multiple ways of measuring learning,'' including
portfolios of student work. He said it is ``far better to ratchet
up standards a step at a time than to try to make one huge leap all
at once.'' He added that ``promotion standards must be phased in
sensibly, not rushed,'' a nod to the backlash against the new
emphasis on testing in several states where hundreds of thousands
of students are facing failure.
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Schwartz, president of Achieve, a nonprofit group
monitoring the standards movement, said it is difficult to quibble
with the suggestion for review, but that the 50 states cannot all
be helped with the same remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``While on the one hand you may have places that seem to be
marching rapidly to the edge of the cliff at breakneck speed,
you've got other places that are proceeding pretty carefully, and
other places that have barely started,'' he said. ``It's hard to
make a general statement that everybody needs to stop where they
are and have a mid-course correction.''
</P>
<P>
   Chester E. Finn Jr., a leading conservative on education, said
Riley ``would have done standards-based reform more good if he had
advised state officials to be steadfast and resolute and to
persevere and not be deterred by the forces of resistance to
accountability and standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, one of three Clinton Cabinet members to have survived
from the first days of the administration, initiated the annual
education speech. Tuesday, he was welcomed to Souther High School
by a chorus of teen-agers in glittery silver vests singing, ``I
believe I can fly,'' but most students watched the speech on
television from their classrooms, as the gym was filled with
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Each year at his speech, Riley has held up a photograph of one
of his newly born grandchildren, effectively dedicating his speech
to students of the future. The tradition remained unbroken, thanks
to the birth this weekend in Sacramento, Calif., of William Daniel
Riley, who weighed 8 pounds, 9 ounces.

MCCAIN, GORE POLL LEADERS IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects hed)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Arizona Senator John McCain holds a commanding lead
over Goverrnor George W. Bush among likely Massachusetts Republican
presidential primary voters, while Vice President Al Gore has
expanded his lead over Bill Bradley in the Democratic contest, a
new University of Massachusetts poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, taken between Saturday and Monday, gives McCain 58
percent of the GOP vote, with Bush getting 34 percent. Alan Keyes
received 1 percent. The remainder were undecided in the poll sample
of 400 Republicans and independents who expect to vote in the
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic contest, Gore, who trailed Bradley in a
similar poll last October by an 8 percentage-point margin, now
leads the former US Senator by a 50-to-35 margin, the UMass poll
found in a separate opinion sample. Another 15 percent were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Each sample has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent.
The state's presidential primary takes place March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Lou DiNatale, the polls' director, said the McCain lead reflects
the unprecedented switch in party registration by Democrats to
Republican this year.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State William F. Galvin announced Monday that as
many as 30,000 voters have moved to the Republican or independent
rolls in the weeks since McCain stunned Bush in New Hampshire's
Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
   The sampling for the UMass survey was begun after Bush was
declared the winner of Saturday's South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's lead over Bush in the poll is based on his strong
showing among independents. He leads the Texas governor by 43 to 28
percent among such voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can find some good news in the poll. He maintains a better
than a 2 to 1 lead among those voters who describe themselves as
``mostly Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strong showing also seems to be undercutting Bradley's
once strong position in Massachusetts. ``The independent bloc is
currently heading to the Republican primary and that's bad news for
Bradley,'' DiNatale said.

UNDERDOG BRADLEY TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Emerging from three weeks in the political
wilderness, Bill Bradley Tuesday pursued a new attack strategy in
his struggle to catch Vice President Al Gore before all hope is
lost in his quest for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who was poised to gamble vast resources that he can
overcome Gore's double-digit lead in Washington before the state's
non-binding primary next Tuesday, cast the vice president as a
symbol of ``finger-in-the-wind leadership'' who talks about his
convictions but fails to honor them.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was scheduled to leave New York Wednesday for six days
in Washington in the hope of seizing some momentum before the
decisive round of primaries in more than a dozen states on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priorities come from conviction, not from polls, and his
actions have been far different from his words,'' Bradley said of
Gore at Adelphi University on Long Island. ``What does he really
believe?''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that laid out Bradley's campaign themes for the next
two weeks before the March 7 primaries, the former New Jersey
senator also asked voters not to confuse his charisma deficit with
a lack of courage or conviction. The speech marked Bradley's
fullest acknowledgment yet that his trademark reserve and low-watt
speaking style have stymied his ability to inspire interest in his
sweeping agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not flashy,'' Bradley said. ``I never have been. ... My
passion for these things is deep in my heart and soul. I show it
not by shouting or making a fist, but by the consistency of my
beliefs, and by my never-ending fight to turn those beliefs into
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's current reality is that he trails Gore in all the
states that choose delegates on March 7. Bradley, who has been
largely obscured since John McCain's win in the New Hampshire
Republican primary, has fallen behind Gore by double digits in
every March 7 state except New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for an opening, Bradley and his strategists have
targeted the Northwest, where Bradley plans to make a last-ditch
stand in Washington amid polls that show him trailing there by more
than 20 points. Washington voters cast ballots in a ``beauty
contest'' on Tuesday. The results are not binding until caucuses
held on March 7, when the state's nominating delegates are
selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to plant a flag and make one state a clear contest
over the core differences between us,'' said Bradley's spokesman,
Eric Hauser. ``If we can make up a chunk of ground in Washington,
like we did in New Hampshire, we'll take that momentum and storm
into March 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made no secret of his plans to escalate his assault on
Gore, which he launched with renewed vigor in a donnybrook debate
in Harlem the night before. Bradley aides would not rule out that
he would soon roll out his first attack ads against Gore, and they
said a commercial featuring an endorsement by film director Spike
Lee is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in the Adelphi speech, argued that Gore has transformed
himself from a conservative during his congressional career to a
fair-weather fan of President Clinton's agenda. Bradley reiterated
his criticism that Gore had opposed gun control initiatives,
tougher tobacco regulations, and Medicaid funding for abortions
while in Congress, only to switch positions as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we really know about Al Gore?'' Bradley said. ``We
know he's been a loyal No. 2, but what was he like on his own? He
was a conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bradley's speech, Gore aides handed out news releases
announcing the debut of a ``Bradley information bureau'' on Gore's
Web site. The new feature, intended to highlight inconsistencies
and misstatements by Bradley, quotes Bradley as saying, ``I won't
spend my time attacking my opponent on votes from long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``information bureau'' notes that Bradley's criticism of
Gore's congressional record has dated to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley knows very well that Al Gore is pro-choice and
supports gun control,'' said Doug Hattaway, a Gore spokesman. ``He
is trying desperately to create phony distinctions because he loses
when voters focus on the real differences in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in contrasting his political history with Gore's,
argued that he has clung to his core convictions since he first ran
for office in 1978. Outlining issue after issue of his agenda, he
completed each proposal by saying, ``It's what I believe, it's what
I've always fought for, and it is what I will do as president.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Rocky'' theme, an underdog anthem, filled the room as
Bradley departed.

NEW ZEALAND ON A ROMP _ AGAINST A FASTER BOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ When the Italian team sailed Luna Rossa
into the middle of an America's Cup nightmare Monday, there was an
unavoidable sense that New Zealand was on a romp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just a step ahead in every department,'' said Peter
Gilmour, the Australian who skippered the Nippon Challenge for
Japan. ``From their design to the techniques they have worked out
for sailing their yacht, the Kiwis are on a new standard.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians may indeed be in full retreat. Or, after they
licked their many wounds on the second layday Tuesday, perhaps they
will come out fighting as they did against AmericaOne to take the
Louis Vuitton Cup from Paul Cayard.
</P>
<P>
   There is little empirical evidence that New Zealand is a faster
boat than Luna Rossa.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes after a slam-dunk start by skipper Russell Coutts
in Race 2, one that stuffed Prada back 18 seconds off the line,
Italy skipper Francesco de Angelis had Luna Rossa perking along on
the first beat and closing the distance. And that was with a
plastic bag hanging on the keel, creating troublesome drag and
attendant problems.
</P>
<P>
   On the third leg, after smoothing out the boat-handling horrors,
Prada was cooking again, and in fact sailed a faster leg than New
Zealand by an average speed of 9.5 to 9.2 knots _ a huge
difference, though the two boats had such separation they could
have been sailing in different wind.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a 2-0 lead in the best-of-nine finals, Team New
Zealand is creating the impression that it is the varsity
scrimmaging the JVs. Several challengers for the 2003 Cup have
already called New Zealand authorities to reserve dock space along
Viaduct Basin.
</P>
<P>
   If NZL 60 is a breakthrough boat, it is not because of any one
design feature, said Gilmour, but ``a whole lot of details outside
the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime yacht designer David Pedrick, who has been analyzing
the boats here, agreed. NZL 60 certainly looks different, because
of its ``spoon'' bow. Rather than the long fine entry into the
water that Luna Rossa has, NZL 60's bow angles down into a chunky
chin that looks in profile like the front of a barge.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be pretty, but many designers agree with Pedrick that
the ``knuckle bow'' is just one innovation that translates into
boatspeed.
</P>
<P>
   The bow has the trademark of its designer, Laurie Davidson, who
is known to use the design to gain waterline length without paying
the measurement price. In fact, as measured, NZL 60 has at least 1
foot more effective sailing length than did NZL 32, the Kiwi Cup
winner of 1995. This is enough to account for significant
differences around an 18-mile course, said Pedrick.
</P>
<P>
   The slightest speed advantage becomes magnified, not necessarily
in straight-line drag races, but in allowing match-racers to gain
controlling positions.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, New Zealand's chief designer last time was Doug
Peterson, who was hired to design Prada's Luna Rossa, along with
German Frers and his son, Mani.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ``knuckle'' bow, the Kiwi boat also has
shallow stern overhangs and several anti-drag measures. For
example, when it occurred to someone that on upwind legs, the
topmast backstay _ the steel rod that holds the mast up against
sail pressure downwind _ was simply hanging limp, creating some
drag, the Kiwis decided to detach it and drop it on deck.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gilmour, Japanese analysts ran computer tests and
found the dropped backstay to be a factor of 4 kilograms of drag in
a total 350 kilograms of total drag created by these rigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real percentage,'' said Gilmour.
</P>
<P>
   With these innovations, and the ``millennium rig'' _ a stiff
mast given superior bend control by three sets of stays rather than
five _ the Kiwis have broken through into what Gilmour calls
``tomorrowland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, everyone has just caught up with where the Kiwis
were in '95,'' said Gilmour. ``So by the next Cup, if all we've
done is catch up to where the Kiwis are now, it won't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kiwis look like they've raised the design game in several
ways. We're all chasing this little isolated country out here in
the Pacific.''
</P>

&HT;     SMUGGLING FOR PROSTITUTION IS CALLED `SLAVERY'

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A million women and girls a year are smuggled
across international borders and forced into prostitution, the
State Department told a Senate subcommittee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, about 50,000 enter the United States annually from
Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, said Frank Loy,
undersecretary of state for global affairs. Most of the females are
lured by false promises of legitimate work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loy and other officials said gangs of smugglers linked to
organized crime keep the girls and women in their control through
beatings, rape, psychological intimidation, confiscation of
passports and threats to relatives back home. Often the victims
contract sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Such exploitation represents ``one of the most egregious human
rights abuses right now,'' Loy declared. ``It is slavery pure and
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Lederer, director of the smuggler-monitoring Protection
Project at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, said
the traffickers seem to operate with impunity in such nations as
India, Thailand, Brazil and the former Soviet republics of Ukraine
and Moldova.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs,
said of the trafficking: ``This is one of the most shocking and
rampant human rights abuses worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman who called herself Inez from Veracruz, Mexico, testified
about being trapped for several months in a prostitution ring. She
wore sunglasses and a scarf around her head to disguise her
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   She told the senators that in 1997, when she was a lemon
harvester in Veracruz, a friend told her about an opportunity to
work in a U.S. restaurant for good pay. Inez said she jumped at the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   A smuggling gang spirited her across the border in Brownsville,
Texas, took her to Houston and from there transported her to a
trailer in Avon Park, Fla., which turned out to be a brothel.
</P>
<P>
   There she was told she had accumulated a $2,500 debt for
transportation to the United States and that she would have to pay
it off by selling her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was horrified,'' Inez said. ``I asked my friend what this
was all about. She said she had already worked in the brothels, and
it did me no good to complain.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Inez said, she plunged into the terrifying world of forced
prostitution. Condoms with torn wrappers were sent back to the
smugglers and served as tickets for $25 deductions from the
smuggling debt.
</P>
<P>
   Inez and the other women and girls _ some as young as 14 _
worked six days a week, 12 hours a day, and were ferried from place
to place, she said. Beatings and rapes by the smugglers were
commonplace. Those who became pregnant were forced to get
abortions, with the abortion fee added to the smuggling debt, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   After a few months police and FBI and Immigration and
Naturalization Service agents raided the brothel. Inez said that
after spending several more months in a detention center, she was
released to a women's domestic violence center where she received
comprehensive gynecological examinations and mental health
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony helped put several of the smuggling crew in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``No woman or child would want to be a sex slave and endure the
evil that I have gone through,'' Inez told the Senate panel.
``Please help us. Please do not let this happen to anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and House are considering legislation to beef up
criminal penalties for prostitute-smuggling gangs and to provide
social services and visas for immigrant females forced into
prostitution. The legislation would also allow the administration
to impose sanctions against foreign nations involved in
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version would authorize $86 million over two years
for the federal effort; the House would authorize $78 million.
</P>
<P>
   Loy said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright often brings the
issue up in talks with foreign ministers. He added that the United
States is promoting a plan to attach a measure forbidding such
trafficking to the United Nations Convention on Transnational
Organized Crime.

 &HT;    Expatriate's pardon came down to the wire
 &HT;    By Colin Campbell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Preston King _ who's expected back in America today for
the first time in nearly nearly 40 years _ didn't know until the
last minute whether he would return home a free man or end up in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   After his eldest brother died Feb. 12, in Miami, King's
sister-in-law in Albany, Ga., Carol King, postponed the funeral so
King's lawyers in Washington could once again press the government
to let him fly from England, where he's a professor of political
theory, to attend the funeral in Albany without fear of being
arrested. King has been a fugitive since his 1961 conviction for
draft evasion.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and others in the administration were believed
to sympathize with King, since even the judge who sentenced him has
said that the case would never have come to trial if King _ an
educated young black man in Jim Crow Georgia _ hadn't demanded to
be addressed politely by his white draft board.
</P>
<P>
   King's hopes had been raised before _ only to be crushed by
apparent political questions at the White House about pardoning a
``draft dodger.''
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, with his lawyers in Washington still negotiating with
the government over the terms of his possible return, King had
grown so frustrated that he had determined to fly to Atlanta on
Wednesday no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've basically decided,'' the 63-year-old King said Monday,
``that I've got to come home for this funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   King had refused to risk imprisonment earlier by returning for
the funerals of his parents and three other brothers, but, now that
his 79-year-old brother Clennon W. King Jr. was dead, he had had
enough. ``It was Gordian-knot time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers had been discussing legal options as diverse as a
full presidential pardon, commutation of his sentence, or some
temporary deal whereby he'd be allowed to enter the country for the
funeral and then leave again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as you know,'' King said Sunday afternoon, 24 hours before
the pardon was issued, ``this has been going on for over a
generation, and its latest resuscitation has been going on for over
a year.''
</P>
<P>
   King decided he would take the last train to London on Monday
night and catch a Delta flight to Atlanta today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we must just go ahead,'' he said shortly before
leaving for the station. ``The whole question is, What are the
intentions of the American government? ... I'm going to try to get
a visa first thing in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if the U.S. Embassy in London looked him up, discovered
that he was a U.S. fugitive and refused to stamp a visa in his
Australian passport?
</P>
<P>
   ``They would look me up in their computers to clap me in
irons,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   But, King said, ``I got off the train about midnight, in
London.'' The train was an hour late, but a camera crew from NBC
News was waiting for him, looking serious. ``And then they said,
`You got a pardon!''' His reaction was numbness, and relief.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, instead of a visa, he picked up his new blue U.S.
passport, which expires Feb. 21, 2010. He was, officially, a
native-born citizen again. ``Isn't that wild?'' he said. King's
last U.S. passport expired in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The pardon ``was really unexpected,'' said his lawyer, Liz
Holtzman, by telephone from New York. King's formal petition for a
pardon was submitted _ seemingly with Clinton's blessing _ on Dec.
21. But weeks passed and nothing happened. ``I could see this was
an endless process,'' Holtzman said.
</P>
<P>
   When King's brother Clennon died earlier this month, King told
Holtzman almost despondently that he would never be allowed to
return for the funeral. ``I felt a kind of futility creeping over
me,'' King recalled. Holtzman left a message at the Justice
Department asking that King be allowed to return for the funeral,
if only for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   A government lawyer returned Holtzman's call and asked if
Clennon's funeral had happened. It hadn't yet. It was scheduled to
take place last Saturday. Holtzman and Carol King agreed to
postpone the funeral until this Thursday to give the government
more time. ``I could see that they were really trying,'' Holtzman
said. ``Somebody was moved by the fact of the funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtzman said: ``I give the president enormous credit. It took
courage _ it's not necessarily a risk-free pardon, but it's the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank him,'' King said of Clinton on the eve of his
departure for America, ``and I applaud him.''

 &HT;    Home Depot's earnings take another step up
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot's profit continues to surge as consumers
spend more on remodeling and housing supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company said fourth-quarter earnings rose 38
percent to $578 million, or 25 cents a share, from $418 million, or
18 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Home Depot beat analysts'
expectations by a penny, according to a survey by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 26 percent to $9.17 billion from $7.26 billion. The
company opened stores at a brisk pace and concentrated on
higher-ticket merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot customers continued to spend more on average for each
purchase. In the fourth quarter, the average transaction was
$46.61, against $44.46 a year ago. Some of the increase was caused
by price hikes in commodities such as lumber and building
materials, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're demonstrating to the customer the benefits of products
that are one step up in price,'' said analyst Doug Gordon at Banc
of America Securities, who rates the shares ``strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's stock closed Tuesday at $53.87 1/2, up 12 1/2
cents. The retailer's shares have fallen more than 20 percent this
year on concern that rising interest rates could curb consumer
spending and hurt profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Arthur Blank told analysts in a conference call
Tuesday that he was ``optimistic'' about housing growth trends.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Home Depot's long-term growth initiatives already have
paid off in recent earnings results, analysts said. For example,
the company is aggressively expanding its selection of decor,
flooring, appliances and other pricier goods. And it's adding
installation services for products such as roofing, water heaters
and siding. Those goods and services generally are more profitable
than Home Depot's commodity items, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Depot has put a lot of energy into notching up the
quality of its product assortment,'' analyst Ursula Moran at
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. told Bloomberg News. She rates the stock
``outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, competitor Lowe's Cos. reported a 51 percent increase
in fiscal fourth-quarter profit. Lowe's also benefited from sales
of items with higher profit margins, such as kitchen cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot said its profit got a boost because it offered fewer
markdowns and got suppliers to bear more costs. Gross margin, which
measures the profit from each sale, widened to 31.9 percent from
30.3 percent a year earlier. Blank said he expects margins to
improve further this year.
</P>
<P>
   At stores open at least a year, sales rose 9 percent. The
retailer said it maintained ``same-store'' sales increases of 10
percent until the last two weeks of the quarter. Same-store sales
are a key indicator of a retailer's business because they exclude
sales from new and closed stores.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot operated 930 stores at the end of its fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   North Wilkesboro, N.C.-based Lowe's reported that sales at
stores open at least a year rose 6.2 percent. Same-store sales were
hurt by cold weather, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot anticipates comparable sales increases in the ``upper
end of the mid-single digits'' for the first quarter, said Marshall
Day, senior vice president of finance and accounting.
</P>
<P>
   For the year ended Jan. 30, Home Depot said sales rose 27
percent to $38.43 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A replay of the company's conference call with analysts is
available for five days at www.homedepot.com.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With raised voices and emotional appeals, lawyers
for the four New York City police officers charged with the murder
of Amadou Diallo pleaded with jurors Tuesday to see his shooting as
a tragic mistake brought on by Diallo's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Eric Warner, responded with an equally
impassioned argument. ``Amadou Diallo never had a chance,'' Warner
said. ``In the mind-set they had, that man was doomed from the
minute they saw him.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' summations came after three weeks of a trial that
was, at times, racially charged. The four officers, who are white,
fired 41 shots at Diallo, a black man who was standing, unarmed, in
the vestibule of his apartment building in the Bronx on Feb. 4,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   In their arguments Tuesday, the defense lawyers stressed the
state of mind of the officers, who they said shot Diallo out of
fear. They believed Diallo was pulling a gun out if his pocket and
intended to shoot them, the lawyers said. The officers, who
happened to be driving down the street where Diallo lived, said
they approached him because they thought he might have been a
rapist or a robber.
</P>
<P>
   But Warner argued that the officers thought the worst of Diallo
for no good reason and that their judgment was flawed from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were willing to write him off on such flimsy
suspicions,'' Warner said. ``He was one of the people they were
supposed to protect,'' he added, but the officers ``took a dim view
of that block and everything went downhill from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury of four black women, two white women and six white men
is to begin deliberating Wednesday, after hearing instructions on
the law from Justice Joseph C. Teresi of the Supreme Court. The
officers could be convicted of second-degree murder, first-degree
manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide in relation to
Diallo, and reckless endangerment of bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants _ Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy
and Kenneth Boss _ all pleaded innocent to the two counts of
second-degree murder that each is charged with in the killing of
Diallo, a 22-year-old immigrant from Guinea. The first count is for
Diallo's death and the second for depraved indifference to human
life.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Much of the attention over the case has centered around the
issue of race and the violent circumstances of Diallo's death. The
four policemen fired 41 bullets at Diallo. Nineteen of those shots
hit the victim.
</P>
<P>
   The officers testified that at the time of the shooting, they
believed Diallo had a gun and was threatening them. It turned out
that Diallo was holding his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who were members of the police department's Street
Crime Unit and were dressed in plainclothes, said they were on
patrol looking for a rape suspect and had gotten out of their car
to question Diallo because they thought his actions were
suspicious. They said Diallo did not follow their instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argued that the officers acted hastily after
cornering Diallo, fired too many shots, and did not try to
determine whether Diallo was hearing impaired or could understand
English.
</P>
<P>
   Although the officers were charged with second-degree murder,
the judge ruled the jurors would be permitted to consider the
lesser charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter and
criminally negligent homicide in their deliberations. Minimum
penalties for convictions range from 15 years to life for
second-degree murder to probation for criminally negligent
homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi's instructions to the jury, which he outlined on Friday,
pleased the defense but left prosecutors disgruntled.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said his instructions would include presenting jurors
with two statutes from New York penal law that outline when the use
of deadly force is justified. One statute, Section 35.30, says that
a police officer is justified in using deadly force to defend
himself or herself or a third person if he or she is making an
arrest or preventing an escape from custody.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution argued that such a statute does not apply to the
four officers in the current trial because the policemen said that
they planned to question Diallo, not arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also said he would instruct jurors on Section 35.15,
which says any citizen may use deadly force if he or she
``reasonably believes'' the action is needed to defend against an
attack. Part of the statute also allows the use of deadly force if
a citizen believes another person is in the process of committing a
crime like rape or robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors tried to bar those parts of the statute. Carroll had
testified that he believed Diallo was either a robber or a rapist
when he and the other officers tried to question him.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi said he would also explain to the jurors a state law that
allows police officers to approach citizens and to question them.
The defense lawyers hoped that a reading of the law would make it
clear that the police officers had the authority to question
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   The closing arguments Tuesday concluded an intense and highly
emotional phase of the trial in which witnesses and the police
officers recounted, sometimes in tears, the night of the shooting.
Carroll said that after discovering that Diallo was unarmed and had
only been clutching a wallet, he wept over the body and begged
Diallo to stay alive.

FOOTBALL PLAYER PLEADS GUILTY TO CHARGES INVOLVING STOLEN VEHICLE
SALE

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With his guilty plea to a federal felony
Tuesday, Kansas City Chief Tamarick Vanover joined a long line of
cooperating witnesses in a drug probe that has stretched over 27
months and touched at least four states.
</P>
<P>
   Vanover, a wide receiver and kick returner, is the
highest-profile figure yet snared in an investigation that has led
to convictions against seven men in California and Missouri and
pending criminal charges against seven others.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the sale of a stolen
vehicle that had crossed state lines. Vanover appeared before U.S.
District Judge Gary A. Fenner and was released after he promised to
appear at future court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Vanover could face from four to 14 months in prison, according
to a preliminary estimate included in the plea agreement.
Prosecutors could ask the judge to sentence him to less than that
if they find his cooperation substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Following the court appearance, U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill
said the plea was a positive step.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has agreed to cooperate with an ongoing investigation by
the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service,'' Hill said. ``This is a
helpful development.''
</P>
<P>
   Such cooperation often involves extensive interviews with
federal agents, appearances before grand juries and, occasionally,
testimony at trials.
</P>
<P>
   Hill declined to discuss whether other Chiefs players had come
under scrutiny in the probe.
</P>
<P>
   After his plea, Vanover declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Michael T. Yonke, emphasized that Vanover is fully
cooperating with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tamarick understands what he has done is wrong and there is a
price to be paid for his actions,'' Yonke said. ``He is willing to
pay that price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tamarick is sorry for the embarrassment he has caused his
family and his employer. I am confident that this will be the last
involvement Tamarick Vanover will ever have with the criminal
justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanover acknowledged in court that he helped transport a stolen
Ford Expedition from Missouri to Florida in March 1999. For that,
Vanover later received a $10,000 check from a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the stolen sport utility vehicle first emerged
earlier this month, with the release of court records charging
Vanover's personal assistant, Gregory E. Burns, with federal
cocaine and marijuana violations. Burns has pleaded not guilty to
those charges.
</P>
<P>
   Court records linked Burns to a ``large-scale, organized and
structured'' cocaine smuggling operation based in Fresno, Calif.,
with ties to Missouri, Kansas and Tennessee. The conspiracy once
resulted in more than 200 pounds of cocaine being transported to
Kansas City every month, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Vanover came to federal authorities' attention when cooperating
witnesses identified him as an associate of Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his guilty plea, Vanover will be allowed to travel to
play football. But Vanover's future with the Chiefs was uncertain
even before his legal problems surfaced recently.
</P>
<P>
   He remained under contract with the team as of Tuesday. He has a
$750,000 bonus due from the Chiefs on March 1 if he remains on the
roster. Should he be released before March 1, the Chiefs would
neither be responsible for the bonus nor Vanover's base salary of
$850,000.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued Tuesday by Bob Moore, the Chiefs public
relations director, did not suggest his role with the team would
change because of his guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``As is the case with any employer, we believe in the sanctity
of the legal system,'' Moore said. ``The legal system has run its
course in this matter. The issue has been addressed to the
requirements of the law.''

INSIDE NYU'S ADMISSIONS WAR ROOM: IT TAKES MORE THAN SCORES

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The glittering silver shoe rimmed in purple feather
boa arrived at 22 Washington Square North _ the town house that
serves as New York University's admissions war room _ with a note
from Jessica. Now that she had one shoe in the door, the note said,
she hoped to get the other one in, too.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Avitabile, director of admissions at NYU (whose school
color is violet) pronounced the shoe ``cute, but not too cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Avitabile has seen many gimmicks, from balloons to brownies with
the applicant's name on them. Some work. Many do not. But this one
provided a bit of sparkle last week during the marathon process
that constitutes admissions. ``No one gets in just because she
sends us a fancy shoe,'' he said. But if the rest of Jessica's
application reflected the same creativity, he noted, it would be a
strong plus.
</P>
<P>
   Reading applications is an annual winter ritual on campuses
across the country, one that has ballooned in scope at selective
colleges as the number of applicants has climbed. But few colleges
face anything like the deluge at NYU.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by New York's soaring popularity as a college town and by
the university's climb in college ratings, NYU received 30,750
freshmen applications this year _ more than any other private
university. That is 10,000 more than it received four years ago and
triple the number in 1990. And that does not even count the 4,700
transfer applications. (Even among the public universities, only a
few get more applications; UCLA is the leader, with 37,460 this
year.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a discount plan with the vision center,'' Avitabile
joked, alluding to the tired eyes of admissions officers; he and
about 20 others review each folder at least three times.
</P>
<P>
   Digesting all that paper _ and choosing 8,800 worthy candidates
from among almost 31,000 hopefuls _ is a frantic undertaking that
demands intense devotion from Avitabile and his staff. Having
steered NYU through its admissions cycle eight times before,
Avitabile (pronounced AV-it-a-bull), 52, is intimately familiar
with the demands.
</P>
<P>
   For a few hours last week, he ignored the more than 200
applications awaiting his scrutiny in his tidy second-floor office
overlooking Washington Square Park and chatted about the admissions
process.
</P>
<P>
   Some admissions officials read the essays first. Others glance
at the transcripts. Avitabile usually begins by sizing up a
student's courses to see how challenging they were and then turns
to the teacher references. ``The one caveat is that a reader is not
allowed to look at just the statistics and put the application
aside without reading it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NYU admissions officials divide folders into three rough
categories: clearly acceptable (about 15 percent to 20 percent of
the pool), clearly not acceptable (about 10 percent) and the large
gray middle that absorbs most of their time.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle group are students who have taken tough courses,
gotten good grades, scored well on standardized tests and
participated in extracurricular activities. But when held up
against other applicants, many do not make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get questions all the time about why this student was
admitted and this one wasn't,'' Avitabile said. ``I say, `He's
great, but some others were just a little bit better, and we had to
make some tough choices.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a white button-down shirt, dark tie and wing-tip shoes,
Avitabile appears ready for business, but his sensibility is more
collegiate than corporate. Even with the explosion in applications,
he rejects the notion that there may be a more efficient approach
to handling them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must remember that every one of those files represents an
individual life,'' said Avitabile, who has been through the college
admissions process twice himself as a father.
</P>
<P>
   With the luxury of an expanded pool of applicants, NYU has
become increasingly selective. Today the average score on the
College Boards for those accepted is about 1,350 (out of 1,600),
Avitabile said, and athletes and children of alumni get close
scrutiny but little or no preference. ``Athletics is one
characteristic we consider,'' he added, ``just like a student who
is a dancer or a scientist.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes an applicant stand out? Avitabile says he wants
students who do well in the most challenging courses and whose
activities suggest they will be ``active participants here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some favorite examples: There is the young photographer who
traveled around the world with her parents and lived in an
orphanage for six months, and whose photographs centered on needy
children. And there is the young man who ran a political campaign
for a state senator and also worked as a computer consultant to
local shopkeepers. ``They have not necessarily scaled mountains,''
Avitabile said, ``but most have done interesting things in their
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the process is that NYU has seven highly
differentiated schools that take undergraduates, including the
College of Arts and Science, the Tisch School of the Arts and the
Leonard N. Stern School of Business. Although their priorities
differ, Avitabile's office is the gatekeeper for all, and
applicants to all of the schools _ even those with powerful
auditions or art portfolios _ must also be strong academically.
</P>
<P>
   Avitabile plans to admit 8,800 students this year _ about 28
percent or 29 percent of applicants _ to fill a freshman class of
3,500. Nearly a third of the seats are already allocated; in
December, NYU accepted 1,100 of the 2,700 early decision
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Avitabile, who says he took a back seat when his own two
children applied to college, said he has ``great faith'' in the
ability of young people to find the right college. ``I have based
my professional career on the rational behavior of 17-year-olds,''
he said.

EXPERTS ALARMED AT RISING USE OF PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS IN YOUNG
CHILDREN

<P>
   In a finding that medical experts called ``troubling'' and
``very surprising,'' researchers reported Tuesday that the number
of preschoolers taking stimulants, antidepressants and other
psychiatric drugs rose sharply from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The use of stimulants _ most commonly methylphenidate, the
generic form of Ritalin _ increased twofold to threefold for
children ages 2 through 4 enrolled in two state Medicaid programs
and one health maintenance organization in the Northwest, the
researchers found. The number of children receiving prescriptions
for antidepressants doubled in the Medicaid programs. The use of
clonidine, a blood pressure drug gaining popularity as a treatment
for attention disorders, also jumped among the group of more than
200,000 children studied.
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers have known for some time that such drugs
are increasingly being prescribed for older children, the study,
which appears in Tuesday's issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Association, is the first to document an increase among
children under 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to support the anecdotes that more U.S. children
are receiving a diagnosis and treatment for attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder in the late 1990s than ever before,'' said
Dr. Julie Magno Zito, an associate professor of pharmacy and
medicine at the University of Maryland and lead author of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have shown significant increases in the use of
stimulants and antidepressants to treat children 5 to 19. In a
smaller study of Medicaid enrollees in Michigan, done in 1998,
researchers found that of 223 children under age 4 who were
identified as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 57
percent received at least one drug to treat the condition.
</P>
<P>
   Though the total number of very young children in the latest
study who received prescriptions for the drugs was small, 1 percent
to 1.5 percent, the increase is disturbing, the researchers said,
because research on the safety and efficacy of the medications,
scant for older children, is virtually nonexistent for
preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any benchmarks to know if this is or is not a
problem,'' Zito said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Hyman, director of the National Institute of Mental
Health, said that he was ``more than shocked'' by the findings. The
use of psychiatric drugs in young children, he said, is ``an area
of enormous concern,'' and one that Hyman has made a priority in
the institute's funding of research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly need clinical trials of safety and efficacy for
both pharmacological and psychosocial treatments in young
children,'' Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he added, he is sympathetic ``to the intense
need to do something for children who really are so terribly sick
that other means cannot control their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the researchers did not track the diagnoses given to the
children or the training of the professionals who prescribed the
drugs, the reasons for the increases are not clear.
</P>
<P>
   But experts speculated that the reasons might include the
reluctance of HMOs and subsidized medical care programs to pay for
counseling or other treatments that did not involve drugs, the
pressures from parents and schools to diagnose attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder in children, the rise of drugs as the
preferred mode of treatment and the fact that most prescriptions in
subsidized settings are written by primary care doctors rather than
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the drugs, Zito and other experts pointed out, are
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating children
of preschool age. The package insert for methylphenidate, for
example, carries a warning against prescribing the drug to children
under 6.
   While prescribing drugs for purposes not approved by the FDA,
called off-label prescribing, is both legal and common in the
treatment of older patients, the practice raises more difficult
issues in young children.
</P>
<P>
   When a doctor prescribes a drug off-label for a child, Zito
said, parents ``should be aware that they are entering an area of
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms of emotional or behavioral problems displayed by
children under 5 may be different from those exhibited by older
children, and diagnosis of such conditions in preschoolers is at
best iffy. As Dr. Joseph Coyle, chairman of psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School, commented, the normal behavior of many children
ages 2 and 3 looks a lot like attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Zito said, ``It is not really clear that children this young
could meet the diagnostic criteria for either attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder or depression, and those are the probable
diagnoses given to justify the use of stimulants, clonidine and
antidepressants.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more worrisome, experts said, is the fact that little is
known about the effects of antidepressants, stimulants and other
psychoactive drugs on brain development. Studies in animals
indicate that the brain chemicals that are targeted by some such
drugs play an important role in the proliferation of nerve cells in
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``These interventions are occurring at a critical time in brain
development,'' said Coyle, who wrote an editorial accompanying the
report, ``and we don't know what consequences are.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Zito's study, methylphenidate was by far the most popular
stimulant prescribed for preschoolers, accounting for 90 percent of
stimulant prescriptions. In the Midwestern Medicaid group, 11.1 of
every 1,000 children ages 2 to 5 were prescribed methylphenidate in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   In the HMO and in a mid-Atlantic Medicaid group, the number of
girls receiving prescriptions for stimulants increased more in five
years than the number of boys, researchers found, suggesting that
attention disorders were increasingly being diagnosed in girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that girls are more likely than in the past to
be getting medicated,'' Zito said, ``where attention deficit
disorder used to be more of little boys' disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Among antidepressants, the older generation of ``tricyclic''
drugs remained the most commonly prescribed, though the number of
children receiving newer medications like like Prozac and Zoloft
increased sharply in the Medicaid programs over the five years. In
the Midwestern Medicaid group, 3.2 of every 1,000 preschoolers
received prescriptions for antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   Though clonidine was prescribed far less frequently than
stimulant drugs, the researchers said, its increased use was
``particularly notable,'' because there were no rigorous studies
demonstrating that it was a safe or effective as a treatment. The
study found that 2.3 children per 1,000 in the Midwestern Medicaid
group received prescriptions for the drug in 1995, compared to 0.1
child per 1,000 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Heart problems have been reported in children taking clonidine
in combination with other drugs, including Ritalin, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the increase in other drugs, the use of
antipsychotic drugs for preschoolers remained constant over the
five-year period at about 0.7 children per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Zito and her colleagues noted that the findings of the study may
not apply to all other medical settings. But she said she suspected
that the use of stimulants to treat attention disorders was even
more prevalent among children from higher-income families.

 &HT;    Tale of two markets
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a twofold message to investors in the stock
market's behavior, according to analysts: Technology is here to
stay, and the first half of 2000 will be more painful than the
second.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the message is based on the idea that a giant
shift is under way in the economy, which is reflected on Wall
Street by a move out of Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stocks and into
Nasdaq composite stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The second message is that the Federal Reserve's strategy of
raising interest rates to slow the economy is having little impact
on ``new economy'' stocks of the technology sector, while hurting
``old economy'' stocks. That threatens to deepen the correction in
blue chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 295 points Friday
ahead of the three-day holiday weekend, recaptured some of that
loss in a late rally Tuesday, rising 0.8 percent. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 also benefited from bargain hunting to rise 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite, which traded at a record 4,548.92 on
Thursday, fell Friday and again Tuesday, although it too was rising
at the end of the trading day.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts saw no fundamental change in the trading pattern
and expect the Nasdaq to go on leading the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a market that wants to participate in the most dynamic
growth sector in my 40 years in the business,'' said Alfred
Goldman, strategist for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   At Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta, senior strategist Robert S.
Robbins increased the recommended portfolio weighting of technology
stocks to 42 percent from 38 percent of total stock holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth stocks in general and technology stocks in particular
remain the overwhelming stock market leaders short term and long
term, in our opinion,'' said Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Fed's strategy of raising interest rates to slow the
economy, analysts say it is having little impact on the technology
sector while hurting the blue chip sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed is raising rates and slowing the segment of the
economy that is already slowing,'' said Goldman. He explained that
technology companies do not borrow as much as traditional cyclical
and interest-sensitive firms included in the Dow and S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stocks that have been such powerful drivers of this market
have gotten tired,'' George Cohen, a principal at Cohen
Klingenstein &AMP; Marks, told Dow Jones News Service, referring to
blue chips. ``Whether this is the moment for a true correction or
not, I don't think anybody can say. But many of these stocks have
gotten stretched.''
</P>
<P>
   At Prudential Securities, technical analyst Ralph Acampora noted
that his morning conference calls with company offices have dealt
in the recent weeks with ``the split between the `old economy'
stocks and the `new economy' stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' he said, ``many of the suspicious `old
economy' stocks reside in the Dow average _ thus the Dow is apt to
do worse than some of the `new economy'-laden indices such as the
Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq composite.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Acampora, the market is oversold on a near-term
basis and due for a ``technical rally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem still remains: Is any rally from current
levels sustainable? We don't think so. Therefore, a retest of the
recent lows and even lower levels can be expected for the Dow,'' he
said. ``We leave the door wide open for the Dow to retest its
October 1999 low of 9,976.02.''
</P>
<P>
   But Acampora also said a setback of that size would be
``positive for the longer-term market'' since it would ``wash out
the excesses and set the stage for a longer-term upside move'' in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, yields on the 30-year Treasury bond continued to fall
as demand remains strong in the face of the government's promise to
reduce new debt in a period of budget surplus. The yield on Tuesday
fell to the lowest point in 3 1/2 months.

CORRECTION IS OFFICIAL; DOW, NASDAQ INDEXES DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's official. The stocks that make up the Old Economy are in
the midst of a correction.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery is whether New Economy stocks will follow.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index, which represents a spectrum of technology
companies, dipped 29.62 Tuesday, closing at 4382.12. It was an
insignificant second consecutive day's decline, a blip in an index
whose all-time high was achieved only last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dow Jones industrial index, despite a small rally
Tuesday, has tumbled 12 percent from a record of 11,722.9 on Jan.
14. A correction occurs when stocks decline 10 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glare from the Nasdaq has truly masked the poor
performance of some very critical sectors of our old economy,''
said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist for State Street Global
Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which is composed of heavy-hitting stocks such as J.P.
Morgan and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., closed at 10,304.84, up 85.32
points (less than 1 percent). But the index did not leave
correction territory, which it entered on Friday during a 295-point
free fall that wiped out 2.8 percent of its value in a day.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's dive was a delayed reaction to hints by Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan that the wealth being generated by
a rising stock market is causing the economy to overheat.
Inflation, the Fed fears, may be ignited if it does not act
decisively.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, though, has faltered repeatedly since Fed interest-rate
hikes began in June. Some industries represented in the Dow _
including home building and some financial companies _ began to
reveal cracks months ago. Not even the addition of Microsoft Corp.
last year to the Dow's roster of 30 stocks was protection against
flagging investor sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Market strategists say the Dow is hurting because some investors
have become increasingly convinced that an economic slowdown is
coming _ and they want out before it occurs. The Nasdaq has not
been fazed by higher rates because there is plenty of equity
funding _ from venture capitalists and other stock investors _ and
less need for loans, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan's diagnosis was pretty clear,'' said Allen Sinai,
president of Primark Decision Economics, a Boston consulting firm.
The economy is experiencing ``a boom with a bunch of imbalances,
and the only way the central bank can deal with it is to raise
interest rates. But implicit in his comments about rate hikes to
come is (that) some damage to growth has to happen,'' Sinai said.
The companies in the Dow ``are cyclically sensitive to Fed
tightening,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the chemicals giant E.I. DuPont DeNemours was
trading at about $65 a share at the end of last year. It closed at
54 3/16, up 2 1/12.
</P>
<P>
   Interest-rate-sensitive financial companies are suffering from
higher rates. American Express Co., at 173 a share last year,
closed at 139 1/8, up 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   And retail companies are being hit by anticipation of a softer
economy and slower sales. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., for example, closed
at 48 3/16 up 7/16, from levels of more than 69 a share in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester Marquardt, research director for John Hancock Funds,
sees a ``significant change from the period of September to
November, when estimates of economic activity were still rising.''
</P>
<P>
   Although economists have not yet revised their growth forecasts,
``investors are acting as if the economy will slow.''
</P>
<P>
   The advent of an official correction has elicited a full range
of forecasts by experts about the future of the Dow _ and of the
red-hot Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point there has to be some profit-taking in these
things, but every time you throw in the towel, they go up,'' said a
trader at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``These stocks could turn up on a dime.
We have a little rational selling right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts for the Dow run the gamut, from fears a correction
could turn into a bear market to a belief that the index will again
recover, as it showed signs of doing Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's less there than meets the eye,'' said Larry Wachtel, a
market analyst for Prudential Securities Inc. in New York. The
simple reason the Dow came back Tuesday he said, was ``it got a
little oversold last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Primark predicted the markets will be up this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Minervini of Quantech Research Group in Connecticut is
not optimistic. He has put out memos to staff saying the Dow may
even be headed below 10,000 as cylical stocks suffer from the rate
increases and an outflow of money from Dow stocks to Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Minervini also said he believes the Nasdaq will not repeat its
86 percent rise of 1999 and could fall sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't count on the Nasdaq holding up this well forever,''
he said. With the Dow off so much, ``We think the Nasdaq is going
to play some catch-up.''

TAX GROUP SAYS `BIG DIG' SHORTFALL SHORT BY $1B 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL REZENDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A respected fiscal watchdog group delivered bad news
Tuesday to officials struggling to come up with $1.4 billion to
cover a ``Big Dig'' cost overrun: you need another billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation warned that the Central
Artery project, now pegged at $12.2 billion, could climb even
higher.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, a business-backed independent group, recommended
state officials agree to a plan to generate $2.5 billion. The group
suggested the state consider turning Interstate 93 into a toll
road, re-imposing fees on car registration, tapping this year's
budget surplus, and dedicating a portion of the gas tax to help
finance the project.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Widmer, president of the group, said it is essential the
state build in a cushion to guard against future funding shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems we have now is that we've had no
contingency plans and no margin for error,'' Widmer said. ``If
three years ago we'd put a contingency plan in place that dealt
with the inevitable cost overruns, things would be a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation by the MTF could complicate an already
challenging effort under way on Beacon Hill to come up with money
to solve the Big Dig cost crisis. It drew a frosty reaction from
Cellucci, who stood by Massachusetts Turnpike Authority's estimated
$1.4 billion cost overrun on the $12.2 billion project as a ``worst
case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran said legislators may
embrace a plan that would prepare now for cost overruns beyond the
$12.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to go about this by coming up with piecemeal
suggestions every six months,'' Finneran said. ``To come back in
another year to the taxpayers and motorists of Massachusetts and
say, `Oops, we missed it in the year 2000, this time we think we're
closer to the mark,' that doesn't add any credibility to the
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran said MTF is known for its ``credible and responsible
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the foundation's suggestion that drivers traveling on
Interstate 93 pay tolls would likely be a tough sell politically.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and the Legislature are under intense pressure to
devise a plan to find a way to cover the $1.4 billion overrun by
March 15. US Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater has threatened
to cut off future federal funds if the state fails to put forth a
credible plan.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven auditors from the Federal Highway Administration are
expected to arrive in Boston Thursday to examine the progress of
the project, scrutinize contract increases and determine whether
$12.2 billion is a realistic final price tag.
</P>
<P>
   They are expected to remain here for two weeks. The team is
expected to include Highway Administrator Ken Wykle, who will
return to Washington after a day; Deputy Highway Administrator
Walter Sutton, and representatives from the office of the Inspector
General of the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The audit was spurred by Turnpike Authority Chairman James J.
Kerasiotes' admission earlier this month that the cost of the Big
Dig would soar by $1.4 billion, despite earlier assurances that the
project was proceding ``on time and budget.'' Kerasiotes has been
criticizing for failing to tell the public last year _ when the
cost increases were discovered _ that the project could not be
completed for $10.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Widmer said because the state is enjoying strong
revenues and a robust economy now, it would be prudent to develop a
plan that could cover more than the $1.4 billion gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a manageable problem now,'' Widmer said, ``but if
we're faced with other problems like this two years from now in the
middle of an economic recession it becomes a crisis. Let's deal
with the problem now while we have the resources to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Widmer said the surplus for this fiscal year, expected to bet
between $200 million and $600 million, could be applied to the Big
Dig. In addition, he said, the state could borrow about $2 billion
by issuing bonds, then repay them with revenue from four separate
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The sources, Widmer said, could include 4 cents of the existing
21-cent state gasoline tax, which would raise $120 million
annually; the restoration of recently elminated auto registration
fees, raising $55 million; maintaining driver's license fees, as
Cellucci has proposed; raising $45 million; and new tolls directed
at drivers north and south of Boston, raising $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of agreeing to the larger sum, Widmer said, is
that local officials would be assured that other transportation
projects could proceed without the Big Dig interfering with their
projects or siphoning off funds they are anticipating.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci worried that pushing up the price tag to cover
additional, unforeseen costs might be an invitation to project
managers to spend more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not put more money on the table so that the people who
are building this thing can find other ways to spend it,'' Cellucci
said. ``Let's not try to create something that's not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, for his part, said he isn't prepared to say how much
state officials should be prepared to raise to cover Artery cost
overruns.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that some artery officials, including the top
management consultant overseeing the project, have said overruns
could exceed the current $1.4 billion gap.
</P>
<P>
   He also said legislative leaders, including Senate President
Thomas F. Birmingham, should be willing to consider an array of
revenue sources, including the gas tax, tolls, and auto
registration and license fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll consider anything at this point,'' Finneran said.

 &HT;    The race to the SEC title
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Winning the SEC regular-season championship guarantees
a team absolutely nothing in basketball's big picture _ the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But the title isn't meaningless to Kentucky coach Tubby Smith,
whose team is one of six still with a chance with two weeks left in
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the SEC championship and before the season started,
that was everyone's goal,'' said Smith, whose Wildcats (19-7, 9-3
SEC) play at Tennessee (21-4, 9-3) tonight in one of the key games
down the stretch. ``Winning the conference is always special. As
tough as the league has been this year, it will mean even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the SEC is split into divisions, the team with the
best record in either division is declared the regular-season
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose going to win this thing? It's anybody's guess,'' said
Florida coach Billy Donovan, whose team plays tonight at Georgia.
``But if I had to guess, it would be the team with the easiest road
schedule. It's been really tough to win on the road this season.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at the six SEC teams still in the race for the title, as
the end of the regular season draws near:
</P>
<P>
   _ Auburn: The Tigers appeared to be in trouble after an 83-68
loss at LSU on Feb. 9, but followed it up with an impressive 86-80
win at Vanderbilt. Beginning with Tuesday night's game at Alabama,
Auburn will play three of its last four games on the road. Games at
Florida on Sunday and at home next Wednesday with LSU will be
difficult. ``We're just going to try to be the same, no matter what
the circumstances are,'' coach Cliff Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida: The Gators, who lost a tough one in overtime (76-73)
at Tennessee on Feb. 12, must win tonight at Georgia and then get
ready for Sunday's nationally televised game with Auburn in
Gainesville. Depending on what happens this week, the March 4 trip
to Kentucky for the last regular-season game could loom large.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kentucky: After consecutive road losses at Florida (90-73) and
LSU (70-57), the Wildcats looked like they would sag down the
stretch. But if the Wildcats can win tonight in Thompson-Boling
Arena, they could be in position to win the championship when they
host Florida on Feb. 4. ``We know we've got our work cut out for us
because Tennessee is a tough place to play,'' Smith said. ``But I
still think we have a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   _ LSU: The Tigers have been the surprise team of the SEC. They
have won eight of their last nine, including a pair of victories
over Auburn and Kentucky. Three of LSU's final four games are
against noncontenders _ South Carolina, Mississippi State and Ole
Miss. The other, a March 1 trip to Auburn, could be critical.
``When you look at their schedule, I like their chances a lot,''
Alabama coach Mark Gottfried said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tennessee: Coach Jerry Green has made no secret of the fact
that he was not happy with his team's performance in Saturday's
85-72 loss at Vanderbilt. Green said Monday that his team had lost
patience and was shooting too fast at Vandy. The main offender was
guard Tony Harris, who was 1 of 14 from the field. The Vols must
correct that problem, Green said, tonight against Kentucky and in
the last three games, against Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vanderbilt: The Commodores' only shot is to win their final
four games against non-contenders and hope the others stumble. ``I
think you have to include Vandy in the mix,'' Auburn's Ellis said.
``The way this league has been going this year, anything can
happen.''

   GADZHIYEVO, Russia _ The citizens of this closed military city
that hides one of Russia's nuclear submarine bases above the Arctic
Circle are staging an extraordinary civic revolt, taking on the
navy they have long served in a referendum on whether the fleet can
put a nuclear waste dump just outside the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   On March 26, the day Russians vote for a new president, the
people of this city, whose population is an official secret, will
be engaged in a battle they feel far more intensely than the
lop-sided presidential contest that Acting President Vladimir Putin
is expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment is running high against the waste dump. Elsewhere in
post-Soviet Russia, unpaid shipyard workers have blocked roads and
even threatened to take ships hostage to draw attention to
grievances, but this seems to be the first time an entire town has
challenged the authority of the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most surprising, the revolt is being led by former
high-ranking submarine officers who openly distrust the navy's
ability to look out for their interests and protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of political and economic mudslides, Russians who
have built some basics of democracy but whose freedoms seem ever
tenuous _ threatened by corruption, lawlessness and economic decay
_ are acting as if this election is a referendum on what is
important in their lives, whether that is the war in Chechnya, the
future of economic reform, even whether there is too much sex on
television or, here in Gadzhiyevo, whether the navy can store
radioactive waste near a town without consulting its residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just know from our experience what can happen,'' said
Vladimir Musatyan, 53, who has served on both ballistic missile and
attack submarines over two decades. Speaking in an interview on a
deserted stretch of road north of Murmansk, he said, ``I can tell
you that when we are loading rockets into our submarines, somebody
always drops one.''
</P>
<P>
   His longtime colleague, Yevgeny Burakov, 58, could only agree.
``We are on a base where there are significantly more frightening
weapons than this radioactive waste,'' Burakov said. ``But those
weapons are for the defense of the country and this waste site has
nothing to do with protecting the country, and that is why it
should be placed as far away as possible from any populated area.''
</P>
<P>
   All across Russia, from the rocky fjords here on the edge of the
Barents Sea to smokestack urban centers and snowy plains in the
farm belt, the country's political parties are trying to mobilize
voters for the presidential contest _ a task made more difficult by
the still vivid memory of the tough, mudslinging campaign for
parliamentary elections in December.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to tell how much success the parties will have
in mobilizing their footsoldiers. But it is also hard to find a
Russian who does not have an opinion about what this election
represents.
</P>
<P>
   In the little town of Bolshaya Glushitsa near the Volga River,
Anna Chechenkova, 67, is voting for Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist
Party candidate for president, because there are too many
``cheats'' in government, and too much sex and too many commercials
on television.
</P>
<P>
   Many of her neighbors in the snow-covered village are leaning
toward voting for Putin, because he is young and energetic. But
some _ especially those with draft-age sons _ are nervous about his
war policy in Chechnya, even those who support his fight against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Others have a sense of dread about Putin's assertion that Russia
needs a ``dictatorship of law.'' They worry that the ``law'' part
of that equation might get overtaken by the ``dictatorship'' part
after he gets into office.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly one of the concerns of Boris Fursov, 58, a
retired military officer and engineer who spent his career building
infrastructure for the Soviet military in far off places like
Somalia. He lives in Samara, an industrial center on the Volga, and
says he is voting for the Yabloko Party candidate Grigory Yavlinsky
because he best embodies the democratic principles of the late
Andrei Sakharov.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in Russia's Northwest and in the Volga River
industrial region around Samara, voters and party workers expressed
strong views that Putin's lock on the election might not be as
strong as his advisers think, or as the polls reflect. Many people
seemed to be searching for the best means to influence Putin's
policies by orchestrating a strong turnout for opposition
candidates, and the ideologies they represent.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason the popular and strongly reformist governor of
the Samara region, Konstantin Titov, is running as a maverick
candidate for president, hoping that a strong showing by a
pro-democracy, market-oriented regional leader will force Putin to
ally himself with the more progressive voices promoting a
capitalist, democratic model for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to consolidate the true democratic forces in society,''
said Titov in an interview, adding that if Putin announces
progressive policies, the governor might yet line up behind the
acting president. ``If Putin conducts a policy of reform, why
shouldn't I support him? I am not simply looking for a
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Titov, too, sees the election as a kind of referendum, one that
can be used to shape Putin himself, who continues to withhold any
detailed description of the course that he would chart for Russia
after being elected.
</P>
<P>
   But among others, the sense of inevitability is overpowering,
underscored by Putin's own maneuvering to cultivate better ties
with the West _ officially repairing relations with NATO and
reaching agreement with some of Russia's foreign creditors _ and to
proceed in Chechnya, even if that means virtually obliterating
Grozny and riding roughshod on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can compare Putin to a cannonball that was fired on Dec.
31,'' the day Boris Yeltsin resigned, said Vladimir Shaganov,
editor of the Evening Murmansk, a daily newspaper for the largest
city above the Arctic Circle. ``And this cannonball is going to
land in the president's seat on March 26. Everyone understands
this, despite some politicians who have wind blowing in their
heads.''

   BOSTON _ W.R. Grace Co. was hit with three class-action lawsuits
Tuesday, one filed in Boston on behalf of homeowners nationwide who
have asbestos-tainted Zonolite Attic Insulation in their homes, and
the other two in Montana, where the company operated a mine and
mill.

<P>
   The suit filed in US District Court in Boston by Edward M.
Lindholm accuses Grace of fraud, deception and enriching itself at
homeowners' expense for failing to warn the public that the
Zonolite insulation it sold from 1963 through 1984 contained
tremolite asbestos. Grace's Cambridge, Mass. Costruction Products
Division oversaw its Attic Insulation line.

where Grace operated a mine and mill until 1990, and damages for
all residents exposed to tremolite asbestos. Grace got its
vermiculite, the mineral that was the main ingredient in its Attic
Insulation, from its Libby mine. Asbestos was naturally occurring
in the Libby vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is asbestos contamination in settled dust throughout
Libby in homes and areas outside,'' said Edward Westbrook, a
Charlestown, S.C., attorney with one of the five firms that filed
the Montana cases.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Attorney Kenneth Gilman, who represents Lindholm and
filed the suit in US District Court in Boston, is urging a judge to
order Grace to notify homeowners of the dangers of living with
Zonolite in their houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``All class members should be given an opportunity to inspect
repair and remove Zonolite and to attempt to prevent personal
injury,'' the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gilman nor Lindholm, who is described only as the owner
of a home in Essex County, could be reached Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is seeking punitive and compensatory damages from Grace
and wants the company to foot the bill for Zonolite removal and
attorneys fees for Lindholm and other homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   William Corcoran, a spokesman for Grace, said, ``We believe our
Attic Insulation is a safe product and the lawsuit is without
merit. We've been very open with the governmental agencies and with
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported last week that Zonolite, a type of loose-fill
insulation, contains asbestos, but Grace officials fought to keep
warning labels off the product.
</P>
<P>
   Grace, which discontinued its Attic Insulation in 1984, knew as
far back as 1963 about the asbestos, but feared public disclosure
would hurt sales, according to memos from high-ranking Grace
officials.
</P>
<P>
   An internal Grace memo dated May 24, 1977 and obtained by the
Globe, revealed that the company was concerned by an in-house study
that revealed mortality rates were five times the national rate
among ex-employees at the Libby plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the memo reaffirmed Grace's opposition to warning labels on
Zonolite, saying, ``We believe that a decision to affix asbestos
warning labels to our products would result in substantial sales
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   W.R. Grace, today worth $1.5 billion, has paid out $1 billion as
a result of asbestos claims and expects to pay $1 billion more,
according to Corcoran. Many of Grace's claims are due to its past
manufacture of Monokote Fireproofing, a spray insulation that
contained asbestos.

 &HT;    Fernbank scientist marvels at Giganotosaurus
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLAZA HUINCUL, Argentina _ Gazing up at the biggest meat-eating
dinosaur skeleton ever assembled, Christine Bean, a petite
scientist from Atlanta's Fernbank Museum of Natural History, was
awestruck, almost speechless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, wow! That's so cool,'' Bean whispered.
</P>
<P>
   She was gaping at an artificial cast of a Giganotosaurus at the
Museum Municipal de Carman Funes. She had come to this tiny museum
in this remote, windswept region of western Argentina to help
figure out how to squeeze a skeleton like this one, and that of the
even larger, plant-eating Argentinosaurus, into the Fernbank's
now-empty Great Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we have plenty of room,'' she quipped.
</P>
<P>
   She'd also come to learn more about the dinos, whose fossilized
bones were discovered near here, and to hear about a remarkable new
discovery: fossils from a ``herd'' of giant meat-eaters. It appears
the new dinosaurs were part of a social group _ which contradicts
conventional wisdom about how the carnivores behaved.
</P>
<P>
   First for Bean was the gee-whiz reaction, which Fernbank
visitors are likely to share. Reaching up to touch the
Giganotosaurus skeleton, she remarked: ``My whole body could fit
inside its mouth! The head is gigantic, just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   She was just as startled upon entering an adjacent room, where a
dozen 2-ton vertebrae of the Argentinosaurus lay stretched out.
Longer than four school buses, the huge plant-eater weighed 100
tons. If the Fernbank's skeleton were posed on its hind legs as if
it were eating leaves out of the tops of ancient conifer trees, its
head would jut through the ceiling of the 72-foot-high Great Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just unbelievable!'' exclaimed Marissa Vivona, a public
relations staffer from Fernbank, who made the journey with Bean.
</P>
<P>
   The fossils of both dinosaurs will be cast in fiberglass-like
material, and the casts will be shipped to Atlanta, where they will
be assembled. (Almost all big dino-skeleton displays are casts,
rather than actual fossils. Large fossils are impractical to mount
due to their weight and the potential for damage.) ``People will
have a chance to walk under and around these great animals,'' Bean
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fossilized bones that will be used for the Fernbank
casts are housed at the Museum Municipal de Carman Funes. The
museum's sun-baked curator, world-famous paleontologist Rodolfo
Coria, discovered both the Giganotosaurus and the Argentinosaurus
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Bean and Coria _ along with Philip Currie, a paleontologist with
the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Canada, and Don Lessem, head of the
company producing the reconstructions _ are trying to settle on a
design for the Fernbank that will depict what happened in real life
_ a hungry Giganotosaurus chasing the bigger plant-eater. Coria
speculates the Giganotosaurus, which had teeth like steak knives,
would jump repeatedly onto the Argentinosaurus, chewing, slashing
and bleeding it to death.
</P>
<P>
   The Fernbank's Giganotosaurus cast is due to be displayed by
June. Fossils of the Argentinosaurus are still being excavated, so
its skeleton won't be on exhibit until December.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Coria and Currie announced a discovery that will
likely shake up the world's dinosaur experts. Paleontologists in
Argentina have found the fossil bones of a new, yet-unnamed species
of meat eater, which is even bigger than the Giganotosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   The find suggests that giant meat eaters, including the famous
Tyrannosaurus Rex of ``Jurassic Park'' fame, weren't as dumb as
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists stumbled upon a rare ``herd'' of the new species
of meat eaters. The group appears to have been a hunting pack, and
it may have been a family, Currie said.
</P>
<P>
   The dinosaurs perished together, probably in a flash flood,
Currie said. ``Some were large adults and some were babies,'' he
said. The discovery indicates there may have been some sort of
family life among the great meat eaters, Currie said.
</P>
<P>
   Until this and similar recent finds, meat-eating dinosaurs had
been considered solitary creatures not capable of much social
interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted at the University of Maryland, paleontologist Thomas
Holtz, one of the world's top experts on meat-eating dinos, said
the discovery of the fossil herd was ``very exciting and
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stunning,'' Holtz said. ``By working as a team, these
predators would be able to eat even a giant plant eater.''
</P>
<P>
   Digs have revealed the fossilized bones of at least seven of the
meat eaters, and possibly a dozen or more. Some of the fossils have
been brought to Coria's museum here.
</P>
<P>
   After their announcement, Coria and Currie headed back to the
plains of western Patagonia late Tuesday to look for more fossils
and to show Bean where the Fernbank's Giganotosaurus and
Argentinosaurus had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Bean toured the museum, taking photographs and videotapes of the
bones. She'll use those in the classes she teaches to thousands of
Atlanta-area schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that these gigantic dinosaur skeletons will fuel
the imagination of kids and adults alike,'' she said. ``It will be
a heart-pounding, awesome experience.''

 &HT;    Sweet replay for Holyfield
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield gets his ear
gnawed on again, this time in the new Sports Illustrated swimsuit
edition that hits newsstands today. His new assailant, however, is
far more attractive than Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   In one photograph, the ex-champ is shown sparring with
supermodel Heidi Klum, and in another shot Klum re-enacts a scene
from the infamous Tyson bout by clamping her teeth on Holyfield's
earlobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caught me by surprise when Heidi bit my ear,'' Holyfield
says, ``but I didn't mind when I remembered that the last time
someone did that, I got $35 million.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Holyfield and the usual bevy of bathing beauties
such as cover model Daniela Pestova, Sports Illustrated ($5.99)
includes photos of Ben Crenshaw, Jason Kidd and other famous
athletes with their spouses, most of them in swimsuits.
</P>
<P>
   And, if some of the photos appear a little out of focus, don't
panic. There's nothing wrong with your eyes. You just need to slip
on the special 3-D glasses that are included for perusing the
magazine's first-ever three-dimensional section.
</P>
<P>
   The cardboard-and-plastic specs also can be worn to watch the
``Sports Illustrated Swimsuit 2000'' special airing at 8 p.m.
Saturday on TNT.

 GADZHIYEVO, Russia: their heads.''

   And the Kremlin is using all of its muscle to reinforce Putin's
``positives.'' Shaganov says he was offered a handsome political
payoff from the Putin organization if he agreed to publish a series
of articles that would help create a favorable image of Putin in
Russia's Northwestern region _ an offer hastily withdrawn when the
Putin people realized they already had a great deal of regional
press loyalty and did not need to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Putin headquarters invited the Murmansk newspaper
to send one of its columnists to Moscow for an ``exclusive
interview'' with Putin along with other regional newspaper
columnists.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   So many Russians have lost faith in the ability of the central
government to solve the country's problems that nearly 2 million
Russian voters marked ``none of the above'' on their ballots in the
December parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``none of the above'' dramatically out-polled 20 of the
26 parties listed on the ballot. Now, campaign organizers are at a
loss over how best to approach a testy and mercurial electorate. In
Murmansk, Yabloko leader Igor Lebedev said people in the Northwest
are ``tired'' of politics and don't even read national newspapers
anymore, either because they cost too much or people are just fed
up with Moscow.
</P>
<P>

   Titov, the Samara governor, thinks people are tired of the same
old opposition candidates. ``Zyuganov and Yavlinsky have been
around a long time,'' he said. ``Newer faces should appear, or
people will get sick of going to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Bolshaya Glushitsa, party workers like Liliya
Murza, 32, who runs the local children's center and who built an
eight-member team to campaign door-to-door last fall for the
reform-oriented Union of Right Forces party, say they have no time
to do it again for the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Energizing voters who struggle to make ends meet can also be a
daunting task. And yet, there are exceptions, like 77-year-old
Konstantin Mokshin, a feisty beekeeper who sells honey in the local
market. He shocked the whole town with his bold financial
intervention into last fall's campaign. Mokshin stands on one good
leg like a soldier for the local Communist Party committee and he
shares his house with Anna Chechenkova.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of the ferocious Battle of Stalingrad in World War II,
he was disabled by the bullet that took his left leg shortly after.
The couple was not happy with the era of Boris Yeltsin, not just
because there is a lot of sex on television _ a particular peeve
shared by many used to the public puritanism of Soviet times _ but
really because they haven't seen a leader they admired since the
days of Roosevelt and Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the local school, they used to hang pictures of the heroes
of the Great Patriotic War,'' Mokshin said, gesturing with still
powerful hands over a dinner table laid with homemade butter, fresh
baked bread and honey from the hives stored under the house for
winter. ``My picture was among those at the school,'' he says.
``Now they have pulled them all down. They don't respect the heroes
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechenkova, alluding to the blatant corruption of the Yeltsin
era, said: ``I heard in other countries when people do something
wrong in office, they resign and go away. But here they stay in
office and just keep stealing.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Mokshin got so enthusiastic about the local Communist
candidate for parliament that he marched down to the village bank
and withdrew most of his life savings, the equivalent of about
$425, and donated it to the man to help him fight the ``cheaters''
and ``crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   The teller at the bank thought Mokshin had gone crazy _ and said
so _ and then talked him into withdrawing only two-thirds of his
money. And though his life savings is now less than $200, a sum he
and Chechenkova would like to hold on to, Mokshin seems likely to
impulsively throw his money behind the Communists once more. ``I am
going to vote for Zyuganov,'' he declared, ``because he is trying
to protect ordinary people.'' Putin, he adds scornfully, ``is just
``the lowest card from Yeltsin's deck.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gadzhiyevo, the retired submarine officers who have mobilized
the city against the navy, Musatyan and Burakov, are the only two
Communist Party members of the nine-member city council, where the
referendum on the radioactive waste dump has majority support.
</P>
<P>
   The navy has not disclosed how large the dump site would be, or
how many of the 100 nuclear submarines presently mothballed in the
fleet might end up there waiting, perhaps for decades, for
decommissioning and final disposal of the highly radioactive spent
fuel inside their reactors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are an American, would you allow a radioactive burial site
in your town?'' Burakov asked a foreign visitor.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the glory days of the Soviet fleet, Musatyan and Burakov were
no ordinary officers aboard the nuclear submarines that sailed _
and still sail _ from here. They were Zampolit officers, or
political commissars, in charge of maintaining strict Communist
Party discipline among the crews, whose task it might be to fire
nuclear warheads against U.S. cities or military targets.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of nuclear war, they were said to share the
responsibility with the captain to authorize the launch of the
nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles from the steel tubes welded into
the belly of the Soviet ``boomers.''
</P>
<P>
   In taking on the navy, the city elders have taken some risks, as
was evident when an officer of the Federal Security Service
unsuccessfully sought to prevent a meeting between city council
members and a foreign reporter to discuss the referendum outside
the city gates.
</P>
<P>
   The security officer declared that not only was the city closed
to foreigners, but the road leading to it from Murmansk, the
provincial capital, was also closed. As a result, the former
submarine officers and several of their supporters drove five miles
outside the city and stopped along an empty stretch of highway
where they explained their opposition to the navy's plans in a
roadside interview.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I have heard of people from the naval
community actually challenging the fleet,'' said Thomas Nilsen, a
senior researcher with the Bellona Foundation in Norway, an
environmental group that is now working with Russia to solve
nuclear waste problems. ``The whole history of the last decade has
been that the people living in these closed cities just take orders
from the navy,'' he continued. ``I think this is extremely
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear whether the navy will pay attention to the
March 26 referendum, but the civilian challenge has already forced
provincial leaders in Murmansk to organize the first environmental
impact studies on the proposed radioactive storage site.
</P>
<P>
   As Communists, Musatyan and Burakov see no irony in the
democratic tactics they have employed to rally the voters here.
Indeed, their remarks convey a sense of dragging communism back to
its activist roots, before power ossified both the ideology and
many of those who professed to act in its name. ``Do you think that
Communists don't care about people?'' Musatyan asked. ``We are
Communists,'' added Burakov. ``In fact, I am the secretary of the
local Communist Party committee, but we are not doing this because
we are Communists, we are doing it because it is the best thing for
the future of our town.''

EVOKING CLINTON, BRADLEY BRANDS GORE A FOLLOWER, NOT A LEADER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ In a nod to President Clinton's continuing
popularity among Democratic voters, former Sen. Bill Bradley
asserted Tuesday that Vice President Al Gore had adopted many core
Democratic principles only after becoming Clinton's ``No. 2,'' and
he suggested that the vice president could not be counted on to
defend those principles on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has criticized Clinton's ethics in the past, the
former senator from New Jersey twice wrapped himself in the
president's mantle Tuesday, saying that he and Clinton shared
common views on universal health care, and contending that Gore had
forsaken that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was running for vice president in 1992, he took Bill
Clinton's views on health care and said we needed health insurance
for everyone,'' Bradley told more than 250 people here at Adelphi
University. ``Now that he's on his own running for president, he
says health insurance for all Americans is too expensive and we
can't do it, even though we have a giant budget surplus and 8
million more uninsured than seven years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley went on to argue that in 1993 Clinton supported
replacing Medicaid, the government health care program for the
poor, with a new program that was similar to what Bradley has
called for in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bill Clinton wanted to reform Medicaid to end the
two-tiered system in our country, Al Gore supported it,'' Bradley
said. ``Now that he's running for president, he attacks me for
wanting to do the same thing that Bill Clinton wanted to do, and
that he used to support.''
</P>
<P>
   In evoking Clinton Tuesday, Bradley _ who is trailing Gore by
double digits in public opinion polls in most states _ was trying
to show that Gore was a follower and not a leader in the Clinton
administration, his aides said. Bradley sought to underscore that
theme by calling Gore ``a loyal No. 2.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley also seemed intent on trying to separate Gore
somewhat from Clinton, who remains very popular among voters in
Democratic primaries. A CBS-New York Times poll conducted last
week, for example, found that 70 percent of Democratic voters view
Clinton favorably.
</P>
<P>
   And by mentioning the president twice _ he usually does not
mention Clinton at all in his speeches _ Bradley wanted to show
that he strongly supported some of the president's major
initiatives, Bradley's aides said.
</P>
<P>
   That acknowledgment represents a subtle shift for Bradley, whose
campaign was once strongly premised on the idea that Democrats
would be ready to throw Gore out of office because of weariness
with the Democrats' fund-raising abuses in 1996 and questions about
Clinton's ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying desperately to create phony distinctions, because
he loses when voters focus on the real differences in this
campaign,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore. ``He's
repackaged the same old line of attack he has used since losing
Iowa and New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming just two weeks before the March 7 ``Super Tuesday''
primaries, Bradley's 20-minute speech Tuesday was one of his most
forceful and clearly articulated explanations yet for why Democrats
should choose him over a sitting vice president when the nation, by
many measures, is in very good health.
</P>
<P>
   It also picked up on a theme he began sounding during the
Democrats' debate in Harlem on Monday night, when Bradley asserted
that Gore was a conservative congressman and senator whose views
turned left when he joined the administration in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   By having shifted ground on abortion, gun control, tobacco
regulations, health care and other issues, Gore had showed himself
to have no clear ideological core, Bradley said. ``What does he
really believe?'' the former senator asked, repeating the question
later for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   But Hattaway said, ``Senator Bradley knows very well that Al
Gore is pro-choice and supports gun control.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bradley, who has been criticized by some Democrats for having a
low-keyed stump style, also urged voters not to be taken in by
Gore's more forceful manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strength is not about shouting or pounding a table, it's about
knowing what you believe and acting on those beliefs no matter what
those around you are doing,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not flashy,'' he added. ``Never have been, either on the
floor of Madison Square Garden or in the United States Senate. My
passion for these things is deep in my heart. And it's deep in my
soul. I show them not by shouting or making a fist, but by the
consistency of my beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech Tuesday, Bradley stopped in the Astoria
section of Queens, where he shook hands with voters and dropped by
a Greek delicatessen where he ate feta cheese and baklava, bought a
spinach-and-cheese pie and did his version of a Greek folk dance
for the amused clientele.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bradley will give a speech on economics at
Columbia University before flying to Washington state, where he
intends to spend almost all of the week campaigning in preparation
for its nonbinding primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is staking much time and money on Washington, hoping to
jump-start his struggling campaign for the stretch run to March 7,
when 16 states will hold primaries or caucuses that will select
nearly a third of the Democratic delegates.
</P>
<P>
   His plan to focus on Washington poses something of a gamble,
since it will reduce the time he spends in the major states that
vote on March 7, including California, New York and Ohio. But
Bradley's advisers say they believe he needs some kind of public
relations victory to build momentum before the March 7 contests.

   Saying public schools are plagued by ``an old agrarian schedule,
an outdated factory model and an antiquated wage system,''
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley proposed Tuesday that teachers
work year-round to boost their pay and their status.
</P>
<P>
   In his seventh annual address on the state of American
education, Riley also called for a review of the standards movement
that has swept the nation over the past decade, suggesting that
states use a range of assessments rather than a single
multiple-choice test, and that high achievement goals required for
promotion or graduation be phased in slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers need extra time for professional development to master
the ambitious new standards and integrate technology into the
curriculum, Riley said in proposing the extended calendar. He said
he would leave it up to school districts and states to decide
whether students should spend additional days in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never really improve American education until we
elevate the teaching profession and come to grips with the issue of
teacher compensation,'' Riley told a crowd of 1,500, mostly adults
in suits, packed into a high school gymnasium in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that experienced teachers with master's degrees earn an
average of $32,000 a year less than their counterparts in other
fields, he called for a ``dramatic overhaul of how we recruit,
prepare, induct and retain good teachers,'' adding that, ``With
knowledge all around us, available anytime and anywhere, the role
of the teacher is going to be fundamentally transformed in the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   In an hour-long speech that touched on many policies outside his
purview, from paid maternity leave to gun control, the secretary
named the persistent achievement gap between white and minority
students as one of the nation's profound problems, and worried that
a ``growing digital divide'' is widening the gulf. He renewed his
call for universal preschool, urging parents to read daily to their
babies. He reiterated his position that vouchers, publicly funded
coupons that students can take to private schools, ``are simply a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   His boldest proposal, to extend teachers' calendars, was hailed
by the nation's two teachers unions as a long overdue remedy for
two of their chief complaints _ low salaries and lack of time for
professional development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demands are such that we need more time than you can fit
in the normal school year,'' said Donna Fowler, a spokeswoman for
the American Federation of Teachers. Asked whether it might deter
people attracted by teaching's schedule, Fowler said many teachers
take second jobs because they cannot afford summers off. ``I'm sure
they would rather spend that time doing what they do during the
year and getting paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley's comments on standards were more vague. He declared
himself a supporter of high-stakes tests, yet said states should
``incorporate multiple ways of measuring learning,'' including
portfolios of student work. He said it is ``far better to ratchet
up standards a step at a time than to try to make one huge leap all
at once.'' He added that ``promotion standards must be phased in
sensibly, not rushed,'' a nod to the backlash against the new
emphasis on testing in several states where hundreds of thousands
of students are facing failure.
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Schwartz, president of Achieve, a nonprofit group
monitoring the standards movement, said it is difficult to quibble
with the suggestion for review, but that the 50 states cannot all
be helped with the same remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``While on the one hand you may have places that seem to be
marching rapidly to the edge of the cliff at breakneck speed,
you've got other places that are proceeding pretty carefully, and
other places that have barely started,'' he said. ``It's hard to
make a general statement that everybody needs to stop where they
are and have a mid-course correction.''
</P>
<P>
   Chester E. Finn Jr., a leading conservative on education, said
Riley ``would have done standards-based reform more good if he had
advised state officials to be steadfast and resolute and to
persevere and not be deterred by the forces of resistance to
accountability and standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, one of three Clinton Cabinet members to have survived
from the first days of the administration, initiated the annual
education speech. Tuesday, he was welcomed to Souther High School
by a chorus of teen-agers in glittery silver vests singing, ``I
believe I can fly,'' but most students watched the speech on
television from their classrooms, as the gym was filled with
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Each year at his speech, Riley has held up a photograph of one
of his newly born grandchildren, effectively dedicating his speech
to students of the future. The tradition remained unbroken, thanks
to the birth this weekend in Sacramento, Calif., of William Daniel
Riley, who weighed 8 pounds, 9 ounces.

SEC SEEKS EARNINGS STATEMENT FACTS, RAYTHEON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. said federal regulators are questioning its recent
earnings restatements.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission late
Tuesday, the Lexington, Mass. defense contractor said it received
``an informal inquiry'' from the SEC's Division of Enforcement
following Raytheon's announcement last month that it planned to
restate financial results back to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Such requests by the agency are considered less intrusive than
formal investigations, which involve subpoena powers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the probe adds more uncertainty to the financial outlook
for Raytheon, whose shares have fallen severely in recent months as
it has reduced its profit outlook and warned of slowing sales
overseas. In response the company has begun another restructuring
program that includes hundreds of local layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Of interest to the SEC are restated results at Raytheon's
Wichita, Kan. aircraft division, which once booked revenue on some
planes after manufacturing was complete and titles passed to
customers. Under new accounting rules adopted by the SEC in
December, Raytheon said, it now recognizes revenue only after
planes are delivered.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing, Raytheon said it is ``in the process of
responding to this inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman David Polk declined to describe the SEC's
specific interests. ``The SEC customarily makes inquiries whenever
a company restates its financial results, so we're not surprised''
by the current action, Polk said.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also provide certain documents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a spokesman for the commission declined to
discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon disclosed the inquiry as part of an amended filing to
sell up to $3 billion worth of securities, which it said may
include debt, warrants, or preferred stock. The registration dates
to last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Raytheon said its Engineering and Construction unit
received a contract to provide management services for the
expansion of two optical-fiber manufacturing plants in North
Carolina, though it didn't disclose terms.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also said it has reached agreements to sell the South
Korean Navy a guided missile system to help defend a new class of
destroyers. Terms also were not disclosed.

DEBATE AT THE APOLLO RAISED SOME OLD ISSUES FOR BRADLEY AND GORE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Did not! Did so!
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only players who came out ahead in Monday night's
fractious Democratic debate were the opposition research teams for
the Gore and Bradley campaigns, gnomes who puzzle over 20-year-old
votes and speeches that drew only minimal attention when they were
given.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, though, Bill Bradley was right on Monday night
at the Apollo Theater when he said that Al Gore voted to curb
Internal Revenue Service efforts to develop rules that would end
tax exemptions for segregated private schools.
</P>
<P>
   And the vice president was right when he said that Bradley voted
to end a tax break that encouraged minority purchases of
broadcasting stations.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest charges that Gore and the former senator from New
Jersey leveled in Monday night's Democratic presidential debate in
New York turn out to be completely accurate. But the conclusions
that Gore and Bradley drew about what these old votes reveal about
their opponent's commitment to racial justice may have been
strained.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Bradley said Gore ``voted five times over
three years for a tax exemption for schools to discriminate on the
basis of race,'' he was drawing the worst possible conclusion about
his opponent's votes. The Gore campaign issued a statement on
Tuesday saying that the votes only concerned stopping the IRS from
taking a broad, rather than a case-by-case, approach, and that Gore
was trying to protect ``legitimate, nondiscriminating religious
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   That was an expansion of the vice president's claim, defending
his challenged votes from 1979, 1980 and 1981, that all he was
doing was opposing ``quotas.'' He said they had been against
quotas, the traditional attack against affirmative action programs
of all sorts. He was straining, using the argument offered by the
most conservative proponents of the restriction.
</P>
<P>
   On five occasions Gore voted for measures intended to keep the
revenue agency and the courts from developing rules and procedures
to enforce a Nixon-era prohibition on tax exemptions for the
segregation academies that sprung up in the South after the Supreme
Court outlawed segregated pubic schools. None of them simply
directed the IRS not to use numerical quotas. They prohibited any
new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's allies said the IRS wanted to impose racial quotas on
private schools, which until then could qualify for tax-exemption
if they simply stated they were not discriminating.
(Time-consuming, difficult cases could be built against schools
that were obviously lying.)
</P>
<P>
   Numerical yardsticks were indeed one of several ways a school
could defend itself, but there were others, like hiring minority
teachers or running joint programs with integrated schools.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps learning from Gore's mistake, Bradley offered no
explanation at all for his 1995 vote _ unique among Finance
Committee Democrats _ to make the repeal of the provision on
minority ownership retroactive and thereby block a pending $2.3
billion sale by Viacom to minority interests that depended on the
tax break to work. On Tuesday his spokesman, Eric Hauser, said
Bradley had felt ``This was not the most efficient way to help
minority broadcasters.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Viacom deal had given the minority preference a bad
odor, and when Newt Gingrich's new House majority seized on the
issue as an example of the failure of affirmative action,
relatively few white Democrats stood up to fight to preserve the
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The issue had been debated harshly in the House. One Democratic
representative, Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who is now energy
secretary, called the measure ``the opening salvo of the Contract
with America's war on minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, like Rep. Henry Bonilla of Texas, scorned Democrats
for ``using the race card.'' The bill passed in the House with only
44 no votes, after a compromise effort had been defeated, 234-191.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate Finance Committee, Carol Mosely Braun of Illinois
fought hardest to preserve the tax benefit, first generally and
then for Viacom.
</P>
<P>
   The savings from ending the program, however, were transferred
to a popular program to extend tax deductions to self-employed
individuals who buy health insurance. And when the bill came to the
floor, the health insurance provision dominated the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that he thought the minority broadcast provision
``is not appropriate tax policy.'' He said ``I have consistently
opposed the special interest loopholes.'' But he said he was
unhappy ``that the issue of affirmative action has been interjected
into this underlying issue'' of tax deductions for health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore said nothing on the House floor, and little on Monday
night, about the IRS measures which all passed by overwhelming
votes, he did offer a comment on gun control that could be a useful
standard for talking about old votes.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by CNN after the debate, he was asked about
Bradley's claim that the vide president had altered his views on
gun control so often that it was hard to believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore confessed to changing his mind, saying he saw the gun
problem differently when he represented Tennessee with all its
urban areas in the Senate than when he represented a rural House
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that all of us grow and learn as we encounter people
who have real experiences in life. And, you know, theory collides
with reality and you begin to see better solutions for problems.
So, sure, I've changed my mind on some things and I think it's a
good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's apparently easier to admit to changed views on guns
than on race.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Unilever PLC, the world's leading maker of consumer
goods that include supermarket mainstays like Dove soap, Ragu
spaghetti sauce and Lipton tea, said Tuesday it would embark on a
severe corporate cutback plans, eliminating 25,000 jobs over five
years, closing 100 factories and possibly jettisoning up to 75
percent of its products.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, surprising in
its severity and scope, reflected a growing trend by European
companies to emulate the cutbacks made by big U.S. companies like
General Motors, IBM and AT&AMP;T in the 1990s to become more efficient
and more profitable. Company officials announced the restructuring
plan as Unilever reported profits last year fell 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe hasn't gone through the mega-downsizings we've seen in
the United States,'' said John Challenger, chief executive officer
of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, a Chicago-based job-placement
company that tracks U.S. layoff trends. The Europeans, Challenger
said, ``are kind of following the same path as we move into the
global marketplace. They've got to compete against U.S. companies
that have made these changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Unilever job cuts amount to 10 percent of the company's
global work force, and the cost of the cuts in employment and
factory closings will total $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the job reductions will be made in Europe and North and
South America, but company officials declined to specify how many
would come from layoffs and which countries would be most affected.
Also left unclear was what specific brands might be sold or
discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   In absolute terms, the job cuts rank among the biggest by a
European company, though they are by no means the biggest ever.
Former state-owned monopolies like British Telecommunications and
Deutsche Telekom of Germany cut far more jobs after they were
privatized, for example. Some leading European banks have also cut
many thousands of overlapping jobs after mergers.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain in particular, job losses have become synonymous with
restructuring in sectors from oil to insurance to utilities. In the
past year, companies from BP Amoco to Barclays PLC have announced
payroll cuts amounting to 10 percent of their work forces and the
trend has seeped slowly into Continental nations, like Germany and
France, where reducing staff is both more difficult and more
expensive. Even Deutsche Bank AG has broken its staid mold with a
program of job cuts since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said that the pressures on Unilever are
broader, reflecting a global duel with more profitable rivals _
most notably Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., the biggest household products
manufacturer in the United States _ in markets as disparate as
continental Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Unilever, we have to appreciate that this is a global
company,'' said Susanne Seibel, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
in London. ``And it's competing against global peers.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the restructuring, Unilever said, was to use the
savings gained to sharpen the marketing of the top 400 among its
1,600 brands _ leaving less profitable product lines to be
reorganized, discontinued or sold off.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever officials had said last year they wanted to winnow the
company's lineup of brands, but the announcement Tuesday showed how
Unilever intends to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program is all about accelerating the rate of growth at
Unilever,'' said Antony Burgmans, Unilever's co-chairman. The
changes, he said, would ``dramatically improve our ability to
market our leading brands.''
</P>
<P>
   The Unilever name is not widely recognized by consumers, but it
is the corporate parent behind a vast array of everyday beauty,
home-care and food staples. Some of the best-known products include
Wish-Bone salad dressings, Imperial margarine, Good Humor ice
cream, Wisk detergent, Vaseline skin lotion, Q-tips cotton swabs,
Brut deodorant, Suave shampoo, and Calvin Klein and Elizabeth Arden
fragrances.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Unilever is playing catch-up with P&AMP;G and Danone SA
of France, which both have higher profit margins. The quest for
investor returns has been all the more cutthroat as markets have
generally been leery of food and consumer-goods stocks, preferring
high-growth sectors like telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Unilever's stock declined by 35 percent and
underperformed European rivals by 50 percent, while shares of P&AMP;G,
which itself began a program to cut 15,000 jobs last June, has
generally held steady.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement cheered investors somewhat. In Amsterdam,
Unilever shares rose 3.6 percent, to 47.66 euros, or about $47.66.
In London, the shares rose 1.3 percent to 391 pence, or about
$6.25. Unilever's U.S. depositary receipts rose $1 to $25.75.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its measures would deliver annual savings of
$1.5 billion by 2004, which would largely be invested in enhancing
top brands, including Elizabeth Arden cosmetics and fragrances.
</P>
<P>
   Of its 380 manufacturing sites, Unilever said it will focus
investment on 150 principal plants, closing 100 and leaving the
other 130 as support units.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will probably be about 100 sites surplus to requirements
which we will dispose of,'' said Niall Fitzgerald, the company's
other co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Unilever's weaker profits, rivals have posted
rising earnings. P&AMP;G has said its profits rose by 11 percent in the
fourth quarter of last year. And P&AMP;G's operating margins grew to
16.4 percent last year, compared to 11.1 percent at Unilever. And
Danone said its profits in the second half of 1999 were up by 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement was taken by some analysts as a further
sign of a shifting corporate culture at Unilever, once viewed as a
slow-moving dinosaur with little appetite for radical change. The
shift reflects the ambitions of a new management, which has said it
is committed to a leaner organization focused on a tighter product
range.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two co-chairmen, Fitzgerald took over the top slot in
Britain in 1996 and accelerated the streamlining of its British
operations. Burgman's arrival last year as the Dutch co-chairman
led to the decision to focus on the top 400 brands.
</P>
<P>
   Burgmans said that the thrust of investment in top brands would
be in North and South America. By contrast, a European bakery
division will be sold off if it fails to grow faster this year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, though, remained skeptical about the impact of
the changes. ``It remains to be seen if it's enough,'' Riet Vijgen,
a Belgian analyst, said.

HASBRO PLANS JFK ACTION FIGURE TO JOIN GI JOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Action figure GI Joe could soon have a new comrade in arms _
former president and war hero John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to what may be an unprecedented agreement between the
Kennedy Library Foundation and toymaker Hasbro Inc., consumers
willing to pay $30 may be able to buy an action figure of JFK in
PT-109 fatigues this fall.
</P>
<P>
   On display at last week's American International Toy Fair in New
York, the planned JFK action figure is part of a GI Joe collector's
series that celebrates American military heroes and famous battles.
</P>
<P>
   The JFK figure ``will be the first of a number of Kennedy
products'' that will be made under an agreement between the Kennedy
Library Foundation and Hasbro, the maker of GI Joe, said Hasbro
spokesman Wayne Charness.
</P>
<P>
   Charness declined to elaborate on what those products might be,
but Tom McNaught, a Kennedy Library Foundation spokesman, said one
action figure under discussion might have JFK resplendent in a
naval officer's dress whites.
</P>
<P>
   In the PT-109 edition, the Kennedy figure wears fatigues as he
uses a knife to carve a message into a coconut shell. The figure
reenacts a scene from World War II that Kennedy made famous in his
political campaigns. After their boat was sunk by a Japanese
warship, Kennedy and his crew swam to the safety of a nearby
island. The message on the coconut was entrusted to friendly
islanders who brought it to Kennedy's rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   Because JFK is a public figure, Hasbro probably could have made
the action figure without the Kennedy family's permission, McNaught
said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Cape Cod gift shops are full of Camelot-era
knick-knacks, from Jackie Kennedy dolls to postcards of the late
president sailing in nearby waters. Such products rarely have the
Kennedy family's permission, nor does the law require it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If images are in the public domain, they belong to
everybody,'' McNaught said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Hasbro needed the foundation's permission to make the
action figure is ``a dicey area'' of the law, said Bill Hartglass,
team leader of GI Joe product development for Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed that making an action figure without a family's
permission is ``not the way we do business.''
</P>
<P>
   According to McNaught, Hasbro first broached the idea around the
time of a Kennedy Library event last fall that featured retired
General Colin Powell as a speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Powell was immortalized in the GI Joe heroes line. In
return for his approval of the action figure, Hasbro made a
donation to Powell's favorite charity, the Boys and Girls Clubs of
America. The Powell figure was a smash hit, Hartglass said.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging to treat JFK's image with respect, Hasbro made a
similar proposal, offering to donate royalties to the Kennedy
Library Foundation. Neither Hasbro nor the foundation would comment
on dollar amounts, but McNaught said the money the foundation could
receive was ``significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time something
like this has been done,'' McNaught said of the agreement between
Hasbro and the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   JFK and GI Joe may have an earlier connection, according to one
man. A few years ago, a self-styled GI Joe historian and author
named Hal Fowler offered the theory that the facial features of GI
Joe may have been partly modeled after Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler told a California newspaper that he had reached this
conclusion because the face of the original GI Joe doll bore a
striking resemblance to that of JFK. GI Joe was introduced in 1964,
a year after Kennedy's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes criticized for glorifying war and promoting
inappropriate play, GI Joe debuted as a line of action figures for
boys. During the Vietnam era when soldiers were out of favor, GI
Joe evolved into a generic adventurer and, for several years, was
discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   GI Joe's revival has been partly helped by a trend sweeping the
toy industry _ the advent of the adult collector. In the last few
years, adult collectors have crowded into toy stores, hoarding
everything from Beanie Babies to Barbie dolls.
</P>
<P>
   GI Joe has been no exception, and now many GI Joe products
target such collectors.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, GI Joe enthusiasts could buy figures modeled
after such famous US generals as Dwight D. Eisenhower and George S.
Patton, for which agreements were made with their families,
according to Hasbro. Generic figures also commemorate such famous
battles as D-Day and the invasion of Inchon.
</P>
<P>
   Because the JFK figure that was exhibited at the GI Joe display
duy Fair was a prototype, Hasbro would not allow it to be
photographed. The annual Toy Fair trade show is sponsored by the
Toy Manufacturers of America Inc., and draws 2,000 toy makers,
distributors, and importers.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts estimate GI Joe accounts for only a
fraction of Hasbro's business _ maybe $50 million out of total
sales of about $4.23 billion. Hasbro does not issue specific sales
figures for toy lines. But thanks partly to collectors, Hasbro did
say GI Joe sales last year rose by nearly a third.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro has high hopes for the JFK in its GI Joe line.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hartglass, ``The Kennedys have a special place in American
history and a special place in America's heart.''

DOUBTS CAST ON CLINTON'S PROPOSALS CONCERNING MEDICAL ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for new lead, rewriting throughout)  
(HLW) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The official leading federal efforts to reduce
medical errors told Congress on Tuesday that he had no firm
evidence that mandatory reporting of such errors, as proposed by
President Clinton, increased the safety of patients or reduced the
number of mistakes in states where it had been tried.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Dr. John M. Eisenberg, director of the Agency for
Health Care Research and Quality, said that some of the criticism
of the president's proposals was ``on target.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we know if these programs work?'' Eisenberg said at a
Senate hearing. ``No, we don't. We don't know how well they work,
and when they work best.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg was responding to comments made on Monday by Dr. Nancy
W. Dickey, former president of the American Medical Association,
who said, ``A number of states have mandatory reporting, and
there's no evidence that they have greater safety or fewer
errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Several states require hospitals to report certain kinds of
mistakes and ``adverse events.'' Clinton wants all states to
require such reports.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg said ``there's been very little analysis'' of states'
experience with mandatory reporting. He said that one bit of
evidence, from New York state, suggested that such reports could
improve the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals in New York have been required to report medical
mistakes and other unexpected occurrences to the state Health
Department since 1985. Under a separate program, the agency
collects information on every patient undergoing heart bypass
surgery in New York, regardless of whether there was an error. The
state publishes death rates for all hospitals that perform the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The death rate for bypass surgery has dropped by more than 30
percent since New York first published such data in 1989. The
figures are adjusted to take account of each patient's medical
history and other ``risk factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg said the federal government would develop a research
agenda to identify the best methods of mandatory reporting. As a
condition of getting Medicare money, he said, hospitals will have
to comply with reporting requirements in their states. In addition,
Medicare officials will choose up to 100 hospitals to test the
value of mandatory reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey said: ``The president has the cart before the horse. He'd
put in place mandatory reporting, then study it and do something
different if it doesn't improve patient safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. Richard Gaintner, chief executive of Shands Health Care,
which operates seven hospitals in and around Gainesville, Fla.,
said he feared that the reporting of medical errors would feed the
appetite of lawyers eager to sue hospitals for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take medical errors very seriously,'' Gaintner said in an
interview. ``But the incredible litigiousness in the health care
field is a great concern to us. I have been in this business for 30
years and have sat on the boards of several insurance companies.
I've seen too many examples of information that gets out and is
used in ways that are not good for patients or patient care.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's proposal, the names of hospitals reporting
serious errors would be ``made public without identifying patients
or individual health care professionals.'' The president said that
the results of a hospital's internal investigation and analysis of
its errors should not be available to patients, their lawyers or
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   But Eisenberg said the Clinton administration had not
recommended any specific penalties for the improper disclosure of
such information.
</P>
<P>
   New York hospitals have been required to report errors and
mishaps to the state Health Department since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Spencer Foreman, president of Montefiore Medical Center in
the Bronx, said: ``These requirements compel hospitals to look at
errors and examine them, to find out what caused them and to take
reasonable steps to correct them. Even states with a long history
of incident reporting, like New York, don't have a model program to
ensure that problems, once identified, are corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators of both parties said Clinton was apparently trying to
impose a new mandate on the states without offering them any money
to carry out the task of tabulating and analyzing thousands of
error reports from hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who heads the
Appropriations subcommittee for health care, said he supported
mandatory reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Without a federal law, he said, hospitals will not acknowledge
their errors, and he cited his state's experience to prove his
point. Under state law, he said, hospitals are supposed to report
medical errors, but 35 Philadelphia hospitals reported only one
medical mistake in the year that ended in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   David L. Bernd, chief executive of Sentara Health Care, a large
nonprofit health care system in Virginia, said: ``We support
efforts to deal with medical errors. They can be tragic. But if the
information is used to browbeat providers who report errors, they
won't report. The problem will get worse.''

CLOSING ARGUMENTS UNDERSCORE GAP BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs to rewrite lede grafs and add about 800 words to provide

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. got its last chance in federal
court Tuesday to persuade the trial judge not to issue a stinging
antitrust verdict against the company.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, gave Microsoft little
comfort. At one point in Tuesday's final arguments, he dismissed a
key Microsoft defense by comparing the company to John D.
Rockefeller's Standard Oil monopoly, the subject of the first major
antitrust case, in 1906, that resulted in a breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really see a distinction,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The government, in its final argument, said it was ``simply
impossible to imagine'' that the company will not be found to have
violated the nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, for its part, argued that it was impossible to see
how the company could be found guilty. ``A lot of nothing doesn't
add up to something,'' said John Warden, the company's lead lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   And so the trial drew to close on exactly the same notes that
carried it through 16 months of testimony and argument. The
government pressed hard on its broad points, while Microsoft
refused to concede even a nit. Tuesday's arguments on the relevant
points of law bearing on the case were the last act before a
verdict, which will probably be issued in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The court is likely to hold separate hearings on remedies if, as
expected, Jackson rules that Microsoft violated antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   A strong verdict against Microsoft could well lead to harsh
sanctions against the company, including breaking it up. If,
however, Jackson agrees with some of the government's legal
allegations but rejects others, the sanctions against Microsoft
could be less severe, prohibiting it from some practices but
leaving the company intact.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Justice Department and state attorneys general
pressing the case insist they will not settle for a mild sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remedies have to be drastic and far reaching,'' Richard
Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut and one of the
plaintiffs, said this evening.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Microsoft and the government concluded this phase of
the trial, their representatives are continuing to meet in Chicago
in search of a settlement, in mediation talks overseen by Richard
A. Posner, chief judge of the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.
The two sides reportedly remain far apart, but government officials
note that the fact they are still meeting at this late date
suggests a willingness on both sides to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to work hard with Judge Posner,'' said
William H. Neukom, Micrsoft's general counsel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate in court Tuesday was over how legal precedents from
industries ranging from ski slopes in Colorado to newspapers in
Ohio apply to the facts in the Microsoft case. The government said
Microsoft is an old-fashioned monopolist in high-tech clothes.
Microsoft responded that computer software _ a fast-changing,
dynamic, fiercely competitive industry _ does indeed have
distinctive characteristics, and the courts should tread carefully.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard Oil analogy was just one of several skeptical
questions and remarks Jackson aimed at Microsoft's lawyer in court
Tuesday. Warden was making the argument that the Windows operating
system was protected by a copyright, and therefore was protected
against some of the government's charges, when Jackson spoke up to
say he had a problem with that defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What exactly is covered by copyright?'' the judge asked. Was
it ``fee simple'' or absolute ``control over code? Rockefeller had
fee simple control over his oil. I don't really see a
distinction.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warden responded that the laws were different then, adding that
he did not think copyright law was more powerful than antitrust
law.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's presentations were the final attempt by both sides to
try to influence Jackson's thinking. At one point, David Boies, the
Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, said Microsoft's business
strategy was based on trying to `bribe and coerce'' other companies
in the computer industry. Warden dismissed one of Boies' arguments
as ``entirely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, according to most antitrust experts, is sitting
on a big lead, while Microsoft is trying to limit its losses in
Jackson's court while hoping to fare better on appeal. But at one
point, Boies appeared to be trying to embolden Jackson not to worry
about appeals by saying: ``Try to imagine the Supreme Court ruling
that these acts do not violate the antitrust laws. It is simply
impossible to imagine that.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, on the other hand, seemed to be employing elements of
a loss-limitation strategy. Warden began by saying that Microsoft
``respectfully disagreed'' with much of the Jackson's findings of
fact, issued in November. They strongly favored the government's
case.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Warden then went on to tell Jackson that his ruling may well
shape the ground rules for competition in the entire high-tech
economy. And he lambasted the government for its ``assault on
Windows, which promotes and creates commerce for the citizens of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft case, Warden noted, focuses on the company's
``fights with competitors in a highly competitive, fast-moving
industry.'' And antitrust law, he observed, encourages competition
even when that rough-and-tumble competition hurts a company's
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law should not be rewritten to prevent Microsoft, or any
other company, from competing aggressively,'' Warden said.
</P>
<P>
   In the government's view, Microsoft is trying to change the
subject with arguments like these. ``We don't say competition is a
violation of the antitrust laws,'' Boies said. ``Our allegations
here deal with the means by which they compete. They are seriously
anti-competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the voluminous court record _ including thousands
of e-mails, internal Microsoft documents and months of witness
testimony _ show Microsoft to have been an arm-twisting monopolist,
whose corporate behavior stifled competition and harmed consumers.
Jackson's factual findings agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Boies opened his remarks by emphasizing that the Supreme Court
has long recognized that antitrust cases are ``especially
fact-based cases.'' And throughout his presentation, he repeatedly
made reference to the judge's findings of fact.
</P>
<P>
   But at one point, Jackson asked hard questions of Boies, too.
Antitrust experts say that the Government charge that is most
vulnerable is the allegation that Microsoft illegally tied its
Internet browser to a separate product, its industry-standard
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson questioned Boies closely on the tying issue. Boies
argued that Microsoft's decision was not really a product design
decision, but more a mere ``bolting'' together of the browser and
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Boies was trying to recast the tying charge as a
contract restriction _ that is, PC makers who wanted Windows had to
take its Internet Explorer browsing software whether they wanted it
or not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jackson appeared to be skeptical. What about the benefit,
he asked Boies, of the increased distribution of browser technology
resulting from Microsoft's decision to fold its browser into
Windows? ``I can't offset that _ one plausible benefit,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kevin O'Connor, an assistant attorney general for
Wisconsin, who represented the states, declared that ``Microsoft
has used virtually every tool of the monopolist's trade _ attempted
collusion, exclusionary contracts, tying, predation _ in a
coordinated scheme to eliminate threats to its monopoly.''

JUDGE QUESTIONS KEY MICROSOFT DEFENSE IN ANTITRUST SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Appearing before the same federal judge who branded
it a fierce monopolist, Microsoft Corp. returned to its antitrust
trial Tuesday to argue that it is a vigorous competitor in the
software market but that it never broke antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Federal District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who was
mainly silent during the 76 days of testimony in the case last
year, repeatedly challenged one of Microsoft's key defenses -- that
copyright law gives the company wide discretion in how it designs
and distributes software. He also questioned the degree to which he
was bound by an earlier appeals court ruling that was favorable to
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   And at another point, Jackson compared Microsoft's control of
the computer operating system market to John D. Rockefeller's grip
on the late 19th century oil market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't see a distinction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While such comments are not a reliable guide to a judge's
thinking, the analogy could not have cheered Microsoft. Rockefeller
was considered a ruthless monoplist, and the Supreme Court split
his Standard Oil Co. into more than 30 companies in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments Tuesday marked the opening of the second phase of
the government's antitrust case against Microsoft, which has the
potential to reset the competitive landscape for a variety of
technology markets for years to come. The trial is proceeding even
as the two sides are working with a mediator chosen by Jackson in
an effort to settle the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson on Nov. 5 issued ``findings of fact'' that said
Microsoft, the world's dominant software company and an engine of
the new economy, used its Windows monopoly to throttle competitors
and rob consumers of the benefits of competition, such as a wide
choice of products. Now, the court must rule on whether those
actions violated antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson finds that Microsoft acted unlawfully, he could
impose a range of penalities on the company, the most severe being
its breakup into separate units. His decision is almost certain to
be appealed, no matter how he rules.
</P>
<P>
   It is not illegal to operate a monopoly, but federal law bars a
company from using its monopoly powers to defend the monopoly or to
extend it into new markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states say that Microsoft
threatened to withhold access to its Windows software from
companies that declined to hurt a Microsoft rival, Netscape
Communications Corp. The government says Microsoft wanted to crush
Netscape's Web browser and Sun Microsystem's Java product, both of
which had the potential to develop into rivals to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The government also says Microsoft adopted predatory pricing --
giving away its own browser for free -- in an attempt to crush
Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft lawyer John Warden Tuesday said the company's actions
were lawful, and that they were taken at a time when Netscape, not
Microsoft, was the dominant maker of Web browsers. Microsoft only
enhanced competition by offering consumers an alternative to
Netscape, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the debate Tuesday turned on whether Jackson, whose
harsh ``findings of fact'' suggest that he believes Microsoft acted
illegally, would be on sound legal footing to rule that the company
broke antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The government's lead lawyer, David Boies, listed the
anticompetitive actions that Jackson already detailed in his
``findings of fact.'' He then asked Jackson to ``try to imagine the
Supreme Court not finding a violation of antitrust law on these
facts. . . I think it is virtually impossible to imagine that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson, in questions to the lawyers, suggested that he is
wrestling with the degree to which a 1998 appeals court ruling
forces him to side with Microsoft on one key point.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that in addition to charging nothing for
its browser, Microsoft built its browser into the Windows operating
system merely to drive Netscape out of business. The appeals court
for the District of Columbia, overturning Jackson in an earlier
Microsoft case, said in 1998 that a company could merge two
software products into one if it benefited consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Warden said the appeals court gave Microsoft a right to fold its
Web browser into Windows, because consumers find the combined
software easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   Boies replied that the appellate court itself ``recognized the
fragile and incomplete record it was working with,'' and that it
might rule differently in light of the expansive testimony laid out
in the current case.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson treated one of Microsoft's other defenses with
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   The company argued that Microsoft has rights under copyright law
to control the way computer makers use Windows. One issue in the
trial is whether Microsoft can control the first screen that users
see when they turn on a computer, and the icons that are initially
displayed on that screen.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson suggested that copyright law does not allow
Microsoft to dictate these features if its true goal is to keep a
competitor, such as Netscape, from appearing on the computer
screen. ``Copyright does not protect the conduct with which your
client is charged,'' Jackson said, but it was unclear if he meant
the comment as a definitive finding.

 &HT;    Lewis' ties to co-defendants stronger than first admitted
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In his only statement to police, Ray Lewis said the
other men in his limousine the morning after the Super Bowl were
``club people'' _ people he didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   He told police he had met co-defendant Reginald Oakley _ whom he
identified as A.J. Johnson _ at a club the night of the Super Bowl,
and that he didn't know the names of the other two men in the
limousine.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis was pals with Joseph Sweeting, the third defendant
charged with murder in the stabbings of two men.
</P>
<P>
   Sunseria Keith, Lewis' mother, knew it. So did Lewis' former
college teammate and fellow NFL All-Pro Warren Sapp.
</P>
<P>
   Both testified at a bond hearing for Lewis last week of a
long-standing relationship between Lewis and Sweeting.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, who often bragged about knowing Lewis, also had been a
roommate of another of Lewis' friends.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether Lewis had a personal relationship with
Sweeting and Oakley, both of whom have lengthy criminal records,
could be pivotal to the criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County, Ga., prosecutors have already started trying to
establish a connection between Lewis and his two co-defendants
indicted on murder and assault charges in the Jan. 31 double
slaying. Discrepancies between what Lewis originally told police
and testimony from various witnesses at last week's bond hearing
could provide a challenge for Lewis' attorneys as they try to
distance Lewis from Sweeting and Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   At a bond hearing for Lewis last week, prosecutors introduced as
evidence a framed photo of Lewis, Sweeting (whose nickname is
''Oomph'') and Yuille Garfield, a friend and former roommate of
Oakley's. The orange-framed photo was retrieved by investigators
from Lewis' $900,000 home in suburban Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' mother was shown the photo and testified to knowing
Sweeting as ''Oomph'' and said she'd seen him with her son,
specifically at Ravens home games.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Clint Rucker further pressed the
issue, asking Ravens owner, Art Modell if Sweeting, 34, frequently
had sideline passes. ''So would you be surprised to know that
Joseph Sweeting ... has been to Ravens home football games, has
stood on the sidelines, and has mingled with players, staff and
coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Modell said he had no knowledge of Sweeting, nor how he
maneuvered to get on the sidelines. Rucker did not offer evidence
that Sweeting had access to sideline passes for Ravens games.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp, NFL defensive player of the year, testified that Sweeting
and a frequent sidekick of his in South Florida, Toby Baine, were
often seen at University of Miami football practices while he and
Lewis were there, and that Sweeting was familiar to Miami players.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was always there,'' Sapp said. ''I mean, everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Shown the photo of Sweeting with an arm draped around the
shoulder of Lewis and Garfield, Sapp said: ''Looks like three guys
having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rucker asked Sapp if he was aware Sweeting had purchased three
knives the day before the murder.
</P>
<P>
   No, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rucker also portrayed the co-defendants as drug dealers, asking
Sapp: ''So you would be surprised if you knew that Ray Lewis
associated with drug dealers, wouldn't you? Wouldn't sound like
your running partner, would it?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Sapp what was meant by ``associated,'' Rucker replied:
''I mean flying them into Atlanta to celebrate the Super Bowl,
allow them to stay in his hotel room, ride around town for a week
in his limousine, attend autograph signings with him while he's
here in town, go to clubs, sit at the table, buy drinks for him, go
to strip clubs and buy table dances for him. That kind of friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, it would'' surprise me, Sapp said.
</P>
<P>
   At Garfield's Phase II Beauty Salon in Baltimore, Oakley was
known to brag about the celebrities he knew, dropping the names of
Lewis, movie star Denzel Washington and members of the R&AMP;B group
Dru Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts suggest that Lewis' attorneys will attempt to
distance him from the other defendants as the case unfolds,
possibly seeking a separate trial for Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Greta Van Susteren, co-host of CNN's show ``Burden of Proof,''
said she believes Lewis will act as though he has a distant
relationship with the two other defendants. The two others look
more ``rugged,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, whom Lewis originally identified as A.J. Johnson, had
his ''head busted'' during the fracas, Lewis told police.
</P>
<P>
   When news spread that Oakley was wanted on charges of murder, he
called his grandmother and father to tell them his version of what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he got hit upside his head with a champagne
bottle,'' said John Oakley. ``He said he didn't know what happened
after that. He said he wasn't guilty, he wouldn't do nothing like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Testimony at last week's bond hearing underscored the
substantial number of witnesses both sides may eventually bring
into court.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors brought up the name of Jaye Roberson, whom they
described as Lewis' girlfriend, and three other women who were in
the limo during the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, Keith Ponder, who had shot footage of
celebrities at a club prior to the incident, testified to arriving
upon an argument between Lewis' friends and another group. He
described Lewis as a ''peacemaker,'' but Ponder acknowledged the
two victims hadn't been stabbed when he left the scene. Ponder
testified to there being ''at least 50'' people within 30 feet of
Lewis' limousine when he left.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Keeler, whose second-floor apartment overlooks the crime
scene, said she witnessed the victims being beaten by four or five
men, adding there were ''tons of people all around.''
</P>
<P>
   One witness, in particular, Keeler said, interceded and tried to
help the victims. Police interviewed the man, described as black,
about 6-foot-5 and 300 pounds and driving a mid-1980s Honda, at the
crime scene but he was not called to appear at the bond hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and the co-defendants are charged in the stabbing deaths
of Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, after a night of
post-Super Bowl partying in Buckhead, Atlanta's entertainment
district. Lewis, 24, is free on $1 million bond. Initially, Lewis
told police his ''homeboy'' Kwame King, a friend from Lakeland,
Fla., was among the group. Then he said King had left earlier, and
that he had given the clothes he was wearing that night to King,
who apparently had taken them with him.
</P>
<P>
   King refused to comment on what happened to the clothes when
contacted Tuesday.

MALAYSIA AIRLINES MAY PICK AIRBUS OVER BOEING FOR $1 BILLION
ORDER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Long-time Boeing customer Malaysia Airlines Wednesday
may announce an order for more than $1 billion worth of airplanes
from Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. has been pushing hard to sell Malaysia's national
airline its next generation 737, but the carrier has apparently
decided instead to buy upwards of 30 Airbus A320s, according to
people familiar with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   European governments have lobbed the airline hard in recent
weeks to go with Airbus over Boeing as it seeks to replace about 40
older model 737s in its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia Airlines is also talking with Airbus about buying its
A340-500 and A340-600 long-haul widebody jets that are now in
development.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has been counting on Malaysia Airlines to buy its planned
777X, which will compete against the two planes from Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Airbus for the single-aisle planes could hurt
Boeing's chances of selling the airline its 777X, industry analysts
said. Increasingly, airlines like to stick with one manufacturer
for both their widebody and single-aisle fleet needs because it
saves them money in maintenance and pilot training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would would be quite a blow for Boeing if they decided not
to go with the 777X,'' said Paul Nisbet, analyst with JSA Research
in Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Asian carrier has a memorandum of understanding
with Boeing to buy the 777X, it apparently has grown impatient with
Boeing's repeated delays in launching the longer-range version of
its 777, Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their original preference was to go with Boeing,'' Nisbet
said.
</P>
<P>
   The respected industry publication Flight International recently
reported that Malaysia Airlines is also upset that Boeing chose
General Electric as the sole supplier of engines for the 777X. The
airline now operates nine 777s, all of which are powered by
Rolls-Royce engines.
</P>
<P>
   The A340-500/600 planes will be powered by Rolls-Royce engines.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said Malaysia Airlines could order as many as 10 of
the A340-500/600 jets from Airbus. They would replace older Boeing
747s and would be used to open new non-stop transpacific routes to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how close Airbus and Malaysia Airlines may be to
reaching any agreement on a widebody order.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus has scheduled a news conference Wednesday at the Asian
aerospace air show in Singapore, apparently to announce the order
for the single-aisle planes. The show runs throughout this week.
Bloomberg News reported the order is for 30 jets worth $1.4 billion
at list prices. Airlines are almost always able to get better than
list prices, especially for such large orders.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia Airlines now has mostly Boeing jets in its fleet of
about 90 planes, including the 747, 777, 737 and the MD-10. But it
also operates 10 A330-300 widebody jets, according to the airline's
web site.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the first big airplane order that either Boeing or
Airbus has announced in 2000. Last year, Airbus significantly beat
Boeing for the first time ever in landing new airplane orders.
</P>
<P>
   The order reflects the upturn in Asia's economic climate. A
financial crisis that swept through Asia two years ago crippled
many airlines in that region, forcing them to cancel or delay
orders with both Boeing and Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing postponed the launch of its 777X because of the sagging
fortunes of Asia airlines, which are the principal customers for
the new plane on long routes across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Asian economies are improving, Boeing has stepped up
efforts to sign launch customers for the 777X. It reported has more
than two dozen commitments, but has not yet announced a launch
date. It could get approval to do so at a meeting of the Boeing
board of directors that is set for Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Potential customers for the 777X include Japan Air Lines, Cathay
Pacific, Singapore Airlines and leasing giant International Lease
Finance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan-based Eva Airways said last week that it will buy several
of the 777X jets.

FOR CZARIST RUSSIA'S JEWS, A LOOK AT A PROMISED LAND 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27)
</HEADLINE>

 J. Hoberman is the senior film critic for The Village Voice and the
author of ``Bridge of Light: Yiddish Film Between Two Worlds.'' 
By J. HOBERMAN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several empires back, on the eve of World War I, the ghettos and
market towns of the Russian Pale were transfixed by a sensational
new motion picture attraction. The feature-length documentary ``The
Life of the Jews in Palestine'' was, according to the future
Israeli film exhibitor Yaacov Davidon, then a young man, received
with ``indescribable enthusiasm.'' He said, ``Tears of happiness
gleamed in the eyes of Jewish audiences, thirsty for redemption.''
</P>
<P>
   In another sort of redemption, ``The Life of the Jews in
Palestine'' _ which was produced in 1913 by the Odessa-based
Mizrakh Company and presumed to be lost for some 80 years _ has
resurfaced in New York. Showing on March 6 and 7, in an excellent
new print with English intertitles at the Museum of Modern Art,
Noah Sokolovsky's 78-minute silent film is quite likely the rarest
of the rarities featured in the museum's 10-program tribute to
France's national film archives, the Centre Nationale de la
Cinematographie.
</P>
<P>
   For its producer as well as its original audiences, ``The Life
of the Jews in Palestine'' was something of a celluloid aliya, or
pilgrimage. In April 1913, the Mizrakh crew boarded a ship in
Odessa harbor and steamed through the Black Sea and the Bosporus to
the port of Jaffa, in what was then the Ottoman Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   After creating some panoramic views of the brand-new Tel Aviv _
an impressive grid of houses and boulevards whose construction had
begun only four years before _ the filmmakers spent the next six
weeks touring the Jewish settlements of Judea, Carmel and the
Galilee, documenting cooperatively managed orange groves and
vineyards, as well as portraying a number of local heroes _ Tel
Aviv's first mayor, Meir Dizengoff, presiding over the City
Council; Joseph Trumpeldor (a founder of the World War I Jewish
Legion), plowing his fields with his one remaining arm; the
middle-aged Biluim of Gedera (student radicals of the 1880s)
celebrating their village's 30th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   As suggested by the rubric Mizrakh (the Hebrew word for east),
Sokolovsky was an active Zionist, and his film _ at once
straightforward travelogue and homespun pageant of parading
schoolchildren and athletic contests _ is a vision of Jewish
productivity. Populated by industrious workers and fit, healthy
farmers, by Ashkenazic pioneers laboring beside their Sephardic
co-religionists, the Land of Milk and Honey has been reclaimed by
the presence of Jewish dairies and beekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation is overwhelmingly secular; not until the
filmmakers reach the northern town of Tiberius do they show a
traditional yeshiva. Still, the landmarks of Jerusalem, like Jaffa
Gate, David's Tower, the Western Wall (with worshiping Hasidim
ducking away from the camera), as well as other biblical sites like
Rachel's Tomb, the Cave of the Patriarchs, the Dead Sea and the
River Jordan, must have appeared as little short of miraculous to
the Russian Jews who thronged to see ``The Life of the Jews in
Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sokolovsky's documentary was considered newsworthy within the
Yishuv (the Jewish settlements in Palestine), and some of the
scenes were proudly staged for the cameras. Reporting on the
harvest filmed at the venerable Rishon le Zion settlement, a local
journalist wrote that ``when its turn came to appear before the
great Hebrew public outside the borders of the country, the
settlement stripped itself of its weekday clothes and all became
extremely national _ not one outside laborer was filmed!''
</P>
<P>
   The journalist observed that the mandate for self-employment was
heeded; farmers' daughters, for example, became grape pickers:
``Their fingers that are used to drum upon the piano keys were this
time skilled in passing with swift movements among the grape
clusters and almond boughs,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Life of the Jews in Palestine'' had its world premiere
late in the summer of 1913 as a special event at the 11th Zionist
Congress in Vienna. Within six months, the movie played more than
30 separate engagements throughout Europe and Russia. In Ukraine,
the enthusiastic crowds became the subject of secret police
reports; in Galicia, special screenings were organized for
ultra-Orthodox audiences under rabbinical supervision. Sokolovsky's
documentary was exhibited in New York as well, opening in early
1914 as ``Life in the Holy Land.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's showings in the Yishuv proved the most controversial.
Although ``The Life of the Jews in Palestine'' was praised by
right-wing Zionists, it was criticized by the Zionist left for
idealizing pioneer life while ignoring the presence of the local
Arabs (who are shown, in supporting roles, in only a few shots).
</P>
<P>
   Despite some scraps of badly decomposed nitrate footage found in
the possession of a Bronx film collector, ``The Life of the Jews in
Palestine'' was scarcely more than a memory when an unmarked but
nearly complete print was discovered (without intertitles) three
years ago in the French center's vaults by the archivist Eric Le
Roy. ( Le Roy is scheduled to introduce the Museum of Modern Art's
screenings.)
</P>
<P>
   The film's survival in France was less a factor of exhibition
patterns than of Russian underdevelopment _ the original negative
had been shipped by Mizrakh from Odessa to Paris to be processed by
the Gaumont film laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Le Roy's find was identified by the Israeli film historian and
filmmaker Yaakov Gross and restored in time to be shown in 1998 by
the Jerusalem Film Archives on the 50th anniversary of Israeli
statehood. Gross, who had previously tracked ``The Life of the Jews
in Palestine'' to the Soviet documentary film archives in
Krasnogorsk only to discover the film cans empty (``even though
they were registered in the most official manner and were under the
watchful eyes of Lenin, whose portraits were still on the walls''),
regards the existence of the French archive material as nearly
miraculous. ``It was like finding documentation of Moses; almost
like images of Moses descending Mount Sinai,'' he told a French
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolovsky's international hit _ which inspired a similar Polish
production, still lost _ was not his last production. Mizrakh soon
after released a topical four-reel drama, ``War and the Jews,''
featuring the ``heroic act'' of a Jewish double agent. Over the
18-month period following the fall of the czar in February 1917,
the Odessa studio produced a number of literary movies on the
subject of pre-revolutionary Jewish life. These adaptations by the
Yiddish writers Sholom Aleichem and I.L. Peretz have yet to be
rediscovered; if they were, they might seem even more exotic than
``The Life of the Jews in Palestine.''

W.R. GRACE SUED OVER ASBESTOS-TAINTED INSULATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ W.R. Grace Co. was hit with three class-action lawsuits
Tuesday, one filed in Boston on behalf of homeowners nationwide who
have asbestos-tainted Zonolite Attic Insulation in their homes, and
the other two in Montana, where the company operated a mine and
mill.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed in US District Court in Boston by Edward M.
Lindholm accuses Grace of fraud, deception and enriching itself at
homeowners' expense for failing to warn the public that the
Zonolite insulation it sold from 1963 through 1984 contained
tremolite asbestos. Grace's Cambridge, Mass. Costruction Products
Division oversaw its Attic Insulation line.
</P>
<P>
   Two class-action suits filed Tuesday in federal court in
Missoula, Mont., seek damages for all property owners in Libby,
where Grace operated a mine and mill until 1990, and damages for
all residents exposed to tremolite asbestos. Grace got its
vermiculite, the mineral that was the main ingredient in its Attic
Insulation, from its Libby mine. Asbestos was naturally occurring
in the Libby vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is asbestos contamination in settled dust throughout
Libby in homes and areas outside,'' said Edward Westbrook, a
Charlestown, S.C., attorney with one of the five firms that filed
the Montana cases.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Attorney Kenneth Gilman, who represents Lindholm and
filed the suit in US District Court in Boston, is urging a judge to
order Grace to notify homeowners of the dangers of living with
Zonolite in their houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``All class members should be given an opportunity to inspect
repair and remove Zonolite and to attempt to prevent personal
injury,'' the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gilman nor Lindholm, who is described only as the owner
of a home in Essex County, could be reached Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is seeking punitive and compensatory damages from Grace
and wants the company to foot the bill for Zonolite removal and
attorneys fees for Lindholm and other homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   William Corcoran, a spokesman for Grace, said, ``We believe our
Attic Insulation is a safe product and the lawsuit is without
merit. We've been very open with the governmental agencies and with
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported last week that Zonolite, a type of loose-fill
insulation, contains asbestos, but Grace officials fought to keep
warning labels off the product.
</P>
<P>
   Grace, which discontinued its Attic Insulation in 1984, knew as
far back as 1963 about the asbestos, but feared public disclosure
would hurt sales, according to memos from high-ranking Grace
officials.
</P>
<P>
   An internal Grace memo dated May 24, 1977 and obtained by the
Globe, revealed that the company was concerned by an in-house study
that revealed mortality rates were five times the national rate
among ex-employees at the Libby plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the memo reaffirmed Grace's opposition to warning labels on
Zonolite, saying, ``We believe that a decision to affix asbestos
warning labels to our products would result in substantial sales
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   W.R. Grace, today worth $1.5 billion, has paid out $1 billion as
a result of asbestos claims and expects to pay $1 billion more,
according to Corcoran. Many of Grace's claims are due to its past
manufacture of Monokote Fireproofing, a spray insulation that
contained asbestos.

 &HT;    Coke plaintiffs say black employee laid off in retaliation
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Plaintiffs in a racial discrimination lawsuit against
Coca-Cola allege a veteran African-American manager was laid off in
retaliation for organizing a meeting to discuss a workplace issue
with fellow black employees.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys said in a legal motion Tuesday that the
organizer, Larry Jones, told company President Jack Stahl about the
meeting at his church a day before he was laid off.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch said Jones' layoff had
``absolutely nothing'' to do with the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a human resources manager who has worked for Coke since
1985, called the meeting at St. Philip A.M.E. Church in Decatur to
deal with employee ``apprehension and confusion'' over a key issue
involving the suit and planned job cuts, plaintiffs' attorneys
alleged. To qualify for enhanced severance benefits, laid-off black
employees have to sign a release form relinquishing their rights to
share any monetary relief that could be recovered if the case
becomes a class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 12, Jones and about 150 other African-American
employees, as well as plaintiffs' counsel, met at St. Philip to
discuss the release form issue, plaintiffs' attorneys alleged.
Jones, an associate pastor at the church, said he organized the
meeting after ``scores of African-American employees'' approached
him about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Jones informed Stahl of the meeting and asked
him ``to convince the company not to apply the releases to this
case,'' the plaintiffs said in their motion. Jones claims Stahl,
who also co-chairs the company's Diversity Advisory Council, told
him he would communicate Jones' concerns to Coke's senior
management and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day as the meeting with Stahl, Jones claims he was
told by a human resources director that he had nothing to worry
about when additional job cuts were announced Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, he was laid off, along with about 500 other
employees that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's overnight change of heart regarding Mr. Jones'
employment ... suggests that Mr. Jones' termination was in
retaliation for the meetings he had with putative class members and
the objections to the releases he raised with Mr. Stahl,''
plaintiffs' attorneys alleged.
</P>
<P>
   But the company denies this allegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to file a formal response to these claims within
the next 10 business days,'' said Deutsch. ``In it, we will make it
very clear that Larry Jones' termination had absolutely nothing to
do with the meeting he had at the church or any actions he took
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this realignment process, we are treating all employees
fairly and equitably with absolutely no differentiation for any
reason other than the need of the business and a fair assessment of
their skills and performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jones incident, plaintiffs' attorneys said, is
``particularly troubling'' because of the company's refusal to
answer their questions about the layoffs. The plaintiffs said they
are trying to determine if African-Americans who have complained
about discrimination or the release forms were retaliated against
in the layoff process.
</P>
<P>
   The company denies any retaliation. ``The information that
plaintiffs are seeking is confidential personnel data that is not
relevant because the realignment of the company and actions taken
under it are not at issue in this lawsuit,'' Deutsch said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also are asking the judge to invalidate all
release forms signed between Jan. 26 and Feb. 15. On Jan. 26, the
company announced it will be cutting 6,000 jobs worldwide,
including 2,500 in Atlanta, this year. In Atlanta, the first round
of layoffs took place Jan. 26, with another round occurring Feb.
15.
</P>
<P>
   But plaintiffs' attorneys contend that the release forms are
invalid because the company failed to follow a Feb. 4 court order
requiring it to clarify the terms of the release form in a memo to
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This memo had to be duplicated and sent to more than 1,300
affected associates,'' Deutsch said. ``All of this happened within
five business days of the court order. We don't think that's an
unreasonable amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by eight current and former employees who
allege that Coca-Cola has discriminated against African-Americans
in pay, promotions and performance evaluations. Jones is not among
the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola denies the allegations in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status so they can
represent some 2,000 black salaried employees in the United States.
Recently, U.S. District Judge Richard Story ordered both sides to
try to settle the case through mediation.

<P>
   Eight months later, opponents of NATO's war in Kosovo could not
have imagined more bitter vindication of their warnings than events
in the city of Mitrovica, where Serbs and Albanians confront each
other, kept apart only by the Ibar River and the increasingly
desperate efforts of the NATO-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the mistakes in its execution, the war was fought with
the noble aim of building a stable, tolerant and multi-ethnic
Kosovo. But over the past few weeks Mitrovica has witnessed savage
ethnic cleansing anew.
</P>
<P>
   Serb residents in its overwhelmingly Albanian southern part have
been terrorized and murdered, while Serb mobs have driven out
Albanians marooned in the Serbian enclave on the north bank of the
Ibar.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has tried to maintain order but has instead been dragged
into the struggle _ most violently when American troops were stoned
this weekend as they searched for illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It may be true that the French peacekeepers first assigned to
the city showed excessive sympathy for the Serbs, but Mitrovica
illustrates the reality of a Kosovo where ethnic hatreds burn as
fiercely as ever, where even 50,000 foreign troops cannot impose
civil order and where the main growth industry is Albanian
gangsterism.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest responsibility, of course, lies with the two
communities themselves. With all the resources in the world, NATO
and the United Nations cannot force Serbs and Albanians to live
together peaceably if they do not wish to.
</P>
<P>
   Some blame also lies with the U.N., which is supposed to run
Kosovo. Not for the first time, its structures have proved unwieldy
and overcomplicated.
</P>
<P>
   But, ultimately, the U.N. is no more than the collective will of
its member nations, and it is not the U.N.'s fault that of the
4,800 police _ the most vital single component of a new civil
administration _ promised by those member nations, only 2,000 have
been sent.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has erred too, by not doing enough to protect the Serb
minority and Serbian holy places _ perhaps in the unspoken hope
that the fewer Serbs left in Kosovo, the easier the place would be
to run and the more quickly its future would be settled.
</P>
<P>
   But at heart Mitrovica reflects the ambiguities and confusions
that still dog the entire Kosovo enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Even now it is not clear: are we trying to build a multi-ethnic
state that juridically, at least, remains part of Yugoslavia _ or
are we trying to nudge it towards independence?
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that an independent Kosovo is inevitable, and encouraged
by President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, Serb nationalists see
Mitrovica as the basis of a mini-state that can reunite with
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Albanians strive to prevent the Serbs from
gaining the mineral resources of nearby Trepca, the main economic
asset of an independent Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Partition, however, is not the answer. The notion that good
fences make good neighbors is appealing in a part of the world
where trust is so scarce.
</P>
<P>
   But formal division of Kosovo would not only betray the lofty
moral arguments that justified the war: it would send exactly the
wrong message to Bosnia, Montenegro and Macedonia, other Balkan
countries where different ethnic groups coexist uneasily.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of Mitrovica is that the West, like it or not, is in
Kosovo for the long haul, and must send the police and other
resources required to see the job through. &QL;

   Eight months later, opponents of NATO's war in Kosovo could not
have imagined more bitter vindication of their warnings than events
in the city of Mitrovica, where Serbs and Albanians confront each
other, kept apart only by the Ibar River and the increasingly
desperate efforts of the NATO-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the mistakes in its execution, the war was fought with
the noble aim of building a stable, tolerant and multi-ethnic
Kosovo. But over the past few weeks Mitrovica has witnessed savage
ethnic cleansing anew.
</P>
<P>
   Serb residents in its overwhelmingly Albanian southern part have
been terrorized and murdered, while Serb mobs have driven out
Albanians marooned in the Serbian enclave on the north bank of the
Ibar.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has tried to maintain order but has instead been dragged
into the struggle _ most violently when American troops were stoned
this weekend as they searched for illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It may be true that the French peacekeepers first assigned to
the city showed excessive sympathy for the Serbs, but Mitrovica
illustrates the reality of a Kosovo where ethnic hatreds burn as
fiercely as ever, where even 50,000 foreign troops cannot impose
civil order and where the main growth industry is Albanian
gangsterism.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest responsibility, of course, lies with the two
communities themselves. With all the resources in the world, NATO
and the United Nations cannot force Serbs and Albanians to live
together peaceably if they do not wish to.
</P>
<P>
   Some blame also lies with the U.N., which is supposed to run
Kosovo. Not for the first time, its structures have proved unwieldy
and overcomplicated.
</P>
<P>
   But, ultimately, the U.N. is no more than the collective will of
its member nations, and it is not the U.N.'s fault that of the
4,800 police _ the most vital single component of a new civil
administration _ promised by those member nations, only 2,000 have
been sent.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has erred too, by not doing enough to protect the Serb
minority and Serbian holy places _ perhaps in the unspoken hope
that the fewer Serbs left in Kosovo, the easier the place would be
to run and the more quickly its future would be settled.
</P>
<P>
   But at heart Mitrovica reflects the ambiguities and confusions
that still dog the entire Kosovo enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Even now it is not clear: are we trying to build a multi-ethnic
state that juridically, at least, remains part of Yugoslavia _ or
are we trying to nudge it towards independence?
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that an independent Kosovo is inevitable, and encouraged
by President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, Serb nationalists see
Mitrovica as the basis of a mini-state that can reunite with
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Albanians strive to prevent the Serbs from
gaining the mineral resources of nearby Trepca, the main economic
asset of an independent Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Partition, however, is not the answer. The notion that good
fences make good neighbors is appealing in a part of the world
where trust is so scarce.
</P>
<P>
   But formal division of Kosovo would not only betray the lofty
moral arguments that justified the war: it would send exactly the
wrong message to Bosnia, Montenegro and Macedonia, other Balkan
countries where different ethnic groups coexist uneasily.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of Mitrovica is that the West, like it or not, is in
Kosovo for the long haul, and must send the police and other
resources required to see the job through. &QL;

   TEHRAN _ This is a Persian tale, of hope and love and
generosity. It is also, like all Persian stories, not as simple as
it seems; a trifle opaque perhaps, elliptical, full of heroes who
might not all really be heroes. And it may yet prove to have an
unhappy, tragic ending.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, like the French Revolution and the Russian
Revolution, the Iranian Revolution finally fell under the control
of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Could any election have been more historic in the Middle East,
that dark terrain of dictatorships and torture chambers and secret
policemen? Could any people have broken free of their chains more
gently, more elegantly, and with so much trust?
</P>
<P>
   How else could one interpret the tens of thousands who queued
for hours outside the Husseiniya Ershad mosque _ in which Dr.
Shariati and his friends once protested the Shah's autocratic rule
_ to vote for the friends and supporters of the man they all
adored, President Mohamed Khatami?
</P>
<P>
   And when I talked to them, they all spoke of integrity and
democracy and the mistakes of the past, the men in their jeans and
cheap coats, the women in their ``Hejab'' covering, showing
infinite courtesy to the foreigner who had come to ask his usual
blundering, foolish questions.
</P>
<P>
   I even asked Hojatolislam Seyed Abdulwahed Moussavi Lari, the
Iranian interior minister watching the voters fill in their forms
in the mosque, what historians would write about the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will say...that the people came to vote because they
wanted freedom and to determine their own destiny,'' he announced.
</P>
<P>
   The West has always consistently and willfully misunderstood
Iran and we were at it again Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government and, of course, the American press and CNN
and all the usual suspects were billing the elections as a crucial
struggle between ``reformers'' and ``hard-liners,'' the poll which
could give President Khatami, elected with 70 percent of the vote
last May, a parliament that would at last break the power of the
``conservatives,'' the ``radicals,'' the ``extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   America, of course, says it would like Khatami's supporters to
win _ although I am not sure this is true because America likes
dictatorships in the Middle East and, with one exception, fears
real democracy in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, as usual, the world is being presented with a
partial, skewed version of events here.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where this Persian tale becomes opaque. For look at
some of the men who now say they are supporting Khatami, who are
now calling themselves ``reformers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani, Mohtashemi, Karroubi: the list is endless, all men
from the past, a few of them _ Mohtashemi comes to mind _ with
blood on their hands and a number of ``pro-Khatamists'' (not,
mercifully, candidates) with blood all over them.
</P>
<P>
   Why, wasn't that friendly Ayatollah Khalkhali advocating reform
this month the very same Ayatollah Khalkhali whom I interviewed in
Qom all of 20 years ago, after he had hanged men like thrushes in
Evin Prison, including a 14-year-old old boy for whom, he said, he
had no conscience because he had ``sent him to heaven?''
</P>
<P>
   And what of those stories now moving through the bazaars? In the
decade up to 1998, so they say, up to 100 dissidents were
``disappeared'' in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Gangi, probably the finest Iranian investigative
journalist _ there are precious few around _ is demanding a truth
commission to find out who ordered their murders.
</P>
<P>
   How high did their death warrant go? Wasn't Ali Akbar Mohtashemi
an interior minister after the revolution? Wasn't Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani the president when all those men were put to death?
</P>
<P>
   And isn't that the same Rafsanjani who is now a pro-Khatami
``reformist,'' aching, no doubt, to become speaker of the new
pro-Khatami parliament?
</P>
<P>
   So what is this new parliament going to look like? It may call
itself ``reformist'' but _ like a cup of tea that is steadily mixed
with coffee _ it may not taste like tea when it is drunk. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I put this point to the men waiting to vote outside the mosque
in the Seyed Khandan district. Wasn't there a danger, I asked, that
the parliament's 290 members would look rather similar to the
gentlemen who filled the previous anti-Khatami assembly?
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't the ``reformist'' movement being diluted? Weren't there
one or two men who might be seeking to avoid retribution and keep
their profits by joining the winning team?
</P>
<P>
   One of the men told me to read a copy of Thursday's ``Asre
Azadegam'' which had listed all the ``bad events'' since the
revolution, and another said _ using the same words as a woman
candidate I had met earlier _ that ``there was a kind of change in
these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some had admitted their mistakes, he said. And no one had to
vote for them. Had not one ``reformist'' party refused to put
Rafsanjani on their list because he was not ``Shafafiyat'' _ a
lovely new Iranian word that means ``straight-talking?''
</P>
<P>
   A publisher of political works and modern Iranian literature,
this bespectacled voter _ note that they haven't yet reached the
point of wanting their names printed _ insisted kindly that the
``men of the past'' had changed their attitude towards society.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference from the first period of the
revolution,'' he said. ``These men have learned to pay attention to
what we say and what we want.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its initial stage, our revolution was like the French and
Russian revolutions. At first they thought they had to be radical
but little by little they understood that radicalism isn't good in
any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Such trust he reposed in the men he was electing, such
simplicity. But it was moving all the same. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People laugh in Tehran again now. Their jokes have become
powerful, daring.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pro-Khatami parties has a slogan _ ``Ei Iran, Ei
marze, pourgohar'' _ which means ``Oh Iran, the precious
homeland.'' Note the lack of the world ``Islamic.'' And note _ much
more to the point _ that this was the title of a popular song
during the reign of the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Was this really the same Tehran I remember 21 years ago? The
same people? The same proud, stubborn, brave, single-minded race
that walked in their tens of thousands into the Shah's guns?
</P>
<P>
   I watched that extraordinary revolution and the world seemed to
have changed. America was no longer able to maintain its power
throughout the Middle East. A dynasty had been swept away in
Robespierre blood and fury. But yesterday Friday, instead of
shouting ``Death to America,'' they queued for hours to vote for a
new, gentler revolution that would belong to them.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could share all their faith but like all Persian tales,
I think this needs a familiar sign off: To Be Continued. &QL;

REFORMERS APPEAR TO BE THE BIG WINNERS IN IRAN'S ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Many of the conservative parliamentarians who led
the opposition to President Mohammad Khatami's reform program
apparently were soundly defeated in voting on Friday, according to
independent analysts who tallied up the hard-liners' losses
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vote-counting was nearly complete in the major cities, including
the capital, Tehran, although no official results will be announced
until the end of the week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But preliminary results in Tehran, plus the decided races in
provincial areas, already indicate that the conservatives have lost
most of their senior representatives in the Parliament, analysts
for several foreign embassies and Iranian political parties said.
</P>
<P>
   A runoff election will be needed to decide the winner of some 60
to 65 seats in the 290-member Parliament, they added. The runoff
has tentatively been set for sometime in April.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most closely watched races, the former president
of Iran, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was barely holding on to
30th, or last, place in Tehran, which accounts for 30 seats in the
Parliament. It was not clear whether he would even get the minimum
number of votes _ 25 percent of those cast in the capital _ to
claim a seat in the first round, or whether he would be forced into
a runoff election.
</P>
<P>
   The top 29 vote-getters in the capital appear to be from the
reform camp that supports Khatami and advocates cultural freedoms,
including liberating the press from clerical censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's brother, Mohammad Reza Khatami, has held onto his lead
as the top vote-getter in the capital since the counting started.
Most analysts, including those for the reformers, give the
pro-Khatami forces about 70 percent of the seats in the first round
and the conservatives about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The tallies differ according to the analyst, however, because
some independent candidates are claimed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the elections, a spokesman for the
defeated conservatives admitted publicly Tuesday that they have
suffered a damaging blow.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Mohammad Reza Bahonar, one of the most prominent
ideologues of the conservative side, suggested in an interview with
a Tehran newspaper that hard-liners have some soul-searching to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not change our principles and positions, but it is
natural that we should reconsider our policies and methods,'' he
was quoted as saying in the newspaper Iran Vig. Bahonar also lost
his parliamentary seat in Tehran, according to unofficial results.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Tuesday to proclaim victory in the
parliamentary poll, the reformers pledged to push for legalizing
satellite dishes and allowing a free public debate of religious and
social issues that hard-liners had tried to suppress.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger Khatami warned that normalization of relations
with the United States _ an issue that some of his allies have
suggested should be put to a public vote _ would depend on action
by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States supported the totalitarian regime of the
shah,'' he said. ``And now that Iran has become one of the most
free nations, it continues its policy of sanctions and continues
its baseless claims against Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States cut off relations with Iran during the 1979
revolution, after students seized its embassy in Tehran and held 52
diplomats captive. It also has classified Iran as a state that
sponsors terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the paradoxes of Iran's budding reform movement, some
of its most prominent advocates for opening the country to the
outside world and institutionalizing democratic values were either
hostage-takers or supporters of the seizure.
</P>
<P>
   The poor showing by Rafsanjani, a veteran political operator who
has held high government positions since the Islamic revolution 21
years ago, surprised even his reformist critics.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the Feb. 18 elections, most
commentators considered Rafsanjani a shoo-in not only for a
Parliament seat, but also for the post of speaker.
</P>
<P>
   He was described as a man who could provide balance in the
Parliament between the up-and-coming leftists and their adversaries
on the right. Many analysts had assumed that most Tehran voters,
who could choose 30 candidates, would include Rafsanjani as a
stabilizing factor.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Iran, Rafsanjani had long been considered a moderate who
allowed the publication of independent newspapers and took steps to
liberalize the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, some pro-Khatami activists have accused him
of steering government contracts to family members during his
presidency and failing to support the cause of reformers jailed
over the last two years for expressing political views.
</P>
<P>
   One Tehran-based diplomat said his analysis showed that between
140 and 150 incumbent parliamentarians failed to gain the minimum
number of votes on Friday to keep their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is a core group of senior right-wing lawmakers who
formed a powerful directorate of deputies under the Parliament
speaker, Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri. Nouri did not run for re-election.
He lost in the presidential race two and a half years ago to
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran incumbents who lost their seats included Jabat Larijani,
the brother of the head of state television, and Hassan Rohani, the
first deputy speaker. A former intelligence chief, Ali Fallahian,
was also not re-elected. Some reformers have called for Fallahian
to be questioned by the police about what he may know about the
murders of prominent liberals in Tehran that took place during his
tenure. President Khatami has said the murders were carried out by
``rogue'' intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   Another outspoken hard-liner, Ali Zadsar, lost his re-election
bid. Zadsar was one of the parliamentarians who tried last year to
impeach the liberal culture minister, Ataollah Mohajerani. Ahmed
Rasouli-Nejad, another incumbent involved in the impeachment
attempt, also lost.

   Rafsanjani, Mohtashemi, Karroubi: the list is endless, all men
from the past, a few of them _ Mohtashemi comes to mind _ with
blood on their hands and a number of ``pro-Khatamists'' (not,
mercifully, candidates) with blood all over them.
</P>
<P>
   Why, wasn't that friendly Ayatollah Khalkhali advocating reform
this month the very same Ayatollah Khalkhali whom I interviewed in
Qom all of 20 years ago, after he had hanged men like thrushes in
Evin Prison, including a 14-year-old old boy for whom, he said, he
had no conscience because he had ``sent him to heaven?''
</P>
<P>
   And what of those stories now moving through the bazaars? In the
decade up to 1998, so they say, up to 100 dissidents were
``disappeared'' in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Gangi, probably the finest Iranian investigative
journalist _ there are precious few around _ is demanding a truth
commission to find out who ordered their murders.
</P>
<P>
   How high did their death warrant go? Wasn't Ali Akbar Mohtashemi
an interior minister after the revolution? Wasn't Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani the president when all those men were put to death?
</P>
<P>
   And isn't that the same Rafsanjani who is now a pro-Khatami
``reformist,'' aching, no doubt, to become speaker of the new
pro-Khatami parliament?
</P>
<P>
   So what is this new parliament going to look like? It may call
itself ``reformist'' but _ like a cup of tea that is steadily mixed
with coffee _ it may not taste like tea when it is drunk. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I put this point to the men waiting to vote outside the mosque
in the Seyed Khandan district. Wasn't there a danger, I asked, that
the parliament's 290 members would look rather similar to the
gentlemen who filled the previous anti-Khatami assembly?
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't the ``reformist'' movement being diluted? Weren't there
one or two men who might be seeking to avoid retribution and keep
their profits by joining the winning team?
</P>
<P>
   One of the men told me to read a copy of Thursday's ``Asre
Azadegam'' which had listed all the ``bad events'' since the
revolution, and another said _ using the same words as a woman
candidate I had met earlier _ that ``there was a kind of change in
these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some had admitted their mistakes, he said. And no one had to
vote for them. Had not one ``reformist'' party refused to put
Rafsanjani on their list because he was not ``Shafafiyat'' _ a
lovely new Iranian word that means ``straight-talking?''
</P>
<P>
   A publisher of political works and modern Iranian literature,
this bespectacled voter _ note that they haven't yet reached the
point of wanting their names printed _ insisted kindly that the
``men of the past'' had changed their attitude towards society.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference from the first period of the
revolution,'' he said. ``These men have learned to pay attention to
what we say and what we want.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its initial stage, our revolution was like the French and
Russian revolutions. At first they thought they had to be radical
but little by little they understood that radicalism isn't good in
any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Such trust he reposed in the men he was electing, such
simplicity. But it was moving all the same. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People laugh in Tehran again now. Their jokes have become
powerful, daring.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pro-Khatami parties has a slogan _ ``Ei Iran, Ei
marze, pourgohar'' _ which means ``Oh Iran, the precious
homeland.'' Note the lack of the world ``Islamic.'' And note _ much
more to the point _ that this was the title of a popular song
during the reign of the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Was this really the same Tehran I remember 21 years ago? The
same people? The same proud, stubborn, brave, single-minded race
that walked in their tens of thousands into the Shah's guns?
</P>
<P>
   I watched that extraordinary revolution and the world seemed to
have changed. America was no longer able to maintain its power
throughout the Middle East. A dynasty had been swept away in
Robespierre blood and fury. But yesterday Friday, instead of
shouting ``Death to America,'' they queued for hours to vote for a
new, gentler revolution that would belong to them.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could share all their faith but like all Persian tales,
I think this needs a familiar sign off: To Be Continued. &QL;

<P>
   CHIBUTO, MOZAMBIQUE _ Four days ago in Washington, U.S.
President Bill Clinton proclaimed Mozambique the world's
fastest-growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Tiago Chauque, 35, was up a tree, saving
himself, but none of his hard-earned belongings, from the country's
worst floods in living memory.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he was probably out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work in a South African gold mine. They dismiss you if you
don't turn up for work. I have a wife and five children to
support,'' he said as he waited, stranded, at Chibuto, 150 km (100
miles) northeast of the capital, Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   Here, a patch of grass large enough to land a plane protrudes
from an endless landscape of sand-colored flood water which has cut
the former Portuguese colony in two. But there were no planes
Tuesday for Chauque or the 50 others who had made it to the
airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   A French air force transporter brought emergency rations and
jerry cans but left without any flood refugees.
</P>
<P>
   For all President Clinton's fine words, an African economic
dream _ which enjoyed three successive years of GDP growth
exceeding 10 percent less than a decade after the end of a 16-year
civil war _ has been washed away.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse, say meteorologists. Cyclone Eline, 60
km (37 miles) wide and bearing winds of up to 260 kph (160 mph),
hit the coast Tuesday considerably north of the already flooded
Gaza province, where some 70,000 people have lost their homes,
crops and livestock.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Alain Dupleix, a French air force navigator working in
the disaster zone, a second ``intense tropical cyclone'' _ the
highest rating possible _ is on its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyclone Felicia is three days from Reunion Island and could be
here in a week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Chibuto, everyone knows the disaster is not over. ``The
Limpopo, the Elephant River and all their tributaries have burst
their banks because of rain which did not even come with cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know more rain is coming and the dams in Zimbabwe and South
Africa are overflowing,'' said Donato Salomao Mate, a local
councillor. ``As soon as one of the dams opens its walls, we will
be climbing the trees again. It is only a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Salomao Mate has found shelter for 6,000 people in churches and
municipal buildings near Chibuto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic consequences are dire. We grow maize, beans,
groundnuts and casava here. The harvest was just about to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maputo, at the World Food Program's coordination center,
Inyene Udoyen said helicopter pilots had seen feats of survival
befitting this miracle economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are taking sheets of roofing into the trees and
doing their cooking in the treetops while they wait to be
airlifted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The international community has been quick to react because,
according to the French ambassador, Bernadette Lefort, ``the
Mozambicans are very resourceful and efficient, even if they lack
the transport.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain has pledged aid; Italy has sent rubber dinghies; France
has sent a Transall and 11 crew; Spain has sent a planeload of food
and tents; and South Africa is engaged in a massive helicopter
rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the impact of the floods, the as-yet unknown damage
that will be caused by Eline _ which was Tuesday tearing roofs off
in Inhambane and Sofala provinces as it moved west _ and the future
possible ravages of Cyclone Felicia have devastated the country's
morale.
</P>
<P>
   No one has started counting the material cost yet, but it will
be extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. warns that well-buried landmines from the war that
ended in 1992 will rise to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism developments built in the past five years _ and which
offered the promise that Mozambique would become a top destination
_ have been swept into the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Lefort said: ``Nobody dares even start counting yet.
As an example, a sugar mill, into which French, German, Portuguese
and South African investors ploughed $20 million (pounds
sterling12.5 million), has just gone. I hate to think what the
international investors are making of this.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Female business owners pump profit into Georgia economy
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's female-owned businesses are a powerful
economic engine, according to a study released Tuesday at the state
Capitol by the Center for Policy Alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   These companies' annual revenue in Georgia tops $182 billion,
giving the state a sixth-place ranking in the nation. Female-owned
firms also employ more than 1 million people, the Washington,
D.C.-based nonprofit group reports.
</P>
<P>
   Since the state now boasts nearly 250,000 companies owned by
women, CPA President Linda Tarr-Whelan says it's time to take the
next steps _ collect data, open up business procurement processes
and address the benefits and retirement issues that this powerful
new segment of the economy will need.
</P>
<P>
   Female-owned companies employ one-quarter of U.S. workers and
generate $3.6 trillion in annual sales, she said. Yet, Tarr-Whelan
noted, only 18 states currently collect any data about female-owned
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But today's business climate for women is still a far cry from
the old days when it was tough for a woman in the Peach State to
get her own credit card, much less the capital to start her own
business.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Hanenkrat, president of JSH Building Services, a
25-year-old commercial cleaning firm, said that now ``a great new
generation is out there doing great things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A new cycle has begun, as some women my age are retiring or
selling their companies, merging into larger firms or even
investing in other people's start-ups,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls the mid-1980s when a handful of women started Women
Business Owners of Atlanta. It joined the National Association of
Women Business Owners in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's chapter of NAWBO now has 130 members, said Dale
Miller, corporate partners chair and owner of Corporate Promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Members' businesses include computer companies, construction
firms, employment services, health-care companies, and advertising
companies.
</P>
<P>
   One of her group's goals is keeping the pipeline open for new
female entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numbers draw more numbers, and (that will help us) have a
voice with the state Legislature,'' Miller said.

GORE CAMP SEES FEW RISKS IN STAYING ON THE OFFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take to move by 9 p.m. ET)  
(nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Anyone tuning in to the Democratic debate Monday
night saw two extremely aggressive candidates going full tilt at
each other. Bill Bradley, who trails in all the polls behind Vice
President Al Gore, had obvious reasons to try to make his mark. But
Gore's nostril-flaring performance, and his combative campaigning
over the last few weeks, have raised questions about why, when he
appears to be so far ahead in the race for the party's presidential
nomination, he feels the need to be so pugnacious.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers say that the vice president has several reasons to
keep the heat on Bradley and that there are few risks in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The central fact is that Bradley, whose campaign has seemed
desultory and dispirited since he lost the New Hampshire primary
three weeks ago, has needed to change the dynamic of the race. The
debate Monday night in Harlem presented him with an opportunity.
The Gore camp anticipated that Bradley would intensify his
criticisms of the vice president, and Gore was fully prepared, even
boning up with his usual Bradley stand-in, Tom Downey, the former
congressman, playing his role with a new militancy.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's posture in the debate only mirrors his posture in the
campaign at large. Gore wants the world to know he is a fighter _ a
quality that he needs to assert now to prod core Democrats to the
primaries and a reputation he needs to build to woo independents in
November.
</P>
<P>
   He is constantly growling to his audiences, ``I want to fight
for you!'' He is running a television commercial that shows him, in
fast clips with a driving beat, as a fighter _ against pollution
and drug companies and for Medicare and Medicaid. At a Democratic
party speech in San Jose earlier this month, he questioned
Bradley's loyalty to the party and his commitment to the cause. He
told reporters last week that his job was to ``pour on the gas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy is to campaign very hard, prosecute this case
very vigorously,'' said Bob Shrum, a top Gore adviser. ``Gore is
going to go out and make his case all over the country in a
national primary, which is what this is.''
</P>
<P>
   This is reflected in Gore's relentless campaign schedule, which
often includes four or five events a day and has him traveling in
the wee hours. Tuesday was a rare day off in a campaign that has
been crisscrossing the country and all time zones. On Wednesday he
heads to Florida, South Carolina and New York, and this weekend he
begins a West Coast swing. He is keeping up a pace more often seen
in a general election in the fall than in the winter primaries.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the simple fact that Gore does not yet have the
nomination. Although he has pulled away from Bradley in the polls,
his campaign believes he cannot let up until he has locked up the
nomination. And yet, while Gore's standing in the polls is
improving, surveys show that voters still have a lingering doubt
about his capacity as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, Gore has found success as a combatant,
particularly in debate formats. He came to the presidential
campaign with a history as a fierce debater. Remember Ross Perot?
And in his previous match-ups against Bradley, Gore has found an
easy foil, someone who, despite his years in competitive
basketball, has not been quick to respond or defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley was given a chance in Monday's encounter at the
Apollo Theater to say that Gore did not have the character to be
president, he offered a typically ambivalent response. On the one
hand, Bradley said, ``If Al were the nominee I would support him.''
But he then delivered the heart of his newly packaged criticism of
Gore, branding him a ``conservative,'' and adding that he ``did not
support national health insurance, had an 84 percent right-to-life
voting record, and was the poster boy for the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, wagging his finger constantly, laced his comments with
derision and sarcasm and kept accusing Bradley of false charges.
</P>
<P>
   He called Bradley ``desperate'' and in a few rehearsed zingers
said he was ``the only Democrat in America who misses Ken Starr''
and nearly accused him of initiating racial profiling, saying:
``Racial profiling practically began in New Jersey, senator.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley camp says Gore is especially fired up these days
because he is worried that Bradley could still turn the race
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore knows that his support is very soft,'' said Cornel West,
a top Bradley adviser. West also said that Gore should be concerned
about the Republican contest, where Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
who has strong backing from independents, is battling Gov. George
Bush of Texas. ``If McCain gets pushed out, independents begin to
look toward Bradley,'' West said.

   KARABULAK, Russia _ By any reasonable judgment, life is
unspeakable for the 6,000 or so denizens of the Solglacia refugee
camp, a network of 250 tents and a strand of rail cars set along
the sinuous main road to Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   There is one water spigot. Electricity was spotty until January.
Hot meals ceased altogether three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But all it takes to abandon reason is a brief drive a couple of
miles toward Grozny, to Mukharbek Hashtyrov's abandoned pig farm.
And suddenly, life in a green tent with any water at all begins to
look luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   Solglacia and the Hashtyrov pig farm are bookends in Chechnya's
lesser-noticed tragedy: the endless stream of war refugees westward
into the overwhelmed province of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   This gerrymander-shaped state of barely 300,000 souls has now
absorbed more than 210,000 war victims, and with the Russian
government's seizure and purging of Chechnya's capital, Grozny, the
tide is again rising, by 300 a day at mid-month.
</P>
<P>
   As in the war, the hardest-hit are innocents who happen to be in
the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   The lucky ones _ 20,000 or so at most _ wind up at two model
refugee camps just across the border from Chechnya with the odd
nicknames of Solglacia (or in English, Agreement) and Sputnik. In
both government-run camps, families live in hundreds of green and
tan tents staked out on grids of bulldozed roads.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more live in long strands of passenger rail cars on
abandoned tracks next to each camp. The less fortunate _ now up to
190,000 people _ sometimes find a way to share private homes. The
unluckiest of all are cast into small encampments; some are
semi-organized, but all too many are squatters' outposts like the
Hashtyrov pig farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stay in cattle farms; in mosques; in former factories,''
said Alexander Petrov, the deputy director of the Moscow office of
Human Rights Watch, who is in Ingushetia monitoring the refugee
situation. ``There are hundreds of such places.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are surely few that are more demeaning than the
Hashtyrov place, a crumbling collection of 19 narrow, long-deserted
brick sheds set on a landscape of abandoned machinery and tall
grass.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in buildings filled with trash, dirt and hundreds of
rusted sties, nearly 380 refugees from the Chechen war have staked
out claims on the meanest of spaces. Eight and ten at a time, they
squat in concrete storage rooms at each end of the pig sheds, all
devoid of water or toilets. Each is by rubber hoses that feed
stolen gas into jury-rigged space heaters.
</P>
<P>
   In one 7-by-19-foot room, beneath a single light bulb, beside
the blanket-covered planks that serve as the family bed,
39-year-old Roza Murdolova gathered her seven children around her
Thursday afternoon. Her husband, 43-year-old Supyan, is an invalid.

FINNISH PAPER GIANT STORA ENSO TO BUY CONSOLIDATED PAPERS, INC. 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that marks the fourth major paper-industry merger or
acquisition in less than two weeks, the big Finnish paper company
Stora Enso said Tuesday that it would acquire Consolidated Papers
Inc., based in Wisconsin Rapids, Wis. The deal is valued at $3.9
billion, plus the assumption of $900 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The merged company's combined sales of $13.2 billion in 1999
place it a distant second in revenue to the International Paper
Co., which sells a bigger proportion of high-priced stock, and had
$25 billion in sales. The new company, though, will probably be the
world's largest producer in terms of paper tonnage.
</P>
<P>
   Stora Enso is paying $44 a share for Consolidated, a rich
premium over the company's preannouncement closing price of $26.
Investors thought Consolidated got the better deal: its stock
jumped $10 on Tuesday to $36, while Stora Enso's shares lost 2
euros, to 11.10 euros, in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts hailed the merger as another sign that the
fragmented paper industry was building a global business. ``This
sea change that we've been expecting is finally happening,'' said
Kathryn F. McAuley, a Brown Brothers Harriman analyst, ``and we're
seeing real globalization of the industry,
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, UPM-Kymmene, also of Finland, bought
Champion International, creating a behemoth in coated papers;
Abitibi-Consolidated bought Donohue Inc., creating a leader in
newsprint, and International Paper, which bought Union Camp last
year, said it would acquire Shorewood Packaging, which had been
embroiled in a takeover battle with the Chesapeake Corp. when
International Paper made its offer.
</P>
<P>
   More deals are in the works. The New Zealand conglomerate
Fletcher Challenge has said it wants to sell its newsprint
operations. Norske Skog is said to be looking for a North American
acquisition. And on Friday, St. Laurent Paperboard of Canada said
it was in merger talks. It did not specify with whom, but the name
swirling around Wall Street was that of Smurfit-Stone Container,
the world's biggest corrugated-box maker _ itself formed when
Jefferson Smurfit gobbled up the Stone Container Corp. in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the mergers, paper remains a highly fragmented
industry. ``You can still find 30 or 40 publicly traded paper
companies in the U.S., and probably another 15 in Canada,'' said
Mark Wilde of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, noting that even
International Paper, the industry leader, accounts for only about 5
percent of the 300 million tons of paper produced worldwide each
year.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of cohesion has cost the industry dearly. Most
companies expanded wildly when paper prices started to soar in the
mid-'90s. When economic troubles overseas put the brakes on demand,
the industry found itself drowning in capacity. Prices and profit
plummeted late in 1995, and did not recover until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, industries like publishing and manufacturing, which
are prime customers for paper, have been consolidating into global
powerhouses that want to deal with global suppliers. ``They want to
deal with the same supplier all over the world,'' McAuley said,
``but they don't want their paper shipped to Chicago from
Finland.''
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment, consolidation may have been inevitable.
The European paper companies began merging several years ago and
the resulting big producers, like Stora Enso, are now looking to
North America for merger partners. North American companies,
though, are still joining mainly with each other. ``The American
companies may be missing chances to expand into higher-growth
markets,'' Wilde said.
</P>
<P>
   And the industry has returned to good times. After a dismal 1997
and 1998, most companies were profitable last year, and McAuley,
for one, predicts that profits will remain robust through 2002.
Consolidation can only improve the profit picture, as merged
companies close older plants and eliminate administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The result has not yet translated to higher prices. ``We may see
more pricing power but we're far from being an oligopoly yet,''
McAuley said.
</P>
<P>
   The deals may help smooth out some of the wild swings that have
characterized paper pricing. And they are likely to buoy profit.
``It doesn't mean anything for prices,'' said John V. Faraci,
International Paper's chief financial officer, ``but it's enabling
all of us to get costs out and to put more money into product
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say stockholders will settle for nothing less.
``Shareholders have made it clear they want financial returns
improved,'' Wilde said, ``that they want CEO's to stop building
plants and start rationalizing their businesses.''

 &HT;    Avery's a Brave again
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ All it took was some small talk during
spring-training stretching, and look who's back.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves signed Steve Avery to a minor-league contract
Tuesday, giving him a chance to return to the rotation he once
helped to headline. Avery was MVP of the 1991 National League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   It happened because Braves manager Bobby Cox and John Smoltz
were shooting the breeze before the workout for pitchers and
catchers at the Disney complex Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avery's name came up, and I asked who he was with, and Smoltz
said nobody,'' Cox said. ``I said, `Give me his number. We'll call
him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, Avery was throwing his first side session with
the Braves since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been dying to get down here,'' said Avery, who is coming
off Aug. 5 shoulder surgery. ``I'm sitting (at home in Michigan) in
the snow, watching all the spring-training highlights on TV, and
... it's driving me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery, the third pick overall of the 1988 draft, spent the first
seven years of his 10-year career with the Braves but hasn't been
himself since the mid-'90s. He had a losing record in four of the
past five years, and his ERA hasn't been below 4.00 since 1993. The
speed on Avery's fastball had dipped to the upper-70s. He finally
underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a frayed rotator cuff,
remove a bone spur and reattach his labrum to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not completely recovered,'' general manager John
Schuerholz said, ``but we think we can help him in his
rehabilitation right here, and it gives us an opportunity to look
at another real quality, still very young pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery has been throwing off the mound since January and said he
thinks he'll be ready for the start of the season. After watching
him throw in January, Reds assistant general manager Doc Rodgers
said, ``Wow, that's the old Steve Avery.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of a mix-up over Avery's free-agency status, the Reds
apparently didn't realize they wouldn't be able to sign him until
May 1, which left Avery thinking about going elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He will compete with Bruce Chen to become the fifth starter.
Terry Mulholland is another option, although the Braves would like
to have him in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Avery) is 29, smart as the dickens about how to pitch and
stubborn, too,'' Cox said. ``I look at it as drafting somebody out
of high school. It's a risk, but ...I like his chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds management reportedly suspected that Avery hid injuries so
contract bonuses would kick in for innings pitched and appearances.
Avery denies it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have said, `I can still go out there. I can handle a
little bit of pain,''' Avery said. ``This year, I made a pact to
myself that, if I felt like I did last year, to stop. It's one
thing not to go out there 100 percent, but there were times when I
was 50 percent.''

<P>
   In a finding that medical experts called ``troubling'' and
``very surprising,'' researchers are reporting Wednesday that the
number of preschoolers taking stimulants, antidepressants and other
psychiatric drugs rose sharply from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The use of stimulants _ most commonly methylphenidate, the
generic form of Ritalin _ increased twofold to threefold for
children ages 2 through 4 enrolled in two state Medicaid programs
and one health maintenance organization in the Northwest, the
researchers found. The number of children receiving prescriptions
for antidepressants doubled in the Medicaid programs. The use of
clonidine, a blood pressure drug gaining popularity as a treatment
for attention disorders, also jumped among the group of more than
200,000 children studied.
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers have known for some time that such drugs
are increasingly being prescribed for older children, the study,
which appears in Wednesday's issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Association, is the first to document an increase among
children under 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to support the anecdotes that more U.S. children
are receiving a diagnosis and treatment for attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder in the late 1990s than ever before,'' said
Dr. Julie Magno Zito, an associate professor of pharmacy and
medicine at the University of Maryland and lead author of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have shown significant increases in the use of
stimulants and antidepressants to treat children 5 to 19. In a
smaller study of Medicaid enrollees in Michigan, done in 1998,
researchers found that of 223 children under age 4 who were
identified as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 57
percent received at least one drug to treat the condition.
</P>
<P>
   Though the total number of very young children in the latest
study who received prescriptions for the drugs was small, 1 percent
to 1.5 percent, the increase is disturbing, the researchers said,
because research on the safety and efficacy of the medications,
scant for older children, is virtually nonexistent for
preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any benchmarks to know if this is or is not a
problem,'' Zito said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Hyman, director of the National Institute of Mental
Health, said that he was ``more than shocked'' by the findings. The
use of psychiatric drugs in young children, he said, is ``an area
of enormous concern,'' and one that Hyman has made a priority in
the institute's funding of research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly need clinical trials of safety and efficacy for
both pharmacological and psychosocial treatments in young
children,''said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he added, he is sympathetic ``to the intense
need to do something for children who really are so terribly sick
that other means cannot control their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the researchers did not track the diagnoses given to the
children or the training of the professionals who prescribed the
drugs, the reasons for the increases are not clear.
</P>
<P>
   But experts speculated that the reasons might include the
reluctance of HMOs and subsidized medical care programs to pay for
counseling or other treatments that did not involve drugs, the
pressures from parents and schools to diagnose attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder in children, the rise of drugs as the
preferred mode of treatment and the fact that most prescriptions in
subsidized settings are written by primary care doctors rather than
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the drugs, Zito and other experts pointed out, are
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating children
of preschool age. The package insert for methylphenidate, for
example, carries a warning against prescribing the drug to children
under 6.
</P>
<P>
   While prescribing drugs for purposes not approved by the FDA,
called off-label prescribing, is both legal and common in the
treatment of older patients, the practice raises more difficult
issues in young children.
</P>
<P>
   When a doctor prescribes a drug off-label for a child, Zito
said, parents ``should be aware that they are entering an area of
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms of emotional or behavioral problems displayed by
children under 5 may be different from those exhibited by older
children, and diagnosis of such conditions in preschoolers is at
best iffy. As Dr. Joseph Coyle, chairman of psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School, commented, the normal behavior of many children
ages 2 and 3 looks a lot like attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Zito said, ``It is not really clear that children this young
could meet the diagnostic criteria for either attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder or depression, and those are the probable
diagnoses given to justify the use of stimulants, clonidine and
antidepressants.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more worrisome, experts said, is the fact that little is
known about the effects of antidepressants, stimulants and other
psychoactive drugs on brain development. Studies in animals
indicate that the brain chemicals that are targeted by some such
drugs play an important role in the proliferation of nerve cells in
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``These interventions are occurring at a critical time in brain
development,'' said Coyle, who wrote an editorial accompanying the
report, ``and we don't know what consequences are.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Zito's study, methylphenidate was by far the most popular
stimulant prescribed for preschoolers, accounting for 90 percent of
stimulant prescriptions. In the Midwestern Medicaid group, 11.1 of
every 1,000 children ages 2 to 5 were prescribed methylphenidate in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   In the HMO and in a mid-Atlantic Medicaid group, the number of
girls receiving prescriptions for stimulants increased more in five
years than the number of boys, researchers found, suggesting that
attention disorders were increasingly being diagnosed in girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that girls are more likely than in the past to
be getting medicated,'' Zito said, ``where attention deficit
disorder used to be more of little boys' disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Among antidepressants, the older generation of ``tricyclic''
drugs remained the most commonly prescribed, though the number of
children receiving newer medications like like Prozac and Zoloft
increased sharply in the Medicaid programs over the five years. In
the Midwestern Medicaid group, 3.2 of every 1,000 preschoolers
received prescriptions for antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   Though clonidine was prescribed far less frequently than
stimulant drugs, the researchers said, its increased use was
``particularly notable,'' because there were no rigorous studies
demonstrating that it was a safe or effective as a treatment. The
study found that 2.3 children per 1,000 in the Midwestern Medicaid
group received prescriptions for the drug in 1995, compared to 0.1
child per 1,000 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Heart problems have been reported in children taking clonidine
in combination with other drugs, including Ritalin, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the increase in other drugs, the use of
antipsychotic drugs for preschoolers remained constant over the
five-year period at about 0.7 children per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Zito and her colleagues noted that the findings of the study may
not apply to all other medical settings. But she said she suspected
that the use of stimulants to treat attention disorders was even
more prevalent among children from higher-income families.

A JAPANESE TREASURE MOVES TO THE MIDWEST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. _ Over 20 years, Alan Strassman, a Boston
investment manager, collected 95 Japanese paintings from the Edo
period (1615-1848).
</P>
<P>
   Twenty were gloriously painted screens that included depictions
of a field of tall grasses glowing gold in the moonlight, corpulent
gods wrestling, evocative scenes from ``The Tales of Genji,'' wild
dancing in the streets near a tea house and a Noh theater
performance in an aristocrat's courtyard. His collection became one
of the largest and finest of its kind in private hands.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, when he bought his first scroll painting _ which
showed a tiger gazing at the moon (prompting him later to call his
Edo works the Tiger Collection) _ Strassman was dazzled by, as he
put it, the ``unique flat perspective'' in Japanese art. ``It was
striking and beautiful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was also impressed by the history and stories depicted in
these works on paper and silk, and soon assembled a library of
1,400 books on the subject. ``Much of Edo painting has roots in
mythology, roots in history, roots in some kind of narrative that
is deep in the Japanese psyche,'' he said. ``There is something
literary that lies behind each image, making these paintings
especially meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   As the collection grew, he enjoyed planning exhibitions of the
works in his home, frequently changing them to avoid overexposure
to light and moisture. He even had a vault built there to store
them. Their fragility and his space limitations made it impossible
to view all of his collection at one time.
</P>
<P>
   But Strassman will finally be able to see most of these Edo
paintings when they go on view in ``300 Years of Japanese Painting:
New Treasures for Indianapolis,'' an exhibition that opens at the
Indianapolis Museum of Art on May 20 and remains until Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the museum acquired 70 works from the Tiger
Collection, including the 20 screens. The museum paid more than $7
million, and Strassman donated five screens and his library.
</P>
<P>
   The show will not include 25 scrolls that Strassman still owns;
he plans to give them to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where
he is a trustee and was board president from 1993 to 1997. But the
exhibition will also include five Edo scrolls that were bought by
the Indianapolis museum from Leighton Longhi, the New York dealer
from whom Strassman acquired most of his Edo art.
</P>
<P>
   ``These works strengthen the collection at key points,'' said
James Robinson, the museum's curator of Asian art.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions, with a total value of $10 million, represent
the largest purchase of Japanese art by an American museum, and are
the Indianapolis Museum of Art's second-largest purchase, exceeded
only by the $30 million it paid in 1998 for 101 paintings and
prints by Paul Gauguin and his Pont-Aven followers.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's Japanese additions complement these works as well
as works by other early modernists of the late 19th century, most
of whom were influenced by Edo paintings. The acquisition more than
doubled the museum's Japanese art holdings; its Edo collection now
ranks with those of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston, the Smithsonian's Freer Gallery and the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``These works, which are in immaculate condition, are of a
quality and rarity no longer available in the art market at any
price,'' said Bret Waller, the Indianapolis museum's director.
``The weakness of the economy in Asia in recent years became a
major factor in making this purchase possible. And we were lucky:
the prices for Japanese art had not escalated as swiftly as those
paid for other artworks.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is part of the museum's $160 million development
plan, which will include an expansion of the Asian art galleries to
accommodate the Japanese acquisitions. Until now, such holdings
were overshadowed by the museum's substantial Chinese art
collection, the core of which was donated by Eli Lilly, the
pharmaceutical magnate, who was the museum's largest benefactor
until his death in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion also reflects the museum's awareness of the
growing Japanese presence in Indiana. Today, there are some 200
Japanese companies, including Toyota, Subaru and Isuzu, in the
state, employing more than 40,000 workers. Since 1993, Indiana has
led the nation in attracting new Japanese investment and now ranks
third, after California and Ohio, in the total amount invested: $8
billion plus.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's search for Japanese art began in 1997, when
Robinson alerted dealers in this country and abroad that the museum
was interested in acquiring a major holding. But he never expected
that he would luck into anything like the Tiger Collection, which
includes all the major traditions of Edo painting.
</P>
<P>
   The screens are the stars of the exhibition, revealing the
virtuosity that the Japanese achieved in this art form during the
Edo period, a level of screenmaking unmatched anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all the scrolls and screens are exhibited together, I
hope that the extraordinary density will give people a sense of the
opulence of this collection,'' Robinson said. ``It cuts a broad
swath through Edo painting, something that should knock your socks
off.''

COMMENTARY: THE DISHONEST TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to be a brilliant political analyst to realize
that the Republican nominee for president (gosh, I wonder who it
will be?) is going to have trouble making an economic case for his
candidacy. As Bill Clinton put it, declaring that he had a ``lot of
sympathy'' for the Republicans: ``I mean, it's hard for them to
figure out what to run on. They can't run against the longest
economic expansion in history.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but they can try to claim credit for it. In the months
ahead, there will be a deafening chorus of pundits insisting that
it was Ronald Reagan who laid the foundations for our extraordinary
prosperity _ indeed that today's prosperity is the ultimate
vindication of Reaganomics.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I happened to read a fairly typical example of the
genre, an article titled ``It's the Reagan Economy, Stupid.'' The
piece, circulated by a neo-Reaganite pressure group called The Club
for Growth, was written by Lawrence Kudlow, who was an adviser to
Steve Forbes' campaign, and the club's president, Stephen Moore. (
Moore is also director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato
Institute.) The title says it all: Rapid growth in the late '90s is
the continuing legacy of Reagan's tax cuts, way back in 1981. And
reading the piece, an idea occurred to me.
</P>
<P>
   You see, the usual riposte to this sort of thing involves a
weary reiteration of the basic economics involved. One tries, for
the umpteenth time, to explain that nothing extraordinary happened
to the U.S. economy during the Reagan years. Well before the events
of the '80s, scenarios of disinflation had become standard
exercises in the macroeconomics textbooks. In these scenarios, an
initial period of rising unemployment and slow or negative growth
would be followed by a period of rapid, non-inflationary growth and
falling unemployment, with the unemployment rate ending up about
where it started. And that's just what happened. But though it's
the simple truth, this explanation is too complicated to be heard
over the shouting.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you say we focus on the character issue instead? Are
the commentators who say that our current prosperity vindicates
Reaganomics being honest? If they are, then if things had gone
differently _ if the economy had done badly under Bill Clinton _
logic implies that they would have reached a different conclusion.
If good news vindicates the Reagan legacy, bad news would have
called it into question, right?
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I could stop right there. You know and I know that if
the economy were slumping instead of booming, the same people would
triumphantly contrast the Clinton record with Reagan's and declare
the contrast _ surprise! _ a vindication of Reaganomics.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't have to leave this as a mere conjecture. Instead we
can be scholarly, and look at the literature _ that is, earlier
writings by some of the Reaganite faithful, from the years before
it became clear that their problem would be how to explain away the
economy's continuing success.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it so happens that in October 1996, little more
than three years ago, Moore and William Niskanen, Cato's chairman,
put out a report titled ``Supply-side tax cuts and the truth about
the Reagan economic record.'' This report was vehement in insisting
that in assessing Reagan's achievement one must not include any
data after 1989, which marks the end of the Reagan era; the years
from 1981 to 1989 ``provide a convenient and unique laboratory-like
testing ground for assessing the success or failure of
Reaganomics.'' And the report went on to argue that the slower
growth from 1989 to 1995 demonstrated the superiority of Reaganite
policies.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get much better than this. If the post-Reagan economy
stumbles, the great man's responsibility ends on the day he left
office. But if the good times keep rolling, so does Reagan's
legacy. As they say in the scholarly journals: Gotcha!
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this will make any difference either to the
views or the behavior of the faithful. Commentators will
commentate, fulminators will fulminate, and everyone will pretend
to base his arguments on the evidence. But now that you know the
truth, here's a suggestion: Next time you hear a talking head start
to explain how Ronald Reagan deserves the credit for Bill Clinton's
economy, switch to the Discovery Channel _ where you might actually
learn something.

CONSERVATIVE BARD OF THE DEMIMONDE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 David Bahr's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about Tim
Roth and his film, ``The War Zone.''  
 By DAVID BAHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul Morrissey disdains rock music, abhors
recreational drugs and thinks even less of liberal politics. When
asked his views on sex, he pauses for a moment, looks his
inquisitor in the eye and says: ``I'm Catholic. I'm with Rome 100
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments may seem surprising coming from a director whose
films luxuriate in the libertine lives of heroin users,
masturbating transvestites and polymorphous-perverse male
prostitutes. Yet Morrissey _ who from 1966 to 1972 directed more
than half a dozen movies produced by Andy Warhol, discovered the
avant-garde rock band the Velvet Underground and once saw a court
label his work ``obscene, vulgar and profane'' _ believes he's
misunderstood, to say nothing of misrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every movie I've ever made says the same thing,'' said the
dapper, Morrissey, 61, recently over tea and cookies at Manhattan's
Carlyle Hotel. Presumably, that includes ``Trash,'' which will be
shown at the New York Underground Film Festival at Anthology Film
Archives on Friday and open in New York and Los Angeles on March 17
to mark its 30th anniversary. ``They all find comedy in people
trying to live their lives without any rules,'' he said. ``They are
a record of the period, but without any overt messages. And I think
that confuses people.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceived, directed and photographed by Morrissey, ``Trash''
chronicles the debauched behavior of a group of affable human
oddities living in lower Manhattan during the late 1960s. The
second work in the trilogy that includes ``Flesh'' (1968) and
``Heat'' (1971), it attempted to capture, as Morrissey put it,
``the dead-end existence of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the second Warhol-produced film, after ``Flesh,'' in
which Morrissey had total creative control, though the trilogy
remains commonly identified with, and filed in video shops under,
the Warhol name _ which does not particularly please the director.
``How many films written, directed and photographed by one person
are given co-authorship with their presenter?'' asked a riled
Morrissey. ``I don't know any. But because Andy is a celebrity,
people have to think of him before they think of the movies, which
is grotesque.''
</P>
<P>
   For those familiar with Warhol's numerous films, including
``Sleep'' (1963), which depicts a man sleeping, and ``Couch''
(1964), which shows a series of people conversing on a couch,
Morrissey's movies offer something Warhol's never did: plots. They
also demonstrate Morrissey's unmistakable flair for quirky casting.
In the trilogy, the director follows a colorful collection of
lovable deadbeats, focusing primarily on the quietly charismatic
and usually naked Joe Dallesandro (simply ``Joe'' in the films) as
he evolves from a male hustler in ``Flesh'' to a junkie in
``Trash'' to a washed-up child actor turned aspiring rock singer in
``Heat.'' Employing improvised dialogue delivered mostly by
nonactors, the idiosyncratic films are cinematic exercises in the
mundane, at times tremendously poignant and unexpectedly funny.
</P>
<P>
   Of all his movies, ``Trash'' remains Morrissey's biggest
commercial hit and, arguably, his most emotionally satisfying work.
(After making more than a dozen films over three decades, he gave
up directing in 1988, after his personal favorite, ``Spike of
Bensonhurst,'' was released.) Made for a mere $3,000 and shot on
16-millimeter film, ``Trash'' is a sympathetic portrait of the
chemically anesthetized Joe and his garbage-collecting girlfriend,
Holly (played by the transvestite performer Holly Woodlawn), and
her desperate attempt to attain respectability by getting on the
welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Structurally slack and digressive, the film exhibits a seemingly
aimless humor and directorial imprecision that actually appear
sharper and more effective after repeated viewings. Yet despite its
enduring cult following and an accumulation of positive reviews
since its initial release, ``Trash'' is still dismissed as
amateurish by some film authorities and ignored by others, along
with the rest of Morrissey's work. Ephraim Katz's ``Film
Encyclopedia'' defines Morrissey's movies as ``mediocre''; Leonard
Maltin's latest guide to 20,000 films lists neither ``Flesh'' nor
``Trash''; and ``The St. James Film Directors Encyclopedia,''
edited by the venerable Andrew Sarris, does not mention Morrissey
and his films at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's work has always been in a category of its own,'' says
the avant-garde filmmaker Jonas Mekas, a Village Voice film critic
from 1958-75 and founder of Anthology Film Archives, a showcase for
experimental cinema. ``Those in the avant-garde didn't really get
them. And those who were in Hollywood thought them a little too
loose and amateurish. Like Norman Mailer did in his early films,
Paul used nonactors who improvised. Until then, there were really
only traditionally scripted narratives or documentary-style cinema
verite, which filmed people in real situations, avoiding any
artificial dramatization. Morrissey and Mailer pushed it further by
having nonactors improvise.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``Trash'' achieves an engaging sense of reality
from the uninhibited expression of its nonprofessional actors, many
of whom knew firsthand the counterculture lives they were
portraying. ``There was no script,'' recalled Ms. Woodlawn in a
phone interview from her home in West Hollywood. ``We showed up. He
threw out ideas and rolled the film. There were some retakes but
most of it was done in one shot. The character I was playing was
fictional, but her personality was basically me.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrissey believes that strong personalities, not acting
credentials, make for good screen stars. That is the reason, he
said, that he so frequently cast transvestites. ``Actors should be
instinctive and spontaneous,'' he said. ``If you think about
acting, you're not going to be good. I am the first to use
transvestites that didn't play transvestites, and no one has done
it since. I think the artifice of using a man as a woman makes it
more of a movie. And movies are great because they create
artificial situations, and only through artificial situations does
the real truth sneak out.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrissey's aesthetic of artificiality extends to rawly
simulated depictions of sex and drug use in his films. One
prolonged shot in ``Trash'' shows Dallesandro inserting a
hypodermic needle into his arm and drawing blood as if he were
mainlining heroin. ``So much of the culture glamorized drugs at the
time,'' Dallesandro said in a phone interview from his home in Los
Angeles. ``Paul wanted to show the seedier side, where it all led
to.'' Although the actor, who was 21 at the time, was not told by
Morrissey to puncture his skin, Dallesandro wanted to lend
credibility to the scene. ``I was not some naive kid,'' he said
when asked how he came up with the idea. ``I was already
streetwise.''
</P>
<P>
   It does not seem strange to Morrissey, who professes to being a
political conservative and a devout Catholic, that he would make
affectionate, playful films about unrestrained carnality. ``You
don't put your personal viewpoints in a good movie,'' he said. ``A
movie should only be concerned with characters, not some big moral,
although it's always underneath. I just thought the idea of people
doing whatever they want was a great subject for films. The
characters may be losers, but they're all kind of likable. I can't
imagine putting unlikable characters in a movie. As to why their
lives are so messed up, well, that's for the audience to figure
out.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Woodlawn, it was Morrissey's determination to avoid
moralizing in his films that made them so popular, particularly
among audiences who do not share the filmmaker's political or
religious views. ``Paul is very straight and narrow,'' she said.
``But he's not moralistic. That's why we got along so well. And
that's why his fans run the gamut from A to Z, from old ladies to
gay liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   So what can a conservative like Morrissey possibly make of his
loving, liberal fan base? ``My films show very human characters,''
he said, a faint curmudgeon's smile slowly turning the corners of
his mouth. ``And liberals tend to go to movies, while conservatives
tend to resent anything that rocks the boat.'' He paused, now
grinning widely. ``Of course, not a good conservative. A good
conservative is someone with an open mind.''

BUSH TRIES TO REASSURE MICHIGAN'S CATHOLICS

<P>
   ROMULUS, Mich. _ Even as Michigan residents cast their votes and
time ticked away before the polls here closed, Gov. George W.
Bush's campaign officials worked Tuesday to assure the state's
Roman Catholics that Bush was a friend who deserved their support.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute effort was a response both to negative telephone
calls about Bush that some Michigan Catholics said they had
received and to speculation by some political analysts that Bush's
alliances with Christian conservatives _ and, especially, his visit
earlier this month to Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C. _
had upset Catholic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The effort also reflected the fact that the race here, unlike
the New Hampshire or South Carolina primaries, was much too close
to call and involved a number of factors that could determine the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his day by railing against the phone calls, which
portrayed him as anti-Catholic and which he attributed to the
campaign of Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign has said that it did not authorize the phone
calls but allowed for the possiblity that they may have been made
by over-exhuberant volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, John McCain, he's a man who's called me an
anti-Catholic bigot, and I don't appreciate it,'' Bush said during
a visit to a restaurant in nearby Royal Oak on Tuesday morning.
``That's shameful politics.''
</P>
<P>
   To pound home the Texas governor's message, the Bush campaign
electronically mailed, in the span of just 42 minutes after 1 p.m.,
nine different news releases containing statements from nine
Republican governors, all of whom denounced the telephone calls.
Many of the governors are Catholic, and many assumed the McCain
campaign was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah called McCain's tactics
``shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts labeled McCain a ``typical
Washington politician who says one thing then does another,''
echoing some of Bush's attack ads, and said, ``He should be
ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also released a similar statement from Tom
Monaghan, the founder of Domino's Pizza and an active benefactor of
Catholic causes in the Detroit area.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Roman Catholic,'' Monaghan said, ``I am offended that my
faith is being used as a negative smear tactic to divide people in
a political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a script of the telephone call that the Bush
campaign released Tuesday, a recorded message notes that Bush
visited Bob Jones University, whose officers in the past have made
anti-Catholic statements. Bush has said repeatedly over the last
few days that he does not agree with those statements and has noted
that his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The script provided by the Bush campaign reads: ``Governor
George Bush has campaigned against Senator John McCain by seeking
the support of Southern fundamentalists who have expressed
anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Jones has made strong anti-Catholic statements, including
calling the pope anti-Christ, the Catholic church a satanic cult,''
according to the script. ``Governor Bush has stayed silent.''
</P>
<P>
   By releasing the script and the blizzard of statements, the Bush
campaign was perhaps doing more than assuring Catholics that they
had nothing to fear from the governor.
</P>
<P>
   It may also have been diverting attention from reports that the
evangelist Pat Robertson, a supporter of Bush, had recorded and
sent an incendiary telephone message branding McCain a foe of
conservative Christians and an insufficient opponent of abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Several political analysts said that the Robertson call,
emblematic of the tough politics that Bush's allies on the
religious right used to guarantee Bush's victory in the South
Carolina primary, could hurt Bush with moderate voters if he does
not quickly establish some distance from Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be put back into the bottle,'' Scott Reed, who ran
Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, said of Robertson.
``Somebody should pick up the phone and tell him to stop. He is way
over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Tuesday that Robertson had made the calls
independently of his campaign, an assertion that Robertson
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   As early surveys of voters leaving the polls Tuesday afternoon
gave a slight edge to McCain, the Bush campaign stepped up efforts
behind the scenes, turning to an army of volunteers much bigger
than the Arizona senator's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call longer, call louder,'' said a senior adviser to Bush
about the message the campaign was sending into the field.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also enjoyed an advantage over McCain in terms of radio and
television advertising. Bush's advisers estimated that the Bush
campaign bought $2.6 million worth of advertising in Michigan,
while the McCain campaign spent $2 million.

ANALYSIS: BUSH HITS A POTHOLE IN MICHIGAN
</HEADLINE>
   (With REPUBS-PRIMARIES) 
(sw) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ This road is nothing but bumps.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire knocked Gov. George W. Bush's bandwagon off the
highway. Then, last Saturday, South Carolina derailed Sen. John
McCain's Straight Talk Express. On Tuesday, after a meager two-day
campaign, Bush hit a sizable pothole in Michigan, right in the
middle of his turnpike to victory.
</P>
<P>
   So McCain lives to fight another day, and Bush, with his cloak
of inevitability further frayed, must find somewhere else to drive
the Arizonan from the contest. Bush tried to look past McCain in
his speeches here, concentrating his fire on President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore, the most likely Democratic nominee. That
proved premature.
</P>
<P>
   Although it sounded at the time like wishful thinking, McCain
prophesied on Sunday that Michigan would differ from South
Carolina. In South Carolina, he said, ``it was very clear that we
were wiped out by the so-called Christian right, and that's where a
lot of this hate stuff was directed'' _ implying that Republican
conservatives would count for less on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has more money, more prominent backers and two
powerful geographic bases _ Florida, where his brother Jeb is
governor, and his own state of Texas _ Bush must still be counted
the front-runner. On the other hand, McCain can now entertain
legitimate hopes of rekindling the widespread enthusiasm he
generated in the campaign's early weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The results in Michigan, much the most representative state to
vote so far this year, also contained dire warnings for both of the
candidates. This is the eighth largest state, with a highly
competitive two-party system, a downsizing government, prosperous
farms and a growing, highly innovative economy: the kind of state
all presidential candidates shoot for.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was outpolled 60-40 by McCain among moderate voters here.
Such voters usually hold the key to presidential elections. Having
allied himself firmly with the far right in South Carolina, Bush
apparently suffered for that in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the poll of voters conducted by the television networks
and The Associated Press contained no denominational questions,
many politicians suggested that the governor's visit two weeks ago
to Bob Jones University, which is often accused of
anti-Catholicism, had hurt him among Roman Catholic voters in the
blue-collar suburbs of Detroit and other big cities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, George Bush, lost centrist voters to Bill
Clinton, and with them the election of 1992, and then Bob Dole did
the same thing in 1996. This year, the Republican leaders who
flocked to the Texas governor did so in large part because they
thought he would have broader appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Delighted though he was to do so well here, McCain must worry
about the uncomfortable degree to which his victory depended upon
Democrats and independents. Bush took two-thirds of the Republican
vote, and only the fact that Democrats and independents accounted
for an astounding 50 percent of Tuesday's electorate pulled the
Arizona senator through.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that the non-Republican turnout reached record
proportions for a Republican primary, partly because of local
ballot issues in some communities. There were hints that at least a
few Democrats had deliberately voted in the Republican primary to
foul up the other party's process.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Flashner, 31, a Democratic sales representative in the
Detroit suburbs, backed McCain. Asked why, he replied: ``To tell
the truth, I'd like to see the process go on as long as it can,
because the more they beat each other up, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to attract voters across party lines augurs well for
McCain's chances this fall, should he be nominated, but it will not
help him in many of the primaries that take place later this month.
Virginia's voting next Tuesday and Georgia's and Ohio's on March 7
are open to all registered voters, but only registered Republicans
can vote in primaries in Washington state next Tuesday and in New
York on March 7. In California, which also holds its primary on
March 7, non-Republicans can cast ballots, but their votes will not
count in awarding delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the electorate was much more balanced than in South
Carolina, from a number of points of view. Half the voters here
described themselves as conservatives; 60 percent did so in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, 34 percent called themselves Christian
conservatives. Fewer than 3 voters in 10 here said they identified
with the religious right, a decline from 1988, when Pat Robertson
ran strongly here, and 1996, when Pat Buchanan took 34 percent of
the total in giving Dole a tough fight.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson recorded telephone messages to Michigan voters this
year urging them to turn out in support of Bush, accusing McCain of
having chosen, in former Sen. Warren E. Rudman of New Hampshire, a
``vicious bigot'' as national chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Because the voting here followed almost immediately on the heels
of that in South Carolina, the results there may not have had time
to sink in and generate a surge for Bush. Not until election day
itself, the exit poll indicated, did a small swing to the Texas
governor get under way.
</P>
<P>
   Michiganders, subjected for a much shorter period to bombardment
by the artillery of radio and television ads, took a different view
of the candidates on important points. In South Carolina, McCain
was seen as the less fair of the two contenders; in Michigan, Bush
was, although McCain took a more caustic tone in his personal
appearances. In South Carolina, Bush and McCain were seen as
equally likely to say what they believed rather than what people
wanted to hear; in Michigan, McCain had an advantage on that score.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Breadon, a United Auto Workers member who works on a
Chrysler production line, said in explaining his vote for McCain:
``I really don't care for George Bush. He seems like a daddy's boy.
He seems like a weasel.'' An independent, Breadon voted in Royal
Oak, north of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McCain seemed to have gone some way towards
reclaiming his identity as a reformer, for which Bush successfully
challenged him in the last few weeks with the slogan proclaiming
himself a ``reformer with results.''

   Once again, McCain did much less well than he had hoped among
two groups he has targeted. A Vietnam veteran who spent years as a
prisoner of war, he got the votes of only a few more veterans than
Bush. And he did less well than his rival among young voters,
especially under 30.

NEW CHAIRMAN SAYS SOTHEBY'S WILL WEATHER STORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As its stock took another beating Tuesday, the new
chairman of Sotheby's, the beleaguered international auction house,
predicted that a massive federal antitrust investigation and a lot
of class action lawsuits would be ``expensive but not
life-threatening'' for the 256-year-old company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message has to be that the company is in sound shape and
that the management team is intact except for the two top people,''
Michael I. Sovern, the former president of Columbia University,
said in a phone interview. Sovern, who has frequently stepped into
trouble-shooting situations, was named to replace Sotheby's largest
shareholder, A. Alfred Taubman, as chairman at a board meeting
Monday. Resigning with Taubman was the company's president and
chief executive officer, Diana D. Brooks, who was replaced by
William F. Ruprecht, formerly in charge of the company's North and
South American operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company and its archrival, Christie's, are at the center of
a criminal investigation into whether they conspired to fix the
commissions they charge buyers and sellers. The two companies, with
imposing presences in New York, London and other cities, control 95
percent of the $4 billion worldwide auction business, meaning any
collusion on commission rates could have cost their customers
easily in the tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Sovern, virtually unknown in the art world, said he was
approached less than a week ago to take over the chairmanship by
two old friends. One was Ira Milstein, a senior partner at Weil
Gotschal &AMP; Manges, the Fifth Avenue law firm that Sotheby's hired
to represent it in the federal investigation. The other was Henry
R. Kravis, the leveraged buyout specialist, who is a Sotheby's
board member and a Columbia alumnus. Sovern said he has had little
time to educate himself about either Sotheby's or the art world and
has not met with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the difference between a Serra and a Stella,'' he
said.``But I'm more of a museumgoer and window shopper than art
buyer.'' The fact that his first wife, Joan Sovern, was a sculptor
gave him ``at least one toe in the art world,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, he did mention some policy directions. He said
there would be no further shake-up of management, and, he said,
that while ``it is too early to discuss commission changes''
Sotheby's ``will not be underbid by Christie's.'' Christie's, which
has turned over to prosecutors information about ``possible
conduct'' relevant to the investigation, recently changed its
commission structure to make it more attractive for sellers to deal
with it rather than Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   But the market did not respond well to the continuing
investigation or the appointments of Sovern and Ruprecht, whose
direct sales experience involved objects like expensive rugs rather
than art. Christie's shares closed at 15 5/8, down 12 percent from
its Friday close of 17 3/4. The stock had traded as high as 42 last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether investors will be inspired by the new
team,'' said James M. Meyer, director of research at Janney
Montgomery Scott, the Philadelphia-based investment firm.
``Nobody's got experience running an auction house. This is a
business of relationships, and they have to make sure they don't
lose their expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts say it would be better for Sotheby's if
Taubman, who is still on the board and who owns 22.5 percent of the
outstanding shares of the company and has 63 percent of voting
power on the board, sold his position in the company. Despite
rumors, even before the investigation heated up, that he was
looking to sell, Taubman denied any intention of doing so. He did
not return phone calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said, however, that it would not be easy to
consummate such a sale. ``Sotheby's has a big cloud hanging over
it,'' said one analyst who would talk only on condition of
anonymity. Meyer said that the chances of Sotheby's being sold to a
public company were ``slim,'' but that a leveraged buyout
specialist might be interested in buying it on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the investigation and the lawsuits filed by
buyers, sellers and shareholders, Sotheby's $40 million investment
in the Internet business has been another problem for the company.
Last year it launched two Web sites, one with Amazon.com and the
other independently, but neither one has been popular with buyers,
sellers or Wall Street. Still, Sovern was upbeat about the
investment Tuesday, calling it ``solid'' and something that ``would
pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   More pressing to art dealers, who were stunned by this week's
events, was how the climate will affect the important spring
auctions in New York and London and art prices in general, which
have been robust over the last few years. ``If I were a seller with
a $5 million Picasso, I think I might say that given the tumult and
the lack of buyers' confidence I'd sit tight for another six months
before I'd sell,'' said Meyer. ``As things stand now with the
investigation it's hard to believe this is the end of the story.''

FINNISH PAPER GIANT STORA ENSO TO BUY CONSOLIDATED PAPERS, INC. 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs to add period, delete comma at end of 4th graf)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that marks the fourth major paper-industry merger or
acquisition in less than two weeks, the big Finnish paper company
Stora Enso said Tuesday that it would acquire Consolidated Papers
Inc., based in Wisconsin Rapids, Wis. The deal is valued at $3.9
billion, plus the assumption of $900 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The merged company's combined sales of $13.2 billion in 1999
place it a distant second in revenue to the International Paper
Co., which sells a bigger proportion of high-priced stock, and had
$25 billion in sales. The new company, though, will probably be the
world's largest producer in terms of paper tonnage.
</P>
<P>
   Stora Enso is paying $44 a share for Consolidated, a rich
premium over the company's preannouncement closing price of $26.
Investors thought Consolidated got the better deal: its stock
jumped $10 on Tuesday to $36, while Stora Enso's shares lost 2
euros, to 11.10 euros, in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts hailed the merger as another sign that the
fragmented paper industry was building a global business. ``This
sea change that we've been expecting is finally happening,'' said
Kathryn F. McAuley, a Brown Brothers Harriman analyst, ``and we're
seeing real globalization of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, UPM-Kymmene, also of Finland, bought
Champion International, creating a behemoth in coated papers;
Abitibi-Consolidated bought Donohue Inc., creating a leader in
newsprint, and International Paper, which bought Union Camp last
year, said it would acquire Shorewood Packaging, which had been
embroiled in a takeover battle with the Chesapeake Corp. when
International Paper made its offer.
</P>
<P>
   More deals are in the works. The New Zealand conglomerate
Fletcher Challenge has said it wants to sell its newsprint
operations. Norske Skog is said to be looking for a North American
acquisition. And on Friday, St. Laurent Paperboard of Canada said
it was in merger talks. It did not specify with whom, but the name
swirling around Wall Street was that of Smurfit-Stone Container,
the world's biggest corrugated-box maker _ itself formed when
Jefferson Smurfit gobbled up the Stone Container Corp. in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the mergers, paper remains a highly fragmented
industry. ``You can still find 30 or 40 publicly traded paper
companies in the U.S., and probably another 15 in Canada,'' said
Mark Wilde of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, noting that even
International Paper, the industry leader, accounts for only about 5
percent of the 300 million tons of paper produced worldwide each
year.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of cohesion has cost the industry dearly. Most
companies expanded wildly when paper prices started to soar in the
mid-'90s. When economic troubles overseas put the brakes on demand,
the industry found itself drowning in capacity. Prices and profit
plummeted late in 1995, and did not recover until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, industries like publishing and manufacturing, which
are prime customers for paper, have been consolidating into global
powerhouses that want to deal with global suppliers. ``They want to
deal with the same supplier all over the world,'' McAuley said,
``but they don't want their paper shipped to Chicago from
Finland.''
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment, consolidation may have been inevitable.
The European paper companies began merging several years ago and
the resulting big producers, like Stora Enso, are now looking to
North America for merger partners. North American companies,
though, are still joining mainly with each other. ``The American
companies may be missing chances to expand into higher-growth
markets,'' Wilde said.
</P>
<P>
   And the industry has returned to good times. After a dismal 1997
and 1998, most companies were profitable last year, and McAuley,
for one, predicts that profits will remain robust through 2002.
Consolidation can only improve the profit picture, as merged
companies close older plants and eliminate administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The result has not yet translated to higher prices. ``We may see
more pricing power but we're far from being an oligopoly yet,''
McAuley said.
</P>
<P>
   The deals may help smooth out some of the wild swings that have
characterized paper pricing. And they are likely to buoy profit.
``It doesn't mean anything for prices,'' said John V. Faraci,
International Paper's chief financial officer, ``but it's enabling
all of us to get costs out and to put more money into product
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say stockholders will settle for nothing less.
``Shareholders have made it clear they want financial returns
improved,'' Wilde said, ``that they want CEO's to stop building
plants and start rationalizing their businesses.''

SAILING BECOMES A CONTACT SPORT IN THE HAURAKI GULF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ In hockey and football and all the other
contests where contact is a ritual of the game, the vision of a
bloodied combatant translates to business as usual. But when it
comes to sailboat racing, the sight of deep crimson flowing freely
from a battered competitor, though not unheard of, is rare indeed.
</P>
<P>
   So it is likely that the image that will be remembered from
Tuesday's Race 2 of the America's Cup match between Italy's Prada
Challenge and Team New Zealand will be that of the Italian crewman
Max Sirena reeling from a head wound that left a smudged red stain
along the aft quarter of Luna Rossa's otherwise gleaming silver
topsides. Never mind that Team New Zealand convincingly defeated
Prada to take a 2-0 lead in the five-of-nine race finals, which
resume after Wednesday's lay day, or day off; cut away from the
chase.
</P>
<P>
   When serious injuries occur aboard racing boats, they generally
result from a head-first encounter with an untamed mainsail boom or
spinnaker pole, or from a finger or hand that gets wound into a
line under load. So what happened to Sirena has to go under the
category of freak accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Midway up the first windward leg, with Prada's crew regaining
its composure after a harsh lesson in starting-line tactics by the
clinical Kiwis, the Italians' charge came to a crashing halt when
they hooked a big piece of plastic, with a long length of rope
attached, to the blunt, leading edge of their keel bulb some 12
feet below the waterline.
</P>
<P>
   The resultant drag was deadly, and the junk had to be removed.
Sirena, the bowman, was dispatched below deck to retrieve the long,
carbon-fiber pole that each boat carries to floss the keel clean
when debris is snagged on the bulb or winglets.
</P>
<P>
   The poles, also called kelp sticks, came into vogue during the
last cup regatta off San Diego in 1995, where they were regularly
employed to free the long strands of seaweed routinely encountered
off the Southern California coast. But in the pristine waters of
the Hauraki Gulf, they have rarely been needed.
</P>
<P>
   Any sailor who has ever snared a lobster pot or other flotsam on
his keel or rudder knows what it does to boat speed and handling.
But it's one thing to be inconvenienced on a cruise along the Maine
coast, and quite another to be tripped up in a crucial race for the
America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   So Sirena was moving quickly, which may have contributed to his
mishap. As he passed the back end of the pole topside, and turned
his attention to other tasks, he was stunned when the business end
of the pole _ equipped with a sharp, plastic hook _ raked him
across the top of his scalp.
</P>
<P>
   Sirena sports a haircut like Michael Jordan's; in other words,
he's as bald as a cue ball. A wide gash that would later require
seven stitches pierced his temple.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Sirena's cut looked worse than it was. Alessandra
Ghezzi, a Prada spokeswoman, said Wednesday that the sailor was
``still a bit dazed and quite a bit swollen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's OK and should be sailing tomorrow,'' Ghezzi said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the blow to Sirena was not the only one suffered by the
Prada crew. By the time they freed the plastic and regained
control, Team New Zealand had built an insurmountable lead. Now the
Italians find themselves down two races to a Kiwi crew that is
proving to be far more formidable than anyone Luna Rossa
encountered in the four-month-long challenger's trials.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, after the 2-minute-26-second Race 2 thrashing, the
New Zealand helmsman Russell Coutts found fault with his squad's
performance. ``Our spinnaker pole almost went over the side and
almost broke going upwind one time,'' he said. ``There were a
couple of other mistakes. It wasn't a great day.''
</P>
<P>
   Those remarks begged a question: What will happen if the Kiwis
put together a race that satisfies Coutts?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Italians remain resolute. ``We were feeling pretty
good, and then that thing happened with the keel,'' said the Prada
tactician, Torben Grael. ``It was very unfortunate. We are very
happy with the performance of the boat, and we're looking forward
to the next race.''
</P>
<P>
   Prada's problems, unfortunately, have thus far had nothing to do
with its boat. Had the crews swapped weapons before the series,
with the Kiwis aboard the Italian boat and vice versa, the results
Wednesday would still be the same. The Prada crew has been
outsailed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, it will become clear if a good, sharp crack on the
bean has brought them around.

TEXAS PRISON GUARD `ALL RIGHT' AS STANDOFF ENDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES KIMBERLY 
and KATHY WALT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVINGSTON, Texas _ The correctional officer held hostage for 13
hours by two death row inmates stayed out of harm's way by seeking
common ground with her captors and vowed after her release Tuesday
to return to her job.
</P>
<P>
   Although shaken, Jeanette Bledsoe, 57, is ``a very strong
lady,'' said her former husband, Robert Bledsoe. ``Everything has
come into focus now. She's breaking down into sobbing, but she'll
be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was overpowered by killers Ponchai Wilkerson, 28, and
Howard Guidry, 23, about 4 p.m. CST Monday at the Terrell prison
unit southwest of Livingston, which is about 70 miles northeast of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The two had nearly escaped from the Ellis unit in 1998 and were
among the 112 prisoners recently moved to Terrell, which is
supposed to be more secure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prison officials are trying to figure out if a design
flaw made it possible for Wilkerson to jimmy the lock on his cell.
He opened the door and jumped on Bledsoe as she escorted Guidry
down the hall, and the two overpowered her.
</P>
<P>
   Another prison guard witnessed the attack but was powerless to
intervene, Robert Bledsoe said. He was fearful of endangering his
co-worker, on the job for a little over three years, and went for
help.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with two metal bars, the prisoners took Bledsoe to a
recreation room, where they handcuffed and shackled her, then made
demands on prison authorities for better conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage situation marks at least the third incident in
recent months in which convicts at maximum security lock-ups have
apparently jammed their cell door locks. One guard was stabbed to
death and another was raped in the two earlier incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a design flaw that allows inmates to violate the
locks,'' said Mac Stringfellow, chairman of the Texas Board of
Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Stringfellow said prison investigators also are looking at
several other factors that led to the Terrell hostage situation,
including where Wilkerson and Guidry got the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   One prisoner was armed with a 15-inch steel cylinder filed to a
point at one end and the other with a tool that guards use to open
a narrow food slot on cell doors.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said Bledsoe was following proper procedures
when the incident occurred and that staffing levels played no role
in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Those closest to Bledsoe describe her as a gregarious, matronly
figure who is strong with death-row inmates when necessary but also
treats them with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very caring correctional officer,'' said Robert
Bledsoe. ``She tries to treat everybody with respect. She's a
caring person.
</P>
<P>
   ``She feels she is a protector up there more than a guard,''
said her former husband.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe told her family members that she believed if she could
get the two inmates to view her as a human being rather than an
object of authority, it would be more difficult for them to kill
her.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson has an 8-year-old son. After raising five boys _ one
of whom is also a prison guard _ Bledsoe is now raising a
9-year-old grandson. She and Wilkerson shared stories of
parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs me very much. If something were to happen to me, I
don't know what would happen to him,'' Robert Bledsoe quoted his
former wife as saying to Wilkerson.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about childhoods and their common experiences in the
Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   The plan apparently worked. Only once did Bledsoe fear death was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   About five hours into the stand-off, Guidry and Wilkerson became
concerned that a squad of five guards was preparing to storm the
day room. Wilkerson jabbed Bledsoe with the sharpened metal bar as
he ordered the guards to back off, Robert Bledsoe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She felt like (he) was going to stick her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage situation was resolved peacefully about 5 a.m. after
three anti-execution activists from Houston were invited to the
Terrell unit by the Texas Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   For about an hour the community activists negotiated with prison
officials about how to end the standoff. A deal was made that the
inmates would get to speak with the community activists.
</P>
<P>
   When the group went to the area where Bledsoe was being held,
they said they saw hundreds of police and guards dressed in riot
gear. Bledsoe, they said, was sitting on a mattress.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Taharka, chairman of the Houston chapter of the National
Black United Front, said that when the inmates saw him and his
colleagues, they exchanged the raised fist of the black power
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Then they removed Bledsoe's handcuffs, helped her up and
released her to authorities. The inmates turned their weapons over
to the officers and surrendered peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us they wanted to call attention to the inhumane
conditions,'' Taharka said. ``They were crying out. They had been
on a hunger strike that received very little attention.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``They feel some level of remorse that things had to
get to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush said the governor,
campaigning for president in Michigan, was ``pleased this crisis
was resolved without any serious bodily harm.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush spokesman Mike Jones added that the governor would
not reconsider his decision not to call a special session of the
Legislature to address critical guard shortages or their low pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always going to have problems, even if we had all the
money and staff we needed,'' Stringfellow said. ``It's inherent
with the nature of prisons. Any time you lock up bad people in bad
places, you're going to have bad things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidry earned his cell on death row after he was convicted in
the November 1994 slaying of Farah Fratta, the wife of a former
Missouri City, Texas, police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson, the son of a retired sheriff's deputy, is scheduled
to die March 14 for the Nov. 28, 1990, murder of Chung Myong Yi, a
clerk in a Houston jewelry store.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Wilkerson is so close to his execution date
terrified the Bledsoe family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desperate people do desperate things,'' Robert Bledsoe said.
``I think she was very lucky to get out of this alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she is shaken, Jeanette Bledsoe is resolute about
returning to the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her last words when she left there were, `They may think they
have scared me away, but I'll be back,''' Robert Bledsoe said.

FDA INVESTIGATING DEATHS LINKED TO DIABETES DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.J.)  (jw) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration is investigating a recent
increase in deaths linked to the diabetes drug Rezulin, a spokesman
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin is now reported to have caused 58 deaths and 10 liver
transplants among 85 patients who suffered from liver failure since
the drug's approval in 1997. Both the number of reported deaths and
the cases of liver damage have doubled since March, agency
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday that the medical
officer most closely involved with the government's rapid approval
of the drug, Dr. Robert I. Misbin, told his bosses at the FDA that
he saw no reason why the agency should delay removing the drug from
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he said, ``additional cases of preventable liver
failure'' may occur, The Los Angeles Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA spokesman said Misbin declined interviews on the report.
</P>
<P>
   When Rezulin was approved, because of its life-saving potential
for patients with severe diabetes, it was known that it presented a
risk of producing liver damage. This prompted the FDA to issue
repeated warnings to doctors to closely monitor patients who were
taking it. But an agency investigation last winter found that only
2.7 percent of patients taking Rezulin for three months were being
monitored the way the agency had recommended.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of independent experts has recommended that the drug be
prescribed only to patients who do not respond to other therapies.
</P>
<P>
   At an FDA hearing in March, Rezulin's manufacturer, Parke-Davis,
a division of the Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains, N.J., agreed
with reports from doctors and drug companies that 43 people who
took the drug had suffered acute liver failure and that 28 had
died.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Woodcock, the director of the agency's drug review center,
said the FDA continually evaluated the risks and benefits of drugs.
She also said the agency considered it prudent to keep Rezulin on

MILOSEVIC COVERTLY INCITES VIOLENCE IN KOSOVO, SAYS NATO 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-MITROVICA) 
(bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American and NATO officials Tuesday accused the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, of fomenting violence in
Kosovo and infiltrating his plainclothes police into the province
in a deliberate attempt to thwart NATO's peacekeeping efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and allied governments have detected direct
radio links between Milosevic's special police in Serbia and
Serbian militants in the city of Mitrovica in northern Kosovo,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader is also encouraging his plainclothes police
to travel to Kosovska Mitrovica, the officials said, and has
ordered a buildup of special police units along the border between
Kosovo and the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guidance, men, radios and arms'' is the order of importance of
Milosevic's help to the Serbs of Mitrovica, a senior official said.
Another official said that much of the violence carried out by the
Serbs in Mitrovica in the last two weeks had been ``planned in
advance and comes from Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters and at the Pentagon, officials said they
were concerned that Milosevic was doing everything possible to undo
NATO's control of Mitrovica, the ethnically divided mining town of
90,000 that has become Kosovo's most volatile spot. Just a few
miles south of the border with Serbia proper, it is in effect where
the Albanian-dominated province ends and the rest of Serbia begins,
with the part of town north of the Ibar River 90 percent Serbian
and the southern part mainly Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Albanians have been unable to return to their homes
in the north side as the Serbian community has determinedly
defended a safe area for itself. The few hundred Serbs who lived on
the south side have long since fled.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Milosevic did not appear to be planning to
send the Yugoslav army or uniformed units of his police forces into
Kosovo. Nor does he seem to want control of the province back, the
officials said, but rather to keep up the tension and then divide
Kosovo into distinct Serbian and Albanian parts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. troops were sent to Mitrovica from their southern Kosovo
base last weekend along with British and Canadian soldiers to
reinforce French troops after the violence got out of hand.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   For the Clinton administration, the biggest fear about Kosovo is
that the explosive situation in Mitrovica could blow up in a
presidential election year. One of the worst fears is having NATO _
and U.S. _ troops caught between Albanian and Serbian snipers in an
``urban Belfast'' situation in Mitrovica, a NATO official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry is that arguments within NATO on how to handle
Mitrovica and the shortage of resources for the struggling U.N.
civilian operation, including setting up municipal police, will
diminish the international effort, thus damaging the considerable
investment of the Clinton administration in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a series of public statements in the last two days, U.S. and
NATO officials have warned Milosevic, in general ways, to desist
from interfering in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. representative at the United Nations, Richard C.
Holbrooke, and the NATO secretary-general, Lord Robertson, said
Belgrade was directing the trouble in northern Kosovo. The State
Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said ``we certainly would be
prepared to to respond if Serbian forces made the grave mistake of
trying to interfere'' with NATO operations.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials described the messages between Serbian radio
operators in Mitrovica and Serbian intelligence operators in Serbia
as being of a tactical nature. The messages included statements
like ``they are going here, they are going there,'' _ referring to
movements by Albanian militants _ rather than direct orders, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know they are receiving transmission coming from MUP
radio links inside Serbia,'' an official said, using the acronym
for Milosevic's Interior Ministry special police. ``They are from
the locations and frequencies used by MUP.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the radio links used by the special police in northern
Kosovo have not been dismantled since NATO took over Kosovo last
summer, a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   As well as meddling inside Mitrovica, Milosevic has ``preserved
his options'' by increasing the number of special police in the
area of the Presevo Valley in Serbia, an area next to Kosovo, where
about 80,000 Albanians live and have become increasingly restless.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that they could not be precise about the
number of special police officers now in the area but that the
buildup had been under way for several months. The policemen, whose
presence was regularly reported by Albanian refugees, were in the
same area to which the Pristina Corps of the Yugoslav army had
withdrawn at the end of the Kosovo war, they said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, regarded by the Clinton administration as a master
tactician unable to resist the opportunity presented to him in
Mitrovica, has maneuvered himself into a strong position, said an
administration official involved in day-to-day Kosovo policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belgrade is in a great position _ a win-win position _ and
NATO in a lose-lose position,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO gets tough, then Milosevic can say the Serbs are
victims and Kosovo has been ethnically cleansed,'' he said. In that
circumstance NATO would escort Albanians back to their homes in
northern Mitrovica, a maneuver that would almost certainly make
most of the Serbs there flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO shrinks from doing anything, the situation gets worse
and NATO loses,'' the official said. He added, ``It's a terrible
situation for KFOR to be in,'' referring to the peacekeeping force
in Kosovo.

PAROLE BOARD DENIES DEATH ROW CLEMENCY TO TEXAS WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JIM YARDLEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles Tuesday denied
the death row clemency appeal of a 62-year-old woman convicted of
killing her fifth husband and burying his body beneath a wishing
well, a ruling that could make her only the fourth woman executed
in the United States since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   With death penalty opponents and several women's groups lobbying
for a delay, the scheduled Thursday execution of the inmate, Betty
Lou Beets, presents a politically delicate situation for Gov.
George W. Bush, who has presided over more executions than any
other governor, including the highly publicized execution of Karla
Faye Tucker in 1998. The board's denial added to a day of drama on
Texas' death row, coming after the tense resolution early Tuesday
morning of a hostage crisis in which two inmates awaiting execution
held a guard for nearly 13 hours to protest conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Margulies, a lawyer for Beets, expressed disappointment in
the board's ruling. He and other lawyers had asked the board to
grant Beets a 180-day delay in order to review unheard evidence
that she was battered by her husband. In particular, Margulies said
the Texas Legislature passed a 1991 law that provided for such
cases to be reviewed by the paroles board. He said Beets never got
such a review because she was never notified of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Garrett, chairman of the paroles board, said the board
took two votes on Beets' case. Her clemency appeal was denied
unanimously, but her request for an 180-day delay to consider
evidence of abuse was denied by a 13-to-5 vote. Garrett said the
1991 state law did not apply to Beets because she continued to
proclaim her innocence. Margulies, however, described five
dissenting votes as ``remarkable'' for a body that had approved
clemency only once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by the number of votes alone, Bush has got to realize
this case is being treated differently,'' Margulies said. He has
also filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the execution and
expects a ruling on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, Bush's spokeswoman, repeated the governor's
oft-stated position that in reviewing cases he considers any doubts
about guilt and whether an inmate has had full and fair access to
the courts. Under Texas law, a governor can grant clemency only
with a recommendation from the paroles board. When the board denies
clemency, the governor's only choices are to grant a 30-day stay or
approve the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said Bush upholds ``the laws fairly and evenly for all
people in Texas, including women facing the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``The gender of the killer didn't make any difference
to the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Figueroa, a spokeswoman for the Texas Council on Family
Violence, a non-profit group that advocates for abused women, said
Beets ``was not given due process'' and should have been granted a
180-day stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely disappointed, just devastated by this
decision,'' Figueroa said. ``Her case definitely calls for a stay
so her lawyers would have the chance to present evidence
demonstrating that she had endured abuse in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the office of Texas Attorney General John Cornyn
released a statement from the victim's son, James Beets: ``My dad
was a good man, not an alcoholic or abuser. In his job he went out
of his way to help and save people. They keep talking about her
being a grandma, well my dad's grandkids are never going to know
their grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Beets, a former barmaid who was married five times, shot three
of her husbands, two of them fatally. In October 1985, she was
sentenced to death for the 1983 murder of her fifth husband, Jimmy
Don Beets. For two years, Beets had been considered missing until
investigators in Henderson County discovered his body buried
beneath a wishing well in Beets' yard. In the same shallow grave,
investigators found the body of Beets' fourth husband, Doyle Wayne
Barker.
</P>
<P>
   During her trial, prosecutors say, Beets' son testified that he
helped his mother bury Beets and cover up his murder. A daughter
told detectives that she helped her mother bury Barker's body in
1981. Both men were shot in the head, and the bullets matched a .38
caliber handgun seized from Beets' home. Beets was indicted in
Barker's death but never tried. Previously, she had been convicted
on a misdemeanor charge after she shot a former husband, Bill Lane,
in the side of the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, early Tuesday morning, prison officials resolved a
hostage crisis that began Monday afternoon when two death row
inmates grabbed a female guard and blockaded themselves in a room
at the state's new death row unit in Livingston. The 13-hour
standoff ended at 5 a.m. after the two convicted murderers, Ponchai
Wilkerson and Howard Guidry, were allowed to speak to three death
penalty opponents from Houston. The guard, Jeanette Bledsoe, 57,
was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Todd, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice, said the two inmates told negotiators that they seized the
guard to protest death row policies. In particular, they nmates should be allowed to change visitation lists. Currently,
inmates are allowed to make changes once every six months. They
also protested the unit's prohibition on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had some grievances that they wanted to draw attention
to, and they have done so,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   Todd said officials are still trying to determine how the two
inmates obtained a sharpened rod used as a weapon and how Wilkerson
managed to open the steel door of his cell. In 1998, Guidry and
Wilkerson escaped from death row on Thanksgiving Day, the first
such escape in Texas since 1934. The two men were captured on the
grounds of Ellis prison near Huntsville, though a third inmate,
Martin Gurule, escaped into the woods. His drowned body was later
found in the nearby Trinity River. The escape prompted officials to
begin moving inmates from Huntsville to the new Terrell Unit about
40 miles east in Livingston.

   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Ethnic Serbs living on the
north side of this divided city were edgy Tuesday, a day after the
massive show of force by thousands of Albanian protesters. The city
was calm, slumped in a ``morning-after'' state, with mud and debris
on the streets the only sign left of the disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of young Serb men gathered by the main bridge that
connects the Serb north and Albanian southern district, and
suddenly erupted and attacked a German armored vehicle, pelting it
with stones as it swung by them in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small incident, over as quickly as it blew up, but a
sign of the anxieties and aggression that lie very near the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Serbs had gathered Monday to defend their district
on the north side of the, as tens of thousands of Albanians
streamed into Mitrovica from all over the country. ``We were
worried, because of the huge number of Albanians and of course we
did not expect anything good of it,'' said Oliver Ivanovic, the
self-styled leader of the Serb community in Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting violence, they had evacuated some women and children
and had organized their own protest of 800 people by the bridge and
2,000 more further up the main street, he said. ``It was a clear
intention to show us they have a big number of people and that they
will one day come over the bridge,'' Ivanovic said. ``It was also a
message for us that we are not welcome here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although peacekeeping commanders were congratulating their
soldiers for containing the demonstration and preventing clashes
between the two ethnic communities, the Serbs complained that the
huge demonstration right on the bridge only proved that the
peacekeepers were doing little to protect the Serb community.
</P>
<P>
   With only some 10,000 Serbs on the north side of the city and
some 90,000 Albanians living on the south of the river, the sheer
demographics explain their fears. There are some 100,000 Serbs left
in Kosovo, more than half of them in the north around Mitrovica,
among a population of nearly 2 million Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the mood was muted on both sides. Some Albanian miners
made a brief protest on the south side of the bridge in the
morning. Some Serbs stood around, playing nationalist music on loud
speakers and lobbed a few stones at U.S. paratroopers who deployed
on the main bridge overnight. The Americans had arrived to
reinforce British troops, who had borne the brunt of the turbulent
demonstrations and had ten soldiers slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Nick Carter of the Royal Green Jackets, whose men had
the job of preventing the demonstrators breaking through to the
bridge, said he expected a week or two of calm now, at least on the
Albanian side of the city. The demonstration had been generally
good humored and only a hardcore of 2,000 had been intent on
pushing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made their point, to show the massive feeling that there
is among Albanians that Mitrovica cannot remain divided. The
international community has bought two weeks and now has to produce
some results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs, it was a more intractable problem and was a
question of their viewpoint. ``I personally don't think they will
feel secure while looking over a river,'' he said, comparing the
River Ibar with the Berlin Wall. In Pristina, where the Royal Green
Jackets have been guarding a small Serb community, there is no
dividing line between the ethnic communities and that has helped
the beginnings of normality.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he has been able to reduce the static guards on
houses as slowly the violence has been reduced and Albanians have
taken on the responsibility of ensuring the security of the Serbs.
But he admits, ``It's going very very slowly.''

 &HT;    Florida Cabinet approves end to racial preferences in college
admissions
 &HT;    By Marcia Gelbart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ It's official: Race will no longer help
students get into Florida's 10 public universities.
</P>
<P>
   The state Cabinet, sitting as the Board of Education, voted 4 to
2 Tuesday to approve Gov. Jeb Bush's One Florida plan, eliminating
affirmative action in college admissions but guaranteeing a
university seat this fall to the top 20 percent of students in
every high school graduating class. Attorney General Bob
Butterworth and Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson, both Democrats,
opposed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to the Legislature to ensure that One Florida,
encoded in law, can work in reality. Come the session that opens
March 7, that means supporting Bush's request to add $20 million in
need-based financial aid, and to set aside other funds to teach
Advanced Placement courses in school districts where they're not
now available.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has the support of the House and Senate Republican
leaders. But as critics of the plan pointed out, little is certain
when it comes to budget matters, especially in an election year and
especially with dozens of lawmakers scheming to score their last
hurrahs as they wrap up their legislative careers because of term
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not adequately funded, it's not going to make it,''
Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
   There was also more talk Tuesday of the looming repercussions of
the Cabinet's vote: a possible economic boycott of Florida, as
suggested Sunday by NAACP leader Kweisi Mfume. That could mean a
boycott of orange juice, the tourism industry or canceled Florida
convention meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called the possible action ``inappropriate.'' Also, several
black lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Les Miller of
Tampa and the head of the legislative black caucus, Democratic
Miami Sen. Daryl Jones, were reluctant to immediately embrace the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sen. Kendrick Meek (D-Miami) said, ``This doesn't end
here. That's not a threat, it's a promise.'' It was Meek who
sparked the fierce opposition to One Florida after staging the
January Capitol sit-in with another black lawmaker, Rep. Tony Hill
(D-Jacksonville).
</P>
<P>
   The hostility between Meek and Bush was unmistakable Tuesday as
Meek urged the Cabinet to slow the governor's plan by not adopting
it in its entirety. He explained to Bush how the One Florida plan
is contributing to the building of two Floridas by offering some
words from one of many letters he has received: ``Why don't you go
back to Africa where all your people belong?''
</P>
<P>
   And at one point, as Bush sat behind the dais with a smirk on
his face, Meek said, ``I'm glad this is amusing for you governor,
because it's not for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 30 people who signed up to speak to the Cabinet in
favor of the plan were affiliated with the Florida university
system. But emotional talk of racism elicited personal stories from
opponents and supporters alike.
</P>
<P>
   Regent Steve Uhlfelder, who grew up in Palm Beach County,
recalled being angry that blacks had to ride in the backs of buses.
He also spoke of the grandparents and other family he lost because
of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should never treat people like they treated us in
Germany,'' he said. ``In my heart and soul, if I thought this would
hurt African-Americans, I would not (support it).''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Betty Holzendorf (D-Jacksonville) _ who when asked about
the possible boycott said, ``Why not?''_ recounted her youth in
explaining her opposition. ``In 1954, when I was in the 10th grade
and they announced the (U.S. Supreme Court) Brown (v. Board of
Education) decision, we jumped and cheered, and to have to stand
here at the podium today is painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Bush remained stern. ``We're not moving one step
back in the fight against racism,'' he said. ``Perceptions are
important in politics, boy are they. But I'm focused on reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ONE FLORIDA PRICE TAG
</P>
<P>
   Several provisions of Gov. Jeb Bush's One Florida plan need
approval from the Legislature, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ $20 million in need-based financial aid for college students.
</P>
<P>
   _ Money to encourage low-performing schools to teach Advanced
Placement classes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Money to make PSAT tests available to all 10th graders.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving procurement decisions from the Department of Labor to
the Department of Management Services.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increased penalties for companies that discriminate on the
basis of race or gender.

TRUCKERS JAM NATION'S CAPITAL TO PROTEST RISING FUEL PRICES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PHILIP CAUTHON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of truckers wheeled their rigs through the
nation's capital Tuesday, blasting their horns and protesting
skyrocketing fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Adorned with U.S. flags, the trucks filled Washington's
already-congested streets. The drivers pleaded for government help
in dealing with unbearable operating costs, including steep diesel
prices, which have increased by as much as 55 percent since Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a crossroads here,'' said John Medaglia, a driver for
more than 30 years from Langhorn, Pa., who parked his truck for the
first time last week. ``Do I go back to work and take a loss every
day or do I go out of business. I'm 55 years old. What else am I
going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The high price of fuel adds to &UR;  &LR; truckers' long-standing
complaints that freight rates are too low to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Many drivers lease their services to motor carriers, because in
addition to providing insurance and operating permits the carriers
are better equipped to reach clients. Those carriers, in turn, keep
rates low for independent drivers as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the ability to pass these costs on to clients,''
said Medaglia. ``The carriers don't feel the cost because the
burden is on us. And they're refusing to raise freight rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Shouting over incessant horns on Capitol Hill, rally organizers
demanded that Congress suspend the diesel excise tax, now at 24
cents per gallon, and allow states to rebate an additional 15 cents
per gallon to drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to let the government know that this is an
emergency,'' said Joe Smith, a driver from Camden, N.J. ``We need
some help until the price of fuel comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and others expressed concern that summer demand for fuel
by travelers would boost already excessive costs. The current spike
in diesel prices was fueled by high demand for heating oil in the
Northeast and the rising cost of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said
that it would be difficult to repeal a tax that builds the very
roads the trucks depend on. He said that the administration does
not want ``to intervene in a way that manipulates the price'' of
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves truck drivers to wrestle with prices that can
fluctuate radically and vary from region to region.
</P>
<P>
   For example, John Garcia, a 27-year-old driver from Denmark,
Wis., recalled paying $2.30 per gallon in Connecticut on Monday,
compared to the $1.45 he paid when he left home. He said that, this
time last year, a gallon of diesel cost around 99 cents in most
states.
</P>
<P>
   New England states have been the hardest hit, with diesel prices
rising 55 percent last month and nearly doubling over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Texas' diesel prices are among the lowest, rising just 9 percent
last month.

   ``A lot of guys can't afford to fill up,'' said Garcia, who
learned about the rally from drivers in New Jersey. ``I'm doing
alright now but everybody's got to stick together.''
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at the rally also want the government to create
regional fuel reserves to cushion future price shocks and
investigate whether the current spike in prices was orchestrated by
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the protest was without incident. Traffic was
relatively unimpeded, given that hundreds of trucks flooded the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Ed ``Firecracker'' Amaroso of Baltimore said he hoped the rally
would bring relief. He said that despite a fuel surcharge he
received from his contractor, he was paying about $1,200 a month
more in operating costs than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fortunate,'' Amaroso said. ``But you know, $300 a week,
that's a truck payment or mortgage. And a lot of guys are getting
hit a lot worse. It's really getting tough out there.''

STRAWBERRY TESTS POSITIVE FOR COCAINE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Darryl Strawberry has placed his baseball career
in jeopardy once more, having again tested positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, a multiple violator of baseball's aftercare program,
failed a drug test administered Jan. 19 by the state of Florida in
accordance with the terms of his sentencing last spring on charges
of drug possession and solicitation of prostitution. Major League
Baseball, which had maintained contact with law enforcement
officials here, was alerted to the results of the test, according
to a baseball official.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry faces trouble on three fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Having been placed on probation for 18 months when sentenced
last year, he may face more legal action.
</P>
<P>
   He is facing yet another suspension by Major League Baseball.
Early last season, Commissioner Bud Selig strongly considered
suspending Strawberry for the entire year because of his legal
problem, eventually handing down a penalty of 120 days.
</P>
<P>
   And Strawberry, who turns 38 next month, is again testing the
patience of the New York Yankees' owner, George Steinbrenner, who
has repeatedly given the slugger chances to renew his baseball
career. The behavioral clause contained in Strawberry's contract is
worded so strongly that club officials believe the deal could be
voided and the Yankees' ties with the player severed once and for
all.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were maintaining an official silence on the issue of
Strawberry's drug test Tuesday night. Brian Cashman, the Yankees'
general manager, refused to comment on Strawberry's status or
future with the team. ``Any question you ask me in regards to
Darryl Strawberry will result in a no comment,'' Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's status is out of the Yankees' hands anyway, now
that Major League Baseball is involved in the case. But one person
close to Steinbrenner said of Strawberry: ``He's blowing his whole
life now. I think George will say enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry began his career with the New York Mets in 1983 and
had eight tempestuous years with the team, sometimes enjoying
remarkable success on the field. But he has since admitted to
developing alcohol and drug problems, which contributed to legal
and personal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry joined the Yankees in 1995, after Steinbrenner warned
Strawberry never to embarrass him, and he became a respected member
of the team; shortstop Derek Jeter has said he considers Strawberry
to be something like an older brother.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry hit 24 home runs in 1998, but his problems resumed at
the end of that season. He underwent surgery for colon cancer, and
in the spring of 1999 he rejoined the team even while undergoing
chemotherapy. The usually genial Strawberry became moody, clashed
with coaches occasionally and griped about how he was being
treated. Later, Strawberry _ who had long been a member of
Alcoholics Anonymous _ said he became depressed at this time and
resumed drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Last April 14, Strawberry was arrested by the Tampa police on
charges of possessing .03 grams of cocaine and soliciting
prostitution from an undercover officer. He pleaded no contest and
was sentenced six weeks later to 18 months of probation and 100
hours of community service. He also was ordered to pay court fines.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Espinosa Jr., the Florida Circuit Court judge who sentenced
Strawberry, spoke to him sternly at that time. ``This isn't really
about baseball,'' Espinosa said. ``It isn't about your job, but
about you. When you stop producing, nobody will care about you. If
this is a picture of life after baseball, it's not pretty. This is
only an opportunity. I hope you make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving his baseball suspension, Strawberry rejoined the
Yankees and incredibly swung the bat as forcefully as anyone could
remember, slugging three homers in 49 at-bats and intimidating
pitchers into walking him 17 times. Impressed by what they had
seen, the Yankees kept him on the postseason roster, exercised the
$750,000 option on his contract for this year and planned to use
him as their left-handed designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry played in the World Series as the Yankees swept the
Atlanta Braves and broke into tears on the podium at City Hall
after the victory parade. Manager Joe Torre was at his side, and
Strawberry was unable to speak for 48 seconds. Strawberry
eventually lifted his head and said: ``I'd just like to say to Joe,
thanks for caring for me. And I love you guys.''

CUBA REFUSES TO WITHDRAW U.S. DIPLOMAT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cuba will not withdraw the diplomat linked to an
espionage investigation, despite an order from the United States
that he leave the country, Cuban officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat, identified as Jose Imperatori, had been linked to
an American immigration official charged with espionage last week.
The American charged with spying, Mariano M. Faget, was arrested
late Thursday after he was caught passing to a Cuban-born New York
businessman false information that American officials had fed him
about a Cuban intelligence agent's plan to defect to the United
States, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Faget is a senior official in the Miami office of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Cuban Special Interests section, Luis
Fernandez, confirmed that the Cuban government would not withdraw
the official. He said the diplomat would remain to testify and
prove the espionage accusation to be false.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said that Imperatori and another Cuban official, Luis
Molina, had met with Faget in Miami on separate occasions. He said
the two had spoken to Faget on immigration issues and Faget's
desire to someday visit Cuba. But Fernandez said that Imperatori
had never tried to recruit Faget or to get sensitive information
from him. ``The contacts with this man were public and completely
open,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Rubin, the spokesman for the State Department, said
that the expelled Cuban diplomat had been ``declared persona non
grata,'' and must depart the country by 1:30 p.m. on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be highly unusual for a state to refuse to remove a
diplomat under these circumstances,'' Rubin said. ``Under the
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, Cuba must either recall
the diplomat in question or terminate his functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the diplomat not leave the country, Rubin said, he would
lose diplomatic privileges and immunities, and would become subject
to the laws of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Cuba do not have formal diplomatic
relations; they are represented in each other's country by an
interests section, under the flag of Switzerland.

GONZALEZ CARRIED TOO MUCH CONTRACT BAGGAGE FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Associates of Juan Gonzalez, trying to
tailor Igor's baggy-pants reputation, are saying this spring that
something else didn't fit in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The word from the Detroit camp, where Juan is now the Tigers'
leading man, says the Rangers purposely allowed the big fellow to
stew in his own public-relations mess last season.
</P>
<P>
   If the club had no plans to sign Gonzalez to a long-term
contract, and if a trade in the winter was a given kept secret,
then Juan did play right into the Rangers' scheme.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was his snub last summer of the All-Star Game,
followed by Gonzalez' refusal to even suit up for the Hall of Fame
exhibition game in Cooperstown. Juan said his uniform pants were
too baggy in the butt.
</P>
<P>
   What followed both incidents was the obvious _ a large load of
local and national Juan-bashing in the media, plus Gonzalez was
also roasted throughout baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that criticism, the Gonzalez camp is now claiming, could
have been avoided if the Rangers had been willing to spin-doctor
the news, like many teams will attempt to do in those ugly
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who's spreading that stuff, but it's wrong,''
general manager Doug Melvin said yesterday. ``I know I personally
went to Juan and asked him to back off his stance on the All-Star
Game, and to apologize for what he said. I told him he needed to
restore his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan's answer to me was that he was comfortable with how he
had handled it, and what he had said was how he wanted to leave
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, Juan would be leaving Arlington less than a
month after the season was over, the No. 1 reason being because the
Rangers had no desire to play contractual roulette with Gonzalez
when he became a free agent for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers took that gamble, and even with a staggering $140
million, eight-year offer currently on the table, will probably
enter this season with no long-term commitment from Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Rangers received almost no fan backlash from
dealing the two-time American League MVP to Detroit. That alone is
rather amazing, and definitely appears to relate to the incidents
from last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, Gonzalez is gone because a free-agency
``cycle'' is at work in baseball for all clubs not named the
Yankees. Win three world championships in four years and it's
different, but for basically all other teams, the ``cycle'' goes
like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at our '96 team,'' Melvin said. ``We won the first
divisional title in franchise history \Rending a 25-year wait\S. It
has been three years since the end of that season. How many players
do we have left from that team?''
</P>
<P>
   For those of us caught trying to do a quick count, Melvin had a
ready answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two,'' he said. ``Pudge \RRodriguez\S and Rusty \RGreer\S have
been with us the whole time. That kind of turnover in three seasons
is a perfect example of how the system now works. Due to a lot of
considerations, most of it having to do with how you choose to
spend your money, and how much you choose to spend, a team will
turn over its roster every two to three years.''
</P>
<P>
   The starting infield for the '96 AL West winners was Will Clark,
Mark McLemore, Kevin Elster and Dean Palmer. Greer was in left,
Darryl Hamilton in center and Juan in right. Pudge was the catcher
and Mickey Tettleton the DH.
</P>
<P>
   The starting rotation was Roger Pavlik, Bobby Witt, Ken Hill,
Darren Oliver (who is back this season) and Kevin Gross. John
Burkett took Gross' spot in August of that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on his numbers, Juan certainly figured as a career
Ranger,'' Melvin said. ``But based on his free agency, it came down
to another set of numbers. How much money would it take to make him
a career Ranger? That's the telling part.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, the ``cycle'' goes the other way for the Rangers. ``Our
nucleus is in place this spring to keep this current group together
for three seasons,'' Melvin said. ``We have every player except two
tied up for at least two years, and most of them three and
beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer John Wetteland and first baseman-DH Lee Stevens are in
free agency seasons. At a contract of $3.5 million, Stevens is
almost certainly gone after 2000. Wetteland, due to his value, is
iffy, some of it depending on how young newcomer Francisco Cordero
develops this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In negotiations, I keep hearing players ask for a no-trade
clause,'' Melvin said. ``My answer is for them to sign a reasonable
contract and a no-trade is almost guaranteed. Rusty is a prime
example _ his contract is reasonable and he produces on the field.
As far as I'm concerned, Rusty will be here forever. But about 70
percent of trades these days are an attempt to either move or avoid
bad contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan, I think he meant you. \Ntagtop:Randy Galloway's ``Sports
at Six'' can be heard weeknights, 6-8 p.m., on WBAP NewsTalk 820.

FORMER CIA DIRECTOR LEFT SECRETS OPEN TO THEFT, INVESTIGATOR SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Investigators scouring home computers used by John
M. Deutch, the former director of central intelligence, found 42
secret documents and fragments of 32 others and could not rule out
the possibility that some of the information may have been stolen
by hackers, according to a report by the agency's inspector general
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch's mishandling of the information, much of it in the form
of letters and memorandums to President Clinton, left highly
classified programs and secret code words vulnerable to theft,
either through telephone modems or a burglary of his homes in
Maryland and Massachusetts, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether any of the information was stolen or compromised
remains unknown,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released the report,
an unclassified version of a longer report given to Congress last
year, as it questioned Deutch about his mishandling of classified
information.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Tuesday's hearing, Deutch appeared briefly before
reporters and for the first time responded publicly to the flurry
of controversy over his security lapses and the agency's slow
response to them. He read from a written statement and then refused
to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The director of central intelligence is not above the rules,
and indeed the director of central intelligence should be an
example of respect for security,'' said Deutch, who was the subject
of a criminal investigation over the security lapses that ended
with a decision by the Justice Department not to prosecute him. ``I
very much regret my errors.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's questioning of Deutch went on behind closed
doors, but the inspector general's report offered a highly critical
version of events that led to the discovery of the security lapses
and the agency's investigation into them.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., said
the committee would likely call Deutch to testify again on behavior
he characterized as ``inexplicable.'' The senator said the
committee would also call senior officials from the agency to look
into why an investigation was not handled more promptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're deeply, deeply troubled,'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the information included in the report released Tuesday
has already been publicized in news accounts. The report offered
new detail, however, on Deutch's actions and the agency's response
after it learned in December 1996 that Deutch had kept significant
amounts of classified information on government computers he used
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Even Deutch's explanations for wanting to continue using the
computers after stepping down as director _ that he had personal
financial records on them _ constituted a violation of rules
prohibiting personal use of government property.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Deutch had been briefed on the risks of
keeping secrets on computers not specially encrypted and protected
against espionage, but brushed the warnings aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite this knowledge, Deutch processed a large volume of
highly classified information on these unclassified computers,
taking no steps to restrict access to the information and thereby
placing national security information at risk,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said he used five government computers in all, four
of them with modems that were not protected. Deutch heightened the
security risk by using the same computers for surfing the Internet,
banking online and for sending e-mail messages. He even used e-mail
addresses with private services that could have signaled his
identity.
</P>
<P>
   His ``online identity'' at the CIA was ``johnd(at)odci.gov,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators determined that several of the Web sites Deutch
visited left markers on his computers _ known as ``cookies'' _ that
allow companies to track computer usage.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report did not specify what classified
information was found, but the investigation found that the
computers' hard drives showed that Deutch routinely drafted
memorandums using or referring to the classified documents,
describing official trips. There was also a spread sheet evidently
showing the budget of a classified program from 1995 through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The report also revealed that agency records showed that Deutch
``had problems before becoming director with regard to the handling
of classified information.'' The report did not detail those
problems, but Deutch previously served as under secretary and
deputy secretary of defense before moving to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The report accused two senior agency officials _ former
executive director, Nora Slatkin, and former general counsel,
Michael O'Neill _ of acting in a way that ``had the effect of
delaying a prompt and thorough investigation of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also rebuked Deutch's successor as director of
central intelligence, George J. Tenet, saying he ``should have
involved himself more forcefully to ensure a proper resolution of
the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The report suggested that the delays avoided the possibility of
an investigation under the independent counsel statute, which
expired last year. The report noted a similar case from 1996
involving a senior CIA official who routinely wrote classified
documents on his home computer and a laptop and was later
suspended, demoted and given a two-year letter of reprimand.

 &HT;    Campbell not just Tiger bait
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Michael Campbell remembers sitting on the
edge of his hotel bed after failing to break 80 in the 1997 French
Open and seriously pondering a career change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going, `What can I do?''' Campbell said Tuesday.
``I couldn't even hit the golf ball. I couldn't putt. I couldn't
chip. I was shanking my chips.''
</P>
<P>
   First, it was tendinitis in his left wrist that derailed a guy
who almost won the 1995 British Open. Now it had become, well,
cancer of the golf swing, as Chip Beck once called his own disease.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell lost his European Tour and Australian Tour card,
missing cuts on a weekly basis. He wondered about his old job with
the New Zealand phone company. He figured he could always sell golf
balls and give lessons to amateurs with swings even more crooked
than is.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about turnarounds. One day on the scrap heap, the next at
the focal point of the golf world. Three years ago Michael Campbell
might not have beaten Earl Woods. Now today, in the first round of
the $5 million Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship,
Campbell has the opportunity to knock off the world's No. 1 player,
Tiger Woods, at the La Costa Resort and Spa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to win, not make up the field,'' Campbell said. ``I
believe the way I'm thinking, when I'm in that zone and being
focused, I have a very good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell needs a little more luck than he has been getting
lately. During the six-tournament PGA Tour winning streak that
Woods assembled, Campbell's exploits on the other side of the world
became muted. Not only did Campbell, who will turn 31 today, win
three of the last four events in Australia, he beat Woods last
November in the Johnnie Walker Classic in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   For all of this success, by all logic Campbell should have
ascended higher than 65th, from 67th, for his last Australian win
and missed Woods in the first round. Instead, Campbell secured the
last spot in the field, the 64th, when Japan's Jumbo Ozaki
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   But, then again, any position in a field where the world's best
play for $1 million is enough reward, considering Campbell's
difficult journey. In the summer of '95 in the New Zealand Open, he
thumped a driver into the hard ground and ruptured a sheath in his
wrist, setting off an agonizing, three-year nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating Tiger at the Johnnie Walker in Taiwan in November I
think was the kick-start to my career,'' Campbell said. ``Everybody
expected Tiger to win that week. All the attention was on Tiger.
All I did was just play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   For Woods, the event's obvious favorite, the first-round pairing
is particularly dangerous. But with La Costa still soggy despite
sunny weather Tuesday _ another Pacific storm is to hit today _
Woods' length should provide a significant advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing well; he obviously has a lot of confidence,''
said Woods, who lost in the quarterfinals last year to eventual
champion Jeff Maggert, ``and it's definitely a match I'm looking
forward to playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Campbell feel like an underdog? Of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common thing we have is we're the same color,''
Campbell said of Woods. ``We're sponsored by the same brand, wear
the same golf shoes, wear the same socks, different clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Campbell fully realizes where the best players
reside every week. It's on the PGA Tour, where he eventually wants
to play as soon as a few unspecified goals are fulfilled in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at my fields I've beaten the last few months
compared to Tiger's fields,'' Campbell said. ``It's not as strong.
I think what Tiger has done is phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   If Woods is to win, Campbell pledges that it won't be through
intimidation. In a regular stroke-play event, he feels too many
players defeat themselves at the sight of Woods' name on the
leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's guys out there subconsciously going, `Oh, my God, he's
coming again,''' Campbell said. ```Here he comes. Oh, he's past me.
Oh, he's won.' That's where I think guys waste energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is intent on not wasting the trip. While wife Julie has
accompanied him to La Costa, 18-month-old son Thomas remained in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves me whether I win or lose tomorrow,'' Campbell said.
``He's an inspiration to me. He was born in August of '98, and ever
since then my whole golf game has turned around.''

   EDMONTON, Alberta _ After a nightmarish evening in Vancouver
that was a metaphor for this baffling, tumultuous year, the Bruins
arrived here Tuesday missing three players, one of whom is likely
gone permanently.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, defenseman Marty McSorley will learn the fate of
his season, which is almost certainly over. McSorley flew to New
York for a 10 a.m. hearing at NHL headquarters that will determine
his punishment for a despicable two-handed baseball swing to the
head of Vancouver Canucks forward Donald Brashear with less than
three seconds remaining in a game Monday night that ostensibly was
over in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley, who was assessed a match penalty for deliberate
attempt to injure, was suspended indefinitely pending the hearing.
He is no stranger to supplementary discipline. This marks the
seventh time in his 17-year NHL career that he has been suspended
and the fifth time he's been banished for a stick infraction.
Chances are, though, this will be a suspension of epic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   There are 23 games remaining in Boston's season, and it seems a
fait accompli that McSorley will be ineligible to play in any of
them. A suspension of that magnitude would break the record for
on-ice violence held by Dale Hunter, who was banished for 21 games
at the start of the 1993-94 season for a blindside hit on Islanders
forward Pierre Turgeon in the 1993 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Brashear, whom McSorley struck in the right temple, was
diagnosed Tuesday with a Grade 3 concussion; he lost consciousness
when his head struck the ice. He was held in the hospital overnight
for observation and released Tuesday morning. He was told that he
can participate in no hockey activity for at least 2-3 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty has said it publicly, he's ashamed and has asked for
pardon from everybody,'' said coach Pat Burns, who held a team
meeting Tuesday to try to purge the poison from the dressing room.
``There's nothing more that I can add.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in a state of shock. I certainly don't condone that
sort of play at any time and I don't think anybody should. Marty
has said that what he did was wrong and that's a step in the right
direction. Now it's up to the National Hockey League to decide what
they want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained to the players, that's not the way the game should
be played. These young players, they have to learn that and they
certainly got a good dose of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The disgraceful mess began only 2:09 into the contest, when
McSorley and Brashear squared off. Brashear pounded the aging
veteran, embarrassing him in the bout. At 12:22, McSorley tried for
a rematch but wound up with a double minor for roughing and
cross-checking while Brashear received no penalty. When McSorley
protested to officials, he was hit with a 10-misconduct and
banished to the dressing room for the rest of the period.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for the nasty end of the game, which Boston
wound up losing, 5-2. Had the game officials done their jobs
correctly, both players would've been assessed game misconducts and
tossed out prior to the situation deteriorating to overt violence,
which has prompted a police inquiry in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley was shaken after the game and seemed in shock himself
at what he had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very stupid play,'' said McSorley. ``I went up to him
to fight, as I'd done earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I embarrassed my hockey team. I apologize to Donald Brashear
and the fans who had to watch that. I guess I'm trying to write
checks my body can't cash and I got way carried away. I wanted to
go over and fight him like I'd done with so many guys at so many
different times. Why that happened, I don't know. No excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still kind of in shock at what I did. It was just stupid.
That's not the way I want to be known as a hockey player. The
repercussions are the last thing I'm thinking about. I've got to
reflect about what I did. I've played too many years and played too
honest. I've got to come to terms with what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   McSorley clearly isn't the player he used to be. Besides the
eroding skills, he hasn't been healthy, battling through a shoulder
injury and a bad wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as healthy as I was,'' he said. ``You square up and
fight anybody at any given time and I think I've done that for
years and years and years. You just get frustrated with yourself.
But I'm not making any excuses. It was so stupid, I can't believe I
did that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, across the board, were ashamed to be in the league.
Captain Ray Bourque said it wasn't a good night to be a hockey
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't justify that,'' said Bourque, who seemed more
distraught than ever. ``I have never witnessed anything like that.
I don't know what happened there. It was a shocker. It's a game of
respect where you go out and play hard and you battle. I can't
justify that. It blew me away. That's the first time I've witnessed
something like that. It's not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That takes the cake,'' added defenseman Kyle McLaren. ``I
don't know what to say. Something like that shouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did, and McSorley will pay dearly for it.
</P>
<P>
   The other two Bruins who were lost are Byron Dafoe and Anson
Carter. Dafoe, who suffered a knee injury, and Carter, who suffered
a shoulder injury, flew to Boston for medical examinations. Forward
Antti Laaksonen was recalled from Providence.

   FOR KEYES, AN EVEN SPLIT
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes may be the first black candidate in a contest of
national importance whose support among whites and blacks was just
about the same. Keyes, an outspoken conservative, won the votes of
about 7 percent of the blacks who voted in the Michigan primary
Tuesday. His support among voters overall was not much less than
that.
</P>
<P>
   TIGHT RACE IN MISSOURI
</P>
<P>
   The Senate race in Missouri is a topsy-turvy one if the polls
are any indication. A poll released Tuesday by the National
Republican Senatorial Committee showed the Republican incumbent,
Sen. John D. Ashcroft, ahead of Gov. Mel Carnahan, a Democrat, 53
percent to 43 percent. A Zogby poll last week showed Carnahan ahead
47 percent to 45 percent. A Democratic poll last month showed
Ashcroft ahead 41 percent to 39 percent.

<P>
   RUNNING ONE MORE TIME
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., announced Monday that he was running
for re-election. He also said it would be his last such
announcement. Grams has said he believed that senators should serve
only two terms. He was first elected in 1994. ``He believes
individuals should be citizen legislators, and should return to
private business,'' Grams' press secretary, Steve Behm, said
Tuesday.  &QL;

GUERRERO MIGHT GO NATIONAL SOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the second in an annual four-part series on the best and
worst of sports media in Los Angeles. Today: TV anchor/reporters:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To make it as a female TV sports reporter, Lisa
Guerrero was once told, she'd have to cut her hair, lose the
makeup, wear neutral blue suits and, most important, don't smile
too much.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be !ital!acting, wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   For someone who already had plenty of acting training with movie
and TV experience, asked to enter this kind of business as if it's
a pretend world wasn't going to cut it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be myself, not play some role,'' said the KTTV
Channel 11 sports reporter and fill-in anchor who has been with the
station nearly a year after leaving KCBS Channel 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't acting. If I want to go out and do a story and be
goofy and interview a bunch of drunk fans in a sports bar, I don't
want to be pretending.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tough enough for a woman to be accepted in a sports-TV
world dominated by pretty-boy anchors and testosterone-juiced
viewers, trying to interview immature athletes. But for Guerrero,
working in a city where TV sportscasts are personality driven, the
trick has been to get viewers looking past her incredible beauty to
see she also has a personality, creativity !ital!and a grasp of
what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   She's got the whole package.
</P>
<P>
   And since the former soap-opera vixen (Franchesca Vargas from
``Sunset Beach'') has put her acting career on hold in the midst of
the season for shooting TV pilots, it's serious time to see how far
she can go in the sports TV world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love reporting and producing features and writing my own
stories,'' she said, admitting she has no formal college training
in writing. ``And with the live anchor spots, I like to talk right
to the camera. And I'm getting that opportunity, so I'll take
advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   To L.A. viewers, her first break came as a part of KCBS Channel
2's expanded weekend sports shows, doing remote live interviews.
Her sports-reporting background, however, goes back to Atlanta 10
years earlier, then to Boston, where she hosted a talk show for
SportsChannel New England.
</P>
<P>
   In '93, she returned to her native Southern California and
worked with Fred Wallin's KMPC-AM morning show. For FIT TV, she was
a health-and-fitness reporter.
</P>
<P>
   But, yes, she could act.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the soap run (her character was killed off tragically
about a half year before the show was canceled), Guerrero had the
role of ``volunteer bimbo'' in the 1992 ``Batman Returns'' Michael
Keaton movie, and also played beauty roles in Sandra Bullock's
``Love Potion No. 9'' and Steven Segal's ``Fire Down Below.''
</P>
<P>
   As she juggled both careers, KCBS tried to get her to commit to
a long-term contract last year, shortly after Sports Illustrated
did a feature on her dual life. She considered the security a plus
but eventually opted to keep her options open.
</P>
<P>
   KTTV longtime sports anchor Rick Garcia heard about her leaving
the station and within a week convinced news director Jose Rijos to
hire her. With Guerrero's background in soaps, she said, ``I'm an
easy target'' for critics of her sports-TV work. But Garcia saw
through that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have pushed for her if I didn't think she brought a
lot to the table,'' said Garcia. ``Women in this business often get
unfairly put under the microscope and are often treated unfairly.
They make one mistake and everyone comes down on them. That's why
it's a joy to see someone like Lisa, who possesses a good knowledge
of sports, succeed. People are always asking me about her wherever
I go.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear a sports report delivered in soft voice from a
beautiful woman, maybe we're not used to it. But I think she's able
to pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Now connected to the Fox family, Guerrero has also been able to
pull off additional sports-related work. She's co-hosting a series
for Fox Sports Net called ``Sports Geniuses,'' a smarter-
than-average trivia game show that has been taping furiously the
last few weeks and will begin a daily weekday run later next month.
</P>
<P>
   And her writing, which has started with a column in the monthly
Street Zebra publication, could expand to steady work for a major
men's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes her run as a local TV sportscaster seem like
a brief launching pad rather than a long-term assignment.
Unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, there's a lot more out there for her than just
being confined to do a few minutes of sports news each night,''
said Garcia, who had Guerrero sub in the anchor chair for him and
Randy Kerdoon extensively during the month of December. ``People
with her talent go on to bigger things.''
</P>
<P>
   Which could mean a network sports assignment for Fox even before
the NFL season rolls around again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the pressure women sometimes have doing this,''
Guerrero said. ``It's TV, so looks are important. But some think
women are trying too hard to be like one of the guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a sports chick that's what I call myself and I'm proud of
it. I don't find that degrading at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as long as she's able to pick out her own clothes, wear
whatever makeup she wants, and smile as big a smile as possible all
the way to bigger and better things.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THEY DO IT WITH STYLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ KNBC Channel 4: The nebbish Fred Roggin has cut and pasted a
video career that runs on automatic pilot, especially during
February sweeps. As long as Carlos Del Valle isn't a threat and how
can he be, as he continues to butcher names like a Benihana chef
the female-friendly Fred will flourish.
</P>
<P>
   __ KTTV Channel 11: Adding a bombshell like Lisa Guerrero to the
mix with straight man Rick Garcia (who has been at the station 14
years) and the wacky Randy Kerdoon, and the Fox attitude comes
through for the nonsports viewers. They can even throw in Gil
Bellows (Billy from ``Ally McBeal'') and get away with it in this
town.
</P>
<P>
   __ KABC Channel 7: As much trouble as Bill Weir stirs up, he
draws attention with his dry humor that usually works. Curt
Sandoval is a worthy accomplice andRob Fukuzaki has the weekend
yelling part down.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THEY DO IT WITH SUBSTANCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ KCBS Channel 2: The Sports Central weekend team of Jim Hill,
Bret Lewis, Steve Hartman and Kimiko Tanaka has the combination of
high-profile, experience, opinions and womanly flair.
</P>
<P>
   __ KCAL Channel 9: You've got Alan Massengale as the front man,
John Ireland doing the grunt work and Derrin Horton as a capable
third wheel. Nothing flashy, just productive on a station that
carries the most local live sporting events, which sets the tone
for the sportscasts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THEY DO . . . WHAT? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ KCOP Channel 13: It's Michelle Bonner left to carry the
banner. Bummer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THEY DO IT WORST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ KTLA Channel 5: On weeknights, when anyone's watching
anymore, there's the veteran Tony Hernandez, who's been around
longer than Hal Fishman's hairpiece. On weekends, Claudia Trejos,
still in need of closed captioning, continues to embarrass the
industry. And then Stu Nahan pops in for some crusty commentary.
Adios, audience.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THEY'RE DOING IT NEXT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Fox Sports News: Expect some old faces (possibly Ed Arnold,
Newy Scruggs or Bill Seward) in new places once this thing gets
launched in the summer. It'll have an immediate local impact. &QL;

 &HT;    McCain proves power of center vote
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the past decade, presidential politics has pivoted
around the man in the middle, and Tuesday's results from Michigan
and Arizona confirm that the pattern is being repeated this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, and with more modest results in 1996, the man in the
middle was Ross Perot, with his wry denunciations of both the
Democrats and the Republicans. Perot's Reform Party has become a
sideshow, but the political urge for a candidate who avoids the
extremes of either party remains strong enough for the century to
begin with a professional wrestler in the Minnesota governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The wrinkle this year has been that the man in the middle also
happens to be running for the Republican Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   By ``middle,'' incidentally, we're not necessarily talking about
people who are moderate on every issue, but those who inhabit the
territory between the parties: independents, those disgruntled with
their parties and those who just don't vote.
</P>
<P>
   Without an appeal to those who fit that category _ and a healthy
turnout from those who consider themselves Democrats, as well _
Arizona Sen. John McCain would not have been able to crawl back in
the ring as he did Tuesday after the thumping he took in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   These outsiders have caused some discomfort within the
Republican Party, but in many cases the complaints are coming from
those who were outsiders themselves when Pat Robertson, one of
McCain's most outspoken foes this year, was trying to elbow his way
into the party in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   With a win in his home state and a narrow victory in Michigan,
the man in the middle is back in the thick of the race. But what
does that mean, exactly, in terms of his realistic chances to win
his party's nomination?
</P>
<P>
   It would be something if McCain and Gov. George W. Bush could go
on swapping victories in spotlight states, as they have for the
past month. It's hard to remember two candidates exchanging volleys
as these two have, with Bush's Iowa caucuses win, McCain's stunner
in New Hampshire, Bush's strong response in South Carolina and
McCain's rebound Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the looming 12-state March 7 primaries will force McCain to
make some strategic choices, hoping to find the states that could
be the tinder to keep his insurgency alive.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has to start making tough choices as well. He still has a
money advantage over McCain, but he can't spend full-bore in
California, New York, Ohio and Georgia as he has in New Hampshire
and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bush-friendly states of Texas and Florida coming up the
following week, it still is hard to imagine a scenario in which
McCain pulls off his Republican insurgency, although Tuesday's
outcome could bring more money and endorsements his way.
</P>
<P>
   That tension between a candidate on a hot streak and a long-shot
chance at nomination makes it inevitable there should be talk of
McCain taking his crusade outside the party, whether McCain at this
stage encourages it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has had to run to his left to secure the Democratic
nomination, and Bush has had to run to his right to nail down the
Republican nomination,'' mused GOP pollster Whit Ayres before
yesterday's vote. ``You know at a certain point they're going to
come charging back to the center, but right now there's this huge
opening, right up the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   So long as the middle is attracted to this Republican
competition, incidentally, there will be record turnout in GOP
primaries as there was in Michigan and South Carolina. Which, while
it may not be to the liking of some Republicans, is not a bad thing
for their party.

VAUGHN WANTS TO FINISH JOB
</HEADLINE>

   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Anaheim Angels position players reported to camp
Tuesday, checking in and getting physicals in preparation for
today's first full-squad workout. Among them was Mo Vaughn, who
greeted teammates before making it clear to reporters he isn't
going anywhere, despite the offseason rumors he would be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read all this about me wanting to get traded,'' said Vaughn,
who appeared to bulk up his upper body and shoulders. ``First of
all, nothing I've ever started did I not finish. I'm not about to
jump ship when things don't go the way they're supposed to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always believe my choice to come here was the right
choice. This organization took care of me, gave me an opportunity.
Things don't always happen right away. Last year was a bad year,
but we're in a different situation now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might say that situation is one of rebuilding and cutting
payroll. Although this year's payroll is roughly the same as last
season, it was money that kept the Angels from bringing back
pitcher Chuck Finley, causing many Angels players to question the
team's direction.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, though, said he can't concern himself with the
organization's direction, whatever it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter, I'm not the GM,'' he said. ``We're out here
to play the game the way it's supposed to be played and that's
it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Taking it personally: For the first time in years, pitcher
Brian Cooper didn't play winter ball. Instead, he stayed at home in
Glendora, got married and worked out in preparation for the season.
</P>
<P>
   But not playing winter ball also provided something Cooper he
could have done without.
</P>
<P>
   Angels bashing was popular this offseason, particularly as time
passed and the Angels roster didn't change much. The Angels' lack
of pitching is the heart of the criticism and that struck Cooper
personally.
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Stoneman has said he's content to go
with the pitchers he has, even if that means giving the young guys
like Cooper, Ramon Ortiz and Jarrod Washburn a shot at spots in the
starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, when I heard my name mentioned for the starting
rotation, it didn't matter what people were saying,'' Cooper said.
``It didn't bother me too much except that people didn't give us
credit. Whether we got here this year or next year didn't make a
difference. It's a credit to our coaches that they got us here.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Signings: Pitcher Matt Wise and catcher Jason Dewey were
signed for the 2000 season. Wise likely will pitch at Triple-A
Edmonton this season. He was 8-5 with a 3.77 ERA last season at
Double-A Erie.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey split time last season between Single-A Lake Elsinore and
Erie.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Sen. John McCain scrambled back into contention in the
Republican Presidential race on Tuesday, capitalizing on his
home-state advantage to easily defeat Gov. George W. Bush in
Arizona and riding a wave of independents and Democrats to gain a
narrow edge on Bush in Michigan, polls of voters show.
</P>
<P>
   The voting in Michigan has been watched most closely not only
because the campaign here was marked by bitter accusations of
unscrupulous campaign tactics on both sides, but, more importantly,
because it is the first large-state showdown of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain regained some of the footing he lost on Saturday in the
South Carolina primary by running well ahead of Bush among
independents and Democrats here _ as well as many people who had
not before voted in a Republican primary. Those voters poured to
the polls, swelling turnout estimates to at least one million, more
than double the figure in primaries here four and eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drew his strength from a vastly different pool of voters:
he drew far higher proportions of conservatives and Republican
loyalists than McCain. But those voters helped Bush more in South
Carolina than here in the Midwest, where the electorate is far less
Republican _ and far less conservative.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 percent of Michigan's precincts reporting, McCain had 49
percent of the vote while Bush had 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The two contests on Tuesday were especially critical for McCain
because after Bush's victory in South Carolina, he has sought to
demonstrate that he is not a one-state wonder who could only win
the primary in the tiny state of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Bush's advisers had hoped that they could
effectively knock off McCain after Tuesday's voting. And even
McCain's aides had acknowledged that a lopsided defeat in Michigan
would shatter their chances for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the voting on Tuesday assures that what McCain called ``a
wonderful, wonderful ride'' after his defeat in South Carolina will
not be over. It means that a Republican nominee will probably not
emerge at least until after the candidates sprint through 16
primaries and caucuses over the next 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the outcome on Tuesday will intensify the focus on
the races next week in Virginia, Washington state and North Dakota.
But the most important voting will be on March 7, which is
something of a national primary, with voters going to the polls in
New York, California, Ohio, Missouri, Georgia and several other
states.
</P>
<P>
   After the South Carolina voting, Bush and McCain rushed to
Michigan to concentrate their stumping because the outcome here is
far more important. There are 58 delegates at stake in Michigan; 30
in Arizona. McCain was also widely expected to win in Arizona
because he is the favorite son there who has served three terms in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush's defeat in Arizona, according to the polls,
underscores how the primary season has been far rockier than he or
his advisers had anticipated. Bush enjoyed the energetic backing of
the Republican governor, Jane Dee Hull. For a time last year,
surveys in Arizona showed Bush ahead of McCain. That led some of
the governor's advisers to happily predict that they would
humiliate Mr. McCain in his own state.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush's advisers now insist they never intended to win
in Arizona, they poured as much as $2 million into smothering the
state's Republicans in television commercials and direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   The see-saw nature of the Republican competition - while McCain
has won New Hampshire, Bush was victorious in South Carolina and
Delaware _ leaves Bush appearing far less invincible than he seemed
throughout last year when polls showed, month after month, that he
towered over the Republican field and could easily defeat a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the McCain campaign has fastened onto the theme that Bush
is such a weak candidate that he could lose a general election.
</P>
<P>
   But the voting in Michigan pointed to larger difficulties for
both Bush and McCain. Bush's constituency is drawn most from his
party's conservative wing, according to the surveys of voters,
conducted by a consortium of the television networks and Associated
Press. If he is the Republican nominee, it might be difficult for
him to attract Republican moderates, independents and Democrats in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for McCain, the surveys showed, is that he
encountered difficulty attracting members of his own party. That
could be perilous for the senator because many of the upcoming
primary contests are in states like New York and Ohio, where _
unlike Michigan _ only registered Republicans can participate.

RACE'S OUTCOME IS ONLINE BEFORE VOTES ARE TALLIED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``John McCain 48 percent; George W. Bush 46 percent,'' said the
story about the Michigan primary on Slate, the online magazine.
</P>
<P>
   What was unusual about the story was not the who, what or why,
but the when: It was posted on Slate's Web site Tuesday afternoon,
several hours before the polls in Michigan closed. The numbers were
the early results of the exit polls conducted Tuesday at polling
places across Michigan by an organization run by the major
television networks and The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, by mutual agreement of the news organizations, are
supposed to remain secret until the polls close so as not to have
any influence on voters who have not yet cast their ballots. But
Slate says that the rampant hinting on the television networks
about the exit polls' contents on various election days has made a
farce of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I publishing exit poll numbers before the polls
close?'' the Slate writer, Jack Shafer, asked Friday, in one of
several pieces he has posted on the subject. ``Because the exit
poll embargo that the media observes is a big joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Shafer, who also released exit polls numbers early for the New
Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, wrote that the embargo
``places a terrible burden on reporters, who are paid to
disseminate information and are rotten at keeping secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   In a posting titled ``Git Yer Early Exit Poll Numbers Here!''
Shafer said he would ask ``friends, enemies and acquaintances in
the media'' who had access to the data to give it to him.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls the networks and leading newspapers use all come
from a single surveying organization, the Voter News Service, based
in New York and administered by a consortium consisting of ABC,
NBC, CBS, CNN, Fox and The Associated Press. Other news
organizations, including The New York Times, are subscribers. A
representative of one member of the governing consortium, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said Voter News Service's lawyers have
sent two letters to Slate, calling the postings an unauthorized use
and demanding that they be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Lee C. Shapiro, director of media services for the Voter News
Service, said the organization would have no comment. Michael
Kinsley, editor of Slate, could not be reached Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the competition among the networks, particularly the
24-hour news channels on cable, has become so fierce that primary
races tend to be called the instant the polls close, if not a few
minutes earlier. And in the final hours of voting this year, many
of the commentators and correspondents on the air have seemed
extraordinarily prescient about the outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the race proved so tight that the networks
actually waited until the polls had been closed for 30 minutes to
call the Republican race in Michigan. At 8:34 p.m., for instance,
the Fox News Channel called the race for McCain. In its projection
of his Michigan victory, a graphic flashed with the estimates of
his share of the vote there: 48 percent, just as Shafer had
reported.

   KARABULAK, Russia _ By any reasonable judgment, life is
unspeakable for the 6,000 or so denizens of the Solglacia refugee
camp, a network of 250 tents and a strand of rail cars set along
the sinuous main road to Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   There is one water spigot. Electricity was spotty until January.
Hot meals ceased three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But all it takes to abandon reason is a brief drive a couple of
miles toward Grozny, to Mukharbek Hashtyrov's abandoned pig farm.
And suddenly, life in a green tent with any water at all begins to
look luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   Solglacia and the Hashtyrov pig farm are bookends in Chechnya's
lesser-noticed tragedy: the endless stream of war refugees westward
into the overwhelmed province of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   This irregularly-shaped state of barely 300,000 souls has now
absorbed more than 210,000 war victims, and with the Russian
government's seizure and purging of Chechnya's capital, Grozny, the
tide is again rising, by 300 a day at mid-month.
</P>
<P>
   As in the war, the hardest-hit are innocents who happen to be in
the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   The lucky ones _ 20,000 or so at most _ wind up at two model
refugee camps just across the border from Chechnya with the odd
nicknames of Solglacia (or in English, Agreement) and Sputnik. In
both government-run camps, families live in hundreds of green and
tan tents staked out on grids of bulldozed roads.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more live in long strands of passenger rail cars on
abandoned tracks next to each camp. The less fortunate _ now up to
190,000 people _ sometimes find a way to share private homes. The
unluckiest of all are cast into small encampments; some are
semi-organized, but all too many are squatters' outposts like the
Hashtyrov pig farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stay in cattle farms, in mosques, in former factories,''
said Alexander Petrov, the deputy director of the Moscow office of
Human Rights Watch, who is in Ingushetia monitoring the refugee
situation. ``There are hundreds of such places.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But there are surely few that are more demeaning than the
Hashtyrov place, a crumbling collection of 19 narrow, long-deserted
brick sheds set on a landscape of abandoned machinery and tall
grass.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in buildings filled with trash, dirt and hundreds of
rusted sties, nearly 380 refugees from the Chechen war have staked
out claims on the meanest of spaces. Eight and ten at a time, they
squat in concrete storage rooms at each end of the pig sheds, all
devoid of water or toilets. Each is by rubber hoses that feed
stolen gas into jury-rigged space heaters.
</P>
<P>
   In one 7-by-19-foot room, beneath a single light bulb, beside
the blanket-covered planks that serve as the family bed,
39-year-old Roza Murdolova gathered her seven children around her
Thursday afternoon. Her husband, 43-year-old Supyan, is an invalid.
</P>
<P>
   A single plate of orange tea soup sat on a stone ledge. A
plastic wash basin sat on the floor, by all indications unused.
</P>
<P>
   The family fled its home in Urus-Martan in November, she said,
after Russian troops besieged and then flattened the village in one
of the critical early battles of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nowhere to go,'' she said. ``My house is destroyed.
Everything is destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   A few sheds away, Zulay Takhaeva, 48, and his 35-year-old wife,
Rasol, refugees from Grozny, care for their two children and a
brother's five orphans in a single room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state brings us bread,'' Rasol said. ``Sometimes, it's
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, the Ingushetia government and international
agencies do reach refugees here and in other similar spots, though
often with hardly enough aid for them to survive. War victims who
obtain a pass from the Ingush migration service, a bureaucratic
trial requiring valid documents and other evidence of refugee
status, can now get half a loaf daily.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish Refugee Council, one of the most active charities
serving refugees, has delivered sugar, flour and cereals _ pearl
barley and buckwheat _ which have been a staple for some families
at the farm. The state brings water twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third turn as a refugee camp for the Hashtyrov farm,
once a bright spot in Russia's early-1990s march to capitalism. The
farm's 57-year-old owner, Mukharbek Hashtyrov, bought the property
in 1992 with the hope of converting it to a chicken farm, only to
be overwhelmed by regional wars.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But a war between Chechnya and Ingushetia quickly flooded it
with migrants who took beds, refrigerators, tables and other items
from the main office. ``They looted this place,'' he said in an
interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A second effort fell apart in 1994, when the first Chechen war
against Russia flooded the farm with still more refugees, many of
whom remained until the war ended in 1996. This time, Hashtyrov
said, the migrants stripped away door frames, gas stoves, and
windows.
</P>
<P>
   The farm sat idle until last year when the second Chechen war
brought refugees back. This time, he said, they have illegally
tapped electricity and gas for which the state is billing him.
``It's all on my neck,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Life in the tent cities and railway cars, with their organized
food handouts and conveniences like running water, offers
advantages to refugees, at least compared to places like the
Hashtyrov farm.
</P>
<P>
   At both Solglacia and the more sprawling Sputnick camp, a daily
hot lunch was suspended early this month after the Russian
government's Emergency Ministry ran out of money. Residents get
bread and intermittent food from charities like the Agency for
Rehabilitation and Development, a Dutch organization.
</P>
<P>
   In tent 36 at Solglacia, a 15-by-15-foot, 10-window affair with
a hole in its peaked roof for a gas-stove chimney, Zenap
Hadjimurtova sat with her 12 relatives and ticked off that day's
rare handout: ``Ten cans of tinned meat or four kilograms, five
kilos of rice, five bars of soap, four bottles of oil, 20 kilos of
flour, one tube of toothpaste _ the first in five months! _ and two
packages of washing powder.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no butter this month, she said, and there was
great disappointment not long ago when a donation of tinned meat
turned out to be pork, an inopportune choice for a camp of Muslim
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hadjimurtova and her clan _ a husband, two sisters, many
children, grandchildren and in-laws _ fled Grozny in September and
October and lived months in Solglacia before gas heat and plank
floors were installed this year. When regular electricity became
available in January, they and a few dozen other fortunates planted
poles, tree limbs or two by fours outside their doors and topped
them with antennas made of scrap wire and other stray metal. Now a
19-inch television blares Russian movies from one corner of the
tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to go to work,'' Ms. Hadjimurtova joked. ``When
there is a film on TV, we watch it. If not for television, we'd all
go mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hardship _ among other things, she said, the family
can only wash once a week, and men must leave the tent when women
dress and bathe _ the family realizes it is lucky.
</P>
<P>
   When she first moved to Solglacia in September, into a camp that
had barely erected its first tents, hundreds of others filled a
waiting list, many of them living in cars and trucks until new
tents were erected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were jealous of us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as one daughter, Sveta, was concerned, all the
handouts in the world are nothing compared with what they have
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can give us nothing,'' she said flatly, ``if only we
could just go home.''

   BC-BRADLEY-INQUIRY-NYT (moved on Sunday, Feb. 20)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, Feb. 20,
about an interview with former Senator Bill Bradley on the ABC News
program ``This Week'' said Bradley had endorsed the appointment of
a special prosecutor to investigate campaign finance irregularities
by the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996. While the article cited
Bradley's position correctly, the headline overstated it, saying,
``Bradley Calls for Inquiry Into '96 Fund-Raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was asked, ``Given the campaign finance problem and the
scandals of 1996, should we get to the bottom of what happened in
both parties, in particular the Democratic Party, by appointing a
special prosecutor to look into that?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley replied: ``Yes, I think that it would be very important
to get to the bottom of it. I think a special prosecutor's one way
to do that.''  &QL;

 &HT;    McCain's next battle: Proving to GOP he's a `true conservative'
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sooner rather than later, John McCain has to
impress Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued in Michigan to rack up overwhelming numbers
among the independents and Democrats who voted in the Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
   But exit polls in Michigan indicated that George W. Bush beat
McCain 2 to 1 among Republicans, roughly the same picture that
emerged from the South Carolina primary Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The peril for the Arizona senator is that upcoming primaries in
Washington state next week, then California and New York on March 7
count only Republican votes for the purposes of allocating
delegates to the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   There is no path to the GOP nomination that does not include
winning key states on the basis of Republican _ not independent or
Democratic _ support. Ultimately, the race will become a battle for
the 1,033 delegates that are needed to secure the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's results ensure that McCain will remain a viable
candidate until the California primary, said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe,
a political scientist at Claremont Graduate University in suburban
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had hoped to crush McCain's campaign in Michigan, building
upon his 11 percentage point win in South Carolina on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's performance Tuesday pokes another hole in the Bush
campaign's argument that their man is best suited to take on the
Democrats in the general election, Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's opportunity is to take advantage of some nervousness
that might exist on the part of California Republicans that perhaps
Bush isn't what they thought he was going to be, that he is not the
stronger candidate against Gore or Bradley,'' Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spent two rare nights in his own bed this week, as he
stopped in Arizona to vote in the primary there. But when he
returns to the campaign trail today in Washington, then in
California for two days after that, McCain will be stressing his
ability to beat the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with inevitability is that you're only inevitable
until you aren't,'' said Dan Schnur, McCain's communications
director and a veteran California operative.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, national polls show that McCain performs much better
thaagainst Vice President Al Gore. Oddly, McCain increased
his lead over Gore in the Gallup Poll that followed Saturday's
South Carolina primary, while Bush's narrow advantage over Gore
remained steady.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeffe said McCain also has to repair his image among
Republicans in California, by toning down his reform message and
turning away from his campaign rhetoric that he is an outsider.
``He has to show Republicans that he is a true conservative,''
Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   That task may be harder after the campaigns in Michigan and
South Carolina. In both states, McCain was practically in open
warfare with the Republican establishment, which was strongly
supportive of Bush in both states, and with religious
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But Californians probably will see McCain TV ads that link
McCain with Ronald Reagan, a California Republican icon. And in
California, core Republicans who watched Democrats take over all
but two statewide offices might be prepared to vote for a candidate
they think can win, even if they find him occasionally irritating.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will be trying to walk a fine line in coming weeks,
seeking more Republican votes without weakening himself among
independents.
</P>
<P>
   In several states, including Virginia next week, the Republican
primaries are open to independents, and in some cases, Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The cluster of March 7 primaries includes Georgia, where the
primary is open to all voters, and much of New England, where
independents can vote in the GOP contests.

MCCAIN SAVORS BIG WIN IN HOME STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ He was supposed to be home, taking a nap. But John
McCain can't stand to be alone, and besides, as he excitedly told
the advisers he kept calling on the telephone, his ``do or die''
presidential campaign appeared to be close to doing it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   By lunchtime here, McCain advisers were excited. Exit polls
showed McCain ahead of Texas Governor George W. Bush in the
critical Michigan primary, that he would score a big win here in
the Arizona primary, and, most important to McCain, that he could
prevail without big-name endorsements or crawling into the
negative-campaign gutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day is do or die, we're a high-wire act, an insurgency
campaign, and we've had a great, great ride, and we're proud of the
positive campaign we've been running,'' the Arizona senator told
reporters after voting for himself at Phoenix's Veterans Memorial
Coliseum. ``We believe that is the way the voters will finally come
down.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory in Arizona was expected but still sweet for the
three-term senator. Several prominent GOP officeholders, including
Governor Jane Hull, were working against McCain, whose relationship
with Hull has been stormy. She showed up at the coliseum before
McCain, voted for Bush, and told reporters, ``It's an exciting day
for Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers, however, were far more focused on Michigan,
where a defeat could cripple a campaign that had soared high after
thumping Bush in the New Hampshire primary and then was badly stung
in Saturday's bruising South Carolina primary. They had not had
much time to recover from South Carolina, so their best hope was
that Michigan voters would reject the anti-McCain barrage and
ignore Governor John Engler's endorsement of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michigan was the jury, and it voted against Bush's negative
tactics in South Carolina,'' said Michael Murphy, one of McCain's
top strategists. ``And more importantly, it has shown that McCain
is a far stronger candidate against Al Gore than George W. Bush,
because he has shown power in Michigan, a state that really counts
in the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, said the exit polls
showed ``a total repudiation'' of the value of negative
campaigning, which tarnished McCain more than Bush in South
Carolina. McCain vowed to end his negative attacks, and he angrily
accused Bush of ``character assassination'' when he and others
allied with Bush, like evangelist Pat Robertson, did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``What changed from South Carolina was that the people of
Michigan weren't inundated with negative attack ads by the Bush
campaign and its surrogates,'' Davis said. ``So they were able to
see the campaign in a relatively clear prism. We've always felt
that given that opportunity, people would choose John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   If McCain calls himself a high-wire aerialist, it's his campaign
that often seems to be flying without a net. Tuesday, encouraged by
the reports from Michigan, advisers hastily plotted a course that
would take McCain to Washington state _ political director John
Weaver called the McCain camp bullish on its Tuesday primary _ and
to the big March 7 contests in New York, California, and New
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll run full bore,'' said Weaver, who thinks McCain can stay
competitive because both campaigns have war chests of about $15
million. ``John is doing very well in New England, particularly in
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Vermont, and
naturally, all eyes will be on California.''
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls in Michigan showed that McCain was doing very
well among cross-over Democratic and independent voters. Bruce
Merrill, a professor of mass communications at Arizona State
University and a longtime McCain-watcher, said that may be a risky
strategy as the campaign heads into primaries open only to
Republicans. ``Even if he wins narrowly in Michigan, I don't see
how he survives for long,'' Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain is clearly exhausted from nonstop campaigning,
aides tentatively scheduled a predawn departure for Washington
state this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Cindy McCain had ordered her husband to spend a quiet
day at their sprawling home on Phoenix's Central Avenue. But when
he wasn't on the phone, or meeting with advisers, McCain was at his
son's school, attending the practice of his championship lacrosse
team. Tuesday night, the McCains planned a small party at their
home for family and friends before attending a larger victory rally
at a nearby resort.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, an estimated 4,000 people, mostly students, turned
out at a McCain welcome-home at the University of Arizona in
Tucson. Aides said it was the largest single crowd he has attracted
in his 22-year political career here. Deb Gullet, the senator's
state campaign manager, said he was ``tired and upbeat and
enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its kind of nice to be the first presidential
candidate in this campaign to vote for himself _ it's a unique
experience.'' McCain said.

TEXAS PAROLE BOARD DENIES REPRIEVE FOR WOMAN SCHEDULED TO DIE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The state Board of Pardons and Paroles ruled
Tuesday that there is no compelling reason to delay Thursday's
scheduled execution of condemned murderer Betty Lou Beets.
</P>
<P>
   On a 13-5 vote, the board refused to recommend to Gov. George W.
Bush a 180-day reprieve for Beets, and it unanimously rejected
commutation of her death sentence to a term of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to save her life, Beets' daughters pleaded for a
review of the case based on a relatively new claim that Beets was a
physically and emotionally battered wife.
</P>
<P>
   But parole board Chairman Gerald Garrett said Beets wasn't
eligible for a special clemency review that was authorized by state
lawmakers in 1991. The review, reserved for inmates whose crimes
may have resulted from overlooked domestic violence, doesn't apply
to Beets because she murdered ``for financial gain'' and has shown
no remorse, Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has never accepted guilt for the offense for which she was
sentenced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beets, 62, of Gun Barrel City in northeast Texas, is set to be
executed for the 1983 shooting death of her fifth husband, Dallas
fire Capt. Jimmy Don Beets. His body was found buried outside
Beets' home about two years after he was reported missing while on
a fishing trip.
</P>
<P>
   Beets would be only the second woman executed in Texas since the
Civil War and the fourth in the nation since the U.S. Supreme Court
allowed capital punishment to resume in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Appellate attorney Joe Margulies said Beets' trial lawyer knew
about a pattern of spousal abuse, but failed to raise it as a
mitigating factor. Backed by the Texas Council on Family Violence,
Margulies displayed photographs that he said came from the trial
lawyer's files and corroborated her abuse claim, along with her
daughters' sworn affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   One of her daughters said the photos were taken a week after she
was severely beaten by her fourth husband, Doyle Wayne Barker.
Barker's body likewise was found buried near Beets' home, and
although she was indicted in his 1981 shooting death, she was never
tried on that charge.
</P>
<P>
   Urging Bush to reduce Beets' punishment to a life term because
of her victimization, her daughter, Faye Lane, tearfully said,
``I've seen it with my own eyes ... All my mama's life she's been
abused. I've seen her beaten up by her husbands so many times I
can't remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could only have done something like this if she had been
very scared or threatened ... The jury never heard any reason to
have compassion about my mama, and when I told her lawyer, he
wouldn't listen,'' Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who don't live with it just don't understand what it
does to you, how hopeless, vulnerable and ashamed it makes you
feel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That contention was backed up by University of Texas law
professor Sarah Buel, an expert on domestic violence. She contended
the state does not have the right ``to execute a battered woman who
has been denied due process, who has been denied effective
assistance of counsel.'' Buel said Beets endured ``horrific abuse''
and was ``only trying to figure out how to stay alive'' when she
took her final husband's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, as her community, we have to take some
responsibility for failing to protect her at many, many possible
points of intervention,'' Buel said.
</P>
<P>
   Beets was condemned based on a Henderson County jury's finding
that the murder was motivated by her desire to cash in on her
husband's insurance and pension benefits. But her trial lawyer has
sworn that Beets knew nothing about those benefits until he told
her about them a year after the murder.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate lawsuit seeking the special review that was denied
Tuesday, Beets said she was raped at age 5, first married at age
15, and was abused by all but her third husband. Her ``lifetime of
abuse'' resulted in brain damage, post-traumatic stress disorder,
battered women's syndrome and rape-trauma syndrome, Margulies said.

NEW OPERA: AT NOT LOSS FOR WORDS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Words have been much on music's mind lately, and the two have
been as much opponents as colleagues. Watching important literary
properties (``The Great Gatsby,'' ``A Streetcar Named Desire'')
being wrestled to the ground musically has become a sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, words seem to be coming out on top. New
operas have to have selling points, and music is not first among
them.
</P>
<P>
   Manifestos are easier than the great books. Social and racial
justice are can't-miss categories (``Harvey Milk,'' ``Marilyn,''
``Malcolm X''). Narrate the thundering international incident
(``The Death of Klinghoffer''); add music to the popular movie
(Jake Heggie's soon-to-be ``Dead Man Walking'').
</P>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald and Tennessee Williams have more cachet, but
any topical news item or publicity-drenched cause will do. First
the sexy idea, then how to illustrate it with a lot of loud
singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gatsby'' and ``Streetcar'' have had the tougher problem. Their
newsy companions, with no texts set in stone, have enjoyed free
rides into mediocrity. How were John Harbison and Andre Previn to
get away with ``Gatsby'' and ``Streetcar'' with the authors looking
over their shoulders?
</P>
<P>
   Harbison may have looked back too often, thus becalming his new
piece with an undue reverence for the original. Previn's opera
moved gingerly through its minefield of famous scenes and
much-quoted lines. In ``The Festival of Regrets,'' part of the New
York City Opera's recent triptych, ``Central Park,'' Deborah
Drattell treated Wendy Wasserstein's clever libretto with such
open-mouthed awe that her music dwindled to near-invisibility.
</P>
<P>
   Cole Porter's ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' currently running wild on
Broadway, may have a better idea. Its center is Shakespeare's
``Taming of the Shrew,'' and bits of that hallowed text run through
the evening. But Shakespeare's plot is hollowed out. Broad outlines
are left standing; virtually everything else is trashed and hauled
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss Me, Kate'' ignores the play's maze of exchanged and
hidden identities. Some of the clever wordplay and punning
survives, but most of it gives way to songs like ``So in Love'' and
``From This Moment On'' and Porter's fiendishly clever lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Music can't emulate Shakespeare or Fitzgerald or Williams, but
what it can do is leave the walls of their writing untouched and
build something entirely new inside. An architect friend of mine
calls it ``adaptive use.'' We see examples all over Lower
Manhattan; and for urban renewers across the land, the idea is a
form of daily bread.
</P>
<P>
   What to do with a handsome loft building in SoHo once floor upon
floor of small manufacturers have disappeared? An earlier
generation would have torn it down and begun all over again. The
present one preserves the facade and puts behind it overpriced
living spaces, art galleries and clothing shops with Italian names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss Me, Kate'' proudly advertises its lack of fidelity by
offering a play within a play, the backstage drama emanating from
and sometimes bleeding into what happens before the footlights.
Another thing that gives this revival at the Martin Beck Theater
such a healthy look is its commercialism. It is trying to make
money by making audiences happy; and so there has been some inner
as well as outer adaptive use going on.
</P>
<P>
   The 1948 original pretty much went along with the Elizabethan
idea of womanly subservience. In the year 2000, delicate revision
allows Kate's elaborate postlude on wifely virtues to be delivered
with a smirk or two. Happily, Shakespeare's urtext has an
incorruptible life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Public reverence and public subsidy make sure that ``Kiss Me,
Kate'' can't touch it. The inviolability of the Fitzgerald and
Williams originals is equally assured, but that fact needn't stop
opera composers from ripping out any walls they want. It certainly
didn't stop Verdi, who used the bare bones of his beloved
Shakespearean plays and reconstituted them with powerful Italian
melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   This is one neighborhood zoned for anti-authenticity. If our
SoHo loft building really hewed to contextual accuracy, it would
recreate the old lost companies within its spruced-up walls and set
them to making parts for machines now extinct. Maybe these
operations could get a grant from the National Endowment for the
Arts or gifts from the French and German ministries of culture. I
can't think of anyone who would pay them money otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss Me, Kate'' bears a resemblance to one of those railroad
stations turned shopping center. Some trains may go in and out just
to keep the original atmosphere alive, but the waiting rooms and
all the attendant dramas of travel are pushed pretty much to the
side.
</P>
<P>
   Opera composers often begin with other people's words; the
question is, who will be boss? The horrifying drabness of most
music on Broadway suggests composers dedicated to making sure that
we understand every overamplified line. Visits to four musicals in
quick succession a year or so ago found the same semichanted,
run-on, through-composed music, replete with phony climaxes,
running from one show into the next. No one with eyes shut could
have told one event from another.
</P>
<P>
   There is a case for blaming the tyranny of words and stories for
the uniformity of Broadway musicals and the pervasive drabness of
new American opera, but maybe we are looking at the wrong end of
this argument. Maybe the true culprit is a lack of original music
in the first place. Storytelling has simply rushed in to fill the
vacuum. Perhaps, the only thing to put great literature in its
operatic place is better composers.

A LOFTY VISION OF A BETTER MUSICAL THEATER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Audra McDonald, the theatrical mezzo-soprano who has drawn the
kind of acclaim on which legends are built, is a singer of such
impeccable taste that she can turn the most rough-and-tumble
Broadway showstopper into a concert gem.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to her exquisitely phrased, finely shaded performances
of a program of mostly show tunes on her second solo album, ``How
Glory Goes,'' you come away captivated by as lofty a vision of
nonclassical American theater music as any singer has dared put
forth.
</P>
<P>
   Although the collection of 14 songs tilts more toward Broadway
than did McDonald's 1998 debut album, ``Way Back From Paradise,''
which consisted mostly of theatrical art songs written by obscure
younger composers, its musical point of view is just as elevated.
Classic show tunes like ``Bill'' (from ``Show Boat''), ``A Sleepin'
Bee'' (from ``House of Flowers'') and even Judy Garland's signature
tearjerker ``The Man That Got Away'' (from the movie ``A Star Is
Born'') coincide comfortably with gorgeous, little-known theater
songs by Jeanine Tesori, Adam Guettel and other lesser-known
contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   What holds the program together are passionate vocal
performances that glide so seamlessly between a semi-operatic
lyricism and a pop-blues gutsiness that the normal dividing line
separating classical formality from pop self-expression completely
dissolves. At the same time, the prim twittering arrangements for a
woodwind-heavy orchestra blur the distinctions between a theatrical
pit band and a classical ensemble. There's not a musical moment on
this predominantly contemplative album that could be described as
blaring or bumping-and-grinding.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably no accident that the collection's most heavily
represented composer is Harold Arlen, with five songs: ``Any Place
I Hang My Hat Is Home,'' ``I Had Myself a True Love,'' ``A Sleepin'
Bee,'' ``I Never Has Seen Snow'' and ``The Man That Got Away.'' And
it is also probably no accident that all five have previously been
recorded by Barbra Streisand, whose 1963 debut album marked a
historical musical moment that is comparable to McDonald's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Arlen's belting pop-blues show stoppers for Lena Horne, Garland
and Streisand established him as the most diva-friendly composer of
his generation. And McDonald, for all her classical restraint, also
projects an expansive, larger-than-life theatricality.
</P>
<P>
   In ``How Glory Goes,'' she seems to be staking her own claim to
this tradition and doing so on her own noncompetitive terms. The
album's opening cut, a joyous, beautifully articulated ``Any Place
I Hang My Hat Is Home,'' from the 1946 show ``St. Louis Woman,''
can be taken as a statement of musical intention.
</P>
<P>
   But McDonald's approach to Arlen is pointedly different from,
and in some ways opposite, that of Streisand, who recorded three of
these numbers on her first three albums. Those still-thrilling
early '60s performances blew the roof off the songs with a tornadic
intensity of will and the jaw-dropping bravado of a budding
superstar determined to conquer the world.
</P>
<P>
   If McDonald's singing does not convey the same raw excitement
and personal ambition, in its own discreet way it is as emotionally
charged. Interpreting Arlen's classic torch songs, ``I Had Myself a
True Love'' and ``The Man That Got Away,'' McDonald goes against
custom by making each an expression of private sorrow instead of
public kvetching.
</P>
<P>
   So many singers have used these songs to parade their
heartbreak, building them into crowd-pleasing athletic
demonstrations, that to hear McDonald's anguished interior
monologues is to hear them subtly reinvented. The mood of
introspection is mirrored by arrangements that refuse to nudge the
singer toward the footlights.
</P>
<P>
   Cut by cut, ``How Glory Goes'' (Nonesuch 79580-2) purposefully
builds to a quietly shattering climax that segues ``Somewhere''
from ``West Side Story'' into ``How Glory Goes'' from Guettel's
1994 Off-Broadway show ``Floyd Collins.''
</P>
<P>
   The first song's aching romantic cry for a mythical lovers'
refuge deepens in Guettel's song into a wider spiritual inquiry
about death, eternity and the possibilities of an afterlife. The
album fades out on Tesori's and Brian Crawley's tender lullaby,
``Lay Down Your Head,'' from the 1997 musical ``Violet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this kind of cerebral contemplation has had an honored
place in the Broadway musical at least since Rodgers and
Hammerstein's ``Carousel,'' that place has never been large. Which
raises the delicate question of how much impact McDonald's
brilliant but comparatively introverted albums can have on the
gaudy landscape of show business.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Streisand stormed onto the scene nearly 40 years
ago, she was viewed as a savior by aging composers like Arlen and
Jule Styne, who embraced this talent with the force to stir up
their creative juices. Since then, of course, many Broadway stars
have risen and fallen, but until now none has offered the almost
unlimited promise of McDonald, who in addition to having a major
voice is blessed with beauty, intelligence, taste and formidable
acting ability.
</P>
<P>
   In championing composers like Guettel and Tesori and placing
their songs alongside those of Kern, Arlen and Bernstein, McDonald
has made a bold and powerful statement about the future. Now it is
up to the composers and their collaborators to deliver the shows
from which she can spin her magic.
</P>
<P>
   But will they? Already one has come and gone, Michael John
LaChiusa's promising but flawed ``Marie Christine,'' which was
custom made for her.
</P>
<P>
   As for the public, beyond a coterie, does a mass music-theater
audience schooled in its taste by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Frank
Wildhorn and Boublil and Schonberg expect or even want a musical
theater as refined as the ideal envisioned by McDonald's albums?
Rude rabble-rousing pop fantasies have always been the bedrock of
the Broadway musical.
</P>
<P>
   It may well be that her vision of a higher and better popular
musical theater will turn out to be a pipe dream. If so, McDonald
will at least have dreamed as large as a singer who fuses the best
of two musical worlds could.

   If he were merely in trouble with Bud Selig and George
Steinbrenner, that would be trouble enough. But Strawberry has
flunked a test from the legal system of the state of Florida, and
the last time anybody checked, the legal system of the state of
Florida is not trying to win a World Series and sell tickets to
ball games.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later Darryl is going to run out of chances. The
hand-wringing and the teeth-gnashing will vanish. The anger will
turn to ennui, discounting the sadness we cannot help because we
are human and he is human.
</P>
<P>
   Or, some fans could congregate in public spaces and light
candles in the darkness in empathy for a man who might find colon
cancer easier to beat than his addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Or, some fans could picket his employer and say: ``Enough of
this soap opera. Cut the poor guy loose. Stop jerking us all
around.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all so boring, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd rather see this as a Rock Raines story, about a
guy who had his own troubles with drugs two decades back but has
stayed clean, only to be rewarded with a case of lupus. Now Raines
is trying to make the Yankees' roster as a spare outfielder,
because Joe Torre loves his hustle, the way he works the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Raines' chances improved Tuesday, of course, but he will see
that development only as a misfortune for Darryl Strawberry, as
will all the other Yankees. They love the man they call the Straw
Dog, love him for his street wit in the locker room, love him for
the sudden whip of his bat on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry had it made as a left-handed designated hitter this
season, but, as we are all learning about addiction, second chances
and financial need and an outpouring of love and support do not
necessarily help somebody caught in this cruel grip.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have the right to their personal devotion. He is one
of them. What should the rest of us feel at this stage? The louts
in Shea Stadium jeered at Darryl when he was trying to pull outside
pitches toward beautiful downtown Flushing. Oddly enough, as he
became a baseball stumblebum, a man with drug troubles and drinking
troubles and wife troubles and tax troubles and court troubles and
batting-average troubles, he became more lovable.
</P>
<P>
   Then he helped the Yankees win three World Series. Everybody
knew he needed the money. Steinbrenner stuck by him, threatened to
be Darryl's worst enemy should he flunk any more tests. Well, last
year Darryl was caught taking a ride on the wild side of Tampa, the
Florida town where the Yankees train.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was recovering from cancer, Strawberry had the
sympathy vote. Joe Torre kept referring to his driving on the wild
side with some drugs in his car as ``Darryl's little hiccup.'' What
will this be: Darryl's nervous twitch? Darryl's stumble in the
dark? Darryl's boo-boo?
</P>
<P>
   There is another side to it. Darryl sucks the air out of the
clubhouse, and not just from the cigarettes he smokes. This column
could have been about all the good guys who were not brought back
by the Yankees this year. Joe Girardi was the leader of the
clubhouse, a bright, inspirational and religious adult who wanted
to catch regularly, so he is gone. Luis Sojo, an engaging veteran,
is gone.
</P>
<P>
   And Chili Davis, who was right up there with David Cone for
insight and maturity, is retired, voluntarily, he said. The Yankees
preferred Darryl's residual power to Davis' declining
professionalism. Or maybe it was about saving some money on Davis'
salary. Or maybe Steinbrenner was truly soft about taking care of
Darryl. Still, Davis was the designated hitter who gladly shared
his job with Strawberry because ``I love him like a brother'' _
plus, Darryl could help the club, and Davis was all for that.
</P>
<P>
   Now maybe they will call back Chili Davis. Now Rock Raines has
an easier path to a job. Darryl Strawberry has made himself truly
superfluous. Next step: Transactions.

 &HT;    Rider may be moved by Hawks
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ It hasn't even been seven months since the
Atlanta Hawks acquired Isaiah Rider. But they are so weary of his
actions off the court and his moodiness on it that they might waive
him if they can't trade him. A trade appears to be the first
option. With the NBA trading deadline Thursday at 6 p.m., several
teams, including Miami and Chicago, are interested in acquiring
Rider. Tonight's game against the Sacramento Kings could be his
final game in a Hawks' uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only tell you I'm talking to teams around the league
about a lot of different things,'' Hawks general manager Pete
Babcock said. Babcock added that no deal would take place before
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If no deal is made, a decision to waive Rider and pay off his
contract is a possibility. When asked about his reaction to the
possibility that he might be waived, Rider responded, ``That's
cool. I'll get my money.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider's $5.4 million contract for this season is fully
guaranteed. He makes $65,853.66 per game. If the Hawks were unable
to trade him and elected to waive him before Friday's game in
Seattle, they would be obligated to pay another $1.975 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now 28-years-old, Rider gives this assessment of life in the
NBA: ``It's all about having fun and playing basketball and getting
paid,'' he said. ``If they aren't going to do that, then I'll get
paid and be at it next year. Somebody wants the talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there has been less fun and less money.
</P>
<P>
   Rider has paid about $200,000 in fines and suspensions this
season to the charitable Hawks Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that he does not share, Rider is noticeably moody
these days. His game suffered the past four weeks, as his shooting
and per-game scoring plummeted to season lows of .416 and 21.4,
respectively. Monday night, however, Rider apparently enjoyed a
renewed rivalry with Utah fans. Last spring, they suffered when
Portland and Rider eliminated the Jazz in the playoffs. He hit his
first four shots and finished with 22 points in the Hawks' 96-94
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the showing will encourage suitors around the league who
have some interest in Rider's offensive potential.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is one of them. The Heat is believed to be offering guard
Voshon Lenard, whose contract runs through 2002 with a total
obligation of about $9 million, and forward Mark Strickland, signed
through next season at about $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   One rumor to disregard involving the Heat is the widely reported
Rider-Alan Henderson-Bimbo Coles for P.J. Brown-Lenard deal. Brown
is not available, and Henderson is a base-year player under the
salary cap, which means that the Hawks cannot take back the full
value of his contract in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock might be able to deal Rider to the Bulls, who are trying
to clear maximum cap room for the summer. Chicago is offering
veteran guard Hersey Hawkins, who is signed through next season at
a salary of $4.1 million, and perhaps a second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   It would be cheaper for the Hawks either to waive Rider or to
suffer through the rest of the season and hope they can peddle him
in a sign-and-trade deal over the summer, when Rider becomes a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Hawks avidly protect their ability to go well
under the cap in 2001, they also want to remain flexible this
summer, when Henderson, for example, loses his base-year
designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably can't have cap room,'' Babcock said, ``but we
would not discount the possibility of being able to work a
sign-and-trade that would allow us to sign a free agent.''

THE SCENE HEATS UP UNDER THE MIAMI SUN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 David Hay is a playwright and journalist who writes about the
arts.  
 By DAVID HAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The talk was fast and furious on a January evening that
was distinctly chilly by Miami standards. ``Did you know this
building used to be a cocaine factory?'' asked one of the guests at
the opening of a new exhibition at the Rubell Family Collection's
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   A mile and a half northwest of downtown, the 40,000-square-foot
warehouse once served, in fact, as a storage facility for
contraband seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration. But on
this night, when many new acquisitions by the New York and Miami
collectors Donald and Mera Rubell were on display for the first
time, most of the comments centered on how the Miami art scene was
coming of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite something, isn't it?'' said Bonnie Clearwater, the
director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in North Miami, looking
at the crowd. More than 500 guests attended the opening, a
testament to the enthusiasm that has been generated in the last
year by the emergence of new artists and unusual gallery spaces in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Clearwater, who like everyone else was dressed in
standard black, was another star of the evening: an untitled
diptych painted last year by Chris Ofili, the young British artist
whose ``Holy Virgin Mary'' was at the center of the public debate
over the Brooklyn Museum of Art's recent ``Sensation'' exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   In his new work, Ofili juxtaposed two richly textured portraits
of a man and a woman, turning their noble poses into something more
flirtatious. The work rested on the floor supported by two hard
lumps of dung.
</P>
<P>
   Running through June, the exhibition, curated by Bill Begert,
29, demonstrated how thoroughly the Rubells have scoured the
contemporary art market. Only 105 pieces from a collection of more
than 1,100 works were on display; the contributions by Cindy
Sherman (a self-portrait from 1978), Damien Hirst, Charles Ray,
Rosemarie Trockel and the photographer Thomas Struth were
particularly strong.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Rubells' latest acquisitions were 16 paintings done on
such found wooden objects as the back of a high chair by the
Miami-born Purvis Young. (The Rubells bought 3,000 of Young's
paintings in one day last May.) A long, thin gallery was devoted to
photographs of performance pieces by the Chinese artist Zhang Haan.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that same night, much of the city's art establishment
trekked through the deserted Espirito Santo Bank building on
Miami's fashionable Brickell Avenue. A nine-story dark-tinted glass
box, it was about to be demolished to make way for the 36-story
Espirito Santo Plaza, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But on this evening _ inspired by William Ross, the president of
Group Espirito Santo's United States development company _ the
empty building became the site of an extraordinary exhibition,
``Departing Perspectives.'' Forty-four artists, ranging from the
well-known Haitian-born Edward Duval Carrie to students from the
New World College of the Arts, had spent four days making
installations in the staircases, offices and even vaults of the
empty building. Open to the public for one weekend, the show would
disappear with the arrival of the wrecking ball.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of imminent destruction proved irresistible. In one
corner office, Carol K. Brown opted to build tiny wood stairways
leading to miniature doorways carved into the wall. Behind each
door the artist glued a sentence typical of any good domestic
argument _ ``You'll Never Amount to Anything,'' ``You Always
Embarrass Me.''
</P>
<P>
   On another floor, Annie Wharton transformed a bleakly
utilitarian office into a showcase for beauty by covering the walls
and pillars with soft, circular plastic molds, each in a creamy
pastel shade. On the third floor, Julian Picaza, 22, Jay Hines, 22,
and Bhakti Baxter, 20, tore down walls to erect a moving, womblike
walk-through structure made of cream-colored paper, onto which a
video of ocean currents was projected. In a closet on the seventh
floor, Baxter had installed huge, almost grotesque ivy vines that
burst from the walls, symbolizing nature's attempt to take back the
doomed building.
</P>
<P>
   Many patrons commented on how strong the younger artists' work
was. Born and schooled in this city, a new generation is serving
notice that the Miami art world is no longer the exclusive preserve
of emigre artists from Cuba or Haiti or even New York.
</P>
<P>
   This meeting of the old and the new was on display earlier in
the day at the Fredric Snitzer Gallery in Coconut Grove.
</P>
<P>
   Attending a lunch for the Cuban-born artist Jose Bedia were
members of a collector's circle from the Birmingham Museum of Art
in Alabama. (They timed their visit to coincide with Art Miami, an
international art fair held in the Miami Beach Convention Center in
late January.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With his paintings on the gallery walls around him, the
long-haired Bedia talked eloquently of his desire to fuse the
symbolism of the Afro-Cuban religious system known as Palo Monte
with that of the American Indian. Bedia, who has been based in
Miami for six years, also spoke of the symbols he used to evoke the
forced journey of migration.
</P>
<P>
   Listening attentively was a 23-year-old Miami-born artist, Naomi
Fisher. Wearing a pale pink Lacoste cardigan, her black hair
falling gently about her face, the soft-spoken Fisher confessed to
being ``so comfortable in this city, I don't see any reason to
move.'' An exhibition of her large color photographic studies of
women imperiled by nature _ in one, the artist has buried her face
into the ground at the base of a tree, while in another she appears
to have been impaled by a coconut palm _ opened earlier this month
at the Snitzer Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   This burgeoning new talent has not gone unnoticed by the city's
major institutions. Later this year, the Miami Art Museum begins
its ``New Work: Miami'' project, a series of four exhibitions each
featuring commissioned works from two local artists.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, however, the Miami Art Museum and the Museum of
Contemporary Art are provoking a different kind of discussion. By
sponsoring major exhibitions of, respectively, Brice Marden and
Frank Stella, they are asking Miamians to examine the direction
abstract art took in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Marden exhibition differs slightly from its first showing,
at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington. An earlier work, ``Cold
Mountain No. 1,'' as well as two new paintings that continue the
artist's recent confident embrace of color, have been added.
</P>
<P>
   While some have noted how seductive Marden's work has become in
the 1990s, Peter Boswell, the senior curator at the Miami Art
Museum, argued that ``it would be a mistake to assume that the new
work is less subtle than the black-and-white images from the Cold
Mountain series.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, it's more subtle,'' he said. ``The interplay of
colors is complex and there's a lot more change and working over of
the painting than is evident at first glance.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions of subtlety _ and, surprisingly, even lyricism _ hang
over Frank Stella's exhibit at Charles Gwathmey's handsome but
modest Museum of Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   Wedged between city hall and the North Miami police station, the
museum has devoted its two galleries, one expansive and the other
small, to the first major exhibition of new work from Stella in the
United States since his 1987 show at the Museum of Modern Art in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The artist has moved from basing his work on geometric and
engineering templates to extrapolating from three-dimensional
computerized images of blown smoke rings. It's a multidimensional
template that allows Stella the freedom to construct even wilder
collages of forms, colors and objects. But the result of this
chaos, especially with the large canvases, is a gentle lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do have an ease about them,'' Stella admitted in a
telephone interview. ``They float above the ground.'' Between the
huge canvases are heavy, swirling sculptures Stella made in his
workshop near Newburgh, N.Y., combining preciously forged steel
with other metal objects from everyday life, like an old truck
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both museums expressed delight with the response to
the exhibitions. (The posters o the sides of city buses for
Stella's show, whose design was supervised by the artist himself,
may have helped.) For Stella's Feb. 12 public lecture at the
450-seat Kobens Center at Florida International University, a live
video feed to another hall had to be set up to accommodate the huge
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Just what impact these museum shows will have on Miami's own
artists is yet to be gauged. But their presence adds to the
community's growing sense of self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   This was on the mind of Amy Cappellazzo, visiting curator at the
Palm Beach Institute of Contemporary Art, who attended the opening
at the Rubells' warehouse gallery. ``To be able to attract two
exhibitions of this caliber at the same time is a tribute to how
this city's art world is maturing,'' Cappellazzo said. ``It's a
good moment to be in Miami.''

NEW POLITICS SHOWS ITS FACE IN GOP RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now on to the next round.
</P>
<P>
   They have debated about taxes, bickered about advertisements,
fought for the high ground as reformers, wrestled over the
definition of conservatism, sparred over leadership, style,
philosophy and approach. But neither Senator John McCain, Tuesday's
victor in Michigan and Arizona, nor Governor George W. Bush,
Saturday's victor in South Carolina, has discovered how to knock
the other out of the struggle for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And so the race that the experts said was over before it began
has apparently not even begun to be over.
</P>
<P>
   But already it is clear that the Republican race represents a
fundamental change in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the old politics, the field of candidates was winnowed by
voters. This time it was narrowed by fundraisers. In the old
politics, the independents and party defectors who ordinarily hold
the balance of power in American elections made their voices heard
in November. This time they are bellowing in February.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the entire architecture of presidential politics
has been altered. A process that once was in the firm control of
party bosses was loosened in the 1970s and 1980s, as the
proliferation of primaries transformed the nomination fight from a
private selection to a public audition.
</P>
<P>
   The election of 2000 has taken that trend of ``openness'' _ by
far the favored word of the theorists and reformers who fought to
implement the primaries in the first place _ and extended it,
drawing in huge numbers of independents and Democrats and thus
reshaping the system into a form that would be unrecognizable to
Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard M. Nixon and even the elder George
Bush, the pillars of the old style of Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   The number of voters in Michigan Tuesday was twice the number
who voted four years ago; South Carolina and New Hampshire also saw
record turnouts. These newcomers also have made the outcome of
primaries unpredictable, transformed the tone and timbre of
debates, added uncertainty, unpredictability and excitement to the
Republican contest, affected the course of the Democratic
presidential campaign _ and raised serious questions about whether
a party can or ought to control access to the nomination process,
its most important function.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of newcomers into Republican politics gave McCain his
victory in New Hampshire, turned up the pressure in South Carolina
and rousted Michigan Republicans from their sleepy complacency.
McCain won independents by a margin of about two-to-one in both
Michigan and South Carolina and by three-to-one in New Hampshire.
Only a quarter of his supporters in Michigan Tuesday were
Republicans _ and almost a third of them were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   These new participants have added new challenges to contenders
for the nomination, giving the struggle of the winter and spring
much of the same character and flavor as a general-election fight
of the summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   And though New Hampshire's primary, only three weeks ago, now
feels as if it were held in some other, long-ago age, its lessons
continue to reverberate through the political system. The day of
the primary, some 117,000 voters _ a third of them same-day
registrants, the remainder independents _ showed up to vote in a
contest they weren't expected to participate in. These were voters
the candidates wouldn't have courted before, and perhaps didn't
court this time _ a huge pool of people who aren't considered
participants in normal partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   But the notion of what is normal in party politics is shifting
dramatically this month. Those normally excluded are demanding to
play a role. Those normally in control are battling to retain their
perquisites. Those who once watched from afar are crowding in and
claiming a role, even affecting the outcome of contests in a party
to which they do not belong and whose ideas they do not share.
</P>
<P>
   It is a quiet revolution, being conducted behind the curtains of
polling stations, and the result is a system that, though less
predictible, is also less restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Now, against that backdrop, the Republican contest goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Bush holds the whip hand, the money, the endorsements, the
old-line Republicans. McCain has the enthusiasm, the esprit of the
insurgent, the support of the independents. The geography and the
mathematics support Bush. The chemistry leans toward McCain.
</P>
<P>
   A week ahead are contests in Washington state, Virginia and
North Dakota, which never before have played important roles in
selecting a nominee but now draw heightened attention. Then, on
March 7, comes a huge round of contests in large states, including
California, New York, Ohio and the remaining New England States.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has to make big inroads then. A week's delay would be too
late. On March 14 the significant contests are in Texas and
Florida. Both states have Republican governors. Both of them are
named Bush.

COMMENTARY: MCCAIN PICKS UP THE MO IN MOTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ It is a campaign straight out of Capra.
</P>
<P>
   A decent guy takes on the System, and the brutes who run the
System move in to destroy the upstart. They paint the populist hero
as crazy or deceitful. After a bout of self-pity, when he hates the
whole rotten show, he rallies with some sentimental hooey about
American ideals and routs the ruling-class bullies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, your type's as old as history,'' John Doe tells his
tormentors. ``If you can't lay your dirty fingers on a decent idea
and twist it and squeeze it and stuff it into your own pockets, you
slap it down. Like dogs, if you can't eat something, you bury it!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, like John McCain, the Capra heroes battling Big Money
could often get a little insufferable. They could be sanctimonious
and overemotional and flaky. The idea of virtue triumphing over
greed was always a celluloid dream. But it seems even more
far-fetched now, in a society where greed is a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, McCain's strategist, says he doesn't think the
Republican establishment ``is a bunch of guys in straw-boaters on
telephones yelling `Get McCain!' It's more like 100 lobbyists in
Washington scared that their contracts won't be renewed.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of moderates in Michigan, McCain can continue to
dog W., son of the Establishment, and W. can continue to try to
crush McCain, so that the Texas governor can run as the ex-fighter
pilot who can restore honor and integrity to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's greatest appeal was to conservatives. Many others here
were less impressed. ``I've done a lot of research on Bush _ the
man's done nothing,'' said George Thomas, 30, who works in
computers, as he voted for McCain in Royal Oak.
</P>
<P>
   What's remarkable about the Republican race is that the arcs of
the two campaigns mirror the arcs of the candidates' life stories.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the slacker, started in New Hampshire as a slacker. As in
his life, Bush relied on his name and some help from his powerful
friends to keep him afloat in his campaign until he decided to
apply himself, late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a process of steeling me to become your president,''
he told Newsweek on the eve of the South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, people get their steel before they run for president.
Anyhow, Bush probably should have spelled it ``steal.'' He
purloined everything he could lay his hands on from the McCain
campaign _ the populist bus, the reformer message, the one-on-one
town halls, even the design of the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who spent his life getting in trouble for his
impulsiveness and thin skin, let his emotions get away from him in
the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If there was one thing that was obvious, it was that the Bush
team, humiliated in New Hampshire, was going to be ruthless and
vicious in that most conservative and wired state for the Bushes,
South Carolina. They were clearly going to use all the tricks from
the Atwater playbook _ nasty push polls, racial wedge issues,
let-a-third-party-do-the-dirty-work fliers and e-mails. The
candidate would smile and call himself a uniter, not a divider,
while his team madly divided.
</P>
<P>
   But when it began to happen, McCain reacted viscerally rather
than cerebrally. He was so furious about Bush trotting out a
discredited veteran to trash him for ``forgetting'' veterans, he
was so enraged that a Boy Scout got a push-polling call branding
him ``a liar,'' that he overreached in a television commercial,
comparing Bush to Bill Clinton, then pulled back too far, adopting
an absurdly broad definition of negative advertising that tied his
hands on pointing out unfair Bush tactics. He capped a bad week by
using a self-defeating caustic tone in his concession speech, and
began intemperately railing about ``jerks'' and ``idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   People said from the start that it was too easy to get under
McCain's skin, and that his judgment was questionable at moments of
maximum pressure. He also has a tendency to fall in love with an
idea, harping so much on busting Washington's iron triangle that he
never set out any other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he not bite back strongly enough and quickly
enough, but his Michigan campaign degenerated into a wish that
voters would get huffy over Bush's brutal tactics.
</P>
<P>
   So far, we've learned that one candidate drifts and the other
gets wound up. So now we know what we already knew.

SINDEN CHECKING HIS PLAYERS

<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ No matter what happens with Marty McSorley
at his disciplinary hearing this morning, it was clear long before
he went off the deep end Monday night that the Bruins were a team
in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   There are 23 games left in the regular season, and the way the
club is playing right now, it seems they will miss the postseason
for the second time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns, who has been embattled for several weeks, is
trying everything in his bag of tricks to turn the team's fortunes
around. The players are saying all the right things _ ``We have to
get something going'' _ but they were saying that when there were
40 games left and then 35 and then 30 and then 25.
</P>
<P>
   President/general manager Harry Sinden, who flew to New York
Tuesday for McSorley's hearing, sees two possible reasons behind
the team's ineptitude: the players aren't good enough or they're
underachieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to assess whether or not we have a bunch of
players who are playing right up to their level and that's the best
they can do,'' said Sinden. ``If that's the case, we sure as hell
have got the wrong bunch of players because look where we are. Or,
we've got a bunch of players who are playing way below and are
underachieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to assess whether all these players we put
together a couple or three years ago are this bad because this is
pretty bad. We win one game every three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have 18 wins all year, and only five in their last 21
contests as they head into a game against the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're underachieving, then that's another problem,'' said
Sinden. ``It's hard to determine. We try to go by what you see is
what you get and that's not very much. We try to look back at last
year and the year before and we got a lot more last year and the
year before than we're getting now. Should we discount those two
years and just say, `This is it. This is as good as they are'? If
it is, we sure as hell missed on almost all these players, almost
all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden wasn't critical of his players' work ethic, saying he
hasn't detected any laziness. It appears the players simply don't
get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel in many ways bad for them,'' said Sinden. ``I really
didn't think they were capable of playing this loosely. We can't
win a game. They've forgotten how to play. If we keep playing like
this, we'll lose a lot of games. You know how everyone says, `If we
play like this, we'll win a lot'? Well, if we keep playing like
this, we'll lose a lot. We've really lost our way. We're all over
the ice. This is pretty bad.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With raised voices and emotional appeals, lawyers
for the four New York City police officers charged with the murder
of Amadou Diallo pleaded with jurors Tuesday to see his shooting as
a tragic mistake brought on by Diallo's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Eric Warner, responded with an equally
impassioned argument. ``Amadou Diallo never had a chance,'' Warner
said. ``In the mind-set they had, that man was doomed from the
minute they saw him.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' summations came after three weeks of a trial that
was, at times, racially charged. The four officers, who are white,
fired 41 shots at Diallo, a black man who was standing, unarmed, in
the vestibule of his apartment building in the Bronx on Feb. 4,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   In their arguments Tuesday, the defense lawyers stressed the
state of mind of the officers, who they said shot Diallo out of
fear. They believed Diallo was pulling a gun out if his pocket and
intended to shoot them, the lawyers said. The officers, who
happened to be driving down the street where Diallo lived, said
they approached him because they thought he might have been a
rapist or a robber.
</P>
<P>
   But Warner argued that the officers thought the worst of Diallo
for no good reason and that their judgment was flawed from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were willing to write him off on such flimsy
suspicions,'' Warner said. ``He was one of the people they were
supposed to protect,'' he added, but the officers ``took a dim view
of that block and everything went downhill from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury of four black women, two white women and six white men
is to begin deliberating Wednesday, after hearing instructions on
the law from Justice Joseph C. Teresi of the Supreme Court. The
officers could be convicted of second-degree murder, first-degree
manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide in relation to
Diallo, and reckless endangerment of bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants _ Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy
and Kenneth Boss _ all pleaded innocent to the two counts of
second-degree murder that each is charged with in the killing of
Diallo, a 22-year-old immigrant from Guinea. The first count is for
Diallo's death and the second for depraved indifference to human
life.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Their minimum penalties, if they are convicted, range from
probation to imprisonment for 15 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the officers were charged with any crime at all
has enraged many police supporters, including the police officers
and relatives who pack the courtroom every day. The trial was moved
from the Bronx because of concerns over pretrial publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district attorney asks you to judge them and what they did
that night,'' Steven Brounstein, who represents Boss, told the jury
Tuesday. ``That is arrogance and that is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The main defense argument, generally, is justification, and it
rests chiefly on the testimony of the four officers. Under New York
law, a killing can be justified if a reasonable person in the same
circumstances would have believed his life was in danger. Each
officer said that he believed that Diallo had a gun; it turned out
to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the officers, there was one eyewitness to the
shooting, Schrrie Elliott, but her testimony was contradictory on
many critical points. She said, for instance, that she heard one of
the officers shout, ``Gun!'' but she also said that it could have
been Diallo himself who said it. And she said that Diallo fell to
the ground immediately when the shooting started, but also said
that he remained standing through many of the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the defense lawyers relied heavily on her
testimony in their summations Tuesday. ``She destroyed their
case,'' said James Culleton, who represents Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Worth, the lawyer for McMellon, called her ``the key
witness in this case,'' who had provided the most important
testimony in the case, the word ``gun.''
</P>
<P>
   In their opening statements, the defense had blamed Diallo for
the shooting, but their attacks on him were much harsher Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went through every body motion and conveyed with every
nonverbal cue that he had a gun,'' said John D. Patten, the lawyer
for Carroll, who led the four in their attack on Diallo and fired
16 shots. ``Why didn't he talk to them?'' Patten demanded, his
voice rising. ``Why didn't he stop? Why did he reach into his
pocket? Why did he turn his back to them?''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``When that man turned around, that was it. You can't
ask them to stand around and get blasted away.''
</P>
<P>
   Culleton was somewhat gentler in his assessment of Diallo's
behavior, but said he had been acting suspiciously, peering out
from the stoop of his building. The officers, he said, ``had an
obligation to stop and ask, `Who are you? What are you doing here
in this high-crime area?''' The incident escalated, Culleton said,
``for reasons we will never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers had said in their opening statements that
they would present evidence to show why Diallo might have wanted to
flee from the police, but, as Warner pointed out, they never
offered any such evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In Warner's view, it was Diallo, not the officers, who logically
had reason to be afraid. At 5 foot 6 inches and 160 pounds, Diallo
probably felt terrified and overpowered by the four large men in
plainclothes who were armed and wearing protective vests as they
confronted him, Warner said. It was very likely, Warner added, that
when Diallo reached into his pocket he was either looking for money
to surrender to what he perceived as a group of robbers or
identification to show them.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, . Warner said, the officers never paused to view
the situation from Diallo's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it was unavoidable,'' Warner said. ``But it was a
terrible series of conscious decisions that fell far short of
protecting his life.''

DOW JONES AND EXCITE PLAN WEB VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Note (at) in parens designates the `at' sign in Excite
company name.)  
(jw) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move combining the news resources of Dow Jones &AMP; Co. with
the technical expertise and audience reach of Excite(at)Home, the
two corporations plan to create a new Internet site devoted to
business-to-business communications and transactions for small and
medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, to be called Work.com _ the same name of
Excite(at)Home's current business-oriented site _ would start late
this summer, the two companies said Tuesday, and would carry the
kind of breaking news coverage now available on dowjones.com.
</P>
<P>
   Executives also said they hoped to make an initial public
offering of some shares in the venture after its start. But L.
Gordon Crovitz, a senior vice president of Dow Jones for electronic
publishing, said that the offering would not preclude a possible
separate offering of a stock tracking Dow Jones' Internet assets.
</P>
<P>
   George Bell, president of Excite, said that his company, which
is the biggest portal on the Web with access to high-speed cable
modem communications, could offer small business clients services,
including Web hosting, e-mail and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Customers in the target market _ companies with 500 or fewer
employees _ could use the site's features to set themselves up for
business on the Internet. In particular, Bell said, Excite(at)Home
could offer services that would both draw potential audiences and
customers to small businesses as they go online and help them
manage Web traffic issues to avoid the system crashes that
sometimes plague small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The new site would initially derive most of its revenue from
advertising, though eventually, as the site's offerings became
richer, other sources, from subscriptions to transactional
revenues, would be expected to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The new company would move into a business niche now occupied by
companies like Office.com, a Winstar Communications site that
packages business news from sources like Reuters and Knight Ridder
with guidance and specialized information on e-commerce; and Penton
Media, which publishes trade magazines, runs conferences and trade
shows and maintains more than 40 Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that owning this business portal franchise is very
important to Dow Jones,'' said Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch. ``And Excite(at)Home is up against the wall to get
distinguishable content.''
</P>
<P>
   Crovitz said he was not worried about the new company
cannibalizing Dow Jones' existing Internet offerings, which include
The Wall Street Journal online; as of December that site had
375,000 subscribers and accounted for about $32 million of Dow
Jones' estimated $150 million in Internet revenue in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The current offerings on the free dowjones.com Web site, which
would migrate to the new Work.com site, include part of the
material on the Dow Jones wire service and limited selections from
The Journal's online edition.

<P>
   PHOENIX _ In the end, the home-state hero more than held his own
here Tuesday night, as Sen. John McCain's resounding victory over
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas cut across virtually all demographic
groups in the Arizona Republican electorate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won despite an unusually divisive campaign in which he
lost the support of his own governor and was outspent roughly
10-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   In surveys of voters leaving the polls, McCain led by about 20
points, losing to Bush only among the quarter of the electorate
that described itself as very conservative, which Bush carried with
just over five in 10 votes, to just under four in 10 for McCain.
Among voters who said that abortion should always be illegal, Bush
barely edged out McCain.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs that Bush's television advertising blitz, and
McCain's 17-year electoral career in which he has made his share of
enemies here, took a toll in a state where the population is
growing dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain beat Bush nearly 2-to-1 among longtime residents,
and won a majority even among those who have moved here within the
last 10 years, Bush ran strongly among the newcomers, taking just
over four in 10 of their votes. And though McCain beat out Bush for
the title of ``the real reformer'' in the race, a plurality of
voters _ nearly a third _ said both were. That apparently reflected
the success of Bush's post New Hampshire claim to be a ``reformer
with results.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain seemed to have had the upper hand all along. Three
quarters of voters said he had the temperament to be an effective
president (though the one quarter who did not voted overwhelmingly
for Bush), and a majority of voters who made up their minds Tuesday
decided for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has long tended assiduously to the retirement
community of Sun City, and he won overwhelmingly among voters who
said that world affairs, campaign finance reform or the combination
of Social Security and Medicare were the most important issues. He
also prevailed among those who cared most about moral values or
education, though by smaller margins. Bush easily won among those
who picked abortion or taxes as the most important issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Dee Hull, whose history with McCain includes hectoring
phone calls from him, bolted last year to Bush. When she went to
the polls Tuesday, she was joined by a brace of other Western
Republican governors, Marc Racicot of Montana and Ed Schafer of
North Dakota. Ms. Hull had said McCain needed a 30-point victory to
be seen as winning.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday evening, at what was billed as a ``primary night
celebration'' at a downtown hotel, she was philosophical about his
victories here and in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain's national exposure has been unbelievable, and I
think we all admit that it's been something you can't buy,'' Ms.
Hull said, adding that she thought Bush's overall national effort
would not be derailed. `I think Bush can appeal to Democrats'' in a
general election, she said. ``I'm not sure that appealing to
Democrats in a Republican primary is the place to be doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even McCain aides doubted that Hull's decision to back Bush
would have any political ramifications for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it'll matter one way or the other,'' said Wes
Gullett, a longtime McCain adviser who oversaw the campaign here.
</P>
<P>
   And no one seemed inclined to claim that the results portended
anything particular for this once-ironclad Republican state, which
in recent years has seen such an influx of younger, more liberal
residents that President Clinton carried it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't say much,'' said Pat Murphy, a former editor and
publisher at The Arizona Republic who is often critical of McCain.
``Unless you look at it the other way, which is that he didn't get
30 (percent), which isn't great for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he explained the victory margin, despite the spending
imbalance, Gullett said: ``John said it best when he said, `We
haven't run one television ad in Arizona because people know me.'
People do know him, and they support him. Now, you know, you'd
always like to do better, but I think today looks like a good
victory. We accomplished our objective,'' which was to win the
state's 30 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last fall, polls showed Bush holding a slight edge
over McCain here, and the Texan devoted considerable resources to
an effort to embarrass McCain on his home turf. McCain aides
estimate that in the end, Bush outspent them about 10-to-1, with $2
million worth of television advertising and direct mail to $200,000
in radio ads for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a difference of a few zeroes,'' the Arizona Republican
Party chairman, Mike Minnaugh, said dryly Tuesday.

 McSORLEY, BANNED, FACES HEARING WEDNESDAY IN STICK ATTACK  
(lh) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two investigations began Tuesday following the stick
attack by Boston's Marty McSorley against Vancouver's Donald
Brashear.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley, suspended indefinitely for striking Brashear in the
head with 2.7 seconds remaining during Vancouver's 5-2 victory
Monday night, is scheduled to appear Wednesday morning at a
disciplinary hearing at National Hockey League headquarters in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Brashear was released from a Vancouver hospital Tuesday, a team
spokesman said, and is being treated for a Grade 3 concussion, the
most serious level. The recommended period of recuperation is 14 to
21 days, the Canucks said.
</P>
<P>
   Three detectives for the Vancouver police force were assigned to
the case. A police spokeswoman said they will view videotape and
conduct interviews before presenting their findings to a
prosecutor, who could charge McSorley with assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a standard, thorough investigation into an assault,''
said Constable Anne Drennan, speaking for the Vancouver police
department. ``We are in the evidence-gathering stages.''
</P>
<P>
   The longest suspension in league history for an on-ice incident
was 21 games, and that infraction did not involve the use of a
stick. The longest suspension for a stick-related foul was 15
games, given to three players in three different incidents.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley and Brashear, among the toughest and most penalized
players of this era, had fought early in the game with Brashear
winning the bout.
</P>
<P>
   Brashear declined McSorley's invitation for a second fracas,
even after McSorley was penalized for cross-checking and roughing
him. According to Pat Burns, the Boston coach, Brashear may have
angered some Bruins by flexing his muscles in front of the Boston
bench.
</P>
<P>
   With both players skating on the game's final shift, McSorley
swung his stick and connected with the right side of Brashear's
head, below the bottom of his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   As Brashear fell, his helmet came off and the back of his head
hit the ice. He lay unconscious, blood flowing from his nose, while
McSorley taunted him, briefly. As doctors rushed to Brashear's aid,
the Vancouver goalie Garth Snow attacked McSorley.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans fought in the stands and many spectators threw debris.
Brashear was carried from the ice on a stretcher, his neck in a
brace, and was revived in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the game, Boston goalie Byron Dafoe left on a
stretcher after Brashear fell into him, resulting in an
interference penalty to Brashear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in shock at what I did,'' McSorley said shortly
after the game. ``I have to come to terms with what I did. There's
no excuse. I got way too carried away. It was a real dumb play. I
apologize to Donald Brashear and all the fans who had to watch
that. I embarrassed my hockey team. I don't know what was going
through my mind at that time. It was a stupid mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   McSorley, 36, broke into the NHL in 1983-84 with Pittsburgh. He
has been suspended seven times in his career, five of them for
stick-related infractions, the longest of them six days. With 3,381
penalty minutes in regular-season play, McSorley is third in league
history behind Dave ``Tiger'' Williams, with 3,966, and Dale Hunter
with 3,565. Hunter, then with Washington, was suspended 21 games
for checking and injuring Pierre Turgeon of the New York Islanders
after Turgeon scored a goal in the 1993 playoffs.

<P>
   McSorley's best-known involvement with a stick violation
involved the curve of his blade. During the 1993 Stanley Cup
finals, when McSorley was with Los Angeles, the Kings were leading
the Montreal Canadiens by one game in the four-of-seven-game series
and were ahead late in Game 2 in Montreal. But the Canadiens
requested a measurement of McSorley's stick, which was found to be
illegally curved. He was penalized, and the Canadiens scored on the
power play, sparking a game-winning comeback that led to a Montreal
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Brashear, 28, broke into the league with Montreal in 1993-94 and
has 1,278 penalty minutes in 386 regular-season games. Brashear is
one of 16 black players who have played in the NHL this season, the
most in league history. McSorley is white. There were no reports of
any racial undercurrent to the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to go with complete physical inactivity, not even
skating,'' said Rob Viccars of the Canucks media relations
department.
</P>
<P>
   Many players on both teams reacted with revulsion. Vancouver's
Mark Messier, a friend of McSorley's and a former teammate of his
in Edmonton and New York, said: ``We can't allow that to happen in
the league. It's really tough. Something like that takes the air
out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque, the veteran Boston defenseman, said: ``It was a
shocker. It just blew me away. It's not a good night to be a hockey
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin Campbell, the NHL's executive vice president and director
of hockey operations, will conduct Wednesday's meeting with
McSorley. Frank Brown, a league spokesman, said it is not certain
that a league ruling will be announced. Incidents resulting in
suspensions of four games or fewer are discussed only by telephone.
Players who appear in person are those suspended for longer
periods.

   Microsoft Presses Defense As Trial Draws to a Close
</P>
<P>
   After 16 months of testimony and argument the antitrust suit
against Microsoft drew to a close. A verdict is expected in the
next few weeks, but even then the court is likely to hold separate
hearings on remedies if, as expected, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
rules that Microsoft violated antitrust laws. As Microsoft and the
government concluded the trial, their representatives were still
continuing to meet in Chicago in search of a settlement in
mediation talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, America's big-name investment banks and consulting
firms considered it a waste of time to send recruiters to
second-tier business schools. Harvard, Stanford, the Wharton School
at Penn and a handful of others supplied the talent they needed.
</P>
<P>
   MBA candidates at large state schools or lesser-known private
schools could not expect to see many blue-chip recruiters on their
campuses. They had to send in their resumes and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, that elitist approach is fading, another
consequence of the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the long economic boom has increased demand at banks and
consulting firms for new hires, many of the brightest students at
the top business schools are joining Internet start-ups instead. As
a result, prestigious firms are descending on many schools that
make the Top 50 lists compiled by Business Week and U.S. News &AMP;
World Report but are nowhere near the top.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, students and administrators at the newly
initiated members of the club are ecstatic. ``The top firms are
coming up empty more often at the top schools,'' said Stuart I.
Greenbaum, dean of the Olin School at Washington University in St.
Louis. ``It's opened a whole new tier of opportunities for our
students.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, 17 companies, including CIBC
Oppenheimer, have started recruiting at the Kelley School of
Business at Indiana University, increasing the number of on-campus
recruiters there by about 15 percent. A.T. Kearney has gone to the
Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University for the
first time. Chase Manhattan is recruiting at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers went to the University of Georgia. And
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette made a visit to St. Louis to talk to
Greenbaum's students. Andersen Consulting, Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter are also among the firms expanding their pools.
</P>
<P>
   And recruiters say they are having little trouble finding
qualified candidates, so long as they focus on the best students at
the second-tier schools. ``The notion that all the world's talent
comes out of three business schools I find hilarious,'' said Lenny
T. Mendonca, a director in the San Francisco office of McKinsey &AMP;
Co. Three years ago, McKinsey began using the Internet to reach
campuses where it does not send recruiters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shift could not have come at a more opportune time for
second-tier schools. At some of them, applications have leveled off
in the last year as the booming economy has kept in the work force
people who may otherwise have taken time off to give their careers
an MBA boost. Many deans also fret about the long-term threat of
the top schools' cutting into the second-tier schools' revenue by
offering programs over the Internet. Being added to the recruiting
lists, the deans said, will help their marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Life just got easier for the recruiters, too. Accustomed to
wooing freshly minted Harvard and Stanford MBAs caught up in dreams
of Internet riches, they are suddenly encountering students who are
generally thrilled to see them and eager to sign up at their firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tremendously excited,'' said Vivian Chen, 29, a
second-year student at Washington University, who recently accepted
a job at Salomon Smith Barney. When recruiters for the firm came to
her school for the first time this year, but did not interview for
the kind of job Chen wanted, she used connections through an
alumnus and her internship at another firm last summer to land an
interview at a Salomon office. ``It was a joint effort,'' Chen
said, a combination of ``a firm willing to expand its horizons''
and ``my tenacity.''
</P>
<P>
   When recruiters do find what they are looking for, a bonus often
comes attached: cheaper labor. Students at lower-ranked schools _
whose average starting pay packages are about $80,000, some $30,000
less than the typical student at the top schools would draw _ are
less likely to have lucrative competing offers that would force a
firm to bid up their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The big uncertainty now is whether the trend will reverse when
the economy slows or Internet businesses go through a retrenchment.
Deans at the second-tier schools say that the students of today are
the recruiters of tomorrow and that the current wave of hiring will
allow the schools to establish a long-term presence at the firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I have my people on the inside,'' Greenbaum said, ``I
don't expect to get pushed out.'' If that is the case, middling
students at the top schools could eventually lose out to star
performers at lesser-ranked institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Others looking at the trend are not so sure, though. ``I'm
hoping they'll come back to us'' and try to hire as many graduates
in future years as they now are, said Roxanne Hori, the director of
career management at the Kellogg School of Management at
Northwestern, a top-ranked school. ``But I don't know. That's sort
of the million-dollar question.''
</P>
<P>
   The elite firms' deployment of recruiters to second-tier schools
began in earnest a couple of years ago to fill double-digit
increases in their staff openings. Bain &AMP; Co., for example, says it
will hire about 250 MBAs this year, up from 180 two years ago.
``The top seven or eight schools,'' said Stan Miranda, a director
in charge of the firm's recruiting, ``just cannot satisfy our
needs. We're growing very, very fast and cannot find enough people
to support the growth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The supply squeeze has worsened in the last year, as dot-com
frenzy has gripped many business-school campuses. ``Historically,
when you got an offer from Morgan Stanley or J.P. Morgan, you just
took it. End of story,'' said Meyer Feldberg, dean of the Columbia
Business School, another traditional recruiting ground of the top
firms. But now, ``in some circles, there is a panic over not being
able to hire a sufficient number of talented people,'' Feldberg
added, as many of the most promising students rush to join Internet
start-ups or venture capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   As one stark example, the proportion of Stanford MBAs taking
jobs with either consulting firms or investment banks dropped to 33
percent last year from 43 percent in 1998. For the first time in
memory, people in business-school placement offices say, some firms
are having trouble filling out their on-campus interview schedules.
``People who typically had long waiting lists now have shorter
lists,'' Hori said. ``People who had full schedules now have
holes.''
</P>
<P>
   The response of Andersen Consulting, the world's biggest
consulting firm, illustrates the urgency recruiters feel. Andersen
has expanded the list of schools where its ``strategy group''
recruits to 15 from 12, said Bill Copacino, a managing partner. And
at the original 12, it is giving more presentations to students
this year, taking them out to more dinners and trying to make
stronger connections with student clubs. ``We had to work harder on
the campuses because there are more options'' for students,
Copacino said.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a golden opportunity, second-tier schools and their
students are becoming more aggressive about selling themselves.
After attending a recruiting conference and hearing a manager from
Salomon Smith Barney describe the banking industry's hiring woes,
Kim Gattiker, the assistant director of the University of Georgia's
MBA career services office, organized a promotional campaign. She
and her colleagues pitched Georgia's students and the school's
highly regarded information systems to the big investment banks and
consulting firms, called Georgia alumni already working at some of
those companies and sought out recruiters at other conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Gattiker thought that adding just one or two corporate blue
bloods to the list of Atlanta companies like Delta Air Lines and
United Parcel Service that traditionally scour the University of
Georgia's graduating class would give her big marketing leverage.
Signing up just a few new firms allows her to mention their names
to other recruiters, who then will be more likely to come to
Georgia as well, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this year, for example, McKinsey invited
Georgia's MBAs to send in their resumes. ``McKinsey, up until this
year, had not had anything to do with us,'' Gattiker said. One
student received an invitation to travel to Florida for an
interview. She did not get the job, but when she told
Pricewaterhouse, which had not shown interest in her before, about
the interview, it also decided to talk to the student.
</P>
<P>
   To students and administrators at places like Georgia, the
new-found interest is overdue recognition for a level of excellence
that they believe is a near match for Columbia or Wharton. ``I have
these incredible students,'' said Jennifer Lawrence, an assistant
dean at Boston University, ``who have been severely undervalued by
the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters, however, are not so easy to convince. ``You can't go
any deeper'' than the very top students at second-tier schools,
said Miranda at Bain &AMP; Co. ``We're already pushing the boundaries
at those schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the boundaries or not, they still sometimes have to do
battle with the lure of technology. Students at Boston University,
for example, are delighted that Boston Consulting Group, Chase
Manhattan and McKinsey are all doing more to recruit them than they
did in the past. ``There's definitely a happiness about their
coming to campus,'' said Moshiko Levhar, a second-year student who
survived the interviews and got a job offer from McKinsey, which
is, he declares, ``as good as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Levhar says he may not accept the offer. After all, he
said, the telecommunications industry, where he worked before
entering graduate school, looks very exciting right now.

   TEHRAN _ The overwhelming victory of President Mohamed Khatami's
democratic ``reformists'' in the new Iranian parliament is already
being portrayed by Washington as a ``hopeful sign for the West.''
But the new Iran emerging from last week's poll is likely to

one thing. To talk to him through a wall after he has spent more

Iran was positively surreal. ``Welcome to my home,'' the Ayatollah
growled at me in English. It was one of the few kind things he
said. Understandably, because the reasons for Montazeri's house
imprisonment _ and the contents of his extraordinary first
interview in captivity _ go to the very heart of the crisis behind
last week's parliamentary elections in Iran. &QL;

<P>
   TEHRAN _ The overwhelming victory of President Mohamed Khatami's
democratic ``reformists'' in the new Iranian parliament is already
being portrayed by Washington as a ``hopeful sign for the West.''
But the new Iran emerging from last week's poll is likely to
diminish rather than increase American influence in the region...
In Tehran, they are recalling once again the era of Mohamed
Mossadeq, freely elected but swiftly overthrown in 1953 by a coup
d'etat funded by the CIA and British intelligence. &QL;

   TEHRAN _ Last week's parliamentary election in Iran was like a
Persian tale of hope and love. It was also, like all Persian
stories, not as simple as it seems; a trifle opaque perhaps,
elliptical, full of heroes who might not all really be heroes after
all. And it may yet prove to have an unhappy, tragic ending.

one thing. To talk to him through a wall after he has spent more
than two years under house arrest in this gold-domed holy city of
Iran was positively surreal. ``Welcome to my home,'' the Ayatollah
growled at me in English. It was one of the few kind things he
said. Understandably, because the reasons for Montazeri's house
imprisonment _ and the contents of his extraordinary first
interview in captivity _ go to the very heart of the crisis behind
last week's parliamentary elections in Iran. &QL;

that Iran is about to become just another client nation in the
Middle East. &QL;

   CHIBUTO, MOZAMBIQUE _ Four days ago in Washington, U.S.
President Bill Clinton proclaimed Mozambique the world's
fastest-growing economy. At about the same time, Tiago Chauque, 35,
was up a tree, saving himself, but none of his hard-earned
belongings, from the country's worst floods in living memory. For
all of Clinton's fine words, an African economic dream _ which
enjoyed three successive years of GDP growth exceeding 10 percent
less than a decade after the end of a 16-year civil war _ has
tragically been swept away. &QL;

   LONDON _ Eight months later, opponents of NATO's war in Kosovo
could not have imagined more bitter vindication of their dire
warnings than events in the city of Mitrovica, where Serbs and
Albanians confront each other, kept apart only by the Ibar River
and the increasingly desperate efforts of the overwhelmed NATO-led
peacekeeping force. There is plenty of fault to go around but at
the heart of the matter, Mitrovica reflects the ambiguities and
confusions that still dog the entire Kosovo enterprise. &QL;

GIULIANI ACCUSES CLINTON OF PUSH-POLLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Officials with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's Senate
campaign on Tuesday accused Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign of
engaging in manipulative telephone calls to spread negative
impressions of the mayor. Clinton's campaign immediately responded
that the charges were untrue, and that the mayor was a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager, made the
accusations of ``push-polling,'' a practice in which callers posing
as pollsters spread negative and often false information about
candidates, based on an article in this week's issue of New York
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The article reported that on Feb. 14, a Westchester County
resident received a call from a man identifying himself as an
employee of Global Strategy Group, a Democratic polling firm. The
magazine said the caller made such statements as, ``If elected,
Rudy Giuliani said he would vote for Supreme Court judges who are
against abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The caller then asked the resident, according to the magazine,
if that changed how the resident felt about Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Giuliani said that he would not require a
``litmus test'' in voting on Supreme Court justices as a senator.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Teitelbaum described the call as ``the
latest outrage'' from the Clinton campaign, which he said was
``push-polling in the most negative and pejorative sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Clinton's press secretary, responded that ``the
Clinton campaign has never push-polled, and we never will.''
Wolfson also said that the Giuliani campaign had evidently not
ruled out its own push-polling. Teitelbaum was quoted in the
article, and then said again Tuesday, that ``we have no current
intentions to do push-polling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another example of their hypocrisy,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Push-polling became an issue in the last few weeks of the South
Carolina Republican presidential primary as Sen. John McCain
complained bitterly that Gov. George W. Bush used the tactic
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, push-polling occurs in the closing days of a
campaign. The calls are usually made to thousands of voters and
last only a few minutes each.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Tuesday that the call was in fact made by the
Global Strategy Group, a firm that has in the past worked for New
York's State Democratic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said similar calls were made to 800 voters, lasting 25
minutes each, and were for the purpose of what they described as
general research. Clinton's campaign said Tuesday that she was not
the client and had no connection to the polling group.

   &UR; IRAN'S NEW DAWN MAY END U.S. INFLUENCE IN PERSIAN GULF &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TEHRAN _ The overwhelming victory of President Mohamed Khatami's
democratic ``reformists'' in the new Iranian parliament is already
being portrayed by Washington as a ``hopeful sign for the West.''
But the new Iran emerging from last week's poll is likely to
diminish rather than increase American influence in the region...
In Tehran, they are recalling once again the era of Mohamed
Mossadeq, freely elected but swiftly overthrown in 1953 by a coup
d'etat funded by the CIA and British intelligence. &QL;

   TEHRAN _ Last week's parliamentary election in Iran was like a
Persian tale of hope and love. It was also, like all Persian
stories, not as simple as it seems; a trifle opaque perhaps,
elliptical, full of heroes who might not all really be heroes after
all. And it may yet prove to have an unhappy, tragic ending.

   QOM, IRAN _ It was an eerie experience. To interview the man
whom Ayatollah Khomeini once anointed as his chosen successor is
one thing. To talk to him through a wall after he has spent more
than two years under house arrest in this gold-domed holy city of
Iran was positively surreal. ``Welcome to my home,'' the Ayatollah
growled at me in English. It was one of the few kind things he
said. Understandably, because the reasons for Montazeri's house
imprisonment _ and the contents of his extraordinary first
interview in captivity _ go to the very heart of the crisis behind
last week's parliamentary elections in Iran. &QL;

BRINGING THE HIGH DRAMA OF REAL LIFE TO THE STAGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JESSE MCKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theater, a medium reliant on flights of imagination, is not
exactly a place where precise depictions of real events are common.
</P>
<P>
   But this season, a handful of plays on New York stages and
beyond are demonstrating a strong adherence to the facts, with
documentary-style texts that have been drawn verbatim from
interviews and transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most well-known proponent of this style is Anna
Deavere Smith, the author of the acclaimed plays ``Fires in the
Mirror'' and ``Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,'' which, through the
words of individual citizens, examined racial unrest in Crown
Heights, Brooklyn, and in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest work, ``House Arrest,'' an examination of the
American presidency, opens at the Joseph Papp Public Theater next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The monologues from the recent one-man show ``Another American:
Asking and Telling,'' by Marc Wolf, were taken from a series of
interviews the author held on the subject of gay members of the
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Laramie Project,'' directed by Moises Kaufman and now at
the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, is based on extensive
interviews with residents of Laramie, Wyo., where Matthew Shepard,
a gay college student, was murdered in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And ``The Vagina Monologues,'' Eve Ensler's current Off Broadway
hit, takes many of its stories and anecdotes from interviews
between the author and a wide variety of women.
</P>
<P>
   This form of you-are-there theater is also being used to
illustrate topics that would seem more suited to tabloid
television. ``Charlie Victor Romeo,'' with its re-creations of
airplane crashes and close calls using pilot voice-recorder
transcripts and realistic sound effects, has become a hit at the
tiny theater Collective Unconscious on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Berger, one of the show's directors, contrasted true-life
television action shows like ``Cops'' with ``Charlie Victor
Romeo.'' ``When you see `Cops,' you're just seeing the spectacle of
the arrest,'' he said. ``But with our show you're watching how real
people dealt with the most intense experience of their lives.'' The
show, which opened just before the crash of EgyptAir 880 in
October, has been extended twice and is now running through April
1.
</P>
<P>
   While the subject matter of ``Charlie Victor Romeo'' might be
sensational, practitioners of this type of theater _ and their
audiences _ seem to find great appeal in the relative authenticity
of the material. Smith suspects this appetite derives from a
perception that coverage of events by the news media can be
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we pursuing the authentic?'' Smith asked rhetorically
in a recent interview. ``I think it's because we are trying, and
not necessarily succeeding, to find truth and authenticity in a
time when masks have overwhelmed us.''
</P>
<P>
   While Smith believes the current interest in reality-based forms
of entertainment has been spurred by the 20th-century technology of
tape recorders and television, her own fascination has its roots in
an earlier source: the Russian director Konstantin Stanislavsky,
who championed a realistic style of acting.
</P>
<P>
   Stanislavsky, she said, was trying to elicit authentic behavior
from his actors, and her plays strive for the same thing. Where she
differs, Smith noted, is that she is ``interested in the other
rather than the self.''
</P>
<P>
   In performance, the characters she mimics have all their tics,
pauses and ``ums'' intact. There is a reason for this, Smith said:
today's audiences, surrounded by television and film, don't always
believe language written for the stage, which in many cases
consists of complete sentences and perfect grammar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody talks all the way across the page,'' she said,
``particularly if they are saying something good.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Martin, a professor of drama at New York University who is
writing a book about documentary theater, said that plays of this
type strike a nerve because, ``The performer is implicated in the
subject matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach also seems to offer a degree of objectivity for
politically charged issues, even if the author's underlying
position remains evident. Though, of course, the creator has the
power of omission and compression, which can risk compromising a
verbatim text's authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Another American,'' for example, Wolf recorded more than
400 hours of interviews, but the show's running time was less than
two hours. Opinions and characters, by dramatic necessity, had to
be cut.
</P>
<P>
   In Kaufman's 1997 Off Broadway hit, ``Gross Indecency: The Three
Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' actors cited the sources of the play's
historical accounts and transcript excerpts during the performance.
Kaufman is using a similar method for ``The Laramie Project.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the director said, his mission has had more to do with
finding strong theatrical moments than with chronicling facts.
``Our questions are somewhat different than just `documentary
theater,''' he said. ``We are interested in what is uniquely
theatrical.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, most of these plays seem to discard traditional
narrative structure for cinematic collage. ``I don't have to worry
about plot,'' Wolf said, ``and I don't think audiences worry about
plot. They can piece the story and the ideas together.''
</P>
<P>
   The logic is simple. ``These are good stories,'' Wolf said.
``Why make something up?''

S&AMP;P REAFFIRMS JAPAN'S TRIPLE-A RATING AFTER MOODY'S WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Tightens lead, clarifies Standard &AMP; Poor's position) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Standard &AMP; Poor's, a leading credit-rating agency,
delivered a thinly veiled warning to the Japanese government
Tuesday that its economic policies and rising levels of debt could
threaten Japan's triple-A credit rating.
</P>
<P>
   The admonishment from S&AMP;P was not as blunt as a warning
delivered less than a week ago by Moody's Investors Service, S&AMP;P's
chief rival in evaluating the creditworthiness of countries and
corporations. Indeed, S&AMP;P reaffirmed Japan's high rating and said
the country's outlook was stable.
</P>
<P>
   But in the financial markets, Standard &AMP; Poor's critical
assessment was viewed as another negative for Japan, which has been
languishing amid its worst economic performance since the end of
World War II. After a period of meager growth last year, evidence
has been accumulating that the country may have technically slipped
into another recession in the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P's evaluation carried an implicit criticism of the
government's economic policies, which have depended largely on
pork-barrel projects and other spending aimed at avoiding the
structural adjustments many economists advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's failure to bolster economic prospects by
allowing the pace of structural reform to slip and by faltering in
its efforts to boost consumer confidence suggests that the economic
sluggishness could continue indefinitely, with the government debt
burden rising to levels inconsistent with a triple-A rating,'' S&AMP;P
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although a lowered credit rating would not necessarily cause
economic harm in Japan, it could help raise the cost of borrowing
and would be an enormous embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been troubled by the potential of an increased
discrepancy between Moody's and Standard &AMP; Poor's assessment of
Japan's ability to handle its mounting debt, which currently stands
at 100 percent of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ```Inconsistent with a triple-A rating,''' said Robert Alan
Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo,
quoting an S&AMP;P news release. ``That is a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   While the market has long been aware of Japan's debts, a recent,
subtle campaign by the Finance Ministry to increase awareness of
the problem with politicians and the public has raised anew
questions about whether Japan has a strategy for ending its
decade-long slump.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Moody's raised the possibility that it would
downgrade Japan's credit rating yet again, having lowered it in
November 1998 to Aa1, one level below its top rating. It cited
Japan's rising debt as a major reason for its review.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things Moody's was talking about was a lack of
gross philosophy, meaning how Japan intends to get its economy
moving and deal with the fiscal issues it faces,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has warned repeatedly in recent
weeks that Japan cannot continue to expect to borrow at the low
interest rates it currently gets. Japanese government bonds with a
duration of 10 years have for some time traded within an
interest-rate range of 1.6 percent to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Ministry officials have also quietly and persistently
reminded journalists and others that tax revenue is falling
significantly as companies lay off workers in an effort to overhaul
their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the ratings agencies would be too concerned if
Japan were spending money to bolster structural change and promote
long-term growth,'' said Ron Bevacqua, chief economist at Commerz
Securities. ``But Japan is spending money in a way that delays the
need for structural adjustment, and in that case, the money is
wasted.''

MRS. CLINTON URGES A STATE DEBATING TOUR
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TONAWANDA, N.Y. _ Describing the rambunctious presidential
debate on racial issues at the Apollo Theater in Harlem on Monday
as a valuable exercise for voters, Hillary Rodham Clinton said
Tuesday she would like to debate Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on the same
topics and in the same setting, and suggested that the two embark
on a debating tour across New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't that be fun?'' the first lady said to reporters
during an afternoon visit to this community outside Buffalo. ``It
would be fun to do. Stand up in all sorts of settings all over the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton made her suggestion _ it was something short of the
sort of debate challenge that typically comes later in a campaign _
after a brief address to elderly New Yorkers eating lunch at a
Salvation Army center. By all indications, it was not part of some
larger campaign strategy. The idea seemed to evolve as she spoke
approvingly of the Democratic presidential debate involving Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and
then answered questions about her own campaign for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that the two Democratic contenders for the
presidency would hold a debate about urban issues at the Apollo
Theater in Harlem,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``The bottom line for me is
we're talking about urban issues and we're talking about them in a
setting that is so meaningful and important, historically, to the
African-American community.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if she would like to do the same thing, she
responded, ``I would love to have a debate in the Apollo Theater.''
Mrs. Clinton added, ``It would be good to have ongoing debates and
discussions about issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Bruce J. Teitelbaum, the manager of Giuliani's
Senate campaign, said the mayor welcomed debating Mrs. Clinton, but
would not commit to any specific time or venue. ``The mayor looks
forward to numerous opportunities, including debates, to compare
his record of success as mayor of New York, U.S. attorney,
third-ranking official in the Justice Department, and lifelong New
Yorker, with Mrs. Clinton,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's remarks came as she returned to upstate New
York, discussing, as she did last week, ways to bring down the cost
of heating oil, a matter of concern to voters here during a
particularly cold winter. Giuliani has criticized President Clinton
for not releasing oil from the Strategic Reserve Fund, oil that is
set aside in the event of a worldwide shortage, as a way of
bringing down escalating fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton called for, among other things, increasing federal
assistance to help low-income New Yorkers pay their oil bills, and
requiring oil companies to keep a fuel reserve on hand for times
when demand outstrips supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Bill and I bought our house in Chappaqua, it has
been heated by heating oil so we know how much it has gone up in a
short amount of time,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, was unable to provide details of
the heating costs actually encountered by Mrs. Clinton, who, in
fact, has divided her nights between her new home in Chappaqua and
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical race for U.S. Senate _ which this is not _ debates
between general election candidates do not begin until after Labor
Day. Mrs. Clinton did not say when she would like to start debating
Giuliani, but made clear it was sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would engage in debates with my opponent on the other side
whenever we could,'' she said. ``I don't have any starting time or
ending time. I really believe the more information you give to
people and the more you answer questions, the more you can make the
campaign about issues, and the better it will be for everybody.''

ENDEAVOUR CREW ENDS SUCCESSFUL MAP MISSION OF EARTH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The shuttle Endeavour and its crew of six astronauts
returned to Earth on Tuesday, ending a successful 11-day effort to
create the highest quality map of the planet ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's return ended a successful, $570 million mission in
which the Endeavour crew scanned the Earth with a massive radar
system, gradually fabricating a near global, three-dimensional map
of unprecedented detail and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The new topography will be used for a range of military and
civilian purposes, including missile guidance, flood control and
urban planning.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour touched down at 6:22 p.m. EST at NASA's Kennedy Space
Center in Florida, with commander Kevin Kregel and pilot Dominic
``Dom'' Gorie at the controls.
</P>
<P>
   High crosswinds in Florida forced the astronauts to wave off an
earlier landing opportunity at Kennedy. The space agency was
prepared to divert Endeavour to Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., if
conditions did not improve on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The space agencies of Germany and Italy joined with the
Department of Defense and NASA to produce the mapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin, congratulations to you and your crew for a highly
successful mission,'' Rick Sturckow, the shuttle crew's liaison in
mission control, said in greeting the astronauts as Endeavour
rolled to a stop on the long Kennedy runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really proud to be a part of this mission,'' said
Kregel. ``I think the radar images we brought back will help out
mankind from all countries for many years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Kregel, Gorie, flight engineer Janet Kavandi, payload commander
Janice Voss and astroauts Mamoru Mohri of Japan and Gerhard Thiele
of Germany were to undergo routine medical examinations and rest
overnight in Florida before returning to their Houston-area homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson Space Center in far south Houston planned a
welcoming ceremony for the six astronauts at 2:30 p.m. EST
Wednesday at Ellington Field.
</P>
<P>
   Kregel and his crew blasted off Feb. 11. The mission was delayed
by five months so ground technicians could inspect and repair
electrical wiring throughout Endeavour's fuselage and replace a
faulty computer component.
</P>
<P>
   The Endeavour crew successfully charted more than 99 percent of
the 47.6 million miles of mapping goal. Nearly 95 percent of the
territory was scanned twice, ensuring the accuracy that scientists
desired.e shuttle returned to Earth with 356 tape cassettes of
recorded radar data. The tapes will be duplicated and transported
to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Using high speed computers, experts there will convert the
recorded data into a digital topographical map of the regions
scanned by the shuttle. The process will take one to two years.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's next shuttle flight is scheduled for lift off no earlier
than April 13.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis, with a seven-member crew, is slated to dock with the
unstaffed first components of the new international space station.
The Atlantis crew plans to repair electrical power storage
batteries and deliver supplies for the station's first resident
crews.

WHEN CABARET HAD AN EDGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Barry Singer's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about a
new generation of lyricists.  
 By BARRY SINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kurt Weill rarely wrote for the notorious Weimar-era cabarets of
Berlin. Still, the popular misimpression that identifies him with
the Berlin haunts of Christopher Isherwood and Sally Bowles is
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Weill's music from this period sounds so deliciously dangerous.
Its harsh beauty and dissonant lyricism embody everything we
believe Berlin cabaret to have been: sardonic, sophisticated,
gorgeously profane.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, unfortunately, that cabaret in New York today
largely is not. It is therefore tempting in this, Weill's
centennial year (his 100th birthday is Thursday), to look to his
musical world for instruction: how can our own
less-than-scintillating cabaret scene rediscover the passion, the
artfulness and the engagement of Weill's time?
</P>
<P>
   Weill, who died in 1950, was a creature of the theater and the
opera house. That is where his exquisite early songs of discontent
and disillusion were almost exclusively performed first. The
nocturnal society that he and his collaborator, Bertolt Brecht,
nevertheless loomed over _ and not infrequently patronized _ was a
teeming melange of variety halls, revue emporiums, nightclubs and
strip joints. There, contrary to popular belief, the subject that
Brecht and Weill so mercilessly addressed _ politics _ was not, in
fact, the central focus.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, society was. Topical satire, with nothing sacred, was
what Berlin cabaret reveled in. This relentless burlesquing in song
of anything we today drearily label ``life style'' was always of
the moment. It was also often bracingly literate as well as
musically challenging. Though spiked with plenty of empty-headed
pageantry, low humor and naked girls, cabaret in Berlin could be,
both lyrically and musically, downright virtuosic.
</P>
<P>
   On an evening in the late 1920s or early 1930s, Berlin night
crawlers might have slipped into the celebrated Tingel-Tangel club,
run by the composer and lyricist Friedrich Hollander, to be
confronted by songs like Hollander's ``Munchhausen,'' with its
refrain: ``Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar/ Truth is hard and
tough as nails/ That's why we need fairy tales.'' (Even in
translation these lyrics don't lose their punch.)
</P>
<P>
   Or one could enter Kurt Robischek's Cabaret of Comedians
(Kabarett der Komiker, popularly dubbed Kadeko), where the music of
Mischa Spoliansky reigned, in collaborations with the scriptwriter
and lyricist Marcellus Schiffer. Hollander and Spoliansky, along
with Berthold Goldschmidt and Hanns Eisler, among others, were
composers of immense imagination, nearly as creative, if not as
masterly, as Weill himself.
</P>
<P>
   Schiffer, meanwhile, though best known for parodying the mass
media, was equally adept at savaging the Berlin equivalent of cool,
downtown trendsetters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given a mind that's a sieve/ Makes life so easy to live,'' he
wrote with Spoliansky in ``The Smart Set,'' a sardonic riff on
those ``neatest, ergo elitist,'' who sing: ``Death and diseases
discussed over cheeses,/ The nature of truth mixed with gin and
vermouth/ The world's a mess, still we must confess/ That we
frankly couldn't care less.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Nazi street violence all but banished such expression,
lyric-writing social critics like Schiffer and Kurt Tucholsky,
Walter Mehring and Erich Kastner were as much the stars of Berlin
cabaret as the onstage talents: Trude Hesterberg, Rosa Valetti,
Kurt Gerron and even the young Marlene Dietrich.
</P>
<P>
   Dietrich, in 1928, had her breakthrough at Kadeko, in a duet
with Schiffer's wife, Margo Lion, ``When My Best Girlfriend,'' a
lesbianesque ditty for two dissatisfied married ladies on a
shopping expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast all of this with the recently announced lineup for New
York's newest upscale cabaret, the singer Michael Feinstein's
eponymous Feinstein's at the Regency, where a $60 cover, plus
minimums ranging from $25 to $50, will bring you Robert Goulet or
Linda Eder in March, Feinstein in April or Glen Campbell in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just want to take a walk, all you need is sunlight,''
Weill wrote in ``Berlin im Licht-Song,'' one of his poems set to
music. ``But if you want to see the city of Berlin, the sun isn't
enough./ To see everything in it properly, you're going to need a
few watts/ Come on turn on the lights, so we can see what there is
to see.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What there is to see in New York today is a cabaret scene
dominated by supper clubs, endlessly serving up yesterday's music
to deep-pocketed sophisticates. Such an over-refined atmosphere of
musty musicale was much despised by Brecht. ``Polite, educated
people gently bored and pretending to be moved,'' is how his
biographer, Martin Esslin, characterized Brecht's take on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabaret in New York is dessert entertainment,'' the German
cabaret star Ute Lemper observed recently. ``Audiences here view it
as a public ego demonstration of one's private personality. The
German tradition of `kabarett' _ the cabaret performer as activist,
as opposed to `cabaret,' which is just entertainment _ makes people
extremely uncomfortable, particularly right after an expensive
dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that New York cabaret never remotely embraced
the Berlin model of social engagement, the current scene does seem
more frivolously disconnected from the culture at large than ever
before. Yes, there are rooms downtown, like Joe's Pub and Judy's
and the Duplex, where a kind of cabaret performance occasionally
speaks to the moment.
</P>
<P>
   But New York cabaret seems overwhelmingly rooted to a wingback
chair in the spirit of Mabel Mercer, the definitive cafe chanteuse
who almost always sang sitting down. It's not that Mercer wasn't a
divine role model. Nor that the larger culture is not fundamentally
crude and threatening. It's just that cabaret today must stand up
and engage the here and now if it is to have any meaning, or any
future.
</P>
<P>
   No, the missing link is not some sleazy approximation of the
studied decadence conjured by Kander and Ebb's ``Cabaret'' on
Broadway. Classy song recitals of old music in smart rooms by good
singers are perfectly nice occasions. Moreover, it could even be
argued that poetry slams and stand-up comics function as our
contemporary equivalent of Berlin's kabarett.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with corporate Broadway practically closed to an entire
generation of young playwrights and composers, wouldn't it be
wonderful to see cabaret become a forum for their work? And
wouldn't it be glorious if these writers engaged the society that
surrounds them with some semblance of their Berlin predecessors'
musical and verbal brilliance? And wouldn't it be extraordinary if
audiences, young and old, rich and less rich, began patronizing
cabarets to hear what these writers had to say because it
illuminated their lives?
</P>
<P>
   These are but fantasies. In or out of the supper club, cabaret
is hardly a growth industry. And audiences pacified by everything
from the Internet to Comedy Central are not likely to stir from
their homes for a dose of social satire, however ingeniously
conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Still one can dream. Or as Hollander, in the Berlin of Weimar,
wrote: ``Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar/ ... I'm all through
with logical conclusions/ Why should I deny myself illusions?''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A management expert from Singapore has been
appointed the United Nations' second inspector general, a spokesman
for Secretary General Kofi Annan said Tuesday. The nominee, who
must be approved by the General Assembly, is Dileep Nair, a former
chief operating officer of Singapore's National Savings Bank.
</P>
<P>
   He will replace Karl Theodor Paschke, a German foreign service
officer and the organization's first inspector general, whose
nonrenewable five-year term ended last November.
</P>
<P>
   Annan spent months searching for a successor to Paschke,
rejecting several batches of nominees before settling on a
candidate from Singapore, a country with a reputation for clean
government and a virtually incorruptible civil service.
</P>
<P>
   A group of developing nations opposed the appointment of a
Westerner to the position, officially titled under secretary
general for internal oversight services. Paschke was chosen by
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali when the job was created as
a reform measure in 1994 under pressure from the United States and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Paschke established rigorous auditing and inspection systems for
the organization, and published reports exposing illegal or
unethical practices. The United Nations began taking legal action
in cases of fraud and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Nair, born into Singapore's minority ethnic Indian community,
was educated at the Raffles Institution, Singapore's leading
secondary school, then studied engineering at McGill University.
Later he received a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.

EDITORIAL: MICHIGAN'S SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Early returns and exit polls showing a victory for Sen. John
McCain in Michigan portend more blistering battles to come with
Gov. George W. Bush. Even before the votes were counted, Bush was
taking solace Tuesday night in his strong showing among
Republicans. The exit surveys do indeed suggest that McCain won
because of independents and Democrats, with the Texas governor the
undisputed choice of the GOP faithful. In future primaries, where
such crossover voting is barred, Bush may have an easier time. At
some point McCain will have to demonstrate that he can draw
majority support among members of his own party, as he did in his
home state of Arizona in its primary Tuesday. And Bush, sooner or
later, will have to show he can win decisively without being
propped up by local bosses.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the most striking aspect of the Republican
race is its increasingly nasty and personal nature. A new tone of
religious animosity has crept in, especially as several spokesmen
for the Christian conservative movement in the South have rallied
to the cause of the Texas governor. Supporters of McCain say that
Michigan has been swamped with recorded telephone messages from the
religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, singling out former Sen.
Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, who happens to be Jewish, as ``a
vicious bigot'' for criticizing the Christian Coalition. Bush
supporters, for their part, accused the McCain campaign of
condoning other calls suggesting that the Texas governor is
anti-Catholic because he launched his South Carolina campaign at
Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   All primary campaigns expose internal differences within
political parties that the eventual nominee must paper over before
the general election. But the warfare between Bush and McCain has
an especially rough edge, and it could open wounds that will not be
easily healed. An orgy of religious-based accusations in a
heartland state like Michigan harks back to a kind of bigotry that
most Americans have long ago rejected as an acceptable part of
presidential politics. At their best moments, both candidates have
appealed to the idealistic and, in Bush's term, compassionate side
of the American electorate. But Bush failed in South Carolina and
again in Michigan to criticize those who used the politics of
bigotry in his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan results once again demonstrate that Bush's strength
lies within the traditional conservative base of his party. The
governor may be able to get the GOP nomination by appealing to that
base, and it is too soon to say that he cannot parlay it into
national success. There were those nearly 20 years ago who assumed
that Ronald Reagan, who also came out of the party's conservative
base, could not reach beyond it to win in November. But Bush has
yet to prove he has a gift for base-broadening on a national scale.
Certainly, his showing in the open-primary states raises questions
about his overall appeal. He began by taking moderate positions on
some critical issues and has survived only by adopting a steadily
harder conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has once again shaken up the Republican contest, but he
also has much work to do. The next big mountain for both candidates
to climb _ and also for Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley _ will be the nationwide ``Super Tuesday'' primaries of
March 7, with special focus on California and New York. With his
Michigan upset, McCain has a shot at even more striking surprises
on that day. By the end of it, either Bush or McCain will begin to
look like their party's nominee, ready to take on the task of
overcoming both ideological and religious divisions brought out in
an unusually brutal contest. &QL;

WASHINGTON: West said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the Gore camp has a strong sense that it should not let
Bradley control the conversation. That is one reason, say those
close to him, that Gore gave a surprisingly strong anti-Bradley
speech at the San Jose convention. Bradley had been attacking Gore
before the convention, but when he arrived, he had little to say
about the vice president; Gore then went on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley can't unilaterally dictate the rules,'' Shrum said,
explaining Gore's response. ``It's like assuming you could play
chess with no opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   The chess-playing image is intentional _ that of an academic or
``philosopher king'' who is too impractical to govern. In promoting
that image of Bradley, the Gore camp hopes to solidify Gore's image
as the opposite _ a realist, someone willing to roll up his sleeves
and ``fight for you!''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Gore tries every now and then to modulate this
image. After a commercial break in the debate at the Apollo
Theater, both Gore and Bradley toned down their attacks. And in an
interview on CNN after that, Gore softened even more. Instead of
his usual response of denying his past voting record _ in this case
against gun control _ he acknowledged that he had, in fact, changed
his position from when he represented a rural district in
Tennessee. He said he changed when he began ``seeing the problem
through the eyes of constituents'' in urban areas. ``All of us grow
and learn as we encounter people with experiences in life,'' he
said, notwithstanding his attack on Bradley for changing his view
of ethanol from when he represented New Jersey in the Senate to
when he began running for president in the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But the raucous audience in Harlem almost demanded a sharper
approach. And Gore advisers said their man had little to lose by
going on the attack, particularly since the debate had limited
reach. The political world has been consumed by the Republican
contest. The debate started late, at 9 p.m., and was shown on cable
television.
</P>
<P>
   The forum gave Gore a chance to sharpen his claws for the fall
campaign. His advisers say he is always better when he can define
himself against someone else, and through scalding references to
Bush and McCain, Gore is already serving notice to Republicans that
Bradley is just a warm-up act. And with Republicans steeped in a
fight, Gore may not look so bad.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gore loyalists say that Gore's campaign moves are being
overanalyzed and that there is no grand strategy behind, say, his
aggressive performance in debates. He just wants to win, they say,
and he is moved by a competitive spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Gore would want to hammer Bradley even though Gore
seems so close to the nomination, one said simply, ``A corpse can't
take too many bullets.''

AFTER 11 YEARS, PETE ROSE IS STILL KNOCKING ON THE DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost 11 years to the day he was first summoned to appear
before the baseball commissioner about his alleged gambling, Pete
Rose Tuesday staged his latest public effort to sway the thinking
of the current commissioner. By the close of business at Bud
Selig's office in Milwaukee, Rose had still not succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything compelling about an 11th anniversary,
but it is instructive about Rose's credibility to recall his
reaction to the meeting that marked the beginning of the end of his
baseball life.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was summoned to New York to meet with Peter Ueberroth, then
the commissioner, and A. Bartlett Giamatti, the commissioner-elect,
on Feb. 20, 1989. Rose, the Cincinnati Reds' manager, returned to
the team's spring training camp in Plant City, Fla., the next day,
preceded by word that the topic of the meeting had been Rose's
alleged gambling. Rose, however, denied that gambling had been
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the reason,'' he said that day in Plant City. What
was? ``He asked me to come there,'' Rose said, referring to
Ueberroth. ``He and Giamatti were both there. They wanted my input
and advice on a couple things. I gave it to them; it took an hour.
I left, and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. According to Fay Vincent, who participated in the
meeting as Giamatti's deputy commissioner-to-be, Rose's gambling
was very much the subject, the only subject. Recalling the meeting
Tuesday, Vincent said he asked Rose if he had ever bet on baseball
and elicited this reply: ``No, I'm not that stupid. I've bet on
everything else but not on baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   An admission that he bet on baseball would have earned Rose an
instant one-year suspension; if he had acknowledged wagers on the
Reds, he would have incurred a lifetime ban. Though he continued to
deny having made such wagers, he wound up agreeing to a lifetime
sentence six months later. Nevertheless, he has stuck to his story
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, among others, doesn't believe him. That's why he has not
altered Rose's agreement with Giamatti.
</P>
<P>
   On a telephone conference call Tuesday, Rose said he continues
to have hope that someday he will gain reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a society that is known for giving people a second
chance,'' Rose said. ``From everyone I talked to, George
Steinbrenner on down, they relate to me that Bud Selig is a very
fair man. I have total confidence that someday he'll give me a
second chance. I don't say it will be this week, this month, but
stranger things have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose's lawyers met last month with baseball's chief lawyer and
presented him with what they say is evidence that counters the
evidence baseball amassed in 1989. This was the private part of
Rose's comeback strategy. The conference call was the latest step
in the public part.
</P>
<P>
   A new Internet sports Web site hired Rose to promote the launch
of the site, sportcut.com, last Nov. 30. Rose apparently served the
intended purpose because the site experienced a record number of
hits for the launch of a sports Web site. In return, the site
served Rose's purpose because it posed a question and invited
visitors to answer it: do you think Pete Rose should be in the Hall
of Fame?
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course, was a simplistic one. It didn't begin
to get into the reality of Rose's plight. If Presidential
candidates were chosen on a similar basis, George W. Bush would
have been nominated as the Republican candidate months ago without
a challenge from John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-two percent of the 230,906 who clicked on an answer to
the question over a two-and-a-half-month period said yes, Rose
should be in the Hall of Fame. Rose took the results as a positive
development. He wasn't asked for and he didn't offer an opinion of
the nearly 500,000 more visitors to the site who didn't vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we decided to do this launch with sportcut we were as
interested as everyone else to find out what the reaction of people
would be,'' Rose said. ``You don't know what to expect from fans,
although in my travels I get a lot of feedback that is positive.
It's exciting to see the results of the poll. I don't know where
the results will lead but I'm very happy the results were favorable
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But were they? Two-thirds of the site's visitors during the
voting period apparently didn't care enough to cast a vote. Rose
may want to reflect on that massive slight.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he will continue to wage his public campaign
and his lawyers will submit additional ``evidence'' to baseball's
lawyers. Neither the voice of the people nor the belated efforts of
his lawyers will sway the only person whose vote counts. All the
king's horses and all the king's men will not put Humpty together
again.

   Wage inflation may have all but disappeared from the economic
map, but for companies looking to grow, there is' another side to
that good news. Just about any worker with a marketable skill has
by now caught on to corporate America's worst-kept secret: managers
are desperate to attract talent and even more desperate to hold
onto it.
</P>
<P>
   Mambo.com, a start-up events-planning Web service in Menlo Park,
Calif., for example, hired a longtime Internet recruiter last
spring before it even thought about hiring a vice president for
business development, according to Madeline Schroeder, Mambo's
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   And when the computer networking company Cisco Systems moves
into a market and needs staff, it often hires trucks to be driven
around town with billboards that flash the company's Web site and
plead: ``Talk to us at Cisco.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We like people to know we're there,'' said Randall Birkwood,
Cisco's senior employment manager.
</P>
<P>
   The latest innovation to persuade midlevel and senior managers
to turn down rival offers is one borrowed from addiction treatment:
an intervention by those in the workplace who are nearest and
dearest. James Boone, president for operations in the Americas at
the recruiter Korn/Ferry International, said that besides ``hard
offers of compensation, position and title immediately, you have to
hit at the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as a manager announces he's leaving,'' Boone added,
``you get his team in a room to say things like, `We need you to
succeed' or `What can we do make you stay?' People don't usually
leave just for money. It can be just as effective to tug at the
emotions to get them to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of pleading puts employees in a strong position.

and recruitment site, for almost four years last September. Though
she had worked her way up to the position of project manager, she
said, ``I felt stale; the job wasn't much of a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath went job hunting, and soon got an offer from another
Internet company with comparable benefits and a $5,000 raise. She
accepted and gave notice.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Jeff Taylor, Monster.com's founder and chief
executive, asked why she was leaving. Then he made a counteroffer:
he would promote her to manager of special projects and give her an
immediate $4,000 raise, with the likelihood of more to come.
</P>
<P>
   She accepted because she was shedding the old routine job and
preferred Monster.com to the new company, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't leaving because I hated the job so much,'' McGrath
said, ``but because the company had turned formal and corporate in
the past three years _ titles and what size cube you have. So I
wanted more money. Jeff got me to stay by making me feel like a
change agent again.'' Two months later, she snared an additional
$2,000 raise.
</P>
<P>
   For Taylor, grabbing people on their way out the door has become
a way of life. Monster.com began with a staff of 70 in 1997, grew
to 500 by the end of 1998 and doubled again last year. Competition
for skilled workers from other dot.com start-ups is fierce, so he
pays close attention to his employees' needs and makes sure the
workplace reflects Net speed and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``My employees get shot at regularly by recruiters,'' Taylor
said. ``And money rocks people's worlds, so almost always, I'll
make a counteroffer. They wouldn't be here if they weren't great at
their job. But I like to counter opportunity, not offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies are becoming increasingly inventive when it comes to
incentives, either by dangling special premiums over compensation
or by bumping up the role and autonomy of the job. Counteroffers
now often include letting managers exercise stock options at
earlier dates or at lower prices than the contracts call for and
guaranteeing juicy bonuses for employees who stay a specified
number of years, even if their performance fizzles along the way.
Recruiters and human resources professionals have even coined a
term for these gun-to-the-head elevations: battlefield promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Managers are also more willing than ever to cut special deals.
Daphne Matalene, 26, an advertising account manager at a travel
magazine in New York, turned down an unexciting offer from a rival
company last June. But when she mentioned it to her boss, he
immediately withdrew an earlier suggestion that he might have to
reduce her commission from 10 percent of sales to a rate more in
line with the industry average of about 2 percent. Then, a few
months later, an attractive job offer came her way from a
prestigious business publication, and she was leaning toward
accepting it.
</P>
<P>
   But when she informed her boss, he countered by raising her base
salary by $17,000, a 75 percent increase. To do that, he said, he
would have to lower her commission rate, but he awarded her some
plummy extra accounts and some added responsibilities to compensate
for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to stick around,'' Matalene said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by Development Dimensions
International, a consulting firm, most companies will be enhancing
stock options, benefits packages and salaries this year to attract
qualified applicants.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to the survey, workers want more than just money.
Organizations with the most effective recruiting strategies,
according to the survey, were more likely to offer potential for
advancement, a solid reputation, learning opportunities and a
positive corporate culture as well as stock options and competitive
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   That means employees across the board can expect more and better
job offers and increased leverage with their current employers,
said Jeffrey Christian of Christian &AMP; Timbers, an executive search
firm. ``Today, the best talent wins,'' Christian said. ``So if you
haven't had a counteroffer, you're probably not working.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   I grew up in Ada, a community of about 17,000 people in the
southern part of Oklahoma. We spent weekends walking up and down
the creek looking for rocks, fossils and Indian artifacts. So,
growing up, I had a great interest in archaeology, paleontology and
geology.
</P>
<P>
   No one in my family had ever attended college, but I always knew
I would go to college and major in one of those three fields. Later
in high school, I realized that engineering would be a better
career.
</P>
<P>
   I met my wife, Linda, in church. I was 15, and she was 13. She
was actually in the Bible class my mom and dad taught in church. I
guess you could say they picked her out for me. When we started
dating, we had to walk to the movies because we were too young to
drive. It was a wonderful time to be growing up in small-town
America in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   After four years in the Marine Corps and business school, I
interviewed with 17 companies and was fortunate to receive 16 job
offers. I'm not going to tell you who didn't offer me a job. It was
1966, and I had decided to accept a job with IBM. But one of my
professors had told a young vice president from Conoco about me,
and the VP called and asked if I would have dinner with him while
he was on campus. I was a graduate student with a working wife and
two children. We were on a near-starvation diet, and the idea of a
free steak dinner sounded pretty good. He convinced me that Conoco
had the best management-training program, and I've been here ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   I almost never became the chief executive of Conoco. In the fall
of 1995, I was an executive vice president, and a search firm
wanted me to become the chief executive. of another Fortune 100
company. Since childhood, a Christian faith has been an important
part of my life, so I spent time praying about whether I should
accept this opportunity and leave Conoco. I try to spend time in
prayer and Bible study every day. Finally, I told God I was going
to accept the position unless he stopped me.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later the phone rang. It was the head of the search
firm asking me to put my decision on hold because the board was
talking to someone else. That was a clear signal for me to remain
at Conoco. A few weeks later, I was awakened by a phone call
telling me I was going to be elected chief executive. I really
don't believe it was a coincidence.

 Financier Hellman Buys Stake in Formula One Racing Events  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
San Francisco buyout firm Hellman &AMP; Friedman LLC has paid $712.5
million for a 37.5 percent stake in Formula One Holdings, which
puts on the world's most watched annual sporting events.
<P>
   ``I want to move in faster company,'' joked Warren Hellman,
chairman of the firm which recently raised $2 billion of private
capital and already has invested about half of it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its investment in Bernie Ecclestone's
London-based Formula One grand prix auto-racing events, which draw
more than 300 million viewers worldwide for each event, Hellman &AMP;
Friedman announced yesterday that it has bought Mitchell
International for an undisclosed price. The San Diego company is a
leading software information services provider to the insurance and
automobile collision repair industries.
</P>
<P>
   Both investments deal with cars but that is not what makes them
attractive to Hellman and his investors, who include the California
Public Employees Retirement System, city of San Francisco,
government of Singapore and Stanford and Dartmouth endowment funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investments fit a template,'' said Hellman. ``We like
businesses with a major franchise. We like businesses with
substantial cash flow and we don't like to invest in firms with a
lot of fixed assets like factories or forests.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellman declined to discuss what sort of cash flow is generated
by grand prix events featuring the best drivers and racing cars in
the world. Formula One Holdings does not pay the cost of sponsoring
the racing teams and high-priced drivers. That is paid by Ferrari,
McClaren and other manufacturers and their sponsors. Hellman &AMP;
Friedman is banking on lucrative revenue from TV broadcast,
promotional rights and CD-Rom games.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1984, the firm has invested more than $4.8 billion in 39
companies, with generally impressive results. Hellman &AMP; Friedman
invested $223 million for close to 40 percent of Young &AMP; Rubicam
and cashed out of the advertising firm late last year for a total
gain of more than $800 million. It enjoyed a similar gain on its
$125 million investment in the predecessor of Western Wireless and
Voice Stream.
</P>
<P>
   But not all investments have won a checkered flag. The firm lost
$130 million on its investment in Mobile Media, another
communications company.
</P>
<P>
   And not all of Hellman &AMP; Friedman's money is on the fast track,
either. The company has a minority stake in Power Bar, the Berkeley
company started by University of California at Berkeley track coach
Brian Maxwell. The maker of all-natural nutrition bars is expected
to announce its sale today to a large food products company.

 Legislation Tackles Inflated Gas Prices  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
With gas prices at record high levels, several bills are being
introduced in the state Legislature to increase stability in the
California gasoline market.
<P>
   San Francisco Assemblywoman Carole Migden introduced a bill
yesterday that would promote construction of a pipeline from the
Gulf Coast to boost California's gas supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a crisis in California,'' Migden told The Chronicle.
``We've all been frustrated, especially in the Bay Area, with
fluctuating gas prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the works are a bill from San Francisco Assemblyman
Kevin Shelley to establish a strategic gasoline reserve in the
state, and a separate bill from Hillsborough Sen. Jackie Speier to
limit the ability of oil companies to own and operate retail
service stations.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for submission of the new  &LR; proposals to the
Legislature is Friday.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said the bills being
introduced will be studied by his office as part of a continuing
investigation into California's sky-high gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer has blamed the state's soaring prices on a lack of
competition among leading oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   The California State Automobile Association reported last week
that Bay Area gas prices had reached their highest level for any
February, with the average cost of a gallon of unleaded regular gas
standing at $1.50 _ up 4 cents from January and 32 cents, or 27
percent, from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Migden said her bill would authorize a study on the feasibility
of a pipeline from Texas to California. In the event of a fuel
shortage, she said, additional supplies of gas could be quickly
piped to the West Coast in a matter of days, as opposed to shipping
them in by tanker truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would provide a greater source of gas and it would get
here faster,'' she said. ``Therefore, prices would probably go
down.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Chevron Corp. declined to comment on the
pending legislation.
</P>
<P>
   However, Severin Borenstein, director of the University of
California Energy Institute in Berkeley, questioned whether
sufficient supplies of the cleaner-burning gas required by
California authorities would be available in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear whether such a pipeline would get much use,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other bills coming before the Legislature,
legislature,  &LR; Borenstein said that while a reserve supply of
gasoline would help to prevent price swings, the idea could prove
impractical in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gasoline, unlike oil, doesn't store very well,'' he said.
``You have to make it and then use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein also had doubts about the idea of limiting oil
companies' ownership of service stations _ ``divorcement,'' in
industry parlance. ``There is no evidence that divorcement actually
lowers prices for consumers,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Borenstein said, is that oil prices are now
going through the roof. Until oil prices come down, he observed,
California drivers should not expect gas prices to return to earth.

 Court Rejects Out-of-State Income Tax  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The U.S. Supreme Court yesterday unanimously struck down a disputed
portion of the California tax law, ruling that the Franchise Tax
Board unconstitutionally taxed income earned by corporations
outside the state.
<P>
   Franchise Tax Board spokesman Jim Shepherd said the ruling will
force the state to refund up to $95 million in taxes it collected
from approximately 800 corporations during the past four years. The
four-year period represents the statute of limitations on disputed
tax claims.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, future corporate tax collections will be
reduced by an estimated $13 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt-Wesson, now a subsidiary of Nebraska's -based  &LR; ConAgra
Inc., a food processor, brought the case against the FTB during the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Moll, a partner with the Morrison &AMP; Foerster law firm in
San Francisco, which represented Hunt-Wesson, said his client will
collect about $3 million in back taxes and interest as a result of
yesterday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   California is entitled to collect taxes from out-of-state
corporations that do business in the state. Under the unitary tax
system, the state has a well-established right to tax these
corporations on their California income.
</P>
<P>
   But the case decided yesterday centered on a 1937 statute that
appeared to extend the state's taxing powers to out-of-state
income.
</P>
<P>
   The statute limited the amount of interest payments that
out-of-state corporations can claim as deductions on their
California tax forms.
</P>
<P>
   The statute compelled the corporations to reduce the deductions
from their California income by the amount of dividends and
interest they received from sources outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   In yesterday's ruling, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that the
statute thus, in effect, allowed California to tax out-of-state
income earned by out-of-state corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Previous cases settled before the Supreme Court have established
that this is an ``impermissible'' tax that violates the U.S.
Constitution, Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   California argued that the rule was designed to prevent '`tax
arbitrage,'` in which companies cheat the taxman by borrowing money
for business operations outside the state, then deduct the interest
from their California income.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Miller, the FTB's counsel for multistate tax affairs,
said yesterday that it is difficult to pinpoint which interest
expenses are properly deductible in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to physically locate interest expenses for
corporations,'' Miller said. ``They occur wherever the corporation
is.''

REFRESHED RIPKIN SET FOR QUEST FOR 3,000 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ The inner peace that Cal Ripken
experienced during a particularly emotionally tugging 1999 season
is still there, the Baltimore Orioles' third baseman says. So bring
on the scrutiny and glare that will accompany his April pursuit of
3,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel any pressure right now,'' he said Tuesday at the
Orioles' spring training base. ``I thought I would, but I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken is 9 hits short of becoming the 24th player in major
league history to reach 3,000. He'd like to do it at friendly
Camden Yards, where the Orioles play their first six games.
``Nothing like putting pressure on yourself to start the season,''
he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Ripken will be glad to take the achievement when it
comes, in deference to baseball decorum. No sitting out to wait for
another home stand. He'd just like the suspense to end early, ``so
you can get back to some routine and normalcy.''
</P>
<P>
   At 39, he says he is enjoying baseball these days for the simple
pleasure of playing it. It's a carry-over from last year. He lost
his father, Cal Sr., to cancer in March. Then he went on the
disabled list for the first time in his 18-year career _ and twice,
for periods of 22 and 28 games.
</P>
<P>
   Just when a growing number of people were wondering if his
career might be over, Ripken did some of his best career hitting
between layoffs. In 86 games, he had career highs for batting
average (.340) and slugging percentage (.584).
</P>
<P>
   Of his rejuvenated hitting, he said, ``I started waiting on the
ball to come to me and started hitting the ball in the gaps. Even
after I came back from the disabled list, somehow the magic was
still the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more important than adjustments in the batter's box, Ripken
was able to play with a focus and calm that he had not often
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``A certain peace and a joy came over me last year that I don't
know where it came from,'' he said. ``I was at a position where I
just enjoyed myself and played the game. I didn't feel any added
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Ripken had to make a difficult decision: try to
persevere with nerve root irritation in his back or have surgery.
On Sept. I just enjoyed myself and played the game. I didn't feel
any added pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Ripken had to make a difficult decision: try to
persevere with nerve root irritation in his back or have surgery.
On Sept. 23, he underwent surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrifying alternative,'' he said. ``But it was a
risk I was willing to take to play a full season. And now I've
weathered all the uncertainties, all the doubts. I'm meeting it
head on. Let's find out what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, just for fun, Ripken participated in several drills
at first base. Several media types saw him and began speculating
that he might play some first base this season, to save his aging
body. Never mind that he participated in the drills wearing a third
baseman's glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, I'm penciled in as a third baseman until I
guess I prove I can't do it,'' he said. ``I'm not afraid of coming
in and laying it on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Retirement is not presently a consideration for the man who
holds the major league record for endurance by playing in 2,632
straight games. He laughed when he heard that pitcher Mike Messina
predicted he might play until he is 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing for sure: I can't come in here and say I'm
going to retire. I can't say this is my last year. I have to go out
there and find out.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that while the window of opportunity to play in the
majors is small for anyone compared to his life span, ``I plan to
max that window as much as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At this level you have to prove yourself day in and day out in
front of everyone,'' Ripken said. ``So there are no secrets. You
can't hide from it. You have to lay it on the line and find out
what you can do. That's what I'm going to do as long as I can.
Retirement will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Orioles, Ripken, gray at the temples, can be like
having another coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably the most intelligent player in the game today,''
shortstop Mike Bordick said. ``If you just listen to him, you're
going to learn. He knows players' tendencies and that's a big part
of the major league game _ knowing everybody's tendencies and
getting yourself in the right position.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaching is fine, but one thing is clear from Ripken's demeanor:
he's not ready to be a coach.

 Seagate's New Cheetah Outruns the Rest  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Upping the ante in the high-end hard drive market, Seagate
Technology today announced the first drive ever that spins at
15,000 rpm _ 50 percent faster than most previous high-end drives,
and almost three times faster than the typical PC drive.
<P>
   Called the Cheetah X15, the new 18-gigabyte drive is designed
primarily for servers that have to respond to very frequent
requests for data, such as commercial databases and e-commerce
sites. It won't ship in volume until this summer, according to the
company. Final pricing hasn't been set, but Seagate said it's
expected to be just under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most PC drives today spin at 5,400 rpm, while high-performance
desktop systems increasingly come with 7,200-rpm drives. The
fastest drives made by most manufacturers, designed for servers and
workstations, spin at 10,000 rpm, although Hitachi offers a
12,000-rpm drive for its servers.
</P>
<P>
   Extra spindle speed helps reduce average access time _ how long
it takes to reach desired data on the drive _ and increases the
sustained transfer rate _ the speed with which the drive can
deliver large blocks of data.
</P>
<P>
   The new drive can read, on average, 42.5 megabytes of data per
second. According to Seagate, that's equivalent to a person reading
the entire works of Shakespeare in less than a quarter of a second.
It's also about 25 percent faster than Seagate's current
10,000-rpm, 18-gigabyte drive, the Cheetah 18XL.
</P>
<P>
   Seagate, based in Scotts Valley, shares leadership in the
high-performance drive market with IBM, with Quantum and Fujitsu
not far behind, according to Jim Porter, president of Disk/Trend, a
Mountain View market research company that specializes in storage
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Seagate's announcement puts it ``at least one, and maybe two
quarters ahead'' of its rivals in reaching the 15,000-rpm plateau,
said Shaun Hook, product manager for the Cheetah X15.
</P>
<P>
   But Disk/Trend's Porter wasn't so sure: ``They're all working on
such drives,'' he said. ``Who's first depends on when they actually
ship, not on when they put out the press release.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, drives with higher spindle speeds have usually
required more power, genmore heat and made more noise than
otherwise comparable drives at a lower rpm. But in those respects,
Seagate said, the Cheetah X15 is no worse than its 10,000-rpm
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Seagate shares yesterday fell 69 cents to $44.31. After trading
between $25 and $35 for most of 1999, it rose sharply beginning in
November.

 Oracle Dials Up Internet  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
In its highest-profile foray into the consumer market, Redwood
City's Oracle Corp. yesterday spun out OracleMobile, a independent
company aimed at turning cell phones into Internet-cruising
devices.
<P>
   Oracle, the No.1 maker of database management software, said
OracleMobile will tackle both the consumer and corporate markets.
</P>
<P>
   Using Web-enabled phones (or those capable of receiving pages),
consumers can dial into the OracleMobile portal and browse the
scaled-down Web sites of about 12 companies, including eBay, Zagat
and MapQuest. The results of a search for, say, directions to a
restaurant, are displayed onscreen. If the phone is fitted with
voice recognition technology from Motorola _ a partner in the
venture _ users can orally request information, minimizing the need
to type on the phone keypad. Information from the Web sites can
then be read back to phone users.
</P>
<P>
   On the corporate side, Oracle offers two options to potential
customers like Amazon and Etrade.  &LR; E-Trade. They can buy Oracle's
portal software, which lets them boil down their regular sites to
phone-friendly tidbits. Or, as Oracle hopes, it can both supply the
technology and host the site on its servers.
</P>
<P>
   In making the announcement yesterday in New York, Oracle chief
executive Larry Ellison said the venture is aimed at the exploding
Internet appliance market, which is expected to balloon to $13.2
billion a year by 2003, according to Boston research firm Yankee
Group, as consumers turn away from personal computers and toward
cell phones and other Internet-enabled devices for access to
e-mail, driving instructions and airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC is going to be overwhelmed by Internet appliances, Web
phones, whatever you want to call them _ simple devices with access
to the Internet,'' Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer portal also represents a shift of sorts for Oracle
_ which primarily supplies complex database software to large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect them to get into'' a consumer-oriented
business, said Bruce Raabe, chief investment officer for Collins &AMP;
Co., which rates the stock a hold. ``But you have a lot of
business-to-business companies trying to take advantage of consumer
spending. Like a lot of other companies, (Oracle is) seeing growth
in their traditional business slowing down and they have to branch
outward.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, OracleMobile.com, which will be the portal through
which consumers will access the Web, has been registered by another
organization, forcing Oracle to use OraMobile.com, Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   But Oracle's lawyers ``are chatting with them right now. We'll
have both URLs shortly,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison named Denise Lahey, a software engineer and head of
Oracle's mobile products division, chief executive of OracleMobile.
</P>
<P>
   Lahey said OracleMobile will make money in several ways:
advertising, hosting fees, subscription fees for some premium
services and by taking a piece of e-commerce transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's premiere dovetails with a similar venture Oracle
launched Friday with Swedish telecommunications company Telia AB.
That company will develop and market wireless Internet products
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In both markets, Raabe said Oracle will face stiff competition
as more and more companies announce initiatives to Webify handheld
gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Corp. is already using technology developed by Redwood
City's Phone.com to allow consumers to surf the Web using cell
phones; and Bell Atlantic Corp. announced a similar initiative in
November.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Microsoft Corp. recently invested about $600
million in Nextel Communications to develop online services for
wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   All of these companies may face some acceptance problems from
consumers who balk at many devices' tiny screens and even tinier
keypads.
</P>
<P>
   In yesterday's conference, Ellison conceded ``Yes, (cell phones)
do have smaller screens, but your PC can't call you up and tell you
something important just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Lahey said the 25-employee company, located on Oracle's
sprawling campus in Redwood City, is `'in negotiations'' with
potential investors and expects to offer its shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take the company public as soon as possible,''
Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle shares, which have tripled since September, edged
slightly higher yesterday, closing up 75 cents at $59.31.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Small Business Web Sites to Join  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
ExciteAtHome and Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal,
unveiled plans yesterday to combine their fledgling
small-business-oriented Web sites and sell stock in the joint
venture later this year.
<P>
   The spin-off company, called Work.com, will be based in Redwood
City, where ExciteAtHome has its headquarters, and begin life with
16 workers (eight from each firm) and $20 million to - &LR; $25 million
in annual sales, mostly from online ads.
</P>
<P>
   Excite, which runs Excite.com and other popular consumer Web
sites, started Work.com last September to crack the small-business
market; it offers news and a directory of Web sites for more than
two dozen industries, ranging from accounting to utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones, meanwhile, started dowjones.com, a similar
small-business portal, in June. It features selected headlines and
articles from both the Wall Street Journal and its wire service,
where reporters electronically file quick dispatches to alert
investors and newspapers within minutes and hours of an event,
instead of waiting for the Journal to arrive the next day. Work.com
will now be able to offer some of that news.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome chief executive George Bell said the deal makes
sense for both firms. Excite couldn't reproduce the Wall Street
Journal's articles on its own, and Dow Jones didn't have Excite's
experience fighting with other portals for Net users. ``Each
company is getting something,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement also comes at a time when interest in
small-business portals is heating up. NBCi bought San Francisco's
-based  &LR; Allbusiness.com, a news site for small businesses, this
month for about $225 million in stock. Onvia.com, an online
marketplace for smaller firms, plans to sell stock to the public
for the first time as early as this week. And Inc. magazine has won
fans by stocking its Web site with advice on starting and running a
business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Excite and Dow Jones face stiff challenges. Neither
Work.com nor DowJones.com has attracted much interest or enough
users to crack Media Metrix's monthly list of the top 500 Web
sites, noted Jim Nail, an analyst from Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass. ``Excite doesn't seem to have much traction, and
Dow Jones definitely doesn't have any traction,'' Nail said. ``Does
taking two sites that don't have any traction give you one that
does?''
</P>
<P>
   And there are other factors. Dow Jones only plans to make
headlines and a handful of stories available on the free Web site,
because it charges subscribers to access the full Wall Street
Journal newspaper and archives on www.wsj.com. Meanwhile,
ExciteAtHome said it could potentially refer 5 million users to
Work.com from its other Web sites, but will charge Work.com for its
marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ExciteAtHome sees potential. Citing Nail's research firm,
Forrester, it noted that business information could become an $11
billion market worldwide in four years. And while Work.com garners
sales today from advertising, Bell believes the future is
e-commerce _ selling software and other products through the Web
site. Work.com also plans to create additional co-branded Web sites
with additional partners.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome shares edged up 13 cents, to $34.19. DowJones
closed at $62.56, up 63 cents.

 GROW A BUSINESS/PETER SINTON  &HT;     Finding Reality Checks for That Fantastic Idea 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I feel that I have a blockbuster concept for an Internet
business and have a business license and two registered domain
names. But how do I find out if it will fly? There must be a
process for exploring ideas before going too far out on a limb.
<P>
   I currently work for a large company, but am committed to doing
something where I can tap my creativity and be in control of my own
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: No doubt you know other entrepreneurs or Internet experts you
could talk to about your concept in confidence. You might also
discuss it with some of the angel investors who host forums around
the Bay Area, or visit Web sites like www.garage.com and
www.vfinance.com.
</P>
<P>
   David Cowan, general partner with Bessemer Venture Partners in
Menlo Park, suggests a few other sites for information. One is
EXP.com (www.exp.com), which connects individuals to experts in
nearly 100 categories. Signing up is free, and all transactions
between experts and members are completely secure, confidential and
personalized. Cowan is not exactly an unbiased observer because
since  &LR; his venture capital firm has a stake in EXP.com and he
occasionally offers his services online (for about $200 an hour).
</P>
<P>
   Cowan also likes Silicon Valley Bank's online site for
entrepreneurs (www.esource.svb.com). It offers free articles for
entrepreneurs to help them assess their needs on everything from
marketing to private equity placements. Bank customers can receive
even more services online.
</P>
<P>
   Business Week Magazine recently tested new online advice
services and called Exp.com ``the most efficient, time-saving, and
personalized service.'' It allows info-seekers to do a keyword
search of the site _ for example, ``startup,'' to find advisers
with the right expertise. The service also invites visitors to post
questions on a general bulletin board to which any adviser might
respond. Fees might  &LR; range from $20 an hour on up. Note: Users must
register and submit a credit-card number before asking any
questions.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like going online for advice, you can find plenty
of business consultants, lawyers, accountants and other experts
with real offices.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Software Sources
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: My company creates online documentation solutions for software
companies. I would like to contact more companies, but I find that
mailing list providers work by SIC codes which do not zero in on
what I want (they include software retailers). How can I get my
message about the service I provide to my target audience? I would
especially like to contact the CEOs of startup software companies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It's not surprising that you are having a hard time finding what
you are looking for. The Software &AMP; Information Industry
Association in Washington, D.C., (www.siia.net) has about
 &LR; approximately  &LR; 1,400 members but a lot of the startups you are
looking for are not members yet and may never be.
</P>
<P>
   SIIA spokesman Stever Bowers concedes ``No good list of software
startups exists.'' He said the problem is ``A) there are thousands
of startups, and B) their life span is often very short.'' Some
fail and many others get gobbled up by their competitors so names
and faces change quickly.
</P>
<P>
   You might just have to sift through standard industrial
classification (SIC) codes, as imperfect as they may be. InfoUSA of
Oklahoma puts out books of businesses and their key decision-makers
based on such codes.

MCCAIN SHOCKS BUSH WITH WINS IN MICHIGAN, ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Senator John McCain's campaign roared back to
life Tuesday with wins in Michigan and his home state of Arizona.
McCain beat George W. Bush in the open Michigan contest by cobbling
together a combination of moderate Republicans, independents, and a
surprisingly large number of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, after easily winning South Carolina on Saturday, had hoped
to dispatch McCain in Michigan, where the Texas governor was backed
by the political machine of the state's controversial governor,
Republican John Engler. But Engler's efforts may have backfired by
bringing out Democrats to vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In a symbol of this topsy-turvy election, McCain's Michigan
victory came as the ink was barely dry on many ``Bush comeback''
stories. Exactly three weeks earlier, McCain won by 18 points in
New Hampshire. Then Bush won South Carolina. Now the McCain
comeback launches the Republican contest into a dramatic two-week
dash toward the March 7 blockbuster round of more than a dozen
primaries and caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   An ebullient but soft-spoken McCain accepted his victory as a
sign that his insurgent campaign is taking root with the national
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reformers, Republican reformers who can make this party
bigger and change politics for future generations,'' McCain said.
``Don't fear this, my fellow Republicans, join it. This is where
you belong. We are creating a new majority my friends, a McCain
majority . . . and we are Al Gore's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, reacting to the news that several television networks had
called the race for McCain, said Tuesday night in Kansas City, Mo.,
``My reaction is, if that is the case, I congratulate him. I want
to thank all the Republicans that supported me. I won
overwhelmingly among the Republicans in Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush then implied that many upcoming races will be easier for
him, noting especially the GOP primaries which don't allow
Democrats or independents to participate. ``There is a lot of
contests coming up,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, the presidential campaign had been conducted in
the smaller states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Delaware, and South
Carolina. McCain's performance in the much larger and more
urbanized state of Michigan and his easy win in his home state of
Arizona give him a legitimate claim to being a serious contender in
the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Former Ambassador Alan Keyes finished a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed that Bush got about two-thirds of the
Republican vote, as he did in South Carolina. But the similarities
ended there. While 60 percent of the South Carolina vote came from
Republicans, only 49 percent of the Michigan vote came from within
the GOP. A third were independents. But the big difference was that
18 percent of Michigan voters were Democrats, twice the percentage
of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won the Democratic vote by a 4-to-1 margin, justifying
McCain's gamble to go for the crossover vote. Bush had hoped that
McCain's appeal for Democratic votes would backfire, as it did in
South Carolina, and result in a larger turnout by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, which sends 58 delegates to the Republican National
Convention, was supposed to be not only a firewall for Bush, but
one made of fireproof asbestos, as Republican Governor John Engler,
a Bush backer, put it. But Engler's power is double-edged,
attracting many supporters but also repelling others. The 15
percent of those surveyed who said Engler's endorsement meant a
great deal voted by a 2-to-1 margin for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Engler Tuesday night accused McCain of ``renting Democrats for a
day'' to beat Bush. ``John McCain isn't party building, he's
party-borrowing,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   The black vote, which was only 1 percent of the turnout in South
Carolina, was 5 percent in Michigan, and it went overwhelmingly for
McCain, the exit polls showed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won all 30 convention delegates in Arizona, by virtue of
his win there. In Michigan, the delegate picture is murkier. The
state sends 58 delegates to the Republican National Convention,
most of them apportioned according to who prevailed in each of the
state's Congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   The road remains tough for McCain. His defeat in South Carolina
underscored his weakness in the South, where many states have a
strong constituency of religious conservatives who so far have seem
inclined to support Bush. Moreover, a number of large upcoming
states, including New York, do not allow Democrats and independents
to vote in the primaries, which will likely hurt McCain's chances.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's primaries came 72 hours after Bush's huge win in South
Carolina, where Christian conservatives massed against McCain. At
times, the brief battle in Michigan took on the tone of a religious
war, with McCain appealing to Catholic voters to express their
displeasure with Bush for visiting Bob Jones University in South
Carolina, an institution that views Catholicism with suspicion and
bans interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, was aided by phone calls from the Rev.
Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition, and by phone
calls and postcards from the Right to Life antiabortion group of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, however, fundamentalist Christians are far less of
a force than in South Carolina. About 13 to 17 percent of the
population considers itself part of the Christian right, compared
to more than a third in South Carolina. And about 25 percent of
Michigan voters are Catholic, unlike in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, benefited from phone calls to voters that
said, ``This is a Catholic voter alert,'' describing Bush's visit
to Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Jones has made strong anti-Catholic statements, including
calling the pope the anti-Christ, the Catholic Church a satanic
cult,'' the recording said. ``John McCain, a pro-life senator, has
strongly criticized this anti-Catholic bigotry, while Governor Bush
has stayed silent, while seeking the support of Bob Jones
University.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush complained that McCain first compared him to President
Clinton, and now is paying for phone calls calling him an
anti-Catholic bigot. ``This is shameful politics,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has vowed to stay in the race through March 7, when more
than a dozen states hold primaries and caucuses. Tuesday, McCain's
campaign issued a news release touting a new CNN-USA Today poll
that shows McCain beating Vice President Al Gore in a general
election matchup, 59 percent to 35 percent, compared to Bush's more
tepid 50 percent to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cloak of inevitability that once hung about Governor Bush
has frayed away, and Republicans are starting to realize that John
McCain is the only candidate who can and will win against Al
Gore,'' said Dan Schnur, McCain's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said the pillars of the Bush candidacy _ inevitability,
electability, and money _ are rapidly crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, 58 delegates are at stake, and a total of 1,034 are
needed to win the Republican nomination.

 Palo Alto Firm Encourages All to Share Ideas  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Many local companies do a good job encouraging teamwork and
focusing their competitive efforts on beating their external
rivals.
<P>
   At Ideo, the Palo Alto industrial design company that helped
create the Apple mouse and the Palm V handheld computer, teamwork
is the name of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this mythology in America about the lone genius. We
love to personify things,'' said Ideo general manager Tom Kelley.
``But Michelangelo didn't paint the Sistine Chapel alone and Edison
didn't invent the lightbulb light bulb  &LR; alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideo has 350 people in seven offices around the world and has
built a $60-million-a-year business by getting people to work in
groups, to share ideas and build on them.
</P>
<P>
   This often starts with brainstorming sessions where employees
sit around and throw out ideas. The rules to encourage the free
flow of ideas are stencilled on the walls of all Ideo brainstorming
rooms:
</P>
<P>
   _Defer judgment
</P>
<P>
   _Encourage wild ideas
</P>
<P>
   _Build on the ideas of others
</P>
<P>
   _Stay focused on the topic
</P>
<P>
   _One conversation at a time
</P>
<P>
   Stanford professor Jeffrey Pfeffer applauds Ideo's brainstorming
approach because ``it is built on participation and getting work
done, not title or credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; c,12p2  &LR;  To encourage team spirit, Ideo breaks its employees
down by ``studios'' and project groups. At the home office in Palo
Alto, for example, there are about 100 employees and six studios
with their own names and themes. One adopted a Ronald Coleman goes
to Shangri-la Shangrila  &LR; ``Lost Horizon'' theme and is nestled
nestles  &LR; beneath a DC-3 wing. Another decked out in velvet curtains
looks like a supper club.
</P>
<P>
   Ideo is big on establishing group identity with its own office
design, outside retreats and a bonus system based on the
performance of the company, the studio and the individual. Each
employee must pick two peers to help in his or her annual
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is relatively easy to fool the boss but it's
hard to fool other members of the project team,'' explained Kelley.
``You can't be like Eddie Haskell in `Leave It to Beaver' and just
be on best behavior for a few minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every company starts out fostering teamwork. Some, like
Guidant Corp., found they needed to change their self-destructive
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Guidant, which makes devices for life-saving medical procedures,
realized in the mid-1990s that internal competition was killing its
efforts to foster teamwork and get new products to market quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stay focused on the customer,'' said Ginger Graham,
president of Guidant's $1.2 billion Vascular Intervention Group in
Santa Clara. ``So we developed a team bonus structure that rewards
employees for delivering great solutions, not for what area of the
company they work for or what they do alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidant's bonus system is now based one-third on reaching
product milestone goals and two-thirds on performance of products
in the market. All employees get the same bonus, which is based on
a percentage of their base salary. Last year it was 28 percent. In
1998, a banner year, it was 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, before Guidant adopted its team-based approach,
different groups of employees worked against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in R&AMP;D liked playing with new ideas and making the best
product possible,'' said Peter McInnes, an R&AMP;D vice president at
the time. ``On the manufacturing side, engineers focused on
producing and were resistant to changes that involved new processes
and training.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, McInnes recalls that ``people tried to optimize
performance within their departments,'' sometimes at the expense of
other groups.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, R&AMP;D groups even worked on the same problem, like
finding better coatings for catheters, without knowing it. (The two
units only discovered they were going over the same ground when a
prospective customer brought it to their attention.)
</P>
<P>
   To align everyone around the common goals of creating the best
products and getting them to market quickly, Guidant restructured
around business units where research and manufacturing teams had to
work together and were measured by getting products to market and
having them accepted.
</P>
<P>
   McInnes, now vice president of the unit that makes angioplasty
catheters, said it takes a year or less to get a new product to
market, about half the time it took in the previous era. Since
teamwork has been encouraged, Guidant sales have doubled over the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   A beneficial byproduct of Guidant's shared goals and rewards
structure is that Graham says the company only loses about two to
five percent of its workforce a year and less than 10 percent of
its technical talent. In hotly competitive Silicon Valley, where
job-hopping is the norm and typical employee attrition is 20
percent a year, that's an impressive retention rate.
</P>
<P>
   Another star in professor Robert Sutton and Pfeffer's management
pantheon is Men's Wearhouse. The company headed by TV pitchman
George Zimmer rewards team selling because shoppers are interested
in the total store experience, not their dealings with a single
salesperson.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage collaboration, Men's Wearhouse tracks transactions
and average sales dollars per transaction for each ``wardrobe
consultant.'' If someone has substantially more sales than his or
her colleagues _ say 25 percent or more _ that is taken as a signal
that the person is probably not sharing walk-in traffic but is
hogging it.
</P>
<P>
   Men's Wearhouse has even fired at least one of its most
successful salespeople because he refused to conform with the
firm's cultural values. The move, which was not designed to stifle
individual performance, apparently worked. After the self-centered
salesman was canned, none of his colleagues matched his individual
sales figures but total sales volume of the store still increased
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``To dominate a declining industry means you're doing something
right,'' said Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford professors also have good words for SouthWest
Airlines. The airline, which demonizes external competitors, relies
on collective rewards internally such as profit sharing and stock
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   An unlike some other airlines, it doesn't waste time assessing
and placing blame for problems but focuses on solving them. For
example, if a flight is delayed, SouthWest crews can check the box
``team delay'' rather than blame someone on the ground or in the
cabin.

<P>
   DETROIT _ Sen. John McCain scrambled back into contention in the
Republican presidential race on Tuesday, capitalizing on his
home-state advantage to trounce Gov. George W. Bush in Arizona and
riding a wave of independents and Democrats to gain an edge on Bush
in Michigan, polls of voters indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The voting in Michigan has been watched closely not only because
the campaign here was marked by bitter accusations of unscrupulous
tactics on both sides, but, more important, because it is the first
large-state showdown of the campaign with 58 delegates up for grabs
.
</P>
<P>
   Although early returns showed the race extremely close, McCain
clearly regained some of the footing he lost on Saturday in the
South Carolina primary by running well ahead of Bush among
independents and Democrats here _ as well as many people who had
never before voted in a Republican primary. Those voters poured to
the polls, swelling turnout estimates to at least one million, more
than double the totals in primaries here four and eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drew his strength from a different pool of voters: he
attracted far higher proportions of conservatives and Republican
loyalists _ a margin of more than 2 to 1 _ than McCain. But those
voters helped Bush more in South Carolina than here in the Midwest,
where the electorate is far less Republican _ and far less
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   With 37 percent of the precincts reporting in Michigan, McCain
had 50 percent of the vote while Bush had 44 percent. In Arizona,
with 2 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had 53 percent
and Bush 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief news conference in Kansas City on Tuesday evening,
shortly after the polls closed in Michigan, Bush said,
``Republicans overwhelmingly supported my candidacy. It seems I'm
getting stronger and stronger with Republicans as the primaries go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   And he seemed to recognize the possibility that McCain would
continue to impede what many had once considered an inevitable
march to the nomination. ``This is a long process,'' he said.
``This is a marathon. And I'm going to be in it all the way to the
end. And some primaries you win, and sometimes, you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The two contests on Tuesday were especially critical for McCain
because after Bush's 11-point victory in South Carolina, he has
sought to demonstrate that he is not a one-state wonder who could
only win a primary in a tiny state like New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Bush's advisers had hoped that they could
effectively knock off McCain after Tuesday. And even McCain's aides
had acknowledged that a lopsided defeat in Michigan would have
shattered the chances for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's voting assured that what McCain called ``a wonderful,
wonderful ride'' after his defeat in South Carolina will not be
over. It means that a Republican nominee would probably not emerge
at least until after the candidates sprint through 16 primaries and
caucuses over the next 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the outcome on Tuesday will intensify the focus on
the races next week in Virginia, Washington state and North Dakota.
But the most important voting will be on March 7, which is
something of a national primary, with voters going to the polls in
New York, California, Ohio, Missouri, Georgia, Connecticut and
several other states.
</P>
<P>
   After South Carolina, Bush and McCain rushed to concentrate on
Michigan because the outcome here is far more important. There are
58 delegates at stake in Michigan; 30 in Arizona. McCain was also
widely expected to win in Arizona because he is the favorite son
there who has served three terms in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush's defeat in Arizona, according to the polls,
underscores how the primary season has been far rockier than he or
his advisers had anticipated. Bush enjoyed the energetic backing of
the Republican governor, Jane Dee Hull. And for a time last year,
surveys in Arizona showed Bush ahead of McCain. That led some of
the Bush's advisers to happily predict that they would humiliate
McCain in his own state.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush advisers now insist they never intended to win in
Arizona, they poured as much as $2 million into smothering the
state in television commercials and direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   The see-saw nature of the Republican competition _ while McCain
has won New Hampshire, Bush was victorious in South Carolina and
Delaware _ leaves Bush appearing far less invincible than he seemed
for much of last year when polls showed, month after month, that he
towered over the Republican field and could easily defeat a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the McCain campaign has fastened onto the theme that Bush
is such a weak candidate that he could lose a general election.
</P>
<P>
   But the voting in Michigan pointed to larger difficulties for
both Bush and McCain. Bush's constituency is predominately from his
party's conservative wing, according to the surveys of voters,
conducted by a consortium of the television networks and The
Associated Press. Those so-called exit polls showed McCain with a
slight edge over Bush; McCain also held a narrow leade with with
about a third of the actual votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls also showed that if Bush is the Republican
nominee, it might be difficult for him to attract Republican
moderates, independents and Democrats in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for McCain, the surveys showed, is that he
encountered difficulty attracting members of his own party. That
could be perilous because many of the coming contests are in states
like New York, where, unlike Michigan, only registered Republicans
can participate.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Feuds in the Cubes Drain Energy From Pursuit of Profit  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Entrepreneurs and managers have plenty of knowledge about how to
run companies, including reams of computer data, piles of
management books, loads of high-priced consultants and their own
experiences. But many still do stupid things to undermine teamwork
and performance.
<P>
   In their new book, ``The Knowing-Doing Gap _ How Smart Companies
Turn Knowledge Into Action,'' Stanford organizational behavior
professors Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert Sutton focus on management
practices that sabotage success.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common and most insidious, they say, is ``when
internal competition turns friends into enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Management practices that produce counterproductive internal
competition are incredibly common. They can include recognition
awards such as employee-of-the-month programs, contests between
departments and individuals for prizes and published rankings of
individual or unit performance.
</P>
<P>
   Pitting employees against each other is a common phenomenon at
large companies. But the impetus can take hold at very small
businesses when the entrepreneur at the helm figures survival of
the fittest is the law of the office as well as nature.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton and Pfeffer have nothing against free enterprise or
rewarding individuals for their work. Sales commissions are
effective in spurring brokers, real estate agents and many others
to greater glory for themselves and their companies. The Society of
Incentive Travel Executives in New York figures incentive sales
programs boost revenues of companies that use them by nearly 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Internal competition is only counter-productive when it involves
``zero-sum contests'' where the success or rewards of one person
come at the expense of someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeffer and Sutton talk about management marvels and miscues
with the same exuberance that Tom and Ray Magliozzi discuss
clunkers on their popular ``Car Talk'' show on National Public
Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Near the top of their list of misguided managers is James
Halpin, CEO of Comp USA, who was featured in the Academy of
Management's ``Executive'' magazine last May.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the big Dallas computer retailer, whose stock has
lost three-quarters of its value since 1998, tells his employees to
ask themselves at the end of each day: ``What did I do today to put
myself above my co-workers? If you can't come up with anything, you
wasted a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton derisively calls Halpin ``a piece of work.''
</P>
<P>
   At quarterly meetings, Halpin makes 20 regional managers sit by
order of profitability with the weakest earners in the front
``because they've got to listen to everything we've got to say.''
At other meetings, employees must wear name tags marked with their
store's unaccounted for, or missing, inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeffer calls Halpin's division of employees by ``lifters'' and
``leaners'' and other tactics ``management through humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford professors say the effectiveness of incentive
programs depends on how they are implemented.
</P>
<P>
   If bonuses go to salespeople with specific territories and
little need to cooperate _ ``low task interdependence'' in business
school jargon, they say such rewards might be fine. On the other
hand, ``if employees need help from one another, if they need to
learn on the job, then I-win, you-lose contests can undermine
company performance,'' Sutton contends.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton and Pfeffer say Microsoft fits in this mold and is
``notorious for releasing software with a large number of bugs.''
Microsoft's culture puts a premium on individual expertise. That
leads to high salary and bonus but creates ``an incentive to
prevent others from uncovering your deficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the dangers of unbridled internal competition is that it
can lead to ``information hoarding'' as everyone strives to be an
expert who is more knowledgeable than his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Internal competition also can drive good employees out the door.
Even worse, say Sutton and Pfeffer, it can create so much tension
and stress that employees resort to faking sales numbers and
accounting fraud to meet or surpass expectations.

 DETROIT: can participate.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the many indications that McCain and Bush appeal to
opposite ends of the philosophical spectrum, Bush attracted the
majority of voters who want to see abortion made illegal to some
degree, and McCain drew the majority of voters who favored keeping
abortion legal.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive race here was something of an embarrassment for
Gov. John M. Engler, who had promised that his organization would
deliver for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Engler is a controversial figure in this state, and the
surveys showed that his endorsement was a mixed blessing for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan is far more representative of the nation than the
earlier states that have voted because of its large population,
heavy industry, unions and blend of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the electorate in this state on Tuesday was far different
than four years ago. The number of Democrats voting nearly doubled
to 20 percent of the electorate, while the number of Republicans
diminished to about 50 percent, and independents to about 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Democrats accounted for 10 percent of the voters;
Republicans, 62 percent and independents, 28 percent. Nearly half
the voters said they were conservative, and they backed Bush over
cCain by nearly 3 to 1. But nearly 4 in 10 voters described
themselves as moderates; 6 in 10 of them backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While religious conservatives were credited for delivering huge
support to Bush in South Carolina, they were not as much a factor
in Michigan. Fewer than 3 in 10 voters said they considered
themselves to be part of the religious right movement; those who
did voted overwhelmingly for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigning here had been dominated by often harsh exchanges
over which campaign was most negative, which each side accusing the
other of planting unsavory information about the candidates through
phone banks and mailings.
</P>
<P>
   But while voters in South Carolina concluded that McCain was
behind a more negative campaign, voters here said Bush was slightly
more negative. Nearly 4 in 10 said Bush had been attacking McCain
unfairly; while more than a third said McCain had been attacking
Bush unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the verbal assaults, voters here and in Arizona said
they were most concerned with the candidates' personal character _
not their stands on issues. That was one of McCain's great
strengths in the voting on Tuesday. He had the wide backing of
voters who said a candidates' personal qualities matters more than
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Michigan, 3 in 10 voters said they were looking for a
candidate who stands up for what he believes in; McCain won nearly
6 in 10 of their votes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also was said to be more honest about his beliefs than
Bush. And half the voters said McCain says what he believes rather
than what people want to hear; only 4 in 10 said the same of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a contrast to South Carolina, where Bush successful
appropriated Mr. McCain's mantle of reform, the senator regained
his reform image in Michigan. Asked who the real reformer was,
voters were more likely to say McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ran advertisements emphasizing his ``reformer with
results'' mantra, but McCain repeatedly declared that if his rival
was a reformer he was ``an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, McCain overwhelmed Bush in virtually every
demographic group _ except among voters who consider themselves
very conservative and those who want to make abortion illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The voters in Arizona are staunchly Republican and
overwhelmingly conservative, fitting closely to the profile of
Bush's backers. But McCain appeared to win them over because of his
deep roots in the state.

McSORLEY SORELY MISTAKEN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday, hockey fans should have been celebrating the 20th
anniversary of the greatest moment in the sport's American history.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they were mourning one of the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 22, 1980, we watched the United States Olympic team
upset the Soviet Union in Lake Placid, N.Y., on its way to the gold
medal, a development that signaled the start of hockey's popularity
surge.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 22, 2000, we awoke to video replays of the Boston
Bruins' Marty McSorley clubbing the Vancouver Canucks' Donald
Brashear into unconsciousness, the most vicious act of on-ice
violence in years.
</P>
<P>
   Do you believe in irony?
</P>
<P>
   The Miracle on Ice made fans take a fresh look at a sport that
for decades was the butt of jokes about its fights.
</P>
<P>
   The Mugging on Ice dredges up memories of that old, dark,
best-forgotten era.
</P>
<P>
   By the afternoon after the attack, McSorley had been suspended
``indefinitely'' by the NHL pending a hearing today in New York.
Meanwhile, a police investigation was underway, spurred by a
Vancouver police officer who attended Monday's game and filed a
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a situation here where it would appear, or it's been
alleged, that there was a fairly vicious attack by one person on
another,'' a Vancouver police spokeswoman told the Associated
Press, reducing the incident to its essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in NHL history has a player gone to jail for an on-ice
offense, when Dino Ciccarelli of the Minnesota North Stars served
24 hours for hitting Luke Richardson of the Toronto Maple Leafs
over the head with his stick in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   This time, hockey people are hoping the law-enforcement agencies
maintain their traditional hands-off approach to sports violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave this stuff on the ice _ leave it to the National Hockey
League,'' said Canucks general manager Brian Burke, who used to be
the NHL official in charge of discipline. ``We don't need the
Vancouver Police Department or (the Royal Canadian Mounted Police)
involved in this.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's up to the NHL to prove we don't need the police to get
involved. It's up to the NHL to sock McSorley with a suspension as
painful as the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Marty McSorley, 36, is a 6-foot-1, 225-pound Canadian who earned
the reputation early in his career as a goon who could also play.
He was Wayne Gretzky's bodyguard with the Edmonton Oilers and the
Kings. He scored as many as 15 goals in a season.
</P>
<P>
   The fact he had been suspended following fights six times before
this, most recently in 1994, drew no particular notice. Especially
in Los Angeles, McSorley is best known for taking the illegal-stick
penalty in Game 2 of the 1993 Stanley Cup finals that led to the
power-play goal that prevented the Kings from taking a two-game
lead over the Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   That night in 1993, they checked McSorley's stick blade for
illegal curvature.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, they were checking it for blood.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2.7 seconds remained in the game when McSorley skated
behind Brashear, raised his stick and took a cut worthy of Andre
Dawson. His stick struck Brashear in the right temple. Brashear,
28, his helmet dislodged, fell backward and struck his head on the
ice. He lay, twitching, on his back, blood leaking from his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Back on his feet in the dressing room, Brashear seemed to have
suffered a concussion that will sideline him for two to three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news: It's !ital!only a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't diminish the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the fact McSorley and Brashear had fought in the early
minutes of the Canucks' 5-2 victory, the fact Brashear had fallen
on and injured Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe in the first period, or
McSorley's immediate apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in shock at what I did,'' McSorley said after the
game, explaining he had meant to goad Brashear into dropping the
gloves again. ``That's not what I wanted to do. I wanted to go
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks' Brad May called the incident ``the worst thing I've
ever seen.'' The Canucks' Markus Naslund called the slash ``bad
enough to, I think, kill someone. The league has to make an
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston, 11th in the Eastern Conference and last in the Northeast
Division, isn't going to make the playoffs. After the Bruins' game
at Edmonton tonight, they'll have 22 games left in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently, suspending McSorley for the rest of the season,
costing him $160,000 in salary, would top the NHL-record 21-day
suspension Dale Hunter of the Washington Capitals served for
blindsiding Pierre Turgeon of the New York Islanders after a
playoff goal in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less and the question will remain whether the NHL can
police itself.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was a doubly pivotal day in puck history. It's the day
we went to an anniversary party and a hockey game broke out.

THQ EARNINGS POISED TO DECREASE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CALABASAS _ Look for a strong fourth quarter, followed by a dip
in the performance of video game maker THQ Inc. in the first half
of 2000, industry watchers said. Several factors are converging to
create the likelihood of a decrease in earnings this year, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is expected to beat the First Call/Thompson
Financial consensus of 66 cents per share when it reports its 1999
fourth quarter results Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Williams, stock analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison &AMP;
Co., said the company is typically tight-lipped on financial
matters, but it released an estimate in January that said it would
exceed that estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Investors polled by WhisperNumber.com predict a much stronger
fourth quarter with an average estimate of 77 cents per share.
Williams said he has little faith in whisper numbers.
</P>
<P>
   THQ, along with the rest of the video game industry, is in a
technology shift. Consumers are slowing down their purchases of
games on existing systems in anticipation of the release of two new
game systems - Sega's Dreamcast and Sony's PlayStation 2.
</P>
<P>
   THQ is developing games for both systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have their first game out for Dreamcast in the June
quarter, but they won't get meaningful revenues until the fall,''
Williams said. ``One of the key things to understand about the
industry is that the June quarter in particular tends to be a light
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   But last year, THQ had strong sales in the first and second
quarters, releasing games under its license with World Championship
Wrestling en masse before the license expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had very large shipments in the first half of fiscal 1999
and relatively light shipments in the second half of fiscal 1999,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison with last year's strong first and second quarters,
this year's first half will appear weak, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing with all video game companies is they really
can't be run on a quarter-by-quarter basis,'' he said. ``For 20
consecutive quarters, they will have reported positive
year-over-year earnings. That streak comes to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has slid to roughly half of its November
value, largely on investor concerns about THQ's future performance.
Shares of THQ closed at $17.625 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company faces two shareholder lawsuits alleging selective
disclosure of financial information involving suspected leaks of
the company's projections for its first- and second-quarter
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits were filed by San Diego-based Milberg Weiss Bershad
Haynes &AMP; Lerach and Philadelphia-based Spector, Roseman and
Kodroff. Principals of both firms were unavailable for comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   THQ spokeswoman Liz Bell said the company has not been served
with copies of either lawsuit, and it typically does not comment on
litigation.

 &HT;    McCain takes Michigan, Arizona primaries
 &HT;    By Jena Heath and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Gov. George W. Bush got the news on stage and
on camera, but was ready with the quick spin when told that he lost
Michigan's presidential primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank all the Republicans who supported me,'' Bush
said at a news conference after a rally en route from Michigan to
California. ``I won overwhelmingly amongst the Republicans in
Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Arizona Sen. John McCain, somebody other than
Republicans are helping pick the GOP presidential nominee. And,
exit polls show, those somebodies tend to be big fans of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Only 47 percent of the Michigan vote on Tuesday came from voters
who identified themselves as Republicans. Bush won that group by a
65 percent to 28 percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   But 35 percent of the voters said they are independents, and
McCain won that segment by the same 65 percent to 28 percent
margin. McCain's winning formula also included a whopping 80
percent to 11 percent margin among the 18 percent of the voters who
identified themselves as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose overwhelming gubernatorial re-election effort in
1998 was built on a bipartisan coalition, is now in a political
death match against those forces.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday night whether it's a good idea to have open
primaries that allow Democrats and independents to vote in
Republican contests, Bush came down firmly on the side of maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they are and sometimes they're not,'' he said,
adding that he remains convinced that some Michigan Democrats voted
in Tuesday's GOP primary just to mess with the system.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Bush _ and perhaps the advantage for McCain _
is that the remaining pre-Super Tuesday (March 7) primaries are all
open contests. The next contests are Feb. 29 in Washington state
and Virginia. North Dakota Republicans will hold caucuses that day
to pick their White House favorite.
</P>
<P>
   California, characteristically, has the weirdest deal. All
registered voters are eligible to participate in its March 7 GOP
contest. But only the votes of registered Republicans will be used
in determining how the state's 162 delegates are divided.
</P>
<P>
   If current trends hold, McCain could win the popular vote but
Bush could win the lion's share of the delegates. It takes 1,034
delegates to win the nomination. When the voting ends March 7 _ a
week before Texans vote _ 89 delegates will have been awarded.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who might have been able to knock McCain from the race by
beating him by a large margin in Michigan, declined to say he was
disappointed by the missed opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the Republican vote,'' said Bush, ever on
message. ``This is a long process. This is a marathon and I'm going
to be in it all the way to the end. Some primaries you win and
sometimes you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, Ariz., on a night when he won two Republican
primaries, McCain found himself in the peculiar position of making
a ``special plea'' for GOP votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fear this campaign, my fellow Republicans, join it, join
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas government Professor Bruce Buchanan on
Tuesday night acknowledged the strangeness of the process and the
strange turns it has already taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It leaves McCain back in business with some strengths and some
weaknesses,'' he said of the senator's wins in Michigan and
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's muscle is in his ability reach across party lines and
pull in the kinds of voters a candidate needs to win in November.
His weakness is his relative inability to draw votes in his own
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the front-runner is still Governor Bush because of
all the horsepower he has got lined up behind him,'' said Buchanan.
``But McCain has a moment, and the question is whether he can seize
it. I still give our local boy a slight edge.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Michigan Gov. John Engler, Bush's top backer in that
state. Engler doesn't buy the argument that McCain is engaged in an
incredible mission to broaden the GOP's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan used to go try to recruit Democrats to become
Republicans,'' said Engler. ``We've never seen a candidate like
John McCain who went out to rent Democrats for a day to get himself
the nomination.''

ADVERTISING: NEW CAMPAIGN ABOUT ONLINE TRADING HAS TRADITIONAL
MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hype is everywhere: stories about 22-year-old Internet
millionaires, clerks in start-up companies with stockholdings that
rival those of a typical CEO and TV commercials about fortunes made
in online trading.
</P>
<P>
   In short, everyone is getting rich _ except you.
</P>
<P>
   Now a mutual fund company is sounding a big note of caution in a
new advertising campaign. Alliance Capital, which has $368 billion
in assets under management, is showing a series of commercials
using dark humor to depict investors who lose their life savings
after playing the market on their own. Their message is an
old-fashioned one: invest for the future with a long-term strategy
using a financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the advertising behind online day trading _ of guys in
pickup trucks owning islands _ it's like Las Vegas in your living
room and, we felt we needed to make a statement,'' said Richard
Khaleel, Alliance's senior vice president fpr marketing and
advertising. ``There's this feeling that it's easy to make money in
the market, but that's not the experience of users.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-adviser message comes at a time when buying online for a
reduced fee and without using a broker has become the news of the
industry. It has also prompted a huge battle among some 55
companies ranging from old-line brokerage houses to complete
upstarts. Even Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the nation's largest retail
brokerage firm with 14,000 brokers, recently announced a discount
online trading venture.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance has good reason to promote the use of advisers. Its
funds are sold almost exclusively through advisers and major retail
brokers like Merrill Lynch and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of
Citigroup. The funds can be purchased online through a service like
Etrade.com, but the ould still include the fee someone would
pay a broker, said Shira Zackai, an Alliance spokeswoman. ``So it
makes sense to buy it through a broker where you can get advice,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the TV spots show plans going awry after investors put
their money in the wrong stocks. The TV commercials are fictional
to dramatize the risks of going it alone. The company has no hard
evidence showing that people are losing fortunes on bad trades,
although Khaleel said everyone had heard stories to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   One spot, for instance, shows a teenager joyously announcing
that he made it into medical school only to hear his father say, in
a nonchalant way, that he lost his son's college fund by day
trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it'd be fun,'' the father says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about it, honey,'' the mother says. ``You never
looked good in white anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other commercials show elderly people announcing that they
lost their retirement savings. And another shows a little boy whose
parents are renting out his room to offset their losses in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is suggesting all you need is an Internet hook-up to
make a fortune,'' said John Ferrell, president and chief creative
officer of Ferrellcavillo, New York, the Alliance ad agency.
``We're the only contrary voice out there right now that says you
do need some guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Brad Silberling, who is best known for his work for
shows like ``NYPD Blue,'' the campaign depicts the bad investor as
cavalier, even a bit nutty, to get people to chuckle. Inside the
company, the ads are referred to as the ``Investors Behaving
Badly'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't make it humorous, people could just not want to
think about it,'' Ferrell explained.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance came up with the campaign after its own research with
consumers and brokers found that investors were beginning to think
they could make a killing in the market without any help from a
financial expert, Khaleel said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Burke, an online brokerage industry expert with Gomez
Advisers in Lincoln, Mass., an e-commerce research firm, said the
bull market was probably what was enticing some investors away from
mutual funds into what they hope are faster-growing individual
stocks, like technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happening is that some individuals might be
looking more to the equity market, and that's not solely related to
day trading,'' Burke said. ``It's more about going to individual
stocks _ that's the bigger story.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Alliance is trying to deter Internet trading, its own
proprietary research conducted last May by Louis Harris &AMP;
Associates, New York, showed that only 4 percent of the adult
population trades online. And most Americans are not willing to
trade more than $4,500 without consulting an adviser, it found.
</P>
<P>
   The research also pointed to what Khaleel said was an
information overload. The heaviest Internet users were more likely
to consult a professional adviser before making a decision. Over
all, 57 percent polled said they planned to consult an adviser
whether they traded online or not, Khaleel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you have all this information doesn't mean you
know how to make a decision,'' he said. ``You can get so much
information, and can have too many good choices _ that's where a
good adviser can help out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alliance will spend about $15 million on advertising this year,
a 50 percent increase over last year's spending, Khaleel said. The
company increased the budget to promote its important new message,
he said. But, oddly, another reason the budget increased was
because the cost of media have jumped _ partly because of all those
dot-com companies rushing into TV advertising with money from their
initial public offerings.

   THE DEFENDANTS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officer Sean Carroll, 37, a six-year veteran who first noticed
Amadou Diallo standing in his building's vestibule and led the way
up the steps. He fired 16 of the 41 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Edward McMellon, 27, a six-year veteran, also fired 16
shots, falling backward down the steps and continuing to shoot from
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Richard Murphy, 27, a six-year veteran who was behind
them, fired four times after the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Kenneth Boss, 28, an eight-year veteran and the driver,
was the last to leave the car. He fired five shots.
</P>
<P>
   THE CASE FOR CONVICTION
</P>
<P>
   PROSECUTION BASICS: Four days of presentation; 12 witnesses; 28
exhibits, including Diallo's wallet and 41 discarded shell casings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two prosecution witnesses who were on Wheeler Avenue the night
Diallo was shot testified that they did not hear the officers say
anything to Diallo before the shooting began. Three prosecution
witnesses testified that there was a pause in the shooting, raising
the possibility that the officers had time to reassess the
situation during the fusillade.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dr. Joseph Cohen, a former New York City medical examiner,
testified that one of the first of 19 shots that struck Diallo hit
him in the chest, piercing his aortic arch and spine, which would
have instantly paralyzed him and dropped him to the ground. Thus
one shot _ traveling up the calf _ definitely hit Diallo as he was
on the ground, Cohen testified, and two others may have.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least four witnesses who were at the scene _ including two
police officials _ testified that the vestibule at 1157 Wheeler
Ave. was reasonably well lit, undermining the defense's claim that
the officers could not clearly see Diallo's actions or his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   _ During cross-examination of the four officers, prosecutors
established that Diallo was not committing a crime when the
officers stopped him, and that they did not consider the
possibility that he lived at 1157 Wheeler Ave. or did not
understand their commands.
</P>
<P>
   THE CASE FOR ACQUITTAL:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE BASICS: Nearly five days of presentation; 19 witnesses,
including the four officers; 26 exhibits, including Diallo's right
sneaker and the 40-watt lightbulb from the vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   _ Schrrie Elliott, who was walking down Wheeler Avenue when the
shooting began, testified that she heard an officer yell ``gun''
before the shooting started, bolstering the defense's claim that
the officers truly feared being shot.
</P>
<P>
   _ A wound ballistics expert and a medical examiner testified
that they believed the shot to Diallo's chest was one of the last
to strike him, after he had sustained 15 or 16 wounds to his left
side. They said that one or none of the bullets struck him while he
was on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   _ A former New York City police officer and criminologist who
customarily testifies against police officers testified that the
officers were following their training in deciding to approach
Diallo for an investigatory stop and were correct to pursue him
into the vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   _ In strikingly consistent, often emotional accounts, the four
officers gave their first public version of the shooting. In sum,
they said Diallo had acted suspiciously, that they identified
themselves, that Diallo had refused their requests to show them his
hands, that he appeared to be digging in his waist with his unseen
right hand, that the vestibule was dimly lit, that they mistook his
black wallet for a gun, that they incorrectly thought an officer
who had fallen had been shot, that Diallo had stayed upright until
the final shot had been fired.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE'S RULINGS:
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed to prosecution and defense requests to have the
jury consider charges less than murder, including criminally
negligent homicide, which could be punished with as little as
probation. The judge also decided to tell the jury that police
officers are justified in using deadly physical force to defend
themselves or another person if they are in the course of making an
arrest or preventing an escape from custody. This was viewed as a
victory for the defense.

MURRAY BERNSTEIN, MANHATTAN STURGEON KING, DIES AT 87
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., N.Y., Conn., N.J., Colo.)   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Murray Bernstein, who took a narrow store on Broadway
and turned it into Murray's Sturgeon Shop, a legendary Upper West
Side purveyor of salmon and sable, caviar and camaraderie, died
Monday at a nursing home in Lauderhill, Fla. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Limousines would line up in front of the store, and it regularly
shipped sturgeon and other delicacies overseas. But its heart and
soul were in the ready smile and deft cutting stroke of Bernstein.
His own life epitomized a neighborhood of immigrants, many of them
Jewish, who had known and expected struggle. He remained active in
the grocery workers' union even after he became a store owner,
worked six days a week and never took a single vacation.
</P>
<P>
   His ambitions were sturgeon-size (a beluga sturgeon can weigh
half a ton). ``He had grandiose plans for making the best smoked
fish in the world,'' said his daughter, Cecile Rivel. ``He was a
perfectionist.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Rudin, a member of the New York real estate family, began
coming by in 1950 and remembers the sturgeon shop as a sort of
lodge where the regulars would nosh on pieces of salmon and bagels
between shots of ice-cold vodka. Rudin's wife Rebecca asked
Bernstein to bless the couple's marriage, which lasted until her
death 35 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's Sturgeon Shop, which looked like a jewel box with its
large mirrors and stainless steel, became a place where real estate
magnates and politicians would bump into policemen and shopkeepers.
Show business personalities like Zero Mostel and Sammy Cahn were
regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have been a fish slicer, but he was a very sage
fellow,'' Rudin said of Bernstein. ``He knew his product. He knew
his customers. He ran a clubhouse there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein was born on Feb. 14, 1913, in Poland, and came to New
York as a teen-ager to escape anti-Semitic violence. In 1932, he
met the woman who would become his wife, Nettie Katz, through a
friend, Albert Newman. He and Newman went to Montreal, where the
prospective bride was living, for the introduction. They married
three days later, and returned to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein worked mainly in grocery stores, but as the Depression
deepened in the early 1930s, he lost job after job and was
unemployed for an entire year. But in 1945, Bernstein was able to
buy his first store, at Broadway and 89th Street, from the same
Newman who had helped arrange his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, his brother Sam became a co-owner. Sam died
in 1977. In the late 1940s the store moved to its current location,
2429 Broadway, at 90th Street.
</P>
<P>
   When Bernstein took over, the store sold some fish but
specialized in candy and nuts. The Bernsteins concentrated on fish,
and set out to popularize smoked fish in the European tradition at
a time when many Americans who lived beyond New York didn't know
nova from lox. It was hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Sturgeon, the specialty of the house, may produce caviar, but
its pearly saline flesh is loved for itself by connoisseurs of
smoked fish. Murray's had some of the finest, each customer's order
immaculately sliced with surgical skill. The slicing board was
hospital clean, and the store held no odor of fish. Murray's sable,
the silky smoked codfish known as the poor man's sturgeon, was
legendary, too.
</P>
<P>
   Early each Tuesday and Thursday morning, Bernstein could be
heard negotiating with his smoked-fish suppliers in a loud voice.
``This is not acceptable,'' his daughter remembers him saying,
again and again. ``This has to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   She said he would regularly return a third of the fish, and then
demand that it be replaced the same day. He believed that the
customer was always right, and that included himself.
</P>
<P>
   The diligence paid off. The food critic Craig Claiborne said the
store was ``perhaps the finest in the city.'' New York magazine,
calling it the ``Tiffany of smoked-fish stores,'' likened Murray
and Sam Bernstein's carving skills to that of the heart surgeon
Christian Barnaard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the Bernsteins sold the store to Artie Cutler, a
restaurateur. As Cutler's empire of Manhattan restaurants like
Ollie's and Carmine's expanded, he sold the sturgeon shop to Ira
Goller in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   One day, a year after Bernstein's wife Nettie died in 1990, he
was talking to Florence, the widow of his nephew. She had been a
widow for 18 years, and the two, who had known each other for 43
years, were discussing how lonely they felt. He immediately
proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father doesn't take long,'' Rivel said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and daughter, who lives in Weston,
Conn., he is survived by a sister, Ann Fortune of Clifton, N.J.; a
son, William, of Westminster, Colo.; five grandchildren; and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein remained active in the grocery store union even during
his Florida retirement. He always refused to open an Upper East
Side branch, though many of his customers had moved across town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt it wouldn't be the same,'' Rivel said. ``It wouldn't
have had his personal touch.''

<P>
   The Oracle Corp.'s chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison,
announced the formation and spinoff Tuesday of a new business to
capitalize on the industrywide push to make the Internet accessible
over wireless phones and other portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be known as Oraclemobile.com, will be headed
by Denise Lahey, Oracle's former vice president for mobile
products. Ellison said the company would create partnerships with
electronic commerce sites like Amazon.com or Travelocity to help
translate their Web pages and transaction software into products
accessible on cellular phones and personal organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The company is joining a rush already under way to develop
technology to make Internet access viable on wireless devices so
that people can trade stocks, obtain driving directions, buy books
or music, and conduct similar transactions wherever they happen to
be.
</P>
<P>
   That effort was given added fuel Tuesday as Texas Instruments
introduced a microprocessor intended for cellular phones called the
C55x, which is faster yet uses less power than other processors now
available and should thus extend the battery life to several days.
Texas Instruments said large cellular telephone makers, including
Nokia and Ericsson were planning to use the chip, which is
scheduled for shipment later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is going to have a cell phone, and every cell phone
is going to have Internet access,'' Ellison said at a news
conference. ``By 2002, a lot more cellular phones are going to have
Internet access than PCs.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Ellison predicted the death of the personal
computer by 2000, and the emergence in its place of inexpensive,
ubiquitous ``network computers'' that could call up personal
information anywhere in the world over the Internet. Having missed
his mark in 1996, Ellison Tuesday positioned his new effort as a
sort of revised vision of a post-personal computer world.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle will face competitors already seeking different pieces of
the wireless Web market. For example, Microstrategy in Vienna, Va.,
offers consumer- and business-based content for mobile devices, and
Phone.com, in Redwood City, Calif., has technology for translating
Web pages for wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle's plan differs by being more comprehensive than any
single competitor's technology. What all these companies share,
industry analysts say, are substantial challenges in making rich,
colorful Web content easy to read and navigate on mobile devices,
which are hampered by small screens, slow speeds for gaining access
to data and limited battery life.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking standard keyboards, they also make it hard for users to
enter requests for information. Oracle will provide software to
make it easier and less expensive for e-commerce sites to
automatically translate their content for use on a variety of
wireless devices, Lahey said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Redman, associate director of the Yankee Group, a
Boston-based technology research and consulting firm, said it
remained to be seen whether Oracle would really be able to
automatically translate rich, textured Web pages into bare-bones
content for mobile devices.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he and other analysts said they saw Oracle's entry into
the market as an important endorsement of the concept. ``The fact
that Oracle is doing this is significant,'' said Berge Ayvazian,
chief executive of the Yankee Group. ``The mobile hand set and
mobile device is likely to be the point-of-sale terminal of
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee Group projects that by the end of this year, 15
million phones in the United States will be able to use the
Internet, rising to 150 million by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle opened a Web site Tuesday, www.oramobil.com, featuring
content ready for mobile devices from some of its initial partners.
The name ``oraclemobile.com'' is owned by someone Ellison described
as a ``squatter,'' but he promised that Oracle would get that Web
address ``very shortly.''

MICROSOFT INSISTS IT BROKE NO LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In hours of legal rhetoric capping 16 months of
courtroom wrangling, Microsoft Tuesday told a federal judge that it
broke no laws to become the dominant seller of operating-system
software for Intel-based computers.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, representing the Justice Department and 19 states
who brought the federal antitrust case against Microsoft argued
``It is simply impossible to imagine'' that the Redmond software
company hadn't violated the nation's laws against anticompetitive
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who in November 1999 declared in
harsh language that Microsoft is a monopolist, may rule by as early
as April whether the company's monopolistic acts broke the law.
Then, in separate proceedings, he'll determine what punishment, if
any, is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   While, by some accounts Tuesday, it appeared the government's
case held the upper hand, Microsoft did not yield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law supports Microsoft's position in this case,'' said
John Warden, Microsoft's lead attorney, at the conclusion of the
arguments. ``The government has failed to prove any market impact
of any acts by Microsoft. ... Microsoft's actions resulted in
greater innovation, lower prices and better quality. The creation
of commerce itself cannot violate the Sherman Antitrust Act.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge gave Microsoft little comfort. At one point Tuesday,
he dismissed a key Microsoft defense by comparing the company to
John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil monopoly, the subject of the
first major antitrust case, in 1906, that resulted in a breakup of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really see a distinction,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   At times, rhetoric in the ceremonial courtroom at the E. Barrett
Prettyman Court House was mind-numbingly arcane. And it ran far
longer than its scheduled three and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
   But several legal experts said questions the unusually
vociferous Jackson posed hinted at the issues that may most heavily
influence the case's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are at least five separate antitrust allegations
before him in the case, Jackson focused on two: whether Microsoft's
copyright on its Windows software excused its behavior under
federal antitrust law, and whether Microsoft unlawfully tied the
sale of Internet Explorer to that of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings of fact, issued in November 1999, strongly
suggest he views the fact Microsoft integrated its Internet
Explorer browser with its Windows operating system as a tying
arrangement. That's unlawful under the antitrust laws. That point
is one of Microsoft's most vulnerable spots, said Glen Manishin, a
McLean, Va., antitrust specialist.
</P>
<P>
   But Warden argued Microsoft has done no wrong, because the
integration benefits consumers. He asserted a June 1998 appellate
ruling to that effect in the Microsoft case, which reversed a
holding by Jackson, is binding on Jackson in these proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you read the Court of Appeals' decision as controlling on
me about this?'' Jackson asked Warden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, if there's a plausible benefit, I read it that way,''
Warden answered.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court for the D.C. Circuit in June 1998 found
combining Windows with the Internet Explorer browser did ``some
plausible good,'' and that's all that's required to survive an
antitrust claim, Warden said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson questioned Boies closely on the tying issue. Boies
argued that Microsoft's decision was not really a product design
decision, but more a mere ``bolting'' together of the browser and
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Boies was trying to recast the tying charge as a
contract restriction _ that is, PC makers who wanted Windows had to
take its Internet Explorer browsing software whether they wanted it
or not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jackson appeared to be skeptical. What about the benefit,
he asked Boies, of the increased distribution of browser technology
resulting from Microsoft's decision to fold its browser into
Windows? ``I can't offset that _ one plausible benefit,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lande, a law professor at the University of Baltimore,
said he noted Jackson taking careful notes whenever the tying issue
was addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very complex issue, and very, very important to the
case. I don't think the judge understood it at first,'' Lande said.
</P>
<P>
   As another tactic to persuade Jackson that it is blameless,
Microsoft asserted that its copyright in Windows shields it from
antitrust liability for forbidding computer makers from changing
the number and placement of icons on Windows-based machines and the
computers' boot-up sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Warden denied that he was claiming copyright law prevails over
antitrust law. But then he cited a federal district court ruling
that once a copyright has been acquired, subsequent conduct under
copyright law ``cannot give rise to any liability under antitrust
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as a copyright holder asserts only its rights to the
copyright and doesn't extend them to another market, immunity from
antitrust exists?'' asked Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a good working proposition,'' Warden answered.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kovacic, an antitrust expert at George Washington law
school in Washington, D.C., said there is no caselaw directly on
this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the judge is troubled by it,'' Kovacic said. ``I don't
think it's easy to conclude how he feels about these issues, but
it's clear he is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Other potential bases for Microsoft's antitrust liability in the
case include predatory pricing, exclusionary agreements, and
threats to withhold information from partners.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Microsoft and the government concluded this phase of the
trial, their representatives are continuing to meet in Chicago in
search of a settlement, in mediation talks overseen by Richard A.
Posner, chief judge of the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The
two sides reportedly remain far apart, but government officials
note that the fact they are still meeting at this late date
suggests a willingness on both sides to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to work hard with Judge Posner,'' said
William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The court is likely to hold separate hearings on remedies if, as
expected, Jackson rules that Microsoft violated antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   A strong verdict against Microsoft could well lead to harsh
sanctions against the company, including breaking it up. If,
however, Jackson agrees with some of the government's legal
allegations but rejects others, the sanctions against Microsoft
could be less severe, prohibiting it from some practices but
leaving the company intact.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Justice Department and state attorneys general
pressing the case insist they will not settle for a mild sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remedies have to be drastic and far reaching,'' Richard
Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut and one of the
plaintiffs, said Tuesday night.
</P>

PRIMARY WINS BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO McCAIN CAMPAIGN 
 
(Eds.: This is an analysis) 
(Eds: Optional ending included) 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Democrats and independents in Michigan handed John
McCain a double-edged sword on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They breathed new life into his race for the Republican
presidential nomination but left the Arizona senator open to
renewed attacks that he isn't his own party's real choice for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it means for McCain is a few more weeks of staying in the
fight and keeping hope alive for his troops out in the field,''
said University of Texas at Austin government professor Bruce
Buchanan, a specialist in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said McCain's victory in Michigan and his easy win in
his home state of Arizona, which also held a primary Tuesday, also
may give McCain another boost in fund-raising before the March 7
Super Tuesday lineup of primaries in New York, California and
several other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's got a major task ahead of him to try to convince
Republicans who will dominate most of the rest of the primaries
that he is conservative enough to be their nominee,'' Buchanan
added.
</P>
<P>
   L. Tucker Gibson, a political science professor at Trinity
University in San Antonio, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said McCain's support among Democrats and independents
may suggest that the senator ``doesn't have much depth of support
in the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls indicated that as few as 49 percent of voters in
Michigan's Republican primary were actually Republicans. Some 33
percent were independents, and 18 percent were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush won as much as two-thirds of the Republican vote.
But McCain, who had wooed Democrats and independents, beat Bush 2-1
among independents and captured more than 80 percent of Democrats'
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler, Bush's Michigan chairman, said that McCain,
unlike former Republican President Reagan, didn't try to recruit
Democrats into the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen a candidate like John McCain who goes out to
rent Democrats for a day to win the Republican nomination,'' Engler
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to hurt him in some of the Republican states coming
up.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in his victory statement in Phoenix, defended his
Republican credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a proud Reagan conservative. I love the Republican party.
It is my home,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reformers; Republican reformers who can make our party
bigger and change politics in this country for generations. Don't
fear this campaign, my fellow Republicans. Join it.''
</P>
<P>
   In taking a swipe at Bush without mentioning him by name, McCain
said that Michigan had ``sent a powerful message across America, a
message that our party wants real reform from the real reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Todd Harris said Engler had ``absolutely
nothing'' on which to base his comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Engler is doing everything he can to avoid the shame and
embarrassment of his firewall state getting tip-toed over by Sen.
McCain,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Koopman, a government professor at Calvin College in Grand
Rapids, Mich., said McCain wisely campaigned in areas of the state
Sunday and Monday where the Republican establishment's influence
was weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demographically, this is not South Carolina,'' Koopman said,
comparing Michigan to the state where Bush, aided by the GOP
establishment, scored a big victory over McCain on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Michigan) Republican Party is not John Engler's party to
do with as he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said McCain benefited from an effort by some Democrats
to cross party lines so that they could embarrass Engler by voting
against Bush. But, he added, McCain also won the votes of many
Democrats and independents simply because he reached out to them,
and they were attracted by his maverick style and reform message.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan said Bush is still the front-runner for the GOP
nomination, in large part because McCain, by attracting so many
Democratic and independent voters, has made his nomination task
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   A major test for the Arizona senator, Buchanan added, will come
March 7 in delegate-rich California. Although anyone can vote in
that state's primary, only the votes of Republicans will count
toward delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said McCain also will need to improve his fund-raising
and campaign organizations in upcoming primary states to remain
competitive with the better-funded and better-organized Bush.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the professor added, Bush likely will renew his
attacks on McCain's Republican support, much as he did in South
Carolina after independents helped the senator win the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, the Trinity University political scientist, said McCain
may be in ``real trouble'' in states that have closed primaries or
that choose their nominating delegates in conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But, Gibson added, McCain's second and third primary victories
also could bode ill for Bush. Party regulars ``who thought that
this (the nomination) was an easy run are going to get very anxious
about this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, he said, is going to have to work to avoid any
``attrition'' of his party organization, including defectors of key
endorsements to McCain.

HOW ART'S MEANING DRIFTS WITH THE TIDES OF HISTORY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Ken Shulman's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about the
artist May Stevens.  
 By KEN SHULMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. _ The piece is called ``The Wild Man,'' and
it comes from a late-14th-century choir stall in Cologne, Germany.
Human in form but animal in its sculptured curly hide, the 11}-inch
oak figure is a denizen of the medieval imagination.
</P>
<P>
   For Germans in the Middle Ages, this figure, seen in its
ecclesiastical setting, evoked the fond myth of the German people
descending from a land of rural tribesmen in prelapsarian synthesis
with nature. For Germans in the 1930s, ``The Wild Man,'' isolated
and abstract in its Bauhaus-style museum case, appealed to other
sentiments, including a visceral resentment of Christianity that
was channeled into bellicosity and a hatred of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of context is what this show is all about,'' said Nancy
Netzer, director of the McMullen Museum of Art at Boston College.
Netzer is one of five Boston College professors who organized the
show ``Fragmented Devotion: Medieval Objects From the Schnutgen
Museum in Cologne,'' which opened at the McMullen Museum earlier
this month and is there through May 22. ``We are trying to
demonstrate that an artwork has no single meaning, that meaning is
always dependent on context.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fragmented Devotion'' includes 62 objects of medieval
religious art drawn from the collection of Alexander Schnutgen, a
Cologne priest who in 1906 donated his extensive collection of late
medieval Christian art to the museum that bears his name. The
exhibition is intended to compel the viewer to consider how an
object's original meaning can be altered _ and in some cases
dangerously subverted _ by the manner in which it is displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Netzer and her colleagues have recomposed three distinct
historical moments in the lives of these objects: ``The Middle
Ages,'' in which crucifixes, chalices, chasubles, monstrances and
reliquaries are deployed in settings resembling public and private
medieval devotional spaces; ``Fragments of Fragments,'' a stylized
reconstruction of late-19th-century collections, like Schnutgen's,
in which the same objects are displayed on crowded shelves and
bookcases and classified according to function or theme; and
``Museum Installation: The 1930s,'' a room that recreates the
abstract, art-historical exhibition style of Weimar Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The three historical contexts are visibly different. Yet in
keeping with the show's theme, each represents an age's attempt to
construct a spiritual or philosophical unity from a series of
disconnected historical fragments. The typical medieval devotional
space, where religious functions were celebrated, was animated with
images of far-flung saints and often with fragments of their
martyred bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Even the medieval Mass, the central ritual in the Roman Catholic
faith, was a ceremonial reweaving of certain fragmented elements in
the life of Jesus, most notably the Last Supper.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the medieval devotional scheme was not seen at the time
as being fragmented or reassembled. ``Medieval believers had a way
of looking at fragments and then deducing the entire saint,'' said
Virginia Reinburg, a professor of European religious history at
Boston College and one of the show's curators. ``They were aware
that these saints' bodies had been disturbed, and believed that
their holy power was now dispersed through these relics. Regarding
the Catholic Mass, it may indeed be a patchwork of biblical and
pre-Christian fragments. But when ordinary people went to Mass in
the middle ages, they saw that Mass as seamless.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, the social disorientation caused by
industrialization and war generated a widespread desire for
spiritual renewal in much of Europe. At the same time, the
destruction of ecclesiastical institutions following the Napoleonic
wars made the troves of medieval religious collections available to
individual collectors, casting them, in the words of Netzer, ``like
spores into the vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnutgen began collecting after attending an auction of
religious paintings in 1867, when he realized that sacred art could
easily lose its religious value in a secular context. His motto was
``colligite fragmenta ne pereant'' _ collect these fragments so
they do not perish. For decades, he kept the objects in crowded
rooms at his Cologne residence at Margarthenkloster 7. Schnutgen
had no training in the history of art. His interest in the objects
was spiritual and nostalgic; these were his fragments, shored
against the ruins of his devotional world.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century section of the Boston College show does not
quite attain the clutter of Schnutgen's overburdened home. But it
does capture the spirit of longing _ and fear _ that propelled
Schnutgen and other collectors into their conservation quests. It
also captures the self-deception inherent in those clerics and
collectors who sought refuge from a bewildering industrialized
present in a romanticized vision of the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   The identification with medieval forms as an expression of piety
was so widespread that in 1913 the archdiocese of Cologne mandated
that all new churches be built in the neo-Gothic style.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That Gothic is a predominant style in the architecture of many
colleges and universities _ including Boston College _ repeats the
equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both medieval and 19th-century faithful loved allegory,'' said
Patricia DeLeeuw, a medieval church historian at Boston College and
another curator of the show. ``But the medieval faithful truly
believed that the symbols and objects surrounding them were
representations of greater teachings. The 19th century strikes me
as more nostalgic and less real, as if they were trying to
allegorize themselves into a world that no longer existed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, the Schnutgen collection was moved from the Museum of
Applied Arts in Cologne into the cloisters of the Church of St.
Heribert in Deutz, which is across the Rhine. Deutz is also the
community where most of Cologne's Jewish population took up
residence after they were expelled from Cologne in 1424.
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition, across five centuries, is somewhat ironic if,
as Netzer and her colleagues suggest, the 1930s Bauhaus style of
the Schnutgen collection helped legitimize the brutal bigotry of
the National Socialist regime.
</P>
<P>
   In Deutz, where the Schnutgen Museum currently resides, the
objects from the priest's collection were exhibited according to
20th-century museum canons. No longer were Schnutgen's fragments
perceived as portals into a world of spirit, or as the shattered
archaeology of a more pious, vanished world. Stripped of function,
mounted on pedestals, these sculptures, censers, portable altars
and rosary beads took on a new incarnation as things to be looked
at.
</P>
<P>
   The only devotional scheme the Bauhaus display supported was the
relatively new discipline of art history, which at the time strove
toward the charting of an orderly, triumphant evolution of style.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the complete erasure of context left these objects open to a
broader spectrum of interpretations, which were in turn open to
exploitation by forces including National Socialism. Statues like
``The Wild Man'' and the 15-inch marble ``Moses'' from the Cologne
Cathedral, both on display in the show's Bauhaus section, reminded
some of the suffering and spiritually restless inhabitants of
Weimar Germany that Christianity had been thrust upon them by Rome,
that this faith _ this womanizing, passive, defeatist faith, as
they saw it _ had had its origins in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   These sentiments, and others, may have funneled the German
desire for spiritual leadership into the adoration of a belligerent
despot, and distorted the Germans' need for transcendence into a
national obsession with death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still asking ourselves what was so weak in
Christianity,'' said the Rev. James Bernauer, another curator of
``Fragmented Devotion.'' A professor of philosophy at Boston
College and a Jesuit priest, Bernauer has written widely on the
Holocaust. ``How did it get so deflected into this militaristic
Christianity?'' he went on. ``There is a liturgical, ritual
dimension to National Socialism, a cloying type of spiritual energy
that people evidently needed in their lives. But even so, we don't
understand why this Nazi thing didn't seem stranger than it did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Third Reich clearly understood the incipient power of
fragments, and was masterly in manipulating them. In ``Inside the
Third Reich,'' Albert Speer, Hitler's architect, recalled how he
often presented Hitler with sketches of their never-built Berlin as
it might look to future generations when it lay in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   He writes that he decided to avoid using reinforced concrete in
Reich buildings in order not to leave a rusty legacy of twisted
metal bars. It was the ultimate perversion of meaning, a fragmented
deception conceived for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fragmented Devotion'' hardly implies that the symbolic looting
of Schnutgen's collection led directly to the Holocaust. The show
instead illustrates the process of linguistic abuse, in which
objects are first dismembered, then disenfranchised and then used
to stimulate an atavistic reflex that can compel a people in myriad
directions, including that of collective folly.

ON STATEN ISLAND, THE NEW MEDIA ARE THE MESSAGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Eisenman's design for the Staten Island
Institute of Arts and Sciences brings into focus a theme that has
preoccupied him in recent years: the relationship between the
history of places and the history of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The $65 million project, which partly straddles the St. George
terminal of the Staten Island ferry, is a favorite of the borough
president, Guy V. Molinari. The building will house a new branch of
the Staten Island Institute, called the Center for Electronic
Culture, and will feature displays on the new media that are
helping to bring a global culture into being.
</P>
<P>
   Situated near the mouth of New York Harbor, the center will
honor a city that began to expand the circulation of Western ideas
more than three centuries ago. It offers a microcosmic version of
the global forces that are reshaping the contemporary urban
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums today use advanced media technology in the
presentation of shows, the creation of Web sites, the expansion of
programs outside the museum's stone and mortar walls. At the Center
for Electronic Culture, these new media become the message.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the center include these exciting upgrades: an
Infohall, described as an electronic town square, with games,
projections and other media attractions; a museum, featuring five
long, serpentine galleries with interpretative displays, along with
a library, bookstore and cafeteria, and an Industrial Documentary
Center, with research stations for new developments in high-tech
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Now, check out these deflating downgrades: our central cities
and their architecture, an ancient communications medium that will
remain with us so long as people don't tire of ruins. There's no
longer any doubt that cities, buildings and interiors are being
rapidly affected by new media.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Castels, the urban theorist, has charted what he calls
the space of flows, the global network through which information
and money are transmitted in ever-shifting patterns without regard
for traditional boundaries of city, state and nation. Tourism is
the social equivalent of this electronic space. The tourist
attraction is one of its architectural devices. The Center for
Electronic Culture will be a new attraction for a city that
increasingly relies on tourism to shore up its economic base.
Eisenman's design gives the space of flows an architectural shape.
</P>
<P>
   The center is integrated with the ferry terminal building and
the transportation systems that converge there: boats, trains,
buses, cars as well as the parking lots, roads, platforms and piers
that serve them. The center's most conspicuous form is a large
rotunda, made of intersecting, twisted, tapering oblongs, which
rises 44 feet above ground level.
</P>
<P>
   The curving shapes recall the sculptures of Clement Meadmore,
while the building skin, slit with openings for skylights, will
remind some viewers of the steel and concrete roof designed by Eero
Saarinen for his Trans World Airlines terminal at Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Saarinen or Meadmore, however, Eisenman asserts that he
arrives at his forms by a systematic design process. The process
starts by draping a two-dimensional grid over the site. The grid
assumes the contour of the site's topography. It is then
superimposed with shapes derived from the transportation systems:
ferry lanes, train platforms, bus ramps and so on. These shapes are
extended into three dimensions and then packed with the building's
program: galleries, library, cafeteria, offices and anything else
that fits.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there's a certain amount of gimmickry, not to say
hocus-pocus, involved in this process. The point is that, once
again, Eisenman has convinced himself of the logical basis for his
forms. They are not to be seen as willful, Expressionist shapes but
as emanations of a site, its natural topography and its patterns of
social use, frozen in architectural form.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the design bears no resemblance to contextualism, in
the customary sense of the term. Unlike the 1992 design by Venturi,
Scott Brown for the Manhattan terminal of the Staten Island ferry,
for example, Eisenman's plan does not mimic the surfaces of
adjacent or prior structures. Rather, it links the specifics of its
physical location to the larger grid of Western ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenman has been using this design method at least since 1982,
when he designed the Wexner Center for Art in Columbus, Ohio. In
that project, the particulars of place are represented on an
organizing grid derived from the city's street system and the
partial reconstruction of an old armory building that had once
occupied the site.
</P>
<P>
   The history of ideas is represented by the expansion of the grid
into an abstract, three-dimensional form of white painted steel.
This form, which resembles a scaffold, contains the Wexner's
gallery spaces. It signifies the classic framework of Cartesian
thought.
</P>
<P>
   The scaffold also brings to mind the roughly contemporaneous
work by Sol Lewitt and is thus a clear indication of the source for
Eisenman's topographical method of design. Like Lewitt, Eisenman is
a Conceptual artist, but one who happens to work in the
architectural field.
</P>
<P>
   Like Frank Gehry, who has derived inspiration from Robert
Rauschenberg, Ellsworth Kelly and other artists, Eisenman has drawn
architecture into a wider frame of cultural reference. This is a
natural move for architects of cultural institutions, and one that
should be welcomed by those who esteem Beaux Arts edifices for
incorporating painting and sculpture into their designs. In this
sense, Eisenman's Staten Island project must be seen as a
legitimate heir to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York
Public Library and other landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since Eisenman is our foremost anti-Classicist, this line of
descent is not easily apparent. Nor is Eisenman's work routinely
discussed in the context of Conceptual Art. This is partly a result
of the gap that divides architecture from other art forms, and
partly a result of the modern attachment to originality.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenman himself is hardly innocent of this attachment. He has
always wanted it both ways. He likes to startle viewers with novel
forms and with claims that his projects are helping to undermine
the grand Western tradition. At the same time, he is possessed by a
deeply conservative craving to belong to that tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he's entitled to have it both ways. Even so, the
contradiction needs to be clarified. Eisenman is what used to be
called a New York Intellectual. But he's working at a time when
that species has become nearly extinct. There is, for now, no
community of informed opinion to give his work either support or
ctive resistance.
</P>
<P>
   If there were such a community, the Conceptual roots of
Eisenman's architecture would be less obscure, and his forms would
appear less startling. He would not have been branded a theorist
nor would the audience for his work been largely confined to
academia. In fact, the principal interest of importing
Conceptualism into architecture lies with the potential to extend
that movement's intellectual framework beyond the art world
cloister into the larger public realm.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenman is not the only contemporary architect who draws on or
parallels Conceptual themes. A significant strain of contemporary
architecture comes out of what Harold Rosenberg called the
dematerialization of the art object. John Hejduk, Diller and
Scofidio, Bernard Tschumi, Lebbeus Woods, Neil Denari and others
have created memorable projects relying on conventional building
materials. The emerging generation of computer-based architects are
Conceptualists, whether they're aware of it or not.
</P>
<P>
   This work stands in a critical relationship to the conventions
of mainstream practice, but it also reveals the extent to which
even traditional architecture is conceptually based. Architects
produce ideas, plans, blueprints _ concepts _ that, like Lewitt
wall paintings, will be realized by others: executive architects,
space planners, construction companies and such.
</P>
<P>
   The completed building, in turn, takes on an expanded life in
the mediated form of published drawings, photographs and other
images (like those published here). At both ends, that is to say,
architecture is a medium of consciousness. It can transform our
inner as well as our outer landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptual art is thus an ideal form for reckoning with the
pressures of globalization. The space of flows does not reside
solely in software, streams of electrons, and pixels on a screen.
It also exists in the realm of information and ideas. It lives,
that is to say, in the head. Architecture like Eisenman's
capitalizes on information as the international currency of the
global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The design vocabulary of the Staten Island project _ the grid,
the diagrammatic abstraction _ points to another consequence of
globalization: our increasing awareness of the distinctiveness of
Western thought. In the emerging global culture, the West has begun
to look at itself with an anthropologist's eye.
</P>
<P>
   We walk down streets full of buildings, advertisements, fashions
and window displays designed to appeal to normal tastes, and say to
ourselves: ``How weird! Somebody thought of that.'' Seen in this
way, Eisenman's Staten Island design does not seem weird at all.
Mediating between places and ideas is a natural, even an essential
function for architecture to take on in changing times.
</P>
<P>
   New York intellectual life was created by immigrants, and the
global network made possible by tourism and the media has gone far
toward compensating for its erosion. As an enduring cultural
center, New York deserves a place where this history can be told.
Thanks to the Staten Island Institute, we will have one.

TRINIDAD ATTEMPTS TO DIM DE LA HOYA'S SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Felix Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya were in Manhattan
Tuesday, each doing his own thing. The proximity was not by
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad was working out at the Church Street Gym trying to drum
up attention for his bout in Las Vegas on March 3 against David
Reid, the World Boxing Association superwelterweight champion.
Trinidad was hoping his presence would take a little attention away
from De La Hoya, who fights Derrell Coley on Saturday night at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad's presence only begged the question of why he was
fighting Reid instead of setting up a rematch against De La Hoya,
whom he defeated in a controversial decision Sept. 18 in Las Vegas
to win the World Boxing Council welterweight title.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was simple and readily available from the two people
who should know: Trinidad's promoter, Don King, and De La Hoya's
promoter, Bob Arum. King was with his man at the Church Street Gym,
while Arum was holding court with reporters at The Friars Club for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   King and Arum, rivals who have feuded for years, took turns
trying to kill each other's coming fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fight is a nothing fight,'' King said of the De La
Hoya-Coley match. ``It doesn't segue into anything. He has nothing
after this. The fight Tito is fighting is a something fight. He's
fighting a world champion with a gold medal. There's no upside for
De La Hoya. The guy he's fighting is a bum.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum threw cold water on Trinidad-Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not chortling,'' Arum said. ``It's a lot like a guy who
breaks up with a woman and rushes into another affair without
thinking. It generally ends up a big disaster. King's losses in
this fight will be the biggest losses in the history of boxing.
He's going to lose between $6 million to $7 million.''
</P>
<P>
   King said if he loses money, he loses money. He said he would
need about 400,000 pay-per-view buys on Showtime Event Television
to break even.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the fight, and I'm going on with it,'' King said.
``Money is incidental to me in this. When we knock out Oscar, I'll
make up for it.''
</P>
<P>
   King has presented a rematch deal to Arum that he thinks will
work. King's proposal has De La Hoya and Trinidad each making $20
million and fighting at a catch weight, possibly 150 pounds (3
pounds over the welterweight limit). King said that under his plan,
De La Hoya could keep the WBC welterweight championship belt win or
lose. Trinidad doesn't want to have to fight at welterweight again,
because he is having trouble making the weight.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said they talked about the deal two weeks ago and it seems
workable. He said if they could reach an agreement, the fighters
could be in the ring for a rematch on June 17. That is the date
that De La Hoya had reserved for Sugar Shane Mosley, but Arum
hasn't been able to reach an agreement with Jack Mosley, the
fighter's father, manager and trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he has not discussed King's proposal with De La Hoya,
who has been concentrating on the Coley fight. He said he would
talk to him about it once De La Hoya gets past Coley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the only issue is the weight and I can't
speak to that,'' Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The economic issues have all been addressed. I said
we wanted the fight at Mandalay Bay, because we're loyal to them.
King wanted the fight at Caesars. Dr. Ghanem said the fight would
be at Caesars and a third fight would be at Mandalay Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elias Ghanem is the chairman of the Nevada State Athletic
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing both King and Arum readily agreed on is that
Trinidad and De La Hoya have to win their respective coming bouts
to keep this shaky rematch deal from falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that if this guy doesn't fight Trinidad, then he is
truly Chicken De La Hoya, and no one should support him,'' King
said.
</P>
<P>
   King Clears the Air
</P>
<P>
   Don King said he doesn't understand how the FBI can be chasing
him for making payoffs to the International Boxing Federation while
other promoters and managers have admitted to federal authorities
that they made bribes to advance their fighters in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got about five or six confessors,'' King said. ``How do
they look past the confessors and look for the ghost?''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had ever paid a bribe to the IBF to have one of
his fighters ranked, King said: ``No. No. No. No. No. No.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of making financial contributions to the various boxing
sanctioning organizations, King said he treats them as he treats
the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get goods and services without paying your taxes,''
King said. ``I don't look for tax loopholes. I pay what I owe. I
paid $34 million in taxes, and I sent out a release to tell
everyone that I had paid my taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum was one of the people who gave affidavits to the FBI
detailing what he knew about bribes to the IBF for rankings. Arum
said he has never made a payoff to any sanctioning organization for
a ranking.

 &HT;    McCain proves ignoring center can be risky
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the past decade, presidential politics has pivoted
around the man in the middle, and Tuesday's results from Michigan
and Arizona confirm that the pattern is being repeated this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, and with more modest results in 1996, the man in the
middle was Ross Perot, with his wry denunciations of both the
Democrats and the Republicans. Perot's Reform Party has become a
sideshow, but the political urge for a candidate who avoids the
extremes of either party remains strong enough for the century to
begin with a professional wrestler in the Minnesota governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The wrinkle this year has been that the man in the middle also
happens to be running for the Republican Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   By ``middle,'' incidentally, we're not necessarily talking about
people who are moderate on every issue, but those who inhabit the
territory between the parties: independents, those disgruntled with
their parties and those who just don't vote.
</P>
<P>
   Without an appeal to those who fit that category _ and a healthy
turnout from those who consider themselves Democrats, as well _
Arizona Sen. John McCain would not have been able to crawl back in
the ring as he did Tuesday after the thumping he took in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   These outsiders have caused some discomfort within the
Republican Party, but in many cases the complaints are coming from
those who were outsiders themselves when Pat Robertson, one of
McCain's most outspoken foes this year, was trying to elbow his way
into the party in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   With wins in his home state and in Michigan, the man in the
middle is back in the thick of the race. But what does that mean,
exactly, in terms of his realistic chances to win his party's
nomination?
</P>
<P>
   It would be something if McCain and Texas Gov. George W. Bush
could go on swapping victories in spotlight states, as they have
for the past month. It's hard to remember two candidates exchanging
volleys as these two have, with Bush's Iowa caucuses win, McCain's
stunner in New Hampshire, Bush's strong response in South Carolina
and McCain's rebound Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the March 7 voting in 13 states will force McCain to make
some strategic choices, hoping to find the states that could be the
tinder to keep his insurgency alive.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has to start making tough choices as well. He still has a
money advantage over McCain, but he can't spend full-bore in
California, New York, Ohio and Georgia as he has in New Hampshire
and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bush-friendly states of Texas and Florida coming up the
following week, it still is hard to imagine a scenario in which
McCain pulls off his Republican insurgency, although Tuesday's
outcome could bring more money and endorsements his way.
</P>
<P>
   That tension between a candidate on a hot streak and a long-shot
chance at nomination makes it inevitable there should be talk of
McCain taking his crusade outside the party, whether McCain at this
stage encourages it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has had to run to his left to secure the Democratic
nomination, and Bush has had to run to his right to nail down the
Republican nomination,'' mused GOP pollster Whit Ayres before
Tuesday's vote. ``You know at a certain point they're going to come
charging back to the center, but right now there's this huge
opening, right up the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   So long as the middle is attracted to this Republican
competition, incidentally, there will be record turnout in GOP
primaries as there was in Michigan and South Carolina. Which, while
it may not be to the liking of some Republicans, is not a bad thing
for their party.

 (af)  
 By LAURA WINTERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One day a few weeks ago, the filmmaker Jim Jarmusch
was hunkered down in a corner of the Pink Pony, a favorite hangout
near his Lower East Side home, trying to have a quiet conversation.
But a steady flow of colleagues and well-wishers kept wandering by
_ drawn, it seemed, by his signature silver hair, as well as by his
laid-back manner.
</P>
<P>
   After the umpteenth interruption, Jarmusch smiled wryly. ``It's
still odd to me if somebody on the street knows who I am,'' he
said. ``I'm not interested in the whole celebrity cult thing. Is it
better to be semi-known or semi-unknown?''
</P>
<P>
   Jarmusch, 47, personifies this riddle better than almost any
other American director today. An intensely private man, he became
a downtown celebrity with his second movie, the art house hit
``Stranger Than Paradise'' (1984). With its throwaway but graceful
style and no-budget economy, ``Stranger'' helped pioneer the
American independent film movement. ``When Jim hit with that film,
he forged the way for all of us,'' says Spike Lee, who attended
film school with him at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jarmusch is still an emblem for many younger filmmakers,
his path after ``Stranger Than Paradise'' has not always been easy.
His last few films have drawn only modest audiences in the United
States _ though abroad they draw crowds and his laconic humor is
admired as deeply American.
</P>
<P>
   An industry outsider, he has become a world-cinema insider, with
a loyal band of A-list collaborators _ ``a strange, international
biker club,'' says his friend, the musician Tom Waits. His
reputation has drawn Hollywood stars like Winona Ryder, Johnny Depp
and now Forest Whitaker, who stars in Mr. Jarmusch's new film,
``Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghost Dog,'' which opens on Friday, is Jarmusch's first
non-documentary in four years. Like much of his work, it weaves
together strikingly disparate elements: he calls it a ``gangster
samurai hip-hop eastern western.'' And yet, despite its oddness,
``Ghost Dog'' has a wild-card commercial potential _ both because
of its star, Whitaker, and because of the film's highly bankable
soundtrack, created by the hip-hop master the RZA, of the Wu-Tang
Clan.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows an urban loner named Ghost Dog, played by
Whitaker, who makes his living as a Mafia hitman. A modern-day
samurai, he follows the precepts of the ``Hagakure,'' the
early-18th-century Japanese warrior codebook. Every samurai swears
undying loyalty to a master, and Ghost Dog's master is Louie (John
Tormey), a small-time mobster who once saved Ghost Dog's life.
</P>
<P>
   When one of Ghost Dog's missions goes awry, Louie's own bosses,
a comical bunch of aging mafiosi, decide that the lone gunman has
to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Jarmusch began writing the film, he says, with the idea of ``a
character who was a likable killer.'' He tends to write with
particular actors in mind, and in this case he was thinking about
Whitaker: ``Forest is very gentle and soulful,'' he says, ``but
there's a dark side to his presence which I haven't seen used very
often. I wanted to make a character who had that contradiction.''
</P>
<P>
   When the filmmaker Sara Driver (``When Pigs Fly''), Jarmusch's
longtime girlfriend, gave him the ``Hagakure,'' the book became
``Ghost Dog's'' spiritual well. Jarmusch has aphorisms from the
``Hagakure'' written out onscreen _ solemn lines like, ``The end is
important in all things.'' But the film has his signature zany
humor as well, in his portrait of America as a place of crossed
cultural wires. The mafiosi can't afford to meet in an Italian
restaurant, so they hold court in a fast-food Chinese joint. ``Jim
likes to put things together that might explode,'' says Waits. ``He
may be a white-haired beatnik from Ohio, but he knows how to rub
two sticks together.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, whose implacable presence anchors the film, has long
been interested in Eastern philosophy and spent many hours
discussing his character with Jarmusch. ``It was one of the most
collaborative experiences I've had with a filmmaker,'' Whitaker
said. ``Jim really pays respect to his inspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Jarmusch decided to make ``Ghost Dog'' an outright
homage to certain gangster classics. The film is punctuated with
direct references to films like Jean-Pierre Melville's ``Samourai''
and Seijun Suzuki's ``Branded to Kill.'' But Jarmusch pays homage
as well to whole cultures that he admires. ``I didn't cast Forest
because he was black,'' Jarmusch said, ``but having a black
character created a lot of nuances that I wanted in the story. I
wanted hip-hop culture to be in the film.''
</P>
<P>
   The director, who used to play in a downtown band called the
Del-Byzanteens, was struck by the Wu-Tang Clan's synthesis of
African-American and Asian motifs. So he tracked down the RZA,
their elusive leader, to do ``Ghost Dog's'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three weeks later I get a call,'' he recounts. ``And RZA says,
`Meet me in a blacked-out van at 3 a.m. on 50th Street and
Broadway.' I go there and he gives me a tape and says, `Yo, check
this stuff.' I ask if he has any directions for me and he says:
`Nah. This is hip-hop style! Try it in the film, juice pieces
together.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the film's playfulness, however, lies Ghost Dog's pained
awareness that his code of honor is vanishing in the modern world.
This melancholy comes directly from Jarmusch. ``I've tried from the
beginning to have a code,'' he says, ``but you learn real fast in
the film business that that's a good way to get eaten alive.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He grew up far from the film business, in Akron, Ohio, where his
father worked for B.F. Goodrich. After attending Northwestern
University for one year, Jarmusch transferred to Columbia. When he
spent a semester in Paris, he discovered the Cinematheque and the
films of Yasujiro Ozu, Carl Dreyer and Robert Bresson.
</P>
<P>
   Returning home, he entered film school at NYU and became the
assistant to the filmmaker Nicholas Ray, who in turn introduced him
to Wim Wenders.
</P>
<P>
   When Jarmusch finished his student film, ``Permanent Vacation,''
Wenders gave him some leftover film stock, which Jarmusch used for
part of ``Stranger Than Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of two investors, Jarmusch completed the film, a
deadpan, black and white feature about three drifters on an
impromptu road trip. It went to the Cannes International Film
Festival in 1984 and stunned Jarmusch by winning the Camera d'Or
for best first feature. ``We were at Cannes, sleeping on the floor,
and then the water got cut off,'' he remembers. ``When I had to do
a television interview, I shaved using leftover tea water.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Stranger'' was released later that year, Jarmusch saw
himself hailed, at 31, as the creator of a new film style. The
film's influence extends even to directors today like Kevin Smith,
who directed ``Clerks'' and ``Dogma.'' ``Seeing `Stranger Than
Paradise' is an empowering experience,'' said Smith. ``Here was a
movie that they made for a hundred, two hundred grand, and suddenly
the power was in the hands of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarmusch found all the attention rather overwhelming. But at
another film festival, he met a young Italian actor named Roberto
Benigni. He asked Benigni to star with Waits and John Lurie in his
next movie, in which they would play three innocents who escape
from a Louisiana jail.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Benigni spoke no English. During the shooting of
``Down by Law,'' Jarmusch and Lurie patiently taught him their own
version of the language. ``I learned that a cup was a `clamp,''' .
Benigni said, laughing, on the telephone from Rome, ``and that `to
urinate' was `to flame.' The entire set used these words.''
</P>
<P>
   Benigni credits Jarmusch for having introduced him to America.
``I love really Jim's way to live and to direct actors,'' he says.
``He let me improvise during rehearsal time and then left me an
open door.'' He adds, mysteriously, ``He is a real poet, a cross
between brains and beauty _ between Orson Welles and Brigitte
Bardot.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarmusch's fascination with the coexistence of cultures
permeated his two next films, ``Mystery Train'' (1989) and ``Night
on Earth'' (1992). ``Mystery Train'' is set in a seedy but
evocative Memphis, while ``Night on Earth'' was shot nocturnally in
five cities around the world. Rather than accept Hollywood
production money, Jarmusch began at this point to seek foreign
financing. ``I've been stubborn, but I've kept artistic control
over my films,'' he said. ``I see them through every step of the
process, even owning the negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   This involvement explains the occasionally long stretches
between films. With ``Dead Man,'' his most ambitious project, he
shot a hallucinatory black-and-white period Western with Johnny
Depp as a fugitive befriended by a Native American.
</P>
<P>
   The film was panned by critics when it was released in 1996, but
it has recently undergone a startling renaissance, with many
end-of-century wrap-ups (including a current series at the Film
Society of Lincoln Center) naming it one of the best films of the
1990s. Jarmusch is typically modest about this. ``If it goes
through the culture in some minor way, I'd be glad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Ghost Dog,'' he shot a concert film/documentary of his
friend Neil Young and his band, Crazy Horse, called, simply, ``Year
of the Horse.'' And he has appeared in cameos in some of his
friends' films, including Billy Bob Thornton's ``Sling Blade'' and
Wayne Wang and Paul Auster's ``Blue in the Face.''
</P>
<P>
   The acting is a lark for him, whereas his own films are deeply
personal. The sympathy for the outsider which has inspired all of
his work is especially clear in ``Dead Man'' and ``Ghost Dog.'' ``A
bunch of old white men have run things so far,'' he said. ``That's
why I've always been interested in people who don't fit in. I have
friends who are in prison, off the grid, living on reservations. I
learn more from them, somehow, and I respect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many people know that before making his name as a filmmaker,
Jarmusch worked as a factory welder, a hydraulic drill-gun
operator, a moving man and a process server for Legal Aid. He would
be the first to admit that the people he encountered in these
professions would not, probably, go to see his films.
</P>
<P>
   But his far-flung experiences have shaped his concerns as a
filmmaker, just as they have shaped his desire to reach an
audience, whether it be big or small. ``It's very important to me
that the audience completes the electric current, because otherwise
a film is just a dark lamp sitting in a corner,'' he said. ``I'm
not trying to teach a lesson to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to make a world which they can enter and
observe, bringing with them whatever has shaped their own lives.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27)  
 (af)  
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   She tried not to get up there onstage and do it herself. For the
first time since she became famous for recreating _ to the last
gesture and vocal tic _ dozens of real-life individuals based on
her actual conversations with them, Anna Deavere Smith decided not
to perform her own work. Instead, she cast actors in ``House
Arrest,'' her latest foray into the nation's psyche, this time
focusing on the role of the American presidency, from Thomas
Jefferson to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When the play was performed in Washington in 1997 and then in
Los Angeles last spring, critics called it overlong and said they
missed Smith's presence onstage. Then George C. Wolfe, the producer
of the Joseph Papp Public Theater, suggested to Smith that if she
brought the show to New York, she should do it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe had directed Smith's acclaimed 1994 play about the Rodney
King riots, ``Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,'' and he was one of the
people she interviewed for her ``Fires in the Mirror'' in 1992,
about the Crown Heights disturbances in Brooklyn the previous year.
And so, on March 27, under the direction of Jo Bonney, ``House
Arrest'' is scheduled to open at the Public Theater with just Smith
onstage, flying solo again.
</P>
<P>
   The journey would seem to involve a message: that Smith, 49, was
meant to perform her own work, whether she wants to or not, and
that whatever particular blend of inquisitiveness and insight she
brings to the process of drawing people out in interviews is
ultimately essential to bringing those people to life onstage.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Smith's last two projects would indicate as much.
``Fires in the Mirror'' told the story of the racial flare-up in
Crown Heights that followed the death of a 7-year-old black boy,
Gavin Cato, and the subsequent killing of Yankel Rosenbaum, a
Hasidic scholar. Alone onstage in a white shirt and black pants,
Smith inhabited nearly 30 characters _ from a rabbi to a rapper _
with monologues culled from her interviews. In The New York Times,
Frank Rich called the play ``quite simply the most compelling and
sophisticated view of urban racial and class conflict, up to date
to this week, that one could hope to encounter in a swift 90
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   And of ``Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,'' which explored the
aftermath of that city's riots following the first Rodney King
verdict, David Richards wrote in The New York Times, ``One person
at a time, one idea at a time, one temperament at a time, she
builds up a rich, panoramic canvas of a national trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe describes Smith's approach as singular. ``She has crafted
this extraordinary technique _ art form _ of both embodying a
person and illuminating their language,'' he said. Of the previous
productions of ``House Arrest,'' Wolfe said, ``I saw a lot of
talented actors playing the roles, and they were acting the roles
in a way that you were witnessing the emotion instead of in a way
that the language was swirling up and popping around you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Davidson, the artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum
in Los Angeles, where ``House Arrest'' was done last spring,
suggested that the decision to use actors had been a worthwhile
experiment, even though it proved less effective than a solo show
would have been. ``I think it was a necessary thing for this artist
to do this,'' he said. ``She didn't want to repeat herself.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Davidson continued, the dramatic effect of Smith onstage is
almost impossible for others to approximate. ``Because of her
particular interviewing technique, the audience becomes Anna _ they
sit in for her because Anna is talking to them as if she were
asking the questions,'' he said. ``She creates a level of reality.
When you have actors doing it, it removes it one more step. They
were second generation and it lost something.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, listening to Smith talk about reaching this point _
poring through dossiers of material she gathered with the help of
her research associates to prepare for interviews with the former
presidents Jimmy Carter and George Bush, as well as historians,
journalists and government aides; meeting face to face with
well-known figures like the historian Studs Terkel and the
political columnist David Broder; delving into past scandals, from
Thomas Jefferson's affair with Sally Hemings to Bill Clinton's with
Monica Lewinsky; winding up with 10,000 tapes to cull from _ it is
hard to imagine anyone else being able to convey the color and
cadence of Smith's 425 interviews as well as the intense woman who
conducted them.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the other side of an interview in a bare dressing
room at the Public on a break from rehearsal on a recent Saturday
afternoon, Smith played down the decision to do the show solo as
little more than a matter of logistics, as if she herself had given
it hardly any thought. Wolfe, she noted, simply said it seemed like
a good idea, and she trusts his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said she enjoyed seeing actors perform her material
and that working with them had forced her to deconstruct what she
does instinctively. ``Is that good?'' she asked. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether being onstage again felt like a step back,
she said: ``How can it ever be a step back to be in front of people
willing to come to you with an open ear? I love it. I love the
audience. So how could I call that a step back? That wouldn't be
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But while she had little to say about her performance, she
clearly warmed to the topic of her process. In 1995, Smith, a
tenured drama professor at Stanford University, began to immerse
herself in the ways of Washington _ visiting the White House,
flying on Air Force One, meeting with government officials,
scholars, pundits.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was initially intrigued by the intersection of
politics and the press, and grew increasingly fascinated by whether
the constant photo opportunities and other media events leave the
president with any time to actually run the country.
</P>
<P>
   What she generally tries to do in interviews, she said, is to
get people off their center, to get them to a ``state of abandon,''
when their words transcend mere information and ``sing.'' She
described the phrases she was looking for as ``bouncy ...
utterances that just don't make it all the way across the page.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This kind of spontaneity, Smith said, was harder to come by in
Washington power circles known more for caution than candor. ``In
Washington,'' Ms. Smith said, ``everybody rephrased my questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer organization of the project was daunting. Whereas
``Fires in the Mirror'' and ``Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992'' _ which
was recently made into a film that had its premiere at the Sundance
Film Festival _ had clear beginnings, middles and ends, ``House
Arrest'' explores a subject, not an incident. And the scope of the
topic made it especially difficult to narrow to some kind of
narrative.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Smith pointed out, she wrote both of her previous
works in the aftermath of events. Here, events kept changing under
her, prompting constant revisions. ``In this case, there was no
aftermath,'' she said. ``The project became an amazing moving
target. I wrote more drafts of this than I have of anything ever.''
As she was bringing one version to Federal Express, for example,
Smith said, there was a debate going on in Congress about whether
to release the Starr Report.
</P>
<P>
   While it would seem frustrating to be forced to constantly
adjust to breaking news _ Smith said she had to cancel scheduled
productions in Chicago and Seattle because the show was overtaken
by events _ she instead called the process of trying to capture
history even as it was being made ``a magnificent opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said she did not relish rewriting. ``I don't like
seclusion,'' she said. ``But that's a necessary thing that one must
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she interviewed President Clinton on two occasions
before the Lewinsky scandal broke _ once off the record and once
on. She did not interview him afterward. ``For me, this whole
project closed when he was acquitted in the Senate,'' she said. ``I
wouldn't have approached him when that was going on. I wouldn't
have wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite witnessing the president's obvious foibles, and
confronting the inevitable humanness of those in power, Smith said
she surprised herself by coming away impressed by the people who
govern. ``In the end, I have more awe than I had thought I would,''
she said. ``As a child of the '60s, I was never interested in the
establishment. We were all about trying to bring the thing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she had come to believe while working on the play
that pivotal events like the Vietnam War, the women's movement and
the death of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. have ``bred a very
dangerous cynicism, an overinfatuation with the shadow side, the
darker side of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   At one of her post-show discussions, Smith recalled, a man in
the audience stood up and said he thought the next century was
going to be about putting the shadow and the light together. ``That
was one of the more inspiring things I've heard,'' she said. ``I
want to be part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The pre-Monica version of ``House Arrest'' opened at the Arena
Stage in Washington in November 1997 and ran until January 1998. It
was when the later version opened at the Taper, Smith said, that
she and Davidson, the artistic director, decided to present the
play as a performance by actors, followed by a discussion with the
audience. ``I'm pleased we decided to do that,'' she added. ``To
use theater as a way of framing the conversation that's already
going on in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also one performance at the American Repertory Theater
in Cambridge, Mass., in the summer of 1998, as part of Smith's
Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue, now in its third and
final year. The summer theater institute at Harvard University _
which aims to strengthen the role of the arts in civic discourse _
was started with a grant from the Ford Foundation and is sponsored
by the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute and the American Repertory Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Smith has compiled a book version of the project,
scheduled to be published by Random House this fall, called ``Talk
to Me.''
</P>
<P>
   As to which of her many characters will make the final cut in
New York, Smith said the lineup will not be decided until opening
night because elements of the play will keep changing through the
previews, scheduled to begin on March 7. But she said there were a
few sure bets, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt's cook, Lizzie
McDuffie, Anita Hill, Ed Bradley and Arianna Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   How does she decide which people to include in the first place?
``I divide the interviews into parts that I think I can become,''
she said. ``And I create these stories.'' Beyond that, Smith said,
it was difficult to put her criteria into words. ``It's what's
pushing the narrative forward,'' she ventured. ``It's who I can do,
it's who speaks in a way that gets right to your soul, it's who I
remember.''

EDITORIAL: NEW TENSION OVER TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 23: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A dangerous pattern is emerging in the troubled relations across
the Taiwan Strait. During Taiwan's last presidential campaign, in
1996, China test-fired missiles over waters close to the island's
major cities to protest what it saw as a drift toward independence.
Now, with a new campaign under way, Beijing is again trying to
intimidate Taiwanese voters and push the island's next leaders into
early reunification talks on the mainland's terms.
</P>
<P>
   China was wrong this week to threaten to use force against
Taiwan if the island's leaders take too long to agree to reunite
with the mainland. By coupling that threat with an attempt to
deflect the blame to Washington for increasing military tensions
over Taiwan, Beijing may have damaged its chances of winning
congressional backing for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of the past crises stirred up by the provocative
actions of Taiwan's departing president, Lee Teng-hui, the blame
for this flare-up lies squarely with Beijing. Taiwan's three
leading presidential candidates have tried to mute the independence
issue, and all three favor early talks with the mainland. Most of
the world, and most Taiwanese, acknowledge the principle that
Taiwan and the mainland are part of a single China that should
ultimately be reunited.
</P>
<P>
   But there are vital differences on how and when reunification
should take place. The United States, which recognizes the
Communist government in Beijing as the sole government of China,
rightly insists that reunification be achieved by peaceful means.
Beijing, however, has consistently asserted its right to settle the
question by force. When China underscored that threat with missile
tests in 1996, it created an anti-mainland backlash among Taiwanese
voters and damaged Beijing's relations with the United States. The
mainland could again hurt its own interests if it fails to show
greater restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's presidential race is a tight three-way affair between
the candidate of the ruling Nationalist Party, Lien Chan; a
dissident nationalist, James Soong; and the candidate of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party, Chen Shui-bian. Although
Chen's party has traditionally called for an independent Taiwan, he
has deliberately stepped back from that position, promising that if
elected, he would not seek formal independence. This caution
reflects the general sense on Taiwan that Lee needlessly provoked
the mainland with his politicized 1995 visit to the United States
and his 1999 declaration that Taiwan would henceforth negotiate
with China only if Beijing acknowledged it as an equal state.
</P>
<P>
   Over five decades, a relatively stable arrangement has evolved
that allows Taiwan and the mainland to maintain separate political
and economic systems as part of a larger, single China. That
understanding has served both sides well and preserved peace. This
is no time for Beijing to threaten to overturn it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Election Day polls were based on questionnaires completed on
Tuesday by voters leaving voting stations throughout Michigan and
Arizona. The poll was conducted by Voter News Service, an
organization created by ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, NBC News
and The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan results are based on 1,358 Republican primary
voters in 45 randomly selected sites statewide. The Arizona results
are based on 1,671 Republican primary voters in 40 precincts.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls
should differ by no more than plus or minus four percentage points
from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all
primary voters who turned out on Tuesday in Michigan and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential
sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical
difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election
Day, like the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out a
questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 23: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality-based television'' would seem to involve the very
thing that television entertainment was designed to relieve _
reality. So it should not be particularly surprising that the
marriage of two strangers on the Fox Network's ``Who Wants to Marry
a Multimillionaire'' last week foundered before the honeymoon was
over. After flying into the sunset, the bride and groom came home
separately, the groom facing questions about a police restraining
order against him issued nine years ago after a former girlfriend
complained that he had physically threatened her. Also, there are
some troubling concerns about a good chunk of his autobiography,
including worries that maybe he was not exactly a multimillionaire.
So how many of the 22 million viewers are really surprised that
after a few public minutes of courtship, this instant marriage
instantly hit a snag? Even Cinderella and Prince Charming had until
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   More distressing than the matrimonial flop is the news that the
television industry seems to adore this kind of entertainment.
Company lawyers may fear the potential for a multimillion-dollar
lawsuit in every participant's disappointment. But network
programmers see these shows as a ratings and revenue-producing
bonanza at a time when their less flamboyant productions are losing
ground to cable channels and the Internet. Fox canceled a rerun of
the marriage show Tuesday night and said it would not air another
version of ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire.'' However, Fox
executives, like others, have no plans to desert ``reality
programming'' as a lucrative genre.
</P>
<P>
   Already American networks are adapting European experiments. One
Dutch program, aptly called ``Big Brother,'' featured the
long-running, unscripted saga of 10 young people living in a house
wired with cameras that revealed everything that happened,
including sex and showers. The American version scheduled this
summer on CBS is not expected to reveal all. Another more troubling
CBS show called ``Survivor'' will take a group of contestants to
Borneo for a survival course. The group will vote to exclude one
person in each round until the survivor wins $1 million. A Swedish
version of this show resulted in the suicide of one dismissed
contestant.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson, founder of the Center for the Study of Popular
Television at Syracuse University, fears that this live and
unpredictable peeping-Tom programming will continue because most
viewers are thrilled by risks and rewards offered to ordinary
people. Moreover, Fox and other outlets are trying to wean
themselves from violent programming, using reality-based television
as a substitute. ``For those of you who think this is the end of
the civilized world as we know it, I don't think we've seen
anything yet,'' Thompson predicts. If the appeal to good taste is
fruitless, perhaps the only hope for discerning viewers is the
zapper, the off button or the liability lawyers who may give the
networks pause.

GIULIANI DEFENDS THE POLICE AT ACADEMY GRADUATION
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-DIALLO-TRIAL, NY-DIALLO-SUMMARY) 
(nk) 
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, drawing repeated cheers
Tuesday from graduating police cadets and their families and
friends, called police officers ``civil rights workers'' who are
too often unfairly vilified and subject to prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's remarks, at Police Academy graduation ceremonies at
Madison Square Garden for 1,224 cadets, were made as closing
arguments were under way in an Albany courtroom in the trial of
four New York City police officers charged with murdering Amadou
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not specifically mention the trial or Diallo, but
he told the cadets that he appreciated the difficult situation
officers sometimes faced that required sudden life-or-death
decisions, like whether to use their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get to make a tough decision, I get a lot of time to
think about it,'' the mayor said. ``I get a lot of memos and I have
a lot of meetings and I listen to a lot of advisers and even then I
don't always pick the right decision. You have to make more
important decisions in a split second without any advice.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the mayor said, he has always been careful to
avoid acting hastily when police officers are charged with
wrongdoing or unnecessary use of force.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are in an ambiguous but difficult circumstance and
when others are pointing the finger of blame on you, I give you the
benefit of doubt,'' the mayor said, drawing extended applause.
``The worst criminals that you arrest get the benefit of the doubt.
So it would seem to me that we could give to the men and women who
put their lives at risk for us, the men and women who make it
possible for our children to grow up with security and freedom, it
would seem to me we should at least give them the benefit of the
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor insisted to reporters after the ceremony that he was
not alluding to the Diallo case. But several of the newly sworn
officers and their families said they had interpreted Giuliani's
remarks that way, and that they welcomed his words of support
during a time when the Police Department is under such intense
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just lets you know that you are not going to get in trouble
for doing your job,'' said Timothy Brown, 22, who is joining the
13th Precinct, which patrols the Gramercy Park area in Manhattan.
``That is extremely nice to know. You are out there trying to help
people. You don't want to get hurt for helping them.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances Nasso, whose 26-year-old son, Dominick M. Nasso,
graduated Tuesday, added: ``I don't want my son sent out to the
wolves. It is good to know that the mayor is standing behind
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani noted that his remarks Tuesday echoed comments at
previous academy graduation ceremonies, including his assertion
that New York City police officers are civil rights workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are entrusted with protecting the most important civil
right we possess,'' the mayor said. ``Safety and security.''
</P>
<P>
   He also reiterated his previously stated belief that police
officers, like members of some of the city's religious and ethnic
minorities, are often the subject of prejudice. ``Prejudice against
race, prejudice against religion, prejudice against ethnic
background, prejudice against police officers,'' comes from the
same origin, the mayor said. ``It is the same kind of hateful,
vicious, irrational thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at the ceremony was impressed with the mayor's
comments. One graduate, Pedro Diaz, 26, who is joining a Brooklyn
precinct, said it sounded like a campaign speech by the mayor, who
is a candidate for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, spent part of the ceremony simultaneously
listening to the speakers at Madison Square Garden and to a live
radio broadcast of the Diallo trial. Siegel called the mayor's
suggestion that police officers were civil rights workers and
subject to prejudice ``unreal'' and ``bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is trying to equate criticism of police or even cop
bashing with racism and anti-Semitism,'' he said. ``It is clearly
not apples and apples. It is a distortion of history. Civil rights
workers generally are advocating for minority rights, usually for
groups who have been discriminated against. Police enforce
majoritarian mandates.''

OPPONENT FOR WOODS IS ALSO HOT RIGHT NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ At the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship, your first day could also be your last.
</P>
<P>
   That is part of the intrigue surrounding this week's
single-elimination match play event, which begins Wednesday at La
Costa Resort &AMP; Spa, featuring an elite 64-player field that
includes Tiger Woods, David Duval, Colin Montgomerie, Davis Love
III, Ernie Els, Sergio Garcia, and Greg Norman. Only the top 64
players in the world ranking through Feb. 14 qualify for this
event, the first of four tournaments in this year's World Golf
Championship series.
</P>
<P>
   With a total purse of $5 million, including $1 million for the
winner, Jumbo Ozaki was the only player eligible for the tournament
who decided not to play. However, Wednesday's first-round action is
almost certain to produce some big name casualties. Last year, five
of the top 10 seeds were knocked out in the first round, including
Love, Els, Mark O'Meara, Montgomerie, and Lee Westwood. Woods
didn't make the Final Four either, and the championship match
featured two names that hardly anyone expected _ Jeff Maggert, the
24th seed, vs. Andrew Magee, who was seeded No. 50.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert defeated Magee in a splendid championship match,
chipping in for a birdie on the second hole of a playoff. It was an
unexpected ending to an unpredictable week. And as players prepared
for this week's action, they all had the same motto. Either be
ready to play, or be ready to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playing one set of tennis, it's over very quickly,''
said Montgomerie, who will face Dennis Paulson in a first-round
match. ``Anybody is capable of beating anybody. I enjoy the
challenge of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Woods, a master at match play, faces a difficult challenge
on Wednesday against Michael Campbell of New Zealand, who has won
three of his last four starts. One of the world's hottest players,
Campbell has revitalized his career after suffering a serous injury
to his left wrist in 1995. As recently as June of 1998, Campbell
was a lowly 465th in the world ranking, and he was contemplating
quitting golf. However, Campbell rebuilt his swing and his
confidence, and after beating Woods at the Johnnie Walker Classic
in Taiwan last November, Campbell vowed that he would not be
intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to win, not to make up the field,'' said Campbell,
who qualified for the field on the strength of his recent surge.
``My confidence is very high and I'm very focused. If I keep doing
what I'm doing, tomorrow is going to be very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who advanced to last year's quarterfinals before losing
to Maggert, was looking forward to a rare opportunity to engage in
match play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely makes your excitement level go up a little
bit,'' said Woods. ``It's exciting because of the momentum swings
in a match. In stroke play, you can start looking ahead. In match
play, if you look in the future, you're going to find a ticket
counter somewhere and catch a flight home. `'
</P>
<P>
   While long hitters who make frequent birdies like Woods and Love
have an advantage in match play, it is also important not to give
away holes by making mistakes. Steadiness was the key to Maggert's
victory last year, as he constantly hit fairways and greens and
capitalized on opponent's mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my game is not going to allow myself to make
mistakes on this golf course,'' said Maggert. ``I feel like I can
compete against anybody. I don't get intimidated by who I'm
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The eventual champion must win six consecutive matches,
including a 36-hole match for the championship. That is a grueling
task for any player, so those who are in excellent physical
condition may have a slight advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The local forecast for the week is not good, and the course is
already wet from recent rain in the area. But everyone in the field
was eager to get started, looking forward to see which players
would last as the field was reduced to 32, then 16, then eight,
then four, then two, until a champion was crowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more upsets,'' said Maggert. ``I'm sure everyone
is pulling for Tiger to play on Sunday. It's good for the sponsors
and the television ratings. But there's a lot of good players out
here. Who knows? It could end up with a couple of nobodies like
myself again.''

FILOMEN GREENBERG, 101, NYU LAW BENEFACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Filomen D'Agostino Greenberg, a self-taught stock
trader who used her good fortune to help her alma mater, New York
University Law School, grow into an academic leader, died Friday.
She was 101 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving from Coney Island one morning in 1917 to start classes,
Fil D'Agostino _ as she was called by friends _ found five small
rooms crammed into a single building east of Washington Square Park
in Greenwich Village. Fresh out of high school, she got a $3-a-week
clerk's job and received her law degree in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   While she was practicing negligence and criminal law, she
married Max Greenberg, a 1919 New York University law graduate who
became a highly successful expert in contract law; he died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Greenberg worked as a government censor. One
day she came across a letter filled with arcane abbreviations and
fractions that read like code. She realized that she was looking at
stock-market quotations. Her interest piqued, she reached for the
daily paper, and a new carer opened up.
</P>
<P>
   Since her husband showed no interest in the market, she pursued
it on her own, but they both began many years of strong financial
support for the law school. She continued her investments, and her
donations, after her husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, her gifts totaled more than $6 million, which made her
the school's biggest benefactor at the time. Her help made possible
the Filomen D'Agostino Residence Hall for about 370 students; its
inspiration was her difficult trip back and forth from Brooklyn
every day when she was a student. Her help also financed the
Greenberg Lounge on the campus, the Greenberg Faculty Research Fund
and the Greenberg Professorship in Contract Law.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a sister, Deborah Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   Law, Greenberg once said, was not her first career choice. ``I
wanted to study medicine,'' she said, ``but no school in New York
would admit a woman, and my family was too poor to send me away to
study.''

POLICE CALL DORMITORY ASSAULT SUSPECT A SHREWD PREDATOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J.)   (jw) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Internet as his guide and a knife in his pocket, a
drifter suspected in a series of sexual assaults made his way to
elite prep schools and leafy suburban campuses, sheltered places
rarely visited by violent crime, the authorities said. Sneaking
into dormitory rooms, they said, he placed the blade at the throats
of his young victims, all boys 12 to 16 years old, before abusing
them.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, the authorities said, the suspect,
Michael Lee Allen Jr., 24, terrorized five private schools in New
Jersey and New York, although they believe that he is responsible
for as many as a dozen other attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the Nassau County police on Long Island
arrested Allen, and within hours, law enforcement officials from
across the metropolitan region were interviewing him about
strikingly similar, unsolved attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we came in he just told us everything,'' said Sgt.
Rick Warshany of the Police Department in Hightstown, N.J., where
the most recent attack took place. ``He was all very matter of fact
about what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   An immigrant from Vietnam, the son of an American serviceman and
a Vietnamese woman, Allen has been described by detectives as a
drifter, a troubled man who went through a half dozen foster homes
after arriving in this country as an 8-year-old orphan. He survived
on odd jobs and stolen credit cards. At night he slept in his car
or at motels on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The police say Allen found the schools he targeted on the Web
using computers at a Kinko's copy shop in Garden City, N.Y., and at
public libraries. To help him find his way to his destination,
police said, he would download directions from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is shrewd, intelligent and a master of the Internet,''
said Detective Sgt. Albert Ciaccio of the Nassau County police.
</P>
<P>
   Ciaccio said he believed that Allen was responsible for attacks
across the country, and he urged other victims to come forward.
``We believe Mike is a serial predator,'' he said. ``He was very
well traveled around the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, police have linked him to five attacks in New York and
New Jersey, most of which also involved robbery. In the most recent
case, at the Peddie School in Hightstown, Allen sneaked into a
dormitory on the 175-acre campus around 4:40 a.m. on Feb. 11,
Warshany said.
</P>
<P>
   He pried open a window in a common area of the dormitory and
took items, including credit cards, from the unlocked rooms of
several sleeping students, Warshany said. Allen then entered the
second-floor room of a 16-year-old boy, woke him and sexually
assaulted him while threatening him with a knife, Warshany said.
</P>
<P>
   After the attacker fled the room, the boy called school security
guards, who spotted a man walking away from the building's side
entrance. The guards gave chase but did not catch him, Warshany
said. Allen has been charged with sexual assault, burglary and
other crimes, according to the Mercer County prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, on Feb. 9, police said, Allen staged a similar
attack at the Millbrook School, a prestigious private high school
in Dutchess County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Allen assaulted a 16-year-old boy and stole
property from the rooms of several students as they slept, the
police said. Investigators said they were not sure how Allen
entered the residence hall, which is locked at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this has never happened here,'' said Drew
Casetano, the headmaster of Millbrook, which sits at the end of a
mile-long driveway and is surrounded by woods, meadows and
farmland. The doors to the students' rooms, however, do not have
locks on them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Anderson, the Dutchess County sheriff, said Allen would
probably be charged with sodomy, burglary and grand larceny. ``He's
already confessed to everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has also been accused of molesting a boy who was attending
a baseball camp last summer at the C.W. Post College campus of Long
Island University in Old Brookville. In that case, which occurred
at 4 a.m. July 5, police said the attacker tapped the boy on the
shoulder, threw a towel over his head and threatened to kill him if
he screamed. After sealing the boy's mouth with duct tape, the man
sodomized him and then threatened to kill the boy's parents if he
told anyone about the incident, investigators said. The Nassau
County police have charged him with burglary and sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   The Suffolk County police said Allen was also believed to be
responsible for two attacks there, one at La Salle Military Academy
in Oakdale and another at Stony Brook Preparatory School.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how Allen managed to evade the authorities for
so long, but investigators said his decision to target schools in
numerous jurisdictions prevented officials from linking the
incidents. Only after the Peddie School attack was publicized by
the news media did the authorities begin connecting the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Allen brought himself down by using a credit card
stolen from one of his victims, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   In September, he was arrested and charged with stealing an
identification card from a student at Hofstra University on Long
Island. He was released, but he gave the police his beeper number.
On Friday, after linking him to a credit card taken during the
Millbrook incident, the Nassau County police paged him, and, when
he called, they asked him to come to a police station to pick up
personal property. When he showed up, he was arrested. He is being
held without bail in the Nassau County jail.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: TREND-SPOTTER AMONG TRAVEL AGENTS FOCUSES ON
INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOE SHARKEY  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among travel agents, Rosenbluth International gets credit,
though sometimes very grudgingly, for having anticipated several of
the economic trends that have shaken that industry recently. In the
early 1990's _ years before the airlines enraged travel agents and
even drove some out of business by slashing commissions on tickets
sold _ Rosenbluth began sharply reducing its dependence on
commissions and instead started charging corporate clients fees for
providing travel-management services.
</P>
<P>
   So it is probably worth briefly examining the latest business
idea by Rosenbluth, a Philadelphia-based travel agency with 1,300
offices worldwide. Last month, its Rosenbluth Interactive
subsidiary rolled out a business-to-business travel-booking service
that sets up custom online travel-booking sites, with off-line
travel-agent telephone assistance, ``tailored specifically for
small, midsized and emerging-growth companies,'' said Justin Shaw,
the vice president and general manager of Biztravel.com, a division
of Rosenbluth Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can book a trip online on dozens of different sites,
including Biztravel.com, which Rosenbluth bought last year. What's
different here is that Rosenbluth will design a site _ the company
refers to it generically as biztravel(at)mycompany _ individually
for a company. The site will accommodate a company's employees'
travel profiles and allow travelers wide flexibility not only in
making airline, hotel and other bookings, but in making last-minute
changes by speaking with someone on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you're en route and something changes _ the weather, a
meeting is rescheduled, the boss calls and says they want you in
North Dakota tomorrow,'' Shaw said. ``These are times when it's not
easy to access the Internet and making a phone call is the way to
get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   About 35 companies are now clients of the service. They pay
nothing for the custom site, and pay fees, which Shaw says are
lower than typical travel agencies charge, for having Rosenbluth's
agents provide telephone assistance in changing tickets, available
around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   How does Rosenbluth make money at this? Well, besides the
telephone-service fees, much of the revenue comes from ``certain
payments from the suppliers whose products we sell, such as an
airline,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, that would be commissions. Oddly enough, as many
struggling small travel agencies were forced to impose fees for
face-to-face transactions to make up for the reduced commissions,
big-brand agencies with huge volumes were negotiating bulk
commissions for bookings from airlines and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that with some of the commission cuts, a lot of local
and regional agencies were getting to the point where they had no
choice but to charge all of their customers a transaction fee,
maybe as much as $20, for booking a ticket,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now obviously with the economics of an Internet business, we
can do the booking online and not charge anything'' for selling the
ticket, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   AIR FARES AND ANTITRUST CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of travel agents and online competition, last week the
American Society of Travel Agents petitioned the Justice Department
to look into possible antitrust violations by major airlines who
announced last month that they would participate jointly in a new
Web site that would offer low-cost tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The travel agents' trade group called the site, scheduled to
start this spring, an anti-competitive ploy to ``lure consumers
onto the Web with lower prices.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Web site said there was no merit to the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The travel agent group, which has been dismissive of online
booking sites until the airlines started getting into the act, said
travel agents still book 80 percent of airline tickets, 95 percent
of cruises and 90 percent of package tours, and most continue to
prosper as overall travel spending increases in a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   AIR FARES AND OIL PRICES
</P>
<P>
   Now that oil prices are wedged in the $30 a barrel range,
airlines are scrambling _ a bit frantically at times _ to keep
profits up as fuel costs soar. Last Friday, Continental Airlines
increased domestic fares by as much as $15. The next day, Delta Air
Lines and American Airlines also raised fares, followed on Sunday
by US Airways, United Air Lines and Trans World Airlines. But
Northwest Airlines stubbornly refused to get on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind!'' yelped the others, fully aware that mischievous
Northwest would undoubtedly get a lot of mileage out of ads
trumpeting that it alone had refused to jack up fares. One by one
on Monday, the others dropped their price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see what happens  &UR; next &LR;  week.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled British Airways, meanwhile, raised trans-Atlantic
fares by 3 percent earlier this month, after earlier increases on
those routes by American competitors. And since January, major
American carriers have been adding a $20 fuel surcharge to most
domestic tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the cost of oil, American Express says, ``typical''
business air fares will rise this year by 3 to 4 percent, to an
average of more than $1,000 round trip _ a higher rate than it
forecast last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying for business will get more expensive than many expected
this year,'' said Rusty Carpenter, vice president of American
Express Consulting Services. He said the predictions on air fare
costs might have to be revised upward later in the year if the
airlines maintained their fuel surcharges.

MY JOB: RESORTING TO TYPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Ann Berrios is a secretary at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook.)  
(lh) 
 By ANN BERRIOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a secretary, it never seemed to matter where or even that I
had gone to college. My college's name on a resume did not exempt
me from the grammar, spelling and typing tests that aspiring
secretaries must endure. Nor did it open doors for me. When I get
my college alumnae magazine, I catch up on classmates who are
physicians, lawyers and late-blooming social workers. I never read
about the secretaries or clerks, though I know they exist. In
college, there were premeds, prelaws and those who did not know
what to do with their lives. It was what I learned in secretarial
school, not college, that has sustained me the last 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   I never bothered to learn my class rank since I thought that
knowledge would do little to make me happy. I left my senior thesis
behind with the professor who was kind enough to read it five
months after it was due.
</P>
<P>
   My mother sent me to an entree program that taught recent
college graduates practical skills like typing and taking
dictation. We new recruits, gleaned mostly from fancy women's
colleges, were thinking that we might have to start as secretaries
but it would not be long before we would either become moguls or
marry moguls.
</P>
<P>
   I have had my share of adventures. One employer's identity
relied largely on his friendship with a king in exile. He once
called me from my desk to meet his friend. After the introduction,
my boss sent me to buy the king a sandwich. I remember two things
about this event: that the king was a lovely person and that my
employer never reimbursed me for the sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, my boss sent me to find a belt as a Christmas
present for the company president, a man of great girth. I soon
found out that most stores sell men's belts only up to size 42, and
this man was a 48 or more. Dispirited, I bought a calculator
instead. My boss laughed; it was the one gift he knew the president
would hate.
</P>
<P>
   I enjoyed watching another boss lead a former first lady across
a crowded ballroom. He looked so proud, his chest swelled. Trouble
was, the first lady stopped to talk with someone along the way. My
boss did not know this but continued stepping grandly as if she
were still behind him and the whole room were still admiring them.
This was his moment _ and mine too.
</P>
<P>
   I have come to the rescue more than once. I remember the day my
boss appeared holding his natural teeth. He had made the unwise
choice of walking up the subway stairs with his hands in his
pockets. I found the surgeon who saved my boss' teeth and, as an
added bonus for me, wired his jaw shut for a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   Secretaries enjoy hearing phrases like, ``We have to move the
office by Wednesday.'' Translated, this means you have to move the
office by Wednesday. Hauling computers, shoving heavy furniture and
squeaking file cabinets across an unforgiving floor can be all part
of the job. Some days I wish I had worn my construction boots
instead of my pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years down; 22 to go. I just may be a lifer of the
secretarial pool.

CITY'S RULE FOR SHELTERS HELD ILLEGAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state court said Tuesday that the Giuliani
administration could not bar single adults from shelters if they
fail to meet work requirements and other welfare eligibility rules.
</P>
<P>
   The court said those shelter regulations, central to Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's policies on the homeless, violated a 1981 court
decree that guaranteed homeless people the right to shelter. And
the court ruled that the decree, the product of the city's own
negotiated settlement, could not lawfully be changed to include the
regulations, adopted four years ago by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Although the city vowed to appeal, the decision carries
considerable weight, because it was issued by Justice Stanley L.
Sklar of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who is responsible for
enforcing the city's pledge to abide by the decree.
</P>
<P>
   The decree is the bedrock of the city's far-reaching right to
shelter, which was extended from single men to women and then to
families with children through other litigation in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision applied only to single adults, but lawyers
for the homeless said they would argue that it also should prevent
the city from ejecting homeless parents from shelters and putting
their children in foster care if they failed to meet the stringent
welfare requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration's efforts to impose its new
eligibility rules, which are based on the four-year-old state
guidelines, have been on hold while the legal challenges are
considered in the court.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``the multitude of bureaucratic requirements'' contained
in the rules the city wants to impose on shelters, Sklar wrote that
the 1981 decree had been fashioned specifically to ensure that
troubled people would at least be assured a bed in a clean, safe
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple bureaucratic error which might send an individual
out into the street, because he or she was unable to understand or
to cooperate with these requirements,'' Sklar wrote in his 24-page
decision, ``might be the error which results in that individual's
death by exposure, death by violence, or death by sheer neglect.
The risk is simply too great to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani predicted that an appeals court would quickly reverse
the ruling, which he described as ``Justice Sklar clinging to his
desire for a city of dependency.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Banks, the Legal Aid lawyer for the Coalition for the
Homeless, said later in reply, ``It's the court trying to maintain
the humanity of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This decision today isn't about whether work is good
or bad for people. It's clearly in no one's interest to have New
Yorkers who suffer from mental or physical or social dysfunction on
the sidewalks of the city, and that's what today's decision
prevents.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city had argued that safeguards would
distinguish between people who were capable of meeting the
requirements and those who were too mentally or physically impaired
to do so. But Sklar found this confidence misguided and noted that
the regulations did not include an exemption for those impaired by
``social dysfunction,'' a category specifically protected by the
decree.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was not an easy one, Sklar wrote. Among the
affidavits supporting the Giuliani administration's position, he
noted, were those of people passionately committed to improving the
lives of the homeless who believe that the regulations can compel
some people to change their behavior and end their dependency on
the shelters.
</P>
<P>
   But equally compelling, the justice said, was testimony from
mental health and medical experts that the difficulties of
diagnosing illness and treating some of the most vulnerable people,
combined with the ``innumerable bureaucratic requirements'' in the
regulations, ``will result in an explosion of homeless individuals,
banished or barred from shelters, risking their health, and perhaps
their lives, on the often bitterly cold, and palpably dangerous
streets of a sadly indifferent city.''
</P>
<P>
   A city lawyer, Leonard Koerner, chief assistant corporation
counsel, agreed with Banks that Tuesday's decision was a forceful
reaffirmation of the court decree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won,'' he said of the plaintiffs. But he added, ``What
Sklar doesn't deal with is how do you get singles to obey the
rules, including going to appointments for treatment, unless
there's a stick. There is no stick, and they do not conform to
normal behavior patterns.''

 &HT;    Crossover votes help McCain capture wins in Michigan, Arizona
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT, Mich. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain on Tuesday scored
convincing wins in Republican primaries in his home state, where
victory was expected, and in Michigan, where he got overwhelming
support from Democrats crossing over to vote in the Republican
primary, exit polls showed.
</P>
<P>
   Independent voters in Michigan also favored McCain, but he would
have lost to Bush if only independents and Republican votes had
counted, the poll results showed.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Bush emphasized his strength among Republican
voters, but McCain predicted that will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the Republicans in the state of Michigan, among those
independents who share our philosophy, our compassionate
conservative philosophy ... There's no question who the winner is
in Michigan tonight and you're looking at him,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said, ``As I look more electable, we'll start drawing
more Republicans. Michigan sent a powerful message across America,
that our party wants real reform from the real reformer. We're
creating a new majority, my friends, a McCain majority.''
</P>
<P>
   With 37 percent of the vote counted in Michigan, McCain was
leading about 50 percent to 44 percent for Bush. Alan Keyes was
running a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won all of Arizona's 30 delegates with his victory there.
His statewide victory in Michigan earned him 10 at-large delegates,
with the remaining 48 delegates to be allocated according to the
winner of each congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll conducted by the Detroit News showed McCain getting
about 26 percent of Michigan's Republican vote, about 66 percent of
the independent vote and 86 percent from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the Voter News Service showed Republicans made up just
49 percent of those who voted Tuesday. Voters who described
themselves as independent cast 33 percent of the votes, while 18
percent said they were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine percent of voters surveyed said they had not
previously voted in a Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio), a national McCain co-chairman, hailed
the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Reagan Democrats and Reagan independents who are
going for McCain, which is very significant,'' he said. ``It means
we have rediscovered the recipe for winning in November and John
McCain is the cook.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed happy to be out of Michigan, where he and McCain
campaigned at a frenetic pace after last Saturday's South Carolina
primary. Bush won in that state and appeared to regain momentum
from McCain, who earlier had won New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the Republican vote,'' Bush said at a stop in
Missouri on Tuesday night, on his way to California. ``God, this is
a long process. This is a marathon and I'm going to be in it all
the way to the end. ... I'm not doing well among liberal Democrats,
but you know, I didn't expect to.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting was heavy in what passed for a balmy February day in
Michigan, with the temperature reaching 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   McCain openly appealed to Democrats, independents,
``libertarians and vegetarians'' as he crisscrossed the state from
picturesque Traverse City along Lake Michigan in the north to the
Detroit suburbs in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley
were not on the Democratic ballot, making it tempting for Democrats
to cross over.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the race was Michigan's third-term Republican
Gov. John Engler, head of Bush's campaign. Engler's Democratic
opponents urged voters to cross over and pick McCain to spite
Engler.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain isn't party building. He's party-borrowing,''
Engler said in a television interview. ``There's a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who has been mentioned as a possible vice
presidential candidate on a Bush ticket, said he was pleased with
the Republican turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is Democrats and independents showed up in record
numbers,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan provided a better test of the candidates' national
appeal than earlier primaries, said DeWine, one of four Republican
senators who has endorsed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find most significant is that this is a big state, a
state that is a must-win state in the fall and the first (primary)
state that is a microcosm of the country,'' DeWine said.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain's backer rejoiced at the outcome, political
analysts cautioned that McCain still faces an uphill fight,
particularly with so-called Super Tuesday coming up March 7 with
primaries in 13 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really relying on the momentum. The good news coverage
communicates to voters that his campaign is viable. That can make
up for lack of organization,'' said John Green, director of the Ray
C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.
</P>
<P>
   McCain still is a long shot for the Republican nomination,
lacking the grass-roots organization that Bush has in the remaining
states, said Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point he has to have the resources to compete in a lot
of states. The more victories he racks up, the more likely he is to
get them,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the campaigning became increasingly negative
leading up to Tuesday. Phone calls supporting McCain were made to
voters suggesting that Bush is anti-Catholic because he sought the
support of ``anti-Catholic'' fundamentalist Protestants in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In return, religious broadcaster Pat Robertson made calls in
support of Bush accusing former New Hampshire Sen. Warren Rudman, a
McCain national co-chairman, of being prejudiced against
conservative Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by what he considered low blows by the Bush campaign in
South Carolina, McCain stormed around Michigan accusing the Texas
governor of being a ``low-road'' campaigner who would stoop to
anything _ including ``character assassination'' to win.
</P>
<P>
   McCain depicted himself as Luke Skywalker from ``Star Wars''
trying to fight his way out of the Death Star. He said he was
surrounded by enemies shooting at him but added ``We're going to
kill 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush kept a busy campaign schedule here, he made less
mention of his Republican opponent. Instead, he lashed out against
the Clinton-Gore administration and regularly listed the number of
days until voters would chase the Democrats from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking Bush's money and organizational strengths, McCain plans
to pinpoint his political activities. California and Ohio will be
major McCain targets, as he tries for come-from-behind victories in
two states that award all their delegates to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of delegates are up for grabs later this week in
America Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. On Feb.
29, Republicans in North Dakota, Virginia and Washington state will
make their choices.

McCAIN BOUNCES BACK IN MICHIGAN 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ John McCain, powered by votes from Democrats and
independents who made up half the record turnout, won the Michigan
Republican presidential primary Tuesday, robbing George W. Bush of
momentum he had counted on before the glut of voting over the next
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also won his home state primary in Arizona, handing Bush
a double loss just as the Texas governor was attempting to build on
his comeback victory Saturday in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   With more than half of the precincts reporting in Michigan,
McCain led Bush 50 percent to 44 percent. In Arizona, with only a
handful of precincts counted, McCain led 67 percent to 29 percent.
Former Reagan administration official Alan Keyes had 4 percent in
Michigan and 3 percent in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, Bush held sway with traditional Republicans,
especially anti-abortion conservatives, according to exit polls.
McCain won enough Republicans to spell victory when they were added
to his strong support from independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, telling supporters in Phoenix that he was ``a proud
Reagan conservative,'' predicted he would draw more Republicans as
he looks more electable. The Michigan result, he said, was a sign
``our party wants real reform from the real reformer. ... I'm going
to give your government back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fear this campaign, my fellow Republicans. Join it,''
McCain urged fellow party members who have shunned his candidacy.
``We are creating a new majority _ a McCain majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush fell back on his claim, used when McCain won in New
Hampshire Feb. 1, that the nomination season is ``a marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm going to be in it all the way to the end _ and some
primaries you win and sometimes you don't,'' Bush declared at a
rally in Kansas City, Mo., where he was refueling his campaign
plane on his way to California as polls closed in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush quickly slapped at McCain's dependence on Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the Republicans in the state of Michigan, among
independents who share our philosophy ... there's no question who
the winner is in Michigan, and you're looking at him,'' he told
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The result was sweet revenge for McCain, who won big in New
Hampshire three weeks ago but faltered badly in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The result, however, also represented a problematic turn for
both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's victory in Michigan, the first populous, industrial
state to sound off in the presidential race, allows the Arizona
senator at least a momentary rebound. But his continued failure to
generate significant support from Republicans points to a sharply
limited appeal with voters who will control the delegate selection
in the most important primaries immediately ahead, including the
megacontests in California, New York and 11 other states March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's double loss not only dampens any momentum he had picked
up out of South Carolina but also highlights his failure to attract
significant Democratic crossover and independent support in any of
the open primaries so far. That points to problems ahead if he wins
the Republican nomination and must compete in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush retains a lead among Republicans in national
polls, soft spots for the Texan are appearing in the short-term
primary calendar. A new University of Massachusetts survey of
Republicans and independents likely to vote in the GOP primary
there March 7 gave McCain 58 percent to 34 percent for Bush.
Analysts said McCain's strength was based in part on the sizable
number of Democrats who have changed their voter registration to
Republican since McCain won the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan exit poll by Voter News Service, a consortium of
The Associated Press and major television networks, found that Bush
was winning more than 6 in 10 Republican voters while McCain was
winning a big majority of independents and more than 8 in 10
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ran especially well with black voters, perhaps because
some minority leaders advocated support for the Arizonan as way of
striking out at Bush's Michigan leader, Republican Gov. John
Engler. But only one in 20 participants in Tuesday's GOP primary
was black.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a chance for a payback,'' Engler said in a CNN
interview. He accused McCain of a cagey strategy to ``rent
Democrats for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   There was technically a Democratic primary in Michigan, but Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley removed their names
from the ballot to comply with national party rules that allow only
Iowa and New Hampshire to hold binding nominating contests before
March 1. Michigan's Democratic National Convention delegates will
be chosen on the basis of caucuses to be held March 11. Arizona
also holds its Democratic primary March 11.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Republican balloting as the only game for all the
state's 6.7 million registered voters regardless of their true
party leanings and offered McCain another whack at independents and
Democrats who have been the most fertile ground for his insurgent
message.
</P>
<P>
   With the close vote, analysts focused on the prospect that
McCain could carve out a narrow victory in the popular vote and
Bush could triumph in the separate race to win delegates to the
Republican National Convention at Philadelphia this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The victor in each of the state's 16 U.S. House districts is
entitled to three delegates, meaning that if McCain's vote is
concentrated in the Democratic-rich Detroit metropolitan area, he
could leave Bush to pick up the district delegates from the
remainder of the state. The statewide popular vote winner gets an
additional 10 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Engler estimated that Bush would win 36 of the 58 delegates at
stake, adding to his small but growing advantage over McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In the brief Michigan campaign, Bush sounded general-election
themes and concentrated his fire on President Clinton and Gore, the
front-runner for the Democratic nomination. McCain, even though he
has sworn off negative ads on television, sharpened his own attack
on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also railed against Bush's almost solid backing from the
Republican establishment, both in Michigan and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all against me,'' McCain said of Bush's support by a
majority of the party's governors and member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The heated campaign in Michigan was marked by charges from both
sides about religious intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was ``a little disappointed'' by calls he said the
McCain campaign made to voters, ``calling me an anti-Catholic
bigot'' for his address to Bob Jones University in South Carolina,
a fundamentalist Christian school that rejects Catholicism.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Sen. John McCain scrambled back into contention in the
Republican presidential race on Tuesday, capitalizing on his
home-state advantage to trounce Gov. George W. Bush in Arizona and
riding a wave of independents and Democrats to gain an edge in
Michigan, polls of voters and early returns indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The voting in Michigan has been watched closely not only because
the campaign here was marked by bitter accusations of unscrupulous
tactics on both sides, but, more important, because it is the first
large-state showdown of the campaign with 58 delegates up for grabs
.
</P>
<P>
   Although early returns showed the race extremely close, McCain
clearly regained some of the footing he lost three days ago in the
South Carolina primary by running well ahead of Bush among
independents and Democrats here _ as well as many people who had
never before voted in a Republican primary. Those voters poured to
the polls, swelling turnout estimates to at least one million, more
than double the totals in primaries here four and eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drew his strength from a different pool of voters: he
attracted far higher proportions of conservatives and Republican
loyalists _ a margin of more than 2 to 1 _ than McCain. But those
voters helped Bush more in South Carolina than here in the Midwest,
where the electorate is far less Republican _ and far less
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   With 61 percent of the precincts reporting in Michigan, McCain
had 50 percent of the vote while Bush had 44 percent. In Arizona,
McCain had 63 percent and Bush 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, smiled broadly on Tuesday night at a rally in Arizona,
where he thanked his constituents, and took an unvarnished dig at
his rival: ``Today Michigan sent a powerful message across America
_ a message that our party wants real reform from the real
reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned his attention to the coming races. ``Now we move
ahead, our crusade is spreading from state after state, attracting
new people to our great party.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made a pointed appeal to members of his own party, who
have overwhelming sided with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make a special plea tonight to my fellow
Republicans,'' he said. ``There are those who rule the
establishment, who want more than anything to defend Washington's
big, money, big spending status quo. They want to fool you about
me. Well, here's some more straight talk. I am a proud Reagan
conservative. I love the Republican Party. It is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Don't fear this campaign my fellow Republicans. Join
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a brief news conference in Kansas City on Tuesday evening,
shortly after the polls closed in Michigan, Bush said,
``Republicans overwhelmingly supported my candidacy. It seems I'm
getting stronger and stronger with Republicans as the primaries go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   And he seemed to recognize the possibility that McCain would
continue to impede what many had once considered an inevitable
march to the nomination. ``This is a long process,'' he said.
``This is a marathon. And I'm going to be in it all the way to the
end. And some primaries you win, and sometimes, you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The two contests on Tuesday were especially critical for McCain
because after Bush's 11-point victory in South Carolina, he has
sought to demonstrate that he is not a one-state wonder who could
only win a primary in a tiny state like New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Bush's advisers had hoped that they could
effectively knock off McCain after Tuesday. And even McCain's aides
had acknowledged that a lopsided defeat in Michigan would have
shattered the chances for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's voting assured that what McCain called ``a wonderful,
wonderful ride'' after his defeat in South Carolina will not be
over. It means that a Republican nominee would probably not emerge
at least until after the candidates sprint through 16 primaries and
caucuses over the next 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the outcome on Tuesday will intensify the focus on
the races next week in Virginia, Washington state and North Dakota.
But the most important voting will be on March 7, which is
something of a national primary, with voters going to the polls in
New York, California, Ohio, Missouri, Georgia, Connecticut and
several other states.
</P>
<P>
   After South Carolina, Bush and McCain rushed to concentrate on
Michigan because the outcome here is far more important. There are
58 delegates at stake in Michigan; 30 in Arizona. McCain was also
widely expected to win in Arizona because he is the favorite son
there who has served three terms in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush's defeat in Arizona, according to the polls,
underscores how the primary season has been far rockier than he or
his advisers had anticipated. Bush enjoyed the energetic backing of
the Republican governor, Jane Dee Hull. And for a time last year,
surveys in Arizona showed Bush ahead of McCain. That led some of
the Bush's advisers to happily predict that they would humiliate
McCain in his own state.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush advisers now insist they never intended to win in
Arizona, they poured as much as $2 million into smothering the
state in television commercials and direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   The see-saw nature of the Republican competition _ while McCain
has won New Hampshire, Bush was victorious in South Carolina and
Delaware _ leaves Bush appearing far less invincible than he seemed
for much of last year when polls showed, month after month, that he
towered over the Republican field and could easily defeat a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the McCain campaign has fastened onto the theme that Bush
is such a weak candidate that he could lose a general election.
</P>
<P>
   But the voting in Michigan pointed to larger difficulties for
both Bush and McCain. Bush's constituency is predominately from his
party's conservative wing, according to the surveys of voters,
conducted by a consortium of the television networks and The
Associated Press. Those so-called exit polls showed McCain with a
slight edge over Bush; McCain also held a narrow leade with with
about a third of the actual votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls also showed that if Bush is the Republican
nominee, it might be difficult for him to attract Republican
moderates, independents and Democrats in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for McCain, the surveys showed, is that he
encountered difficulty attracting members of his own party. That
could be perilous because many of the coming contests are in states
like New York, where, unlike Michigan, only registered Republicans
can participate.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In one of the many indications that McCain and Bush appeal to
opposite ends of the philosophical spectrum, Bush attracted the
majority of voters who want to see abortion made illegal to some
degree, and McCain drew the majority of voters who favored keeping
abortion legal.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive race here was something of an embarrassment for
Gov. John M. Engler, who had promised that his organization would
deliver for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Engler is a controversial figure in this state, and the
surveys showed that his endorsement was a mixed blessing for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan is far more representative of the nation than the
earlier states that have voted because of its large population,
heavy industry, unions and blend of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the electorate in this state on Tuesday was far different
than four years ago. The number of Democrats voting nearly doubled
to 20 percent of the electorate, while the number of Republicans
diminished to about 50 percent, and independents to about 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Democrats accounted for 10 percent of the voters;
Republicans, 62 percent and independents, 28 percent. Nearly half
the voters said they were conservative, and they backed Bush over
cCain by nearly 3 to 1. But nearly 4 in 10 voters described
themselves as moderates; 6 in 10 of them backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While religious conservatives were credited for delivering huge
support to Bush in South Carolina, they were not as much a factor
in Michigan. Fewer than 3 in 10 voters said they considered
themselves to be part of the religious right movement; those who
did voted overwhelmingly for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigning here had been dominated by often harsh exchanges
over which campaign was most negative, which each side accusing the
other of planting unsavory information about the candidates through
phone banks and mailings.
</P>
<P>
   But while voters in South Carolina concluded that McCain was
behind a more negative campaign, voters here said Bush was slightly
more negative. Nearly 4 in 10 said Bush had been attacking McCain
unfairly; while more than a third said McCain had been attacking
Bush unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the verbal assaults, voters here and in Arizona said
they were most concerned with the candidates' personal character _
not their stands on issues. That was one of McCain's great
strengths in the voting on Tuesday. He had the wide backing of
voters who said a candidates' personal qualities matters more than
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Michigan, 3 in 10 voters said they were looking for a
candidate who stands up for what he believes in; McCain won nearly
6 in 10 of their votes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also was said to be more honest about his beliefs than
Bush. And half the voters said McCain says what he believes rather
than what people want to hear; only 4 in 10 said the same of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a contrast to South Carolina, where Bush successful
appropriated Mr. McCain's mantle of reform, the senator regained
his reform image in Michigan. Asked who the real reformer was,
voters were more likely to say McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ran advertisements emphasizing his ``reformer with
results'' mantra, but McCain repeatedly declared that if his rival
was a reformer he was ``an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, McCain overwhelmed Bush in virtually every
demographic group _ except among voters who consider themselves
very conservative and those who want to make abortion illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The voters in Arizona are staunchly Republican and
overwhelmingly conservative, fitting closely to the profile of
Bush's backers. But McCain appeared to win them over because of his
deep roots in the state.

ANALYSIS: BUSH HITS A POTHOLE IN MICHIGAN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DETROIT _ This road is nothing but bumps.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire knocked Gov. George W. Bush's bandwagon off the
highway. Then, last Saturday, South Carolina derailed Sen. John
McCain's Straight Talk Express. Tuesday, after a meager two-day
campaign, Bush hit a sizable pothole in Michigan, right in the
middle of his turnpike to victory.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's narrow but ever-so-vital edge here was reinforced by an
overwhelming victory in his home state of Arizona, where Bush had
once hoped to make inroads.
</P>
<P>
   So McCain lives to fight another day, and Bush, with his cloak
of inevitability further frayed, must find somewhere else to drive
the Arizonan from the contest. Bush tried to look past McCain in
his speeches here, concentrating his fire on President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore, the most likely Democratic nominee. That
proved premature.
</P>
<P>
   Although it sounded at the time like wishful thinking, McCain
prophesied on Sunday that Michigan would differ from South
Carolina. In South Carolina, he said, ``it was very clear that we
were wiped out by the so-called Christian right, and that's where a
lot of this hate stuff was directed'' _ implying that Republican
conservatives would count for less on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has more money, more prominent backers and two
powerful geographic bases _ Florida, where his brother Jeb is
governor, and his own state of Texas _ Bush must still be counted
the front-runner. He also demonstrated again Tuesday his ability to
beat McCain handily among Republicans, and in many of the primaries
ahead they are the only ones who get to vote.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, McCain can now entertain legitimate hopes of
rekindling the widespread enthusiasm he generated in the campaign's
early weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The results in Michigan, much the most representative state to
vote so far this year, also contained dire warnings for both of the
candidates. This is the eighth-most-populous state, with a highly
competitive two-party system, a downsizing government, prosperous
farms and a growing, highly innovative economy: the kind of state
all presidential candidates shoot for.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was outpolled 60 to 40 by McCain among moderate voters
here. Such voters usually hold the key to presidential elections.
Having allied himself firmly with the far right in South Carolina,
he apparently suffered for that in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the poll of voters conducted by the television networks
and The Associated Press contained no denominational questions,
many politicians suggested that the governor's visit two weeks ago
to Bob Jones University, which is often accused of
anti-Catholhad hurt him among Roman Catholic voters in the
blue-collar suburbs of Detroit and other big cities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, George Bush, lost centrist voters to Bill
Clinton, and with them the election of 1992, and then Bob Dole did
the same thing in 1996. This year, the Republican leaders who
flocked to the Texas governor did so in large part because they
thought he would have broader appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Delighted though he was to do so well here, McCain must worry
about the uncomfortable degree to which his advantage depended upon
Democrats and independents. Bush took two-thirds of the Republican
vote, and only the astounding fact that Democrats and independents
accounted for more than 50 percent of Tuesday's electorate pulled
the Arizona senator through.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that the non-Republican turnout reached record
proportions for a Republican primary, partly because of local
ballot issues in some places. There were hints that at least a few
Democrats deliberately voted in the Republican primary to foul up
the other party's process.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael Flashner, 31, a Democratic sales representative in the
Detroit suburbs, backed McCain. Asked why, he replied: ``To tell
the truth, I'd like to see the process go on as long as it can,
because the more they beat each other up, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John M. Engler, who had put his political prestige on the
line for Bush, confessed Tuesday night that he may have
miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if we could just get the Republican vote out,'' he
said, ``we could withstand whatever Democrats and independents came
out for McCain. I didn't see any need to go up on television and
warn about this wave of Democratic and independent voters. Maybe
that was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to attract voters across party lines augurs well for
McCain's chances this fall, should he be nominated, but it will not
help him in many of the primaries that take place soon. Virginia's
voting next Tuesday and Georgia's and Ohio's on March 7 are open to
all registered voters, but only registered Republicans can vote in
primaries in Washington State next Tuesday and in New York on March
7. In California, also on March 7, non-Republicans can cast
ballots, but their votes will not count in awarding delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the electorate was much more balanced than in South
Carolina, from a number of points of view. Half the voters here
described themselves as conservatives; 60 percent did so in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, 34 percent called themselves Christian
conservatives. Fewer than 3 voters in 10 here said they identified
with the religious right, a decline from 1988, when Pat Robertson
ran strongly here, and 1996, when Patrick J. Buchanan took 34
percent of the total in giving Dole a tough fight.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson recorded telephone messages to Michigan voters this
year urging them to turn out in support of Bush, accusing McCain of
having chosen, in former Sen. Warren E. Rudman of New Hampshire, a
``vicious bigot'' as national chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Because the voting here followed almost immediately on the heels
of that in South Carolina, the results there may not have had time
to sink in and generate a surge for Bush. Not until election day
itself, the exit poll indicated, did a small swing to the Texas
governor get under way.
</P>
<P>
   Michiganders, subjected for a much shorter period to bombardment
by the artillery of radio and television advertisements, took a
different view of the candidates on important points. There, McCain
was seen as the less fair of the two contenders; here, Bush was,
although McCain took a more caustic tone in his personal
appearances. There, Bush and McCain were seen as equally likely to
say what they believed rather than what people wanted to hear;
here, McCain had an advantage on that score.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Breadon, a United Auto Workers member who works on a
Chrysler production line, said in explaining his vote for McCain:
``I really don't care for George Bush. He seems like a daddy's boy.
He seems like a weasel.'' An independent, Breadon voted in Royal
Oak, north of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the voters said they belonged to a union, and McCain
took 6 of every 10 votes in that group. But that margin lent little
credibility to the argument, voiced by some Bush backers, that the
state's big trade unions had set out to disrupt Engler's pro-Bush
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McCain seemed to have gone some way toward
reclaiming his identity as a reformer, for which Bush successfully
challenged in the last few weeks with the slogan proclaiming
himself a ``reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, McCain did less well than he had hoped among two
groups he has targeted. A Vietnam veteran who spent years as a
prisoner of war, he got the votes of only slightly more veterans
than Bush. And he did less well than his rival among young voters,
especially under 30.

<P>
   ROMULUS, Mich. _ Even as Michigan residents cast their votes and
time ticked away before the polls here closed, Gov. George W.
Bush's campaign officials worked Tuesday to assure the state's
Roman Catholics that Bush was a friend who deserved their support.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute effort was a response both to negative telephone
calls about Bush that some Michigan Catholics said they had
received and to speculation by some political analysts that Bush's
alliances with Christian conservatives _ and, especially, his visit
earlier this month to Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C. _
had upset Catholic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The effort also reflected the fact that the race here, unlike
the New Hampshire or South Carolina primaries, was much too close
to call and involved a number of factors that could determine the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his day by railing against the phone calls, which
portrayed him as anti-Catholic and which he attributed to the
campaign of Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign has said that it did not authorize the phone
calls but allowed for the possiblity that they may have been made
by over-exhuberant volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, John McCain, he's a man who's called me an
anti-Catholic bigot, and I don't appreciate it,'' Bush said during
a visit to a restaurant in nearby Royal Oak on Tuesday morning.
``That's shameful politics.''
</P>
<P>
   To pound home the Texas governor's message, the Bush campaign
electronically mailed, in the span of just 42 minutes after 1 p.m.,
nine different news releases containing statements from nine
Republican governors, all of whom denounced the telephone calls.
Many of the governors are Catholic, and many assumed the McCain
campaign was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah called McCain's tactics
``shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts labeled McCain a ``typical
Washington politician who says one thing then does another,''
echoing some of Bush's attack ads, and said, ``He should be
ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also released a similar statement from Tom
Monaghan, the founder of Domino's Pizza and an active benefactor of
Catholic causes in the Detroit area.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Roman Catholic,'' Monaghan said, ``I am offended that my
faith is being used as a negative smear tactic to divide people in
a political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a script of the telephone call that the Bush
campaign released Tuesday, a recorded message notes that Bush
visited Bob Jones University, whose officers in the past have made
anti-Catholic statements. Bush has said repeatedly over the last
few days that he does not agree with those statements and has noted
that his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The script provided by the Bush campaign reads: ``Governor
George Bush has campaigned against Senator John McCain by seeking
the support of Southern fundamentalists who have expressed
anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Jones has made strong anti-Catholic statements, including
calling the pope anti-Christ, the Catholic church a satanic cult,''
according to the script. ``Governor Bush has stayed silent.''
</P>
<P>
   By releasing the script and the blizzard of statements, the Bush
campaign was perhaps doing more than assuring Catholics that they
had nothing to fear from the governor.
</P>
<P>
   It may also have been diverting attention from reports that the
evangelist Pat Robertson, a supporter of Bush, had recorded and
sent an incendiary telephone message branding McCain a foe of
conservative Christians and an insufficient opponent of abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Several political analysts said that the Robertson call,
emblematic of the tough politics that Bush's allies on the
religious right used to guarantee Bush's victory in the South
Carolina primary, could hurt Bush with moderate voters if he does
not quickly establish some distance from Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be put back into the bottle,'' Scott Reed, who ran
Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, said of Robertson.
``Somebody should pick up the phone and tell him to stop. He is way
over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Tuesday that Robertson had made the calls
independently of his campaign, an assertion that Robertson
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   As early surveys of voters leaving the polls Tuesday afternoon
gave a slight edge to McCain, the Bush campaign stepped up efforts
behind the scenes, turning to an army of volunteers much bigger
than the Arizona senator's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call longer, call louder,'' said a senior adviser to Bush
about the message the campaign was sending into the field.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also enjoyed an advantage over McCain in terms of radio and
television advertising. Bush's advisers estimated that the Bush
campaign bought $2.6 million worth of advertising in Michigan,
while the McCain campaign spent $2 million.

MCCAIN, BACK IN THE RUNNING, REACHES OUT TO GOP LOYALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ With his insurgent campaign brought back to life
Tuesday night by victories in the Michigan and Arizona primaries,
Sen. John McCain reached out to loyalists in his party, imploring,
``Don't fear this campaign, my fellow Republicans _ join it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three days after a drubbing in South Carolina looked like
it could be the death knell for his campaign, McCain was exuberant,
grinning and saying, ``What a difference a couple of days make.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that his victory in Michigan relied on his crossover
appeal to Democrats and independents, he immediately began trying
to shore up his support from Republicans in preparation for the
next round of primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make a special plea tonight to my fellow
Republicans,'' he said in a hotel ballroom in his hometown here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who rule the establishment who want more than
anything to defend Washington's big money, big spending status quo.
They want to fool you about me. Well, here is some more straight
talk: I am proud Reagan conservative. I love the Republican Party.
It is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   The night's victories _ most particularly the one in Michigan _
made McCain viable again and propelled him and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas forward into a fierce cross-country struggle for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule ahead still presents a formidable challenge to
McCain's underdog campaign, which largely lacks institutional
support as Bush has piled up the endorsements from governors and
has a national apparatus in place.
</P>
<P>
   Showdowns loom next Tuesday in Washington, Virginia and North
Dakota. And on March 7, the delegate rich powerhouses of California
and New York vote, as well as Ohio, Georgia and a host of New
England states.
</P>
<P>
   Asked as he voted Tuesday morning whether the Michigan primary
was ``do or die'' for him, McCain said: ``Every day is do or die.
We're a high-wire act and an insurgency campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again Tuesday Bush won handily among Republicans in
Michigan while McCain drew independents and Democrats into the GOP
primary. While that shows McCain's potential appeal in a general
election, it also represents a challenge for him. (In his home
state, the results were somewhat different, with Bush winning
support only from the most conservative Republicans.)
</P>
<P>
   While some of the states ahead have open primaries, like
Michigan's, others only allow party members to vote. And while
California has an open primary, its 162 delegates are allotted only
on the basis of how Republicans vote.
</P>
<P>
   In order to shore up his support among Republicans, McCain began
Tuesday night trying to hammer home the theme that he is the one
who can best propel his party to victory in November. ``We are
creating a new majority, my friends, a McCain majority,'' he said,
``and we are Al Gore's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was also preparing to begin airing a new commercial in
California, Washington, and Virginia, perhaps as early as Thursday,
to try to pick up ground with Republicans, his aides said. Striking
similar tones as his victory speech, the advertisement will likely
feature McCain looking into the camera and saying that the
establishment is running ads to fool voters about him.
</P>
<P>
   It will then stress his economic message of fighting against
pork-barrel spending, and his plan for tax cuts for the middle
class while devoting much of the surplus to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to end Washington's outrageous pork barrel spending,''
McCain said Tuesday night. ``I want to rebuild our military,
strengthen our families, protect the unborn, and cut your taxes. I
want to use the surplus the right way, by keeping our obligation to
shore up Social Security, fix Medicare and pay down our debt.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides argue that Washington, California, New York and
New England now represent fertile ground for McCain's message of
reform Republicanism and that Bush will be haunted by the tenor of
his South Carolina campaign and his close alliance with the
Christian right. ``South Carolina did not define this campaign,''
said Davis, the senator's campaign manager. ``Unfortunately for
Bush, he got defined in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Evans, Washington state's former governor, recently switched
from Bush to endorse McCain, as did Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who
criticized Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   And though the pace now becomes punishing and the campaigns have
to be waged simultaneously coast to coast, McCain's aides said that
Bush's vast spending in South Carolina, Michigan and Arizona has
virtually eliminated his fund-raising advantage and that they could
now come closer to matching his television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that, Carla Eudy, McCain's finance chairwomen, said
the campaign was sending out new direct mail, telemarketing and
Internet appeals for cash and that fund-raisers were planned for
Thursday in San Francisco and Friday in Los Angeles.

 FERNANDO BENITEZ, 88, MEXICAN WRITER, DIES  (jw) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Fernando Benitez Gutierrez, a journalist who
helped formulate new visions of Mexican identity in his penetrating
reports on the Indian cultures and through the cultural
publications that he founded, died Monday of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   He was 88, a government biography said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most important work was a four-volume ``Indians of
Mexico,'' published in 1967. It was based on nearly 20 years of
reporting that included extensive travels by burro and on foot
through the most remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made an invisible population visible to us,'' Carlos
Fuentes, the novelist, wrote of Benitez in a remembrance published
Tuesday in the newspaper Reforma. ``He once told me that when an
Indian dies, it's as though an entire library had died.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez's career sprawled across half a century, from the '30s
through the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   As editor of a series of cultural supplements to Mexican
newspapers, Benitez encouraged several important writers, including
Carlos Monsivais, Jose Emilio Pacheco and Elena Poniatowska, early
in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a powerful promoter of talent,'' Poniatowska said in an
interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez was born in Mexico City. The Biographical Dictionary of
the Mexican Government lists his birth date as Jan. 16, 1912. Two
newspapers, La Jornada and Universal, put his birth date as Jan.
16, 1910. A reporter at La Jornada said she had seen government tax
documents listing that birth date.
</P>
<P>
   He was the oldest of four children. His father, the heir to a
mining fortune who was educated in Paris, eventually frittered away
the wealth drinking in bars, Benitez told associates.
</P>
<P>
   His youth played out against the epic violence of the Mexican
revolution, leaving him with images ``that influenced the rest of
my life,'' Benitez wrote in an essay on the absurd slaughter
suffered mainly by poor Mexicans in that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood that there was not one Mexico, but many
Mexicos,'' he wrote. ``The Indians, the slaves on the plantations,
the wretched of the earth. They were as innocent as children. They
weren't civilized, rational beings. And almost all of them would be
murdered by generals who were, in fact, rational beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez's writings portrayed a revolution sparked by humanistic
ideals that were gradually betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he believed that successive presidents of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has governed without
interruption since 1929, made important contributions to
development, and he occasionally defended presidents against other
writers' criticism.
</P>
<P>
   He was private secretary to the interior minister in 1946, and
in 1991, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari named him ambassador
to the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   A massacre of students by a government-sponsored paramilitary
group in 1971 provoked severe accusations by prominent
intellectuals against President Luis Echeverria, according to an
account written by the historian Enrique Krauze.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to choose between Echeverria and fascism,'' Benitez
responded to the president's critics, Krauze related.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez's career began in 1936 with El Nacional, a government
paper. After he became editor there, he founded a supplement called
The Mexican Magazine of Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving El Nacional in 1949, he joined another paper, Novedades,
where he founded a similar supplement, Mexico in Culture, editing
it through the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, he edited Culture in Mexico, a section of the
magazine Siempre! In the late '70s and '80s, he edited cultural
sections for two other papers, Unomasuno and La Jornada.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote very well, and he wrote a lot, but he didn't limit
himself to that,'' the poet Gabriel Zaid wrote Tuesday. ``Instead,
he passed his life helping others to write, organizing literary
circles that workedmarvelously, greatly elevating Mexican
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Georgina Conde Taboada; a son, Fernando
Benitez Conde; and a sister, Ana.

MAN STEALS VEHICLE, DRAGS BOY CAUGHT IN SEAT BELT TO HIS DEATH

<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ A man driving a stolen Chevrolet Blazer
dragged a 6-year-old Blue Springs, Mo., boy about five miles to his
death Tuesday before a group of horrified motorists chased and
caught the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, police had not released the name of the man
arrested in the death of Jake Robel.
</P>
<P>
   Independence police said the incident started about 4:15 p.m. at
a sandwich shop. Employees there became suspicious when they
noticed a man loitering outside.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a woman pulled up to the restaurant, left her
Blazer running and went inside, leaving her son inside the vehicle.
Police Sgt. Gregg Wilkinson said the man outside then jumped into
the sport-utility vehicle and tried to shove Jake out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably thought he'd gotten the kid out, because then he
took off,'' Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jake was tangled in the seat belt and was left dangling from
the driver's side rear door.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Thompson, 38, of Independence, was heading south on
Missouri 291 when the thief sped past him. Something caught
Thompson's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, that's a baby!'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   He chased the Blazer, honking his horn and trying to get the
driver's attention. He said he was traveling at least 80 mph but
couldn't catch up. He followed the driver onto Interstate 70.
</P>
<P>
   Fred and Brad Byam, two brothers from Oak Grove, Mo., were
driving west on I-70 a half mile from the Noland Road exit when the
Blazer sped by. They saw the boy being dragged and joined the
chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought somebody's kid had fallen out the door, so we were
just trying to stop him and alert them,'' Fred Byam said.
</P>
<P>
   The thief sped up an exit ramp and headed north. Just then the a
stoplight turned red, and the Blazer stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The Byam brothers pulled their truck in front of the Blazer to
block its path.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were still thinking it was just an accident,'' Brad Byam
said.
</P>
<P>
   The thief got out of the Blazer, saw Jake dangling from the seat
belt, muttered something, then jumped back into the Blazer, Brad
Byam said.
</P>
<P>
   The thief drove forward and rammed Fred Byam's truck in the rear
left side. Then the thief backed into a car that also had joined
the pursuit, Brad Byam said.
</P>
<P>
   The Byam brothers ran to the truck, yanked the keys out of the
ignition and threw them on the ground. The two pulled the driver
out of the Blazer.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to escape, Fred Byam said. By then, other men who saw
the commotion joined the struggle and wrestled the man to the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fought like a wildcat,'' Fred Byam said. ``The four of us
were having trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Byam yelled at John Rodgers, who had joined the struggle,
to get some rope from his truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tied his feet up,'' Fred Byam said. ``We didn't think we
could hold him until the police got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence police arrived shortly before 4:30 p.m. and took
the man away.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-year-old boy from one of the pursuing vehicles took a
large white blanket from his mother's car and placed it over the
young victim.
</P>
<P>
   Jake's body lay at the side of the stolen Blazer until about
5:50 p.m. Most of the boy's clothes had been ripped away.
</P>
<P>
   Independence police were examining videotape from the restaurant
in hopes that some of the thief's actions were caught on tape.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second dragging death in as many weeks in the Kansas
City area. On Feb. 14, Sandra L. Roberts, 41, of Kansas City, Mo.,
was dragged to death as a man driving a stolen car fled police.
Nobody has been charged in that death.
</P>
<P>
   Long after police took charge at Tuesday's accident, the Byam
brothers lingered and stared blankly at the white blanket that
shielded the victim from the eyes of onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just terrible,'' Brad Byam said, tears welling in his
eyes. ``I don't see how people can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a helpless feeling seeing that kid,'' Fred Byam
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was his wedding anniversary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, all I'll remember is that this is the day I saw
that kid dragged.''

SUSUMU OHNO, 71, AUTHORITY ON GENES' WORKINGS IN EMBRYOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Susumu Ohno, an influential figure in clinical genetics,
died Jan. 13 at the City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., a
Los Angeles suburb. He was 71 and lived in the nearby town of
Glendora.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, said the City of Hope National
Medical Center, where he worked for four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Ohno, recognized internationally for his work with genes,
provided a better understanding of just how they determine whether
a mammal's embryo will grow into a male or female fetus.
</P>
<P>
   His earlier research, in the 1950s and '60s, delved into the
theory that evolution occurs through duplication, rather than
alteration, of genes. His innovative approach influenced
investigators in that field.
</P>
<P>
   He was a former chairman of the division of biology at the City
of Hope medical center and retired from its Beckman Research
Institute in 1996 as a distinguished scientist emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   Susumu Ohno was born to Japanese parents in Seoul, Korea, and
was educated in Japan. He received a doctorate in veterinary
medicine at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology in
1949 and doctorates in pathology (1956) and cytology (1961) from
Hokkaido University. He was a researcher in pathology at Tokyo
University until joining the staff at City of Hope.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which gave him its Amory
Prize for Reproductive Biology in 1981. He published some 350
papers in scientific journals.
</P>
<P>
   Ohno is survived by his wife of 48 years, Midori Aoyama Ohno;
two sons, Azusa, of West Hollywood, Calif., and Takeshi, of Las
Vegas; a daughter, Yukali Ohno-Davenport of Hawaii; three brothers,
Shimesu, Yasushi and Tasumaro, all of Japan, and a sister, Akiko
Furusawa of Tokyo.

THEY CAN'T PUNISH McSORLEY ENOUGH 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marty McSorley, who made his NHL bones as Wayne Gretzky's
bodyguard during the Great One's Edmonton Oilers heyday, has
finally picked a fight with a bully bigger than he is: the entire
National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   He's about to find out what it feels like to be pummeled
senseless. He deserves no less.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Bruins' bad boy, immediately suspended indefinitely
yesterday after NHL execs saw the tapes of his unprovoked assault
and battery on Vancouver's Donald Brashear late Monday night, is
expected to be banished for at least the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He could get life without parole and may yet, if the legal
authorities get involved in Vancouver, as they have been
threatening to do.
</P>
<P>
   You know the Mounties: They always get their man.
</P>
<P>
   By now, you've heard what happened and it's no laughing matter:
The final few seconds of a tough, physical game between the Canucks
and Bruins were ticking off the clock when McSorley, skating up
behind Brashear, swung his stick two-handed like a broadsword,
chopping it viciously into the side of the unsuspecting Canuck's
head.
</P>
<P>
   Brashear was unconscious before he even knew what hit him. His
helmet flew off and his head snapped sickeningly against the ice.
His eyes glazed and blood dripping from his nose, Brashear lay
helplessly as McSorley skated in a circle, taunting him.
</P>
<P>
   It was the act of a coward and one that will surely brand the
36-year-old McSorley for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He is lucky that Brashear is still alive; lucky that the Canuck,
who was carried off on a stretcher, somehow walked out of the arena
and into a hospital on his own feet. Brashear has a concussion from
the attack, but it could have been so much worse.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the NHL has to consider when it hands down its
ruling. They got lucky this time. But what about the next time some
goon decides to ambush another player? What if the stick connects
with the temple, or cracks someone's spine? What if an almost
unimaginable tragedy occurs right there on the ice?
</P>
<P>
   It can't, and that's why McSorley will almost surely get the
longest suspension in league history. If he's banned only for the
rest of the season, that's 23 games. The previous longest
suspension in league history is 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   Even that might not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McSorley plays another game in this league, then this
league is a joke,'' Canucks defenseman Mattias Ohlund told the
``Vancouver Sun'' after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst thing I've ever seen. That guy \RMcSorley\S
should be treated the same as if he tried to kill a guy on the
street, because that's what he could have done had he hit Brash
across the neck with his stick.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what the NHL doesn't want to happen. It's why it
will react quickly and decisively to deal with the incident. The
attack itself, which might have stemmed from a first-period fight
in which Brashear got the best of McSorley, the third
most-penalized player in NHL history, is bad enough. But from an
image perspective, the last thing the league wants is to have the
police and court system get involved.
</P>
<P>
   It has happened before, but it's something the NHL would much
rather avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of incidents happen, hopefully seldom, but they do
happen,'' Stars general manager Bob Gainey said yesterday. ``The
league has handled them in a way that make people feel they get
handled promptly and that the parties involved, whether you're the
guilty party or the victim, feel that they've been taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we felt that way when Derian Hatcher was suspended here
a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher was suspended for seven games at the beginning of the
playoffs last season for a devastating hit that broke the jaw of
Phoenix center Jeremy Roenick. One big difference: Hatcher didn't
use his stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the NHL monitors and regulates and disciplines the
players in the league, as they have, they should be allowed to do
that,'' Gainey added. ``The fact that he's been asked to go to New
York to discuss the case indicates that this will be similar to
disciplinary actions that have happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Gainey said, ``is not a good sign'' for McSorley.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there haven't been many good signs for McSorley for
a long time now. He is an anachronism in a sport trying desperately
to clean up its image and convince people that the game itself is
worth watching, and that this isn't just the Friday night fights on
ice.
</P>
<P>
   Even McSorley's teammates were stunned at the sneak attack that
came with just 2.7 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good night if you're a hockey player right now,''
said Bruins captain Ray Bourque in the subdued Boston locker room
after the game. ``You don't want to be a part of anything like
that. There is no room for it and you can't justify it.''
   Goalie Byron Dafoe, who suffered an injured knee when Brashear
fell on him in the first period, couldn't believe what he'd seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not acceptable,'' he said. ``It's just not hockey.
It's the worst thing I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   These were McSorley's teammates and friends. You can imagine
what the Canucks were saying in the other locker room.
</P>
<P>
   There's no place for that kind of thuggery in the NHL any more,
and there's no place for a dinosaur like McSorley.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky doesn't need him any more. Neither does the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few minutes after the game had ended, the gravity of
what he'd just done had began to sink in with McSorley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be repercussions, but that's the last thing I'm
thinking about right now,'' he said with obviously sincere remorse.
``We've got to be proud to play in the NHL. That's not proud.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not. For a long time, McSorley has stood up to anyone
who dared to drop the gloves with him. He took on one and all. Now
he must stand and accept responsibility for his own despicable
actions.
</P>
<P>
   He should not only quietly and without protest accept whatever
suspension the NHL hands him, he should then hang up his skates and
walk away.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse. He could have killed someone.

 &HT;    Insurgent now must mend GOP fences, experts say
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John McCain has now won three out of the four
primaries in which he has campaigned against George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's victories in Arizona and Michigan on Tuesday gave him a
desperately needed boost 72 hours after Bush won the South Carolina
primary.
</P>
<P>
   But his .750 batting average gives McCain a powerful new
argument to take to Washington state and California, where he will
campaign for the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are creating a new majority my friends, a McCain majority.
And we are Al Gore's worst nightmare,'' McCain said at his victory
celebration in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's top communications aide put it more bluntly. ``It's
clear that South Carolina was an aberration,'' said Dan Schnur,
McCain's communications director. ``Bush has not demonstrated that
he can win a contested primary in a state not dominated by
religious conservative voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if one of McCain's wins _ in his home state of Arizona _
was expected, McCain recorded victories in states in which the top
elected Republicans were arrayed against him. (Bush also won the
Iowa caucuses and the Delaware primary, but McCain did not campaign
in either state.)
</P>
<P>
   He will face the same obstacles in most other states as he and
Bush duel in 16 contests over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had hoped to cut off McCain's campaign in Michigan, one of
his so-called firewalls. Michigan Gov. John Engler had boasted that
his state would be the asbestos that would contain McCain's fire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's performance Tuesday poked another hole in the Bush
campaign's argument that their man is best suited to take on the
Democrats in the general election, said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at the Claremont Graduate University in
suburban Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's opportunity is to take advantage of some nervousness
that might exist on the part of California Republicans that perhaps
Bush isn't what they thought he was going to be, that he is not the
stronger candidate against Gore or Bradley,'' Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, national polls show that McCain performs much better
than Bush against Vice President Al Gore. Oddly, McCain increased
his lead over Gore in the Gallup Poll that followed Saturday's
South Carolina primary, while Bush's narrow advantage over Gore
remained steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with inevitability is that you're only inevitable
until you aren't,'' Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
   But the results in Michigan, in particular, point up a looming
problem for McCain. At some point, he has to begin to impress
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself was aware of his dilemma. ``Don't fear this
campaign, my fellow Republicans. Join it. Join it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued in Michigan to rack up overwhelming numbers
among the independents and Democrats who voted in the Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
   But exit polls in Michigan indicated that George W. Bush beat
McCain by more than 2 to 1 among Republicans, roughly the same
picture that emerged from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The peril for the Arizona senator is that upcoming primaries in
California and New York on March 7 will count only Republican votes
for the purposes of allocating delegates to the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   There is no path to the GOP nomination that does not include
winning key states on the basis of Republican _ not independent or
Democratic _ support. Ultimately, the race will become a battle for
the 1,033 delegates that are needed to secure the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain appealed to rank-and-file Republicans, he again
jabbed at the Republican leaders who oppose him. ``They want to
fool you about me,'' he said. ``Here's some more straight talk. I'm
a proud Reagan conservative. I love the Republican Party. It is my
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffe suggested that McCain could begin to repair his image
among Republicans in California by toning down his reform message
and campaign rhetoric that portrays him as an outsider. ``He has to
show Republicans that he is a true conservative,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That task may be harder after the campaigns in Michigan and
South Carolina. In both states, McCain was practically in open
warfare with the Republican establishment, which was strongly
supportive of Bush in both states, and with religious
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But Californians probably will see McCain television ads that
make use of images of McCain with Ronald Reagan, a California
Republican icon. And in California, core Republicans who watched
Democrats take over all but two statewide offices might be prepared
to vote for a candidate they think can win, even if they find him
occasionally irritating.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will be trying to walk a fine line in coming weeks,
seeking more Republican votes without diminishing the enthusiasm of
independents who have turned out to support him in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In several states, including Virginia next week, the Republican
primaries are open to independents, and in some cases, Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The cluster of March 7 primaries includes Georgia, where the
primary is open to all voters, and much of New England, where
independents can vote in the GOP contests.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts provided more powerful evidence of McCain's appeal
across party lines when Secretary of State William F. Galvin
announced this week that nearly 30,000 people had changed their
party registration to make themselves eligible for the March 7
Republican primary. A new University of Massachusetts poll shows
McCain with a sizable lead over Bush, 58 percent to 34 percent,
among Republicans and independents who are likely to vote in that
primary.

BEWILDERED STARS WINGER HULL FEELING POWERLESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Brett Hull said he wasn't concerned about the Stars'
struggling power play. But he is.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said some of the blame should go to the coaches. But he
blames himself as much if not more.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said a lot about the power play after Monday's 5-2 loss to
Nashville, which said Hull is just as frustrated as the rest of the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a scorer, and we're not scoring,'' Hull said. ``What do
you think?''
</P>
<P>
   With the Stars struggling to score goals, as they have been all
season, the power play can provide the gap between winning and
losing. Scorers such as Hull feel pressure, maybe more than others,
when it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   He had 15 power-play goals last season. He has 17 goals this
season, nine on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the frustration, when you have people who expect to
score and contribute in that way,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``When they aren't, they are not happy people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull certainly isn't the only one feeling the power outage. The
Stars scored on 18.8 percent of their power plays during the
1998-99 regular season. The numbers bumped to 12.1 percent in the
playoffs. They've scored on 14.3 percent this season, dropping to
10.8 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the playoffs last year, it hasn't been going,'' said
Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor, who plays the point on the power
play. ``It's the guys on it who have to take all of the blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Blame, of course, can be a dangerous thing in a locker room.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Stars sat down after Monday's game and talked
about what was going wrong. Not just on the power play, but with
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we did talk,'' Sydor said. ``But our biggest thing is
we've got to get our power play going because we're going to need
it.''
</P>
<P>
   How big can one power-play goal be?
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 22-5 this season when scoring a power-play goal.
The Stars have played 60 games. They've won 33 of them. Do the
math. Only 11 times this season have they won without the benefit
of a power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just about every team in the league can say they're better
when their power play is working. But the Stars are definitely much
worse when theirs isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it's just the power play, and that's the
primary focus,'' Hitchcock said. ``That's too easy. That's an easy
out.''
</P>
<P>
   They're called a strong defensive team, holding opponents to 2.2
goals a game. They've had to be. They've scored only 14 goals more
than they've allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose that in our game with the goals we are scoring we
would really be in trouble,'' Stars center Mike Modano said of the
defense. ``We picked up in that area, knowing that we're not
scoring many goals, two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   The gap between two and three goals a game is huge. The Stars
are 22-1 this season when scoring three or more goals. The gap, the
Stars say, could be provided by the power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can ride the power play,'' Stars captain and defenseman
Derian Hatcher said. ``I know you don't want to rely on it, but
it's nice once in a while to be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoring on the power play should be easy, right?
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help, too, when you have power-play units that you
practice with and you go out in a game and Coach puts different
people with you,'' Hull said. ``Mike knows what I'm going to do. I
know what Zubie's \RSergei Zubov\S doing and Syd's doing and right
now Brenden Morrow, and then you're thrown out there with two other
guys. You don't know what side you are working or who is going
where on the breakout.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have used basically the same power-play unit all
season, with Hull, Modano, Sydor and Zubov among the mainstays.
Hitchcock said he would've used the same group on their fourth
power play Monday, but some of the key personnel had just come off
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's frustration talking.
</P>
<P>
   `` I think it's not just the power play,'' Hitchcock said.
``It's when you feel a responsibility to score and to be
responsible in that area and don't get the job done and it's not
getting done, then frustration sometimes sets in. Everybody goes
through it. The frustration is not there when the team wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull said nobody talks about the struggling power play when the
team is winning. But he, like his teammates, realizes they might
need it to win.

PHOENIX WRITER LOGS A PIRATE'S ADVENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - It's not laden with doubloons or rubies or silver
ingot, but one of the world's most famous pirate ships may have
been found off Madagascar by a crew that includes a Phoenix author.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed, the discovery of Capt. William Kidd's Adventure
Galley could be a treasure trove for historians, despite its lack
of obvious valuables.
</P>
<P>
   The wreck does, however, appear to contain Ming dynasty pottery,
ship fittings, cannons and possibly the ship's bell, which could
confirm its identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``History is kind of a treasure in itself,'' author Paul Perry
said of the find's significance. ``That's really what this is
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who chronicled the expedition for the pirate ship Whydah
off Cape Cod, Mass., is serving a similar role in the Adventure
Galley expedition. He is one of nine crew members and two
filmmakers to explore the remains of Kidd's flagship and the nearby
island of Sainte Marie, a haven for pirates three centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   The crew, led by noted pirate-ship hunter Barry Clifford, set
out in late January and returned last week. Perry wrote daily
dispatches that were posted on Discovery Online, the Web site of
the expedition's financial backer, the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   In them, Perry details the Kidd ship's final days before it was
scuttled by a mutinous crew in May 1699, the character of the
island, the pirates' descendants who still live there, and the
expedition itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who is part of the Clifford expedition is in awe of
what they see, and these are guys who don't awe easily,'' Perry
wrote before the wreck was found.
</P>
<P>
   Their awe stemmed from the untouched beauty of the bay where the
ship was found a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the pirates' Miami,'' Perry quotes Wesley Spiegel, the
dive supervisor for the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the island isn't crude and rustic in many
ways. The mostly poor villagers live in huts elevated by platforms
to keep out bugs.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a pirate cemetery; some headstones are even
inscribed with the Jolly Roger, the familiar skull and crossbones. &QL; 
HARBORING HOPE &QL; 
Sainte Marie features a labyrinth of caves, presumably to hide loot
taken from ships traversing the Indian Ocean. Kidd had been
commissioned by the king of England to raid French and Spanish
shipping, but the crown later turned on the privateer and declared
him a pirate.
</P>
<P>
   Although Perry is interested in the ``back story'' of the island
and its people, the expedition focused on finding the Adventure
Galley.
</P>
<P>
   The crew began by getting the permission of local authorities.
It already had pinpointed where to look by studying the transcripts
of the pirate trail of Kidd in London, which resulted in his
hanging in 1701 over the Thames River.
</P>
<P>
   In the transcript, a sailor had said Kidd's disgruntled crew
sank the already-damaged ship in a spot ``convenient to the
careening area'' in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Now on the island, the expedition quickly narrowed the search
site to the size of a football field. It rented a 21-foot outboard,
filled it with diving equipment and headed to the spot where the
ship was burned and sunk.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 minutes, they found what they believed was the ballast
pile from the Adventure Galley. But it turned out to be a false
lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day, the crew found the ship about 30 feet below
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really exciting in one way, but in another way, it was
anticlimactic,'' Perry said. ``It was really just a confirmation of
four months of research.''
</P>
<P>
   The following day, the expedition found the November Galley, a
small Dutch ship that Kidd had captured in 1697. It was originally
named the Rupparell and carried drugs, clothing, sugar and coral.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity of the November Galley to what is believed to be
the Adventure Galley was further evidence of its find. Records show
that Kidd's crew had burned both ships next to each other. &QL; 
CONFIDENCE IN THE FIND &QL; 
John de Bry, the expedition's marine archaeologist, also helped
authenticate the find by analyzing the porcelain, oarlocks and
other artifacts at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a single element that tells me this is not the
Adventure Galley,'' said de Bry, director of the Center for
Historical Archaeology. ``I didn't see a single artifact that
didn't fit with that time period.''
</P>
<P>
   After the expedition, de Bry stopped in Paris and found
supporting evidence in the way of maps and manuscripts that
indicate two ships sank there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be darned if it's not the Adventure Galley,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, de Bry said the ship must undergo a second phase of
archaeological excavation to know for sure and to document the
find.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the crew plans to return this summer to retrieve
some of the artifacts from the ship, which is believed to be 100
feet long and 30 feet wide. Clifford wants to establish a museum in
the Boston area, which is where Clifford is based. The island also
has offered him an old colonial governor's house for another
museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we find belongs to the government of Madagascar,''
Perry explained. ``But we might be able to take a few pieces back
to Boston for another museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Perry is considering writing a book about the
expedition and the ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like finding the George Washington of pirate ships,'' he
said. ``It probably was the most famous pirate ship and clearly
Kidd's most favorite ship.'' &QL;

<P>
   ROMULUS, Mich. _ Even as Michigan residents cast their votes and
time ticked away before the polls here closed, Gov. George W.
Bush's campaign officials worked Tuesday to assure the state's
Roman Catholics that Bush was a friend who deserved their support.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute effort was a response both to negative telephone
calls about Bush that some Michigan Catholics said they had
received and to speculation by some political analysts that Bush's
alliances with Christian conservatives _ and, especially, his visit
earlier this month to Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C. _
had upset Catholic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The effort also reflected the fact that the race here, unlike
the New Hampshire or South Carolina primaries, was much too close
to call and involved several factors that could determine the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his day by sharply attacking the phone calls, which
portrayed him as anti-Catholic and which he attributed to the
campaign of Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign said Tuesday evening that it had not
authorized the phone calls but allowed for the possiblity that they
may have been made by over-exhuberant volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   But later Tuesday night, the McCain campaign acknowledged that
it had, in fact, placed thousands of phone calls that referred to
Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University and described Jones as
someone with a history of making anti-Catholic statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply pointed out a fact,'' Rick Davis, manager of the
McCain campaign, said. Asked about earlier statements from the
campaign that denied responsibility for the calls, Davis said that
Howard Opinsky, the McCain spokesman who issued the earlier
denials, had not been informed of the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the phone calls did not conflict with McCain's pledge
to refrain from running negative ads. ``This I don't believe to be
outside the realm of a positive campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Bush said: ``I'm telling you, John McCain, he's
a man who's called me an anti-Catholic bigot, and I don't
appreciate it,'' Bush said during a visit to a restaurant in nearby
Royal Oak on Tuesday morning. ``That's shameful politics.''
</P>
<P>
   To pound home the Texas governor's message, the Bush campaign
electronically mailed, in the span of just 42 minutes after 1 p.m.,
nine news releases containing statements from nine Republican
governors, all of whom denounced the telephone calls. Many of the
governors are Catholic, and many assumed that the McCain campaign
was to blame for the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah called McCain's tactics
``shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts labeled McCain a ``typical
Washington politician who says one thing then does another,''
echoing some of Bush's attack ads, and said, ``He should be
ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also released a similar statement from Tom
Monaghan, the founder of Domino's Pizza and an active benefactor of
Catholic causes in the Detroit area.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Roman Catholic,'' Monaghan said, ``I am offended that my
faith is being used as a negative smear tactic to divide people in
a political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a script of the telephone call that the Bush
campaign released Tuesday, a recorded message notes that Bush
visited Bob Jones University, whose officers in the past have made
anti-Catholic statements. Bush has said repeatedly over the last
few days that he does not agree with those statements and has noted
that his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The script provided by the Bush campaign reads: ``Governor
George Bush has campaigned against Senator John McCain by seeking
the support of Southern fundamentalists who have expressed
anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Jones has made strong anti-Catholic statements, including
calling the pope anti-Christ, the Catholic church a satanic cult,''
according to the script. ``Governor Bush has stayed silent.''
</P>
<P>
   By releasing the script and the blizzard of statements, the Bush
campaign was perhaps doing more than assuring Catholics that they
had nothing to fear from the governor.
</P>
<P>
   It may also have been diverting attention from reports that the
evangelist Pat Robertson, a supporter of Bush, had recorded and
sent an incendiary telephone message branding McCain a foe of
conservative Christians and an insufficient opponent of abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Several political analysts said that the Robertson call,
emblematic of the tough politics that Bush's allies on the
religious right used to guarantee Bush's victory in the South
Carolina primary, could hurt Bush with moderate voters if he does
not quickly establish some distance from Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be put back into the bottle,'' Scott Reed, who ran
Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, said of Robertson.
``Somebody should pick up the phone and tell him to stop. He is way
over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Tuesday that Robertson had made the calls
independently of his campaign, an assertion that Robertson
confirmed.

(PHOENIX) - America West Airlines plans to contact thousands of
passengers delayed or stranded last week when 160 flights were
canceled because of a computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   The inconvenienced passengers will be compensated for their
trouble, according to the America West's Customer First policy,
which spells out under what circumstances passengers are entitled
to compensation, company spokeswoman Patty Nowack said.
</P>
<P>
   America West management declined to say whether the airline will
offer further compensation for travelers affected by the canceled
flights.
</P>
<P>
   America West canceled about 160 flights nationwide Thursday and
Friday, Feb. 17 and 18, stranding thousands of passengers, many of
them overnight in Phoenix. The company said it gave out 1,500 hotel
vouchers in Phoenix for passengers whose flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   A computer hardware problem in the company's system that
provides flight briefing information caused the canceled flights. A
backup system was used over the Presidents' Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier's schedule was back on track over the three-day
weekend, except for weather-related delays, Nowack said.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers spent the weekend trying to sort out problems
from Thursday's, Feb. 17, canceled flights.
</P>
<P>
   Maryellen Federico of Scottsdale finally got her luggage back
Sunday. She was booked to fly to Long Beach, Calif., but never made
the trip after several flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Federico spent about 10 hours with the airline on the phone and
in person trying to locate her luggage, she said.
</P>
<P>
   America West at first wanted to charge her a $75 fee for
canceling her $116 flight to Long Beach but later provided her with
$100 in travel vouchers, Federico said.
</P>
<P>
   America West's Customer First policy, which went into effect in
December, says the company will pay for a hotel stay for passengers
who are stuck overnight because of a canceled flight.
</P>
<P>
   The company also will pay for transportation to and from the
hotel if there is no hotel van, and will provide a five-minute
long-distance phone call and $25 for passengers without baggage who
need toiletries.
</P>
<P>
   The company also pays for meals: $5 for breakfast, $7.50 for
lunch and $10 for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Other carriers have similar policies.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's major air carriers implemented customer-service
policies in December after a rash of customer complaints last year
prompted Congress to consider adopting customer-service
regulations. &QL;

CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATOR FACES CHALLENGES IN NEW EDUCATIONAL
VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Freedom from the educational bureaucracy.
Emancipation from cramped, inadequate buildings. Liberty from
incompetent teachers.
</P>
<P>
   As an advocate of charter schools, Steven B. Klinsky embraces
those promises. But as the founder of Victory Schools Inc., soon to
be New York state's largest operator of charter schools, Klinsky
acknowledges that the reality of running such schools is far more
challenging than the slogans suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Victory's experiences with the Sisulu Children's
Academy in Harlem, which opened in September as one of the state's
first three charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   The last bimonthly check due to Sisulu for its allocation of
public school money arrived a month late from the New York City
Board of Education, which blamed a citywide computer foul-up.
</P>
<P>
   Space is so tight at Sisulu's current building that it may have
to forgo plans to add another grade in the fall to its student
body, kindergarten through second grade.
</P>
<P>
   And when members of the State Board of Regents visited in
October, they found a teacher who had misspelled the word
``strawberry'' three times on a chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
   Klinsky says that far from being free of the challenges that
bedevil the administrators of most public school systems, operators
of charter schools _ particularly those that like Victory aim to
earn a profit _ face as many hardships, perhaps more.
</P>
<P>
   How Victory responds to those challenges could be crucial to New
York state's fledgling charter school movement, which aims to offer
alternatives to public schools by setting up schools that benefit
from state financing but are freed from many union rules and have
some leeway to set their own curriculums. Next fall, the number of
charter schools statewide will soar from 4 to at least 20, with
Victory operating 4 of them.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of this growing number of charter schools,
moreover, will answer many questions about whether the politicians
who are eagerly promoting charters are also giving them the
resources necessary to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it is the largest charter school manager in the
state, Victory expects to lose money on each of its three charter
schools in New York City for at least five years, and maybe longer.
A fourth Victory school, in Roosevelt on Long Island, might earn a
tiny profit in its second year, according to Victory's estimates,
but only because that school will receive 33 percent more money per
student than its New York City counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Klinsky said that all of Victory's schools will become
self-sufficient but added that he was not worried about whether he
makes a profit. He said it was a philanthropic urge that led him to
education in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   While making millions of dollars as a Wall Street investment
specialist, Klinsky set up a nonprofit after-school program for
poor elementary school students in East New York, Brooklyn. Now he
is aiming for a network of charter schools to serve similarly poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that entrepreneurs like Klinsky aim at the
dismantlement of public education. The New York State United
Teachers union estimated that the opening of the Victory charter
school in Roosevelt next fall would result in a 5.5 percent cut in
the budget of the Roosevelt Union Free School District.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Carl T. Hayden, chancellor of the state Board of Regents, said
the Roosevelt district, a 2,900-student district that was taken
over by the state in 1995, is barely able to keep its doors open
with its current tax base.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a charter school taking money out of the system, I fear
for the ability of the Roosevelt public schools to continue,''
Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Klinsky said. He says the competition from charter
schools will press the local schools to improve. That Klinsky is
willing, if necessary, to invest up to $1 million in start-up funds
for each charter school does not hurt his chances for success.
</P>
<P>
   But it also demonstrates that the original idea of charter
schools _ a sort of educational co-op set up by community groups
and overseen by a board of parents and local leaders _ is perhaps a
quaint notion that fails to take into account the high cost of real
estate in a state like New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sisulu receives roughly $6,200 for each of its 247 students, far
less than the $7,200 the Board of Education spends on each
elementary school student. New York's charter school law, like
those in some other states, provides no support for building
expenses or capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   Even the money to which Sisulu is entitled takes a long time to
arrive. Klinsky complains that the school has not yet received any
federal funds for poor children despite Sisulu's calculations that
70 percent of its students qualify for federal free-lunch programs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Greenberg, supervising superintendent for new school
development for the Board of Education, acknowledges that there
have been bureaucratic delays in transferring the funds but said,
``We've tried to be good neighbors to these schools, and we've made
it clear that we want to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``there's a learning curve going on on both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Academically, the learning curve at Sisulu was in clear evidence
when members of the Board of Regents, the state's education policy
making board, visited last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found practices that seemingly replicated those at some
lower-performing schools in New York,'' said Sheila Evans-Tranumn,
associate commissioner of the state Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   The department raised questions about some classroom management
techniques and whether the school's curriculum was properly
balanced.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators also noted that the school had no room to add
another grade, as planned. After Sisulu made some changes to its
curriculum and personnel, including firing the teacher with
spelling problems, the Regents granted approval in December for the
Harriet Tubman Charter School to open in the Bronx next fall, to be
managed by Victory.
</P>
<P>
   Klinsky says that since the changes, parents of Sisulu students
have given the school high marks. A recent survey of the parents of
100 Sisulu schoolchildren found 98 percent of them satisfied with
the school, Klinsky reports. (The findings echo national studies,
which have found that parents often rate their own children's
schools highly, even while disparaging the quality of education
generally.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Victory Schools will open two other charter schools in the fall
as well, the Merrick Academy-Springfield Gardens charter school in
southeast Queens and the Roosevelt Children's Academy on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Victory has outpaced bigger, nationally known
school operators like Edison Schools and Advantage Schools. But
none of the companies nationally that have sought to make a profit
from public education have succeeded, and some have been
spectacular failures financially.
</P>
<P>
   Klinsky attended public schools in the Detroit suburbs and
graduated from the University of Michigan, and he received both a
law degree and an M.B.A. from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He then went to Wall Street, working at Goldman, Sachs and later
with Forstmann Little &AMP; Co., the leveraged buyout firm headed by
Ted Forstmann, the conservative philanthropist who also favors
educational causes.
</P>
<P>
   Klinsky's management experience includes little in the field of
education. But he has surrounded himself with education and
financial experts, including Margaret R. Harrington, the former
superintendent for Queens high schools at the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Klinsky, 43, was long inspired by education, an interest he
credits to the memory of his brother Gary, who was seven years
older and who died in 1978 at the age of 29 of Niemann-Pick
disease, a genetic enzyme deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Steven Klinsky established and named for his brother
the after-school program for elementary school students in East New
York.
</P>
<P>
   This experience taught Klinsky a few lessons he used in forming
a charter school company. Most important is that the operation
needs to be concentrated in a small geographic area, so it can hire
educators who can easily visit the schools to deal with problems.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the company can then spread those costs across
several schools, giving each a better chance of earning a profit
than it would have alone.
</P>
<P>
   The company charges Sisulu 15 percent of revenue for curriculum
development and overhead costs, and hopes to keep up to an
additional 7 percent of revenue as its management fee, or profit.

<P>
   Klinsky also plans to continue investing, looking to buy
companies in communications and education, although he will not
invest in charter schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klinsky's business acumen and his dedication to education, as
well as his company's ability to provide start-up money, is what
attracted Alma Alston, the founder of the Merrick Academy, to
Victory Schools. ``I'm pretty astute in terms of operating a
school,'' said Alston, who will be leaving her job as principal of
St. Peter Claver School in Queens. ``But someone has to look at the
business component of things as well.''
</P>
<P>
   With seven months to go before Victory is scheduled to open
three more new charter schools, Klinsky is upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My optimism comes from the belief that someone who has not
spent his entire career as part of the formal Board of Education
system can create a team of educators and business people to
energize something,'' he said. ``I could make a lot more money if I
was spending my time on the Internet than taking the subway back
and forth to 115th Street. But I have a social goal here. I want
this to be a sound enterprise.''

   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Henry Bibby could be setting off another
controversy this week, as he intends to prevent the Trojans from
shaking hands with Oregon State players following Thursday's game
at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get cheap-shotted,'' Bibby said, referring to
last week's postgame brawl between USC and Arizona State that
resulted in Trojans guard Jeff Trepagnier and Sun Devils forwards
Awvee Storey and Tanner Shell being put on probation by the
Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was firmly committed to keeping the Trojans from
taking part in any posgame handshakes, Bibby said, ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said he was also considering not letting his staff shake
hands with the Oregon State coaches during the traditional postgame
show of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't decided that yet,'' Bibby said. ``More than likely
(we won't).''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby's anger over the Arizona State incident had not subsided
Tuesday and he spoke again at length over his displeasure with Sun
Devils coach Rob Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Saturday that USC wrote lewd comments about ASU on
the practice basketballs and he claimed the Trojans' Friday
practice spilled over into the Sun Devils' practice time, in an
attempt to distract ASU before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're liars,'' Bibby said. ``Rob Evans lied and tried to
frame me and my basketball team. A good man would have come and
talked to me. But he didn't come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said it was too late for him and Evans to settle their
differences amicably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to say,'' Bibby said. ``If he wanted to
talk, talk before the game. That's what a class act would do, not
try to plant something. We were framed. I'll take a lie detector
test and put up $10,000 right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been portrayed as the bad guys and that's not fair. It
was a setup. They framed us. It was a great old ploy because they
needed a win. It was very unlawful for them to make those
accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans was asked Tuesday if there was lingering resentment over
the altercation. ``From whom? I don't know on their side. People
who were involved know what happened. I don't have any hard
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Pac-10 settled the matter, Bibby said he has
sent the conference a report of 21 incidents during the game that
showed Arizona State committing dangerous fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking for a replay of the basketball game, we're
asking for fairness,'' Bibby said. ``Something has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Clancy has X-rays: Forward Sam Clancy underwent a second set
of X-rays Tuesday morning which showed his broken right foot was
healing as scheduled. Clancy began light running for the first time
during Tuesday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My foot looks a lot better on the X-ray this time,'' Clancy
said. ``I still think I'll be back for the Cal game (March 3).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Traffic advisory: Fans attending Thursday's game at the
Sports Arena should be aware that a soccer match between Canada and
Trinidad and Tobago is scheduled at the Coliseum at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   __ Elmore honored: Guard Tiffany Elmore has been named the
Pac-10 women's basketball player of the week after leading the
Women of Troy to a sweep of the Arizona schools. She is the firsplayer honored with the award since Tina Thompson in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   USC (11-11, 6-6) has won three games in a row for the first time
since the 1996-97 season.

<P>
   Friedensreich Hundertwasser, an Austrian painter and architect
famous for his undulating forms and color wizardry as well as for
his visceral loathing of symmetry and the straight line, died
Saturday on board the Queen Elizabeth 2, Joram Harel, his manager
and friend, told The Associated Press. He was 71 and had boarded
the ship in Auckland, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, Harel said.
</P>
<P>
   A painter at heart, Hundertwasser rose to international
prominence through his architectural designs, whose wavy lines,
bright primary colors and ornamental baubles bucked modern trends
in favor of the decorative tradition of fin de siecle Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   His mission, as he saw it, was to ``improve the world and make
it more beautiful.'' He despised the geometrical, disdained
symmetry and defined the straight line as ``the tool of the
devil.'' To that end, he created a uniquely personal style, weaving
labyrinthine spirals of vibrant, exotic color around fantasy images
that stared out through blank, almond-shaped eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Born Friedrich Stowasser in Vienna on Dec. 15, 1928, he and his
mother, who was Jewish, survived World War II. In 1948, he began
studies at the Vienna Academy of Art but left three months later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 he adopted the name Friedensreich Hundertwasser _
``kingdom of peace, hundred waters'' in German _ and four years
later painted his first spiral, which became his signature symbol.
</P>
<P>
   But even his acceptance into the esteemed Art Club of Vienna
could not buffer him from the criticism of his colleagues, who
found his work, with its swirls, luminous color and naif
inhabitants, decadent. Nonetheless, it quickly became popular in
the Far East, South Africa and South America. By 1965, his
paintings, which a decade earlier had been snapped up by collectors
like Peggy Guggenheim for between $10 and $50, were now selling for
upward of $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 he was awarded the Austrian State Prize, the country's
highest cultural award, and he used his prestige to campaign
against nuclear power as well as what he called degenerate modern
art.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Hundertwasser persuaded the Vienna City Council to
allow him to design the residential block that was opened in 1985
as the Hundertwasserhaus. With its variegated bands of color, odd
window shapes and onion-dome cupolas, it conjured images of
``Hansel and Gretel'' run amok and became a hit with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Hundertwasser divided his time between Austria
and his farm in New Zealand. Last year his first architectural
creation in that country opened: a public toilet. The structure,
made of colorful tiles and wine bottles, has no straight lines. Its
roof, topped with golden globes, sprouts vegetation including
marijuana plants.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MILDRED ROOT MOTTAHEDEH, PORCELAIN COLLECTOR, 91 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mildred Root Mottahedeh, a collector of Chinese export
porcelains and co-founder of a company that produced reproductions
of porcelains for several U.S. presidents and institutions
including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died Feb. 17 at New
York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 91 and lived in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Seabright, N.J., Mildred Root began collecting Japanese
prints at 13 after moving to New York. She met Rafi Y. Mottahedeh,
an Iranian-born importer, in New York, and the union of ``two
collecting nuts'' came to be, she told The New York Times in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Married in 1929, the Mottahedehs began acquiring Oriental
porcelains, ivories, jades and bronzes, amassing one of the world's
finest private collections with some 2,000 pieces. In his foreword
to ``China for the West,'' an authoritative publication on the
Mottahedeh collection, Nelson A. Rockefeller, a friend and fellow
collector of Chinese export porcelain, described the collection as
``utterly fabulous, an artistic and cultural treasure without
comparison in its field.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, the couple founded Mottahedeh &AMP; Co. in Manhattan, which
rose to prominence as one of the most prestigious firms in the
reproduction of porcelain, producing some 1,500 different items for
more than 3,000 stores, from Tiffany's to small gift boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   The company also reproduced pieces in the collections of museums
like the Metropolitan and the Museum of Modern Art in New York and
the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris for sale in their shops.
Mottahedeh reproductions have graced the White House as well as the
reception rooms of the State Department in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye for good design and a mind for practicality,
Mottahedeh refused to reproduce a piece simply for its historical
significance but demanded instead that the object ``have character
and usability.'' Among those works meeting her criteria were a
monteith, or punch bowl, incorporating the presidential seal, which
President Ronald Reagan presented to heads of state, and a dinner
service designed by Pierre L'Enfant for George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband died in 1978, Mottahedeh succeeded him as
president and remained active in the company, even after it was
sold, until her retirement in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Bahai faith since 1929, Mottahedeh served for
many years as the first Bahai representative to the United Nations.
With her husband, she founded a series of primary and secondary
schools in Uganda, and maintained four village development projects
in Maharashtra state in India that served as training facilities in
agricultural techniques, public health services and the development
of local handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958 the couple created a foundation, Mottahedeh Development
Services Inc., to help with social and economic development
projects in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter, Peri Yusef of London; a son, Roy
P., of Brookline, Mass.; five grandchildren; and two
great-grandchildren. &QL;

   SCHROEDER BOULTON, WALL STREET EXECUTIVE, 91 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder Boulton, a 67-year veteran of Wall Street, died Feb.
13 at his home in Greenwich Village. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Boulton was fond of saying that he was one of just four people
who began their careers on Wall Street in the depth of the
Depression. He was hired in 1931 to be a research trainee at Baker,
Weeks &AMP; Harden. In 1936, he graduated from Columbia University,
receiving a degree in business.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to work at Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. and Jesup &AMP; Lamont. He
retired two years ago as first vice president of Tucker Anthony
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Boulton was born in Brooklyn in 1909. He was a grandson of
Frederick Schroeder, mayor of the City of Brooklyn and founder of
the Germania Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935 he married Marjorie Clayton; she died in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   A year later he married Dr. Mary Holzman Bancroft, a
psychotherapist who died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Boultons were outspoken supporters of the civil rights
movement and their Greenwich Village apartment was known as a

   His daughter, Nancy Boulton-LeGates, remembers driving through a
neighborhood when she was 5 years old and asking her father why
anyone would want to live there. She said he answered: ``Some
people don't have a choice. They need to be helped, and it's our
role in life to help them.''

   G. LEON NETTERVILLE, HEADED SOUTHERN U., 93
</P>
<P>
   G. Leon Netterville, a former president of Southern University
and A&AMP;M College, the largest historically black college in the
nation, died Feb. 12 at his home in Baton Rouge, La. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Netterville was the third president of the college, which has
9,000 students and is in Baton Rouge; he served in that post from
1968 to 1972. He resigned shortly after police shot and killed two
students in a campus protest about administration policies.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, among the demands made by the protesting students was
Netterville's resignation. They said he was thwarting ``black
awakening'' and the development of ``black consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   George Leon Netterville Jr. was born in rural Ascension Parish,
La., on July 16, 1906. He received a bachelor's degree from
Southern and a master's degree from Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Southern as the dean of men and business manager in
1938. He became vice president for finance and business affairs in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Rebecca, died in 1989, and his son, George Leon
Netterville III, died in 1993. He is survived by a granddaughter.

TOBACCO INDUSTRY UNFAIRLY IS A TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Perhaps the most destructive aspect of the anti-smoking
campaign is how it undermines reverence for the truth.
</P>
<P>
   No deceptive claim, it seems, is too grotesque if it's in the
service of demonizing tobacco to legitimize plundering the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The president, for instance, recently trotted out what's perhaps
the most grotesque distortion of the truth while making a pitch for
boosting the federal tax on cigarettes by 25 cents a pack. ``Every
year,'' he lamented, ``more than 400,000 Americans die from
tobacco-related diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   This dubious claim has been bandied about for so long it's
accepted as gospel, which it's not. A couple of years ago, Robert
A. Levy and Rosalind B. Marimont did an analysis for Regulation
magazine exposing this highly questionable statistic for what it
is.
</P>
<P>
   Levy is a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato
Institute and adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center
teaching Statistics for Lawyers. Marimont is a retired
mathematician who spent her career at the National Institute of
Health and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
Their analysis can't be adequately explored in a column, but a
couple of their points are worth revisiting.
</P>
<P>
   The ``400,000 deaths a year'' claim emerged as a flawed
government assumption of what constitutes a smoking-related
disease. If the official death count excluded statistically
questionable causes, the number would have been about 40 percent
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Levy and Marimont also noted that another key study extrapolated
from a relatively small survey and ascribed the results to the
entire population. This method subtracted the deaths of those who
had never smoked from the total deaths and assumed the remainder to
be smoking-related. This study, they said, involved subjects with
atypically low death rates. When its result was applied to the
whole population, it created the illusion of more deaths from
smoking than could be realistically expected.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the deceit that involves creating the impression
that smoking causes widespread death at an inordinately early age.
Nobody would deny smoking presents the risk of a shorter life, but
the statistical difference is not as dramatic as implied.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in life expectancy, according to a 1991 Rand
study, is about 4.3 years at age 20. Another study showed that
tobacco was not responsible for any deaths below the age of 35. To
put this finding into perspective given all the talk about ``saving
the children,'' consider these numbers from the National Center for
Health Statistics: In 1992 more than 21,000 people below age 35
died from motor vehicle accidents, nearly 17,000 were homicide
victims and more than 11,000 were suicides. More than half these
deaths had a link with alcohol or drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say smoking is good for you or to endorse its
use. Rather, it's to ask why, given all the other equally injurious
threats to our national health, the tobacco industry has been so
single-mindedly made the target for demonization.
</P>
<P>
   Think money. The crusade has much more to do with financial gain
than saving lives. Big Tobacco has deep pockets, and everyone wants
to get its Big Money.

COMMENTARY: MCCAIN PICKS UP THE MO IN MOTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs for rewriting throughout)  
 By MAUREEN DOWD  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ It is a campaign straight out of Capra.
</P>
<P>
   A decent guy takes on the System, and the brutes who run the
System move in to destroy the upstart. They paint the populist hero
as crazy or deceitful. After a bout of self-pity, when he hates the
whole rotten show, he rallies with some sentimental hooey about
American ideals and routs the ruling-class bullies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, your type's as old as history,'' John Doe tells his
tormentors. ``If you can't lay your dirty fingers on a decent idea
and twist it and squeeze it and stuff it into your own pockets, you
slap it down. Like dogs, if you can't eat something, you bury it!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, like John McCain, the Capra heroes battling Big Money
could often get a little insufferable. They could be sanctimonious
and overemotional and flaky. The idea of virtue triumphing over
greed was always a celluloid dream. But it seems even more
far-fetched now, in a society where greed is a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, McCain's strategist, says he doesn't think the
Republican Establishment ``is a bunch of guys in straw boaters on
telephones yelling `Get McCain!' It's more like 100 lobbyists in
Washington scared that their contracts won't be renewed.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of moderates and without the religious right
smothering him, McCain won in Michigan, so he can continue to dog
the son of the Establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's greatest appeal was to conservatives. Many others here
were less impressed. ``I've done a lot of research on Bush _ the
man's done nothing,'' said George Thomas, 30, who works in
computers, as he voted for McCain in Royal Oak.
</P>
<P>
   What's remarkable about the Republican race is that the arcs of
the two campaigns mirror the arcs of the candidates' life stories.
</P>
<P>
   Bush started in New Hampshire as a slacker. As in his life, he
relied on his name and powerful friends to keep him afloat in his
campaign until he decided to apply himself late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a process of steeling me to become your president,''
he told Newsweek on the eve of the South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, people get their steel before they run for president.
Anyhow, Bush probably should have spelled it ``steal.'' He
purloined everything he could lay his hands on from the McCain
campaign _ the populist bus, the reformer message, the one-on-one
town halls, even the design of the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who spent his life getting in trouble for his
impulsiveness and thin skin, let his emotions get away from him in
the last couple of weeks. If there was one thing that was obvious,
it was that the Bush team, humiliated in New Hampshire, was going
to be ruthless and vicious in that most conservative and wired
state for the Bushes, South Carolina. It was clearly going to use
all the tricks from the Atwater playbook _ nasty push polls, racial
wedge issues, let-a-third-party-do-the-dirty-work fliers and
e-mails. The candidate would smile and call himself a uniter, not a
divider, while his team madly divided.
</P>
<P>
   But when it began to happen, McCain reacted viscerally rather
than cerebrally. He was furious about Bush trotting out a
discredited veteran to trash him for ``forgetting'' veterans; he
was enraged that a Boy Scout got a push-polling call branding him
``a liar''; and he overreached in a television commercial,
comparing Bush to Bill Clinton, then pulled back too far, adopting
an absurdly broad definition of negative advertising that tied his
hands on pointing out unfair Bush tactics. He capped a bad week by
using a self-defeating caustic tone in his South Carolina
concession speech, and began intemperately railing about ``jerks''
and ``idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   People said from the start that it was too easy to get under
McCain's skin, and that his judgment was questionable at moments of
maximum pressure. He also has a tendency to fall in love with an
idea, harping so much on busting Washington's iron triangle that he
never set out any other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he not fight back strongly enough and quickly
enough in South Carolina, but his Michigan campaign degenerated
into a wish that voters would get huffy over Bush's brutal tactics.
But McCain does have incredible tenacity, and he hung on until he
got to an electorate more suited to him.
</P>
<P>
   So far, we've learned that one candidate drifts and the other
gets wound up. So now we know what we already knew.

CONGRESSIONAL PANEL HEARS TESTIMONY ON INTERNATIONAL SEX

   WASHINGTON _ Duped into thinking they are leaving their home and
country for work and a better life, a million girls and women are
being forced into sexual slavery around the world every year,
witnesses told a U.S. Senate subcommittee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sad fact that at this moment in history, people
still inflict on each other unspeakable and unbelievable horrors,''
said Frank E. Loy, undersecretary of state for global affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, asked Loy and others to
testify at a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Near Eastern and
South Asian Affairs, of which he is chairman.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to India, Pakistan and Nepal, Brownback talked
to teen-age girls who had been tricked into leaving their homes for
domestic or nanny work, and then were held captive in brothels in
Asia, Europe and elsewhere. Their captors take their passports so
they cannot return home.
</P>
<P>
   About 50,000 women a year also are being brought into the United
States from Mexico and other countries, according to the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee heard Tuesday from a woman who was talked into
leaving Mexico in 1997 at age 18 to work in the United States. Two
men told her they would take care of her immigration papers and get
her a job at a Texas restaurant, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying herself only as Inez and shielding her face with a
scarf and large sunglasses, the woman said she was sent from Texas
to a trailer in Florida and told she would have to pay off a
``smuggling fee'' of $2,500 by selling her body for sex.
</P>
<P>
   If she refused or tried to escape, she would be beaten and her
family in Mexico would be harmed, the men told her. The woman said
she was forced to work six days a week, 12 hours a day, having sex
with 32 to 35 clients daily for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually federal agents raided the brothel. The women were
released to a domestic-violence center.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback and Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, ranking Democrat
on the subcommittee, said legislation was needed. Brownback has not
yet proposed anything, but Wellstone has a bill.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone proposes an interagency task force to monitor the
problem, stronger penalties, more services for victims, letting
victims stay in the United States on visas and allowing the
president to impose sanctions on countries that do not stem
trafficking.
