   Union leaders, Democratic Party officials and hundreds of other
people came together Tuesday night in cities across the country to
watch President Clinton's State of the Union address and to show
their opposition to the impeachment process, warning Republicans
that they would pay for it at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group that has
been trying to rally support for the president, organized the
anti-impeachment forums in 17 cities, among them San Diego,
Detroit, Tucson, Ariz., and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where more than 400 people gathered at the
headquarters of one of the city's most politically active unions,
speaker after speaker condemned the Senate trial and promised that
those who voted for impeachment would find themselves out of office
after the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of the campaign to oust those who voted
the wrong way,'' said Dennis Rivera, president of the union, 1199,
the National Health and Human Service Employees Union, which has
dedicated its 80-person telemarketing office to the
anti-impeachment effort. ``We don't condone the president's
behavior, but the people have indicated that they don't want him
removed from office. They want us to get back to the issues that
are important to America.''
</P>
<P>
   The event's organizers distributed buttons that read ``Nov. 7,
2000'' the date of the next national elections, and Barbara
Handman, director of the union's New York chapter, promised that
her group would focus on the seats of those who voted for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those who addressed the crowd were law professors and
historians who described the impeachment process as dangerously
flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that Clinton is suffering from self-inflicted
wounds,'' said historian Arthur Schlesinger, ``but the Republicans
are lowering the bar of impeachment and extending high crimes and
misdemeanors to private conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger, who said he could not recall a more bizarre period
in American history, drew cheers when he described Rep. Henry J.
Hyde, R-Ill., who led the prosecution of the president, as ``a
demagogue straight out of central casting.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Jay Williams, a professor of law at Columbia
University, said that she found the prosecution devoid of legal
rationale. ``What I'm hearing are words like `sacred,' `honor,'
`faith' and `belief.' It's more of a religious trial, a witch hunt
by a hypothetical moral majority trying to impose a standard of
behavior that very few people can live up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Mayor David N. Dinkins compared the Senate
proceedings to some of the darkest episodes in American history,
among them the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II and
the many years that the American government failed to oppose
apartheid in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, he said, the country's constitutional foundation
is being threatened by political partisanship. ``There have been
too many instances when good people were silent, or not vocal
enough, in the face of what they knew was wrong,'' Dinkins said.
``This, I believe, is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many at the event said they were drawn by fear, not
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Brady Wyman, 54, a Manhattan businesswoman, said she
worried that if the Republicans succeeded in ousting the president,
the country's democratic system could be threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid of the Republicans, afraid that they're leading us
down a very dangerous road,'' said Ms. Brady Wyman, who said she
was an independent. ``To me this prosecution is being run by
vindictive people who are motivated by hate. I came here because I
feel like I have to do something, otherwise it will be too late.''

TOBACCO INDUSTRY SHOCKED BY CLINTON'S PLAN TO SUE

<P>
   President Clinton's announcement that the Justice Department was
preparing to sue cigarette makers came as a shock to the industry,
which thought it had put most of its legal problems behind by
defeating congressional efforts to regulate nicotine and by
settling a series of lawsuits brought by states.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the four major cigarette makers agreed to pay 46
states and five territories $206 billion over the next 25 years to
settle the state suits, which sought to recover their Medicaid
costs for treating smoking-related illnesses. They had previously
reached separate settlements with four states for a total of $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton surprised the industry and Congress by announcing
that the government would file its own action seeking the recovery
of federal money, from Medicare and other programs, spent on
smoking-related illnesses. He said the money would be used to
strengthen Medicare, the federal program that provides health care
to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the cigarette industry, Scott Williams, said the
president's comments were ``blatantly political,'' demonizing the
tobacco companies because they were an easy target.
</P>
<P>
   ``This political and economic terrorism against the industry has
got to stop,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Under an earlier settlement proposed in 1997, the tobacco
companies would have paid $516 billion but would have ended the
threat of lawsuits from both states and the federal government. The
industry, however, mounted an intense campaign against the bill and
defeated it.
</P>
<P>
   After that defeat, Richard Scruggs, one of the plaintiffs'
lawyers who helped draw up the first state lawsuits against tobacco
makers, continued lobbying Clinton administration officials to file
a Medicare lawsuit against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers in the first suits have already been awarded
billions of dollars in legal fees for work on behalf of states.
Scruggs is the brother-in-law of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs did not return a telephone call Tuesday night seeking
comment. But in earlier interviews, he said that the Justice
Department did not appear eager to file such a suit.
</P>
<P>
   Any federal lawsuit brought to recover Medicare money would face
the same hurdles as the state lawsuits, which were based on novel
legal theories. Because all of the state cases were settled before
they were resolved by a judge or jury, the legal underpinnings of
the lawsuits were never tested in court.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, federal officials may seek to use the threat of a
lawsuit to force concessions from the industry not won in the state
round of settlements, like federal regulation of nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of smoking were enthusiastic about the announcement.
Matthew Myers, a lawyer with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a
group in Washington, D.C., said he believed that a federal lawsuit
would open up a new front in the tobacco war. A federal lawsuit
could prove a far greater financial threat to cigarette makers than
all state actions combined, Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette producers participating in the plan are the Philip
Morris Companies; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of the RJR
Nabisco Holdings Corp.; Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of the
Loews Corp., and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of BAT
Industries PLC.

LINEBACKER NAZEL COMMITS TO USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC has received an oral commitment from
linebacker Omar Nazel of Oakland Skyline High. Nazel (6-foot-4, 220
pounds) selected the Trojans over Colorado, Washington, Arizona and
Cal. He had 14 sacks and 86 tackles for Skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Nazel is the fourth linebacker to commit to the Trojans, joining
Markus Steele (Long Beach City College), Aaron Graham (Bakersfield)
and Chris Prosser (San Diego Morse).
</P>
<P>
   USC now has 14 commitments and is waiting on approximately 17
players to make their final decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers enrolls: Tight end Jacob Rogers of Oxnard High is
attending classes at USC and will be able to participate in spring
practice, which is expected to begin March 26. Rogers (6-6, 235)
graduated early from Oxnard and was the first player to commit to
USC when he announced his decision last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Williams arraigned: Defensive tackle Aaron Williams pleaded not
guilty in Orange Superior Court to prowling charges and for having
unpaid traffic tickets on Tuesday. Williams was arrested last month
in Costa Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   A pretrial hearing is set for Feb. 8, but Williams' attorney,
Bob Van Hoy, said he is discussing a plea bargain with the district
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there should be a dismissal,'' Van Hoy said.

CARDS' TICKETS PRICES REMAIN UNCHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the fourth consecutive year, the Cardinals have decided not
to raise ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes four months before a multipurpose stadium
project will be on the ballot in Mesa, Gilbert and Queen Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials also hope to build on their first non-strike
playoff appearance in 23 years and the franchise's first playoff
victory in 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision not to raise prices comes three weeks after
the popular move of giving starting quarterback Jake Plummer a
four-year, $29.7 million contract extension, making him the
second-highest-paid player in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way we're saying thank you to our fans,''
Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill said Tuesday. ``We had very loyal fans
this year and think we're developing a strong fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be an exciting off-season, and we have a lot
of momentum going. We have good feelings here in our office, in the
locker room and around town.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' average ticket price remains at $33.28, which
ranked 17th in the 30-team NFL last year. Several teams already
have announced ticket increases.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, the Diamondbacks caused a stir by raising
ticket prices 12.1 percent for next season. The number of season
ticket holders dropped 28 percent from March 1998 to January 1999,
from 36,000 fans to 26,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns raised ticket prices an average of 13 percent for this
season. The Coyotes didn't raise ticket prices for their 1998-99
season.
</P>
<P>
   According to Team Marketing Report, the four professional
leagues increased tickets an average of 7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials think the team's first winning season in
Arizona, coupled with keeping ticket prices the same, could bring a
significant increase in season ticket sales for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The team sold 31,019 season tickets last year, the most since
having 48,122 in 1994, Coach Buddy Ryan's first season. The
Cardinals drew an average of 53,819 fans, their third-best since
moving from St. Louis in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to make a concerted effort (to sell) more season
tickets,'' Bidwill said. ``We can get more ticket revenue by
selling more tickets than by (raising prices).''
</P>
<P>
   Season tickets will cost from $180 (south end-zone bleachers) to
$1,800 (loge 50-yard line) in 1999. More than 54 percent (39,182
seats) of 72,994-seat Sun Devil Stadium will be available for $25
per game or less if purchased on a season ticket basis.
</P>
<P>
   Season ticket holders will get 10 to 20 percent discounts on the
single-game price if purchased by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals play one of the toughest schedules in the league
next season, including four home games against playoff teams _ the
San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, Buffalo Bills and New England
Patriots. They also will play two home preseason games against
undetermined opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is expected to announce dates and kickoff times for the
regular season in late April or early May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to help us as far as season tickets to have some
games against tough teams,'' Bidwill said. ``It is a tough
schedule, but they have to play us, too.'' &QL;

CLINTON FOCUSES ON ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Standing in the very chamber where he was impeached
last month, facing the very senators who are now considering
ousting him from office, an embattled President Clinton Tuesday
night delivered a determined defense of the State of the Union
while avoiding any mention of the state of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, delivering his sixth annual address to a joint session
of Congress, laid out a bold proposal to allow the government to
invest a portion of the Social Security trust fund in stocks,
called for a substantial increase in military spending and urged
Congress to pay for 50,000 more police officers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to demonstrate that he is focused on issues, even if
Congress is focused on impeachment, Clinton took his case directly
to those who have stood behind him throughout the past year _ the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans,'' he said. ``I stand before you to report
that the state of our union is strong. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps in the daily press of events, in the clash of
controversy, we do not see our own time for what it truly is _ a
new dawn for America,'' he said. ``A hundred years from tonight, an
American president will stand in this place to report on the state
of the union. He or she will look back on a 21st century shaped in
so many ways by the decisions we make here and now.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, echoing congressional calls for a new era of
bipartisanship, he said: ``Let it be said of us ... that we were
thinking not only of our time, but of their time; that we reached
as high as our ideals; that we put aside our divisions and found a
new hour of healing and hopefulness; that we joined together to
serve and strengthen the country we love.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton for the second year in a row gave top billing in his
speech to the importance of ``saving'' Social Security. The Social
Security Trust Fund is expected to run out of money by 2032, and
politicians of both parties have expressed a commitment to
rejiggering the system in a way that will generate enough money to
pay retirement benefits for current workers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans, whose formal response was delivered by
Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., and former Seattle Seahawk Steve
Largent, R-Okla., continued to complain that the president was not
offering specifics, Clinton was more precise than he was a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the number of elderly Americans set to double by 2030,
the Baby Boom will become a Senior Boom,'' Clinton said. ``Last
year, we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew what it
would take to save Social Security. Again, I say, we should not
spend any of it until after Social Security is truly saved. First
things first.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed setting aside 60 percent of the federal budget
surplus for the next 15 years for Social Security, and investing a
small portion of that in the stock market. He also suggested
setting aside 16 percent of the surplus for Medicare, and 11
percent of the surplus in Universal Savings Accounts that Americans
could invest individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Social Security and Medicare is the right way to use
the surplus,'' he said. ``If we do so, we will still have the
resources to meet urgent national needs in education and defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 77-minute speech drew a mix of reactions. Some
Republicans, including House Managers Henry Hyde and Bob Barr,
boycotted the speech. Supreme Court Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, who is presiding over the impeachment trial, and Sen.
Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican who has skipped the last
several State of the Union speeches, also stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were restrained in their applause, and two leaders,
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and House Majority Whip
Tom Delay, R-Texas, glowered throughout the speech, rising only to
applaud home run slugger Sammy Sosa, seated with Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were a smattering of empty seats on the
Republican side of the chamber, the Democratic side of the chamber
was packed, with some members standing in the aisle or sitting on
armrests. An observer shouted ``Viva Clinton'' as the president
entered, and Democrats on occasion whooped to demonstrate their
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to hear him speak _ he's a great communicator,'' said
Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash. ``But he wasn't talking about
reinventing government, but about renewing the expansion of
government we had been holding in check. It was not a State of the
Union but list of ideas of things we wish we could accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats were skeptical of the laundry list of
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an extraordinary speech, with almost something for
every American,'' said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. ``I counted three
dozen new initiatives and new programs. But he avoided the
difficult choices _ a parsing of this budget would show that it is
based on unrealistic revenue and budget assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., although generally supportive,
expressed some concern about Clinton's proposal to close failing
schools and crack down on substandard teachers. A former
schoolteacher, she argued that the emphasis should instead be on
helping teachers and schools improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shutting down schools that continually fail _ that's good
rhetoric, but let's make sure there's a place for them (the
children) to go,'' she said. ``Let's go in there and help them
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats were generally enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy Sosa never hit one that far,'' said Rep. Jim McDermott,
D-Wash. ``It was a wonderful speech, and will force Congress to
deal with two major issues _ Social Security and Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., expressed hope that Clinton's speech
would change some views in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw a lot of uncomfortable folks realizing the policies
he's advanced are in touch with the American people,'' he said.
``He was honest about tackling our most difficult problems, and
America will respond to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress behaved courteously, applauded frequently,
disagreed on substance and demurred on scandal. Like the president,
Republicans wanted to show the country they can conduct the
nation's business even as the impeachment proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   The major policy difference came in the area of tax cuts. Dunn
proposed an across-the-board 10 percent cut in tax rates; Clinton
called only for a handful of smaller tax measures.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did propose a $1,000 tax credit for the aged, ailing or
disabled or their families.
</P>
<P>
   In a section of the speech that could have important
ramifications for the Northwest, Clinton urged ``a freer and fairer
trading system for the 21st century.'' He seemed to threaten trade
sanctions against Japan if that country doesn't reverse a surge of
steel exports, and he called for a new round of global trade
negotiations ``to expand exports of services, of manufactures, and
most of all, farm products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must tear down barriers, open markets, and expand trade,''
he said. ``At the same time, we must ensure that ordinary citizens
in all countries benefit from trade _ pressing for trade that
promotes the dignity of work, the rights of workers, the protection
of the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for reversing a decline in the level of
military spending. He said his budget proposal would call for ``a
substantial increase in the next year for readiness and
modernization, and pay and benefits for our troops, and sustained
increases over the next six years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the heirs of a legacy of bravery represented by
millions of veterans,'' he said. ``America's defenders today stand
ready at a moment's notice to go where comforts are few and dangers
are many, doing what needs to be done as no one else can. They
always come through for America. We must come through for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime rates have been declining nationally, but Clinton
continued to push for new crime-fighting measures. In his 1994
State of the Union address Clinton called for hiring 100,000 new
police officers around the country, and Tuesday night he called for
hiring half again as many.
</P>
<P>
   On education, always a top priority for voters, Clinton said SAT
and math scores have been rising, but that the federal government
needs to hold states and school districts more accountable for the
way they are spending federal dollars. He called for closing the
nation's worst schools and requiring teachers to pass performance
exams.
</P>
<P>
   The speech included a laundry list of proposals, many of which
are unlikely ever to be enacted by a Republican-controlled
Congress. He called for a $1 per hour increase in the federal
minimum wage, for extending the federal Family Medial Leave Act to
small companies, and for tax credits for stay-at-home parents. He
proposed more empowerment zones in struggling cities and for more
crop insurance for struggling farms.
</P>
<P>
   He praised immigrants, saying ``they are revitalizing our
cities, energizing our culture, building our new economy.'' But he
also urged them to learn English and about democracy, and said he
would propose increased spending to help them do so.

SONICS' LAMENT: A GOOD BIG MAN IS HARD TO FIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If the NBA insists upon force-feeding the public a
slapdash season full of Fat Alberts and Homer Simpsons, the least I
can do is highlight the local cartoon _ the Sonic center position.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quiz to see if you've been following this unanimated
feature:
</P>
<P>
   Can you name the starting center when the Sonics ended the
playoffs each of the past three seasons?
</P>
<P>
   If you said Sam Perkins (1998), Terry Cummings (1997) and Frank
Brickowski (1996), you should be ashamed of yourself for not having
a more varied life in spring.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you can take some pride in landing upon the central
failing of the local franchise this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it is a profound scoop. With the notable exception of
All-Star Jack Sikma (1977-86), center has been the franchise's
curse.
</P>
<P>
   Much as with the Mariners in left field and the Seahawks on the
offensive line, the Sonics' weakness apparently defies resolution.
The latest confirmation comes with news that Jim McIlvaine is on
the verge of being traded.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, traded. Unbelievably, to another NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if the Sonics are getting much in return. In
soon-to-be-37-year-old Michael Cage and perpetually injured Don
MacLean, the Sonics are receiving from New Jersey the equivalent of
gym socks.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Nets seem willing to take on McIlvaine's
remaining five years and $20 million-plus on his contract. Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Next, tell me that the Dodgers think Bobby Ayala is Cy
Young-bound.
</P>
<P>
   Not that McIlvaine isn't a swell guy; so, too, are Cage and
MacLean. But as NBA fans learned during the last few months, the
league is about little more than money. These are not money
players, except that they cost a lot of money. The imminent deal is
merely a swap of problems.
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine might be the poster child for the toxicity of the
NBA's economic system. Through no fault of his own and every fault
of the system and team president Wally Walker, the Sonics foolishly
gave him a $33.7 million, seven-year contract that put him in a
brutal pressure cooker.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, then-Sonic coach George Karl had no place for a
slow big man in his defensive system, nor did he have the patience
to work with a project. Besides, Karl considered McIlvaine Walker's
guy, and Karl is just self-destructive enough to allow his contempt
for Walker to influence his handling of McIlvaine.
</P>
<P>
   The poor guy was doomed in Seattle the moment he signed the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   A recent conversation with Pete Newell, guru to many of the
NBA's big men, confirmed the shortcomings. Lamenting McIlvaine's
slowness and his loss of offensive ability due to the need to bulk
up, Newell, who has tutored him over several summers, simply shook
his head when asked whether McIlvaine is capable of breaking
through to become a significant contributor.
</P>
<P>
   His physical limitations, combined with the contract pressure
and Karl's mismanagement, led to the destruction of whatever
confidence and presence McIlvaine might have possessed.
Consequently, on the eve of the past two playoffs, Karl switched to
his backup centers, Perkins and Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, Cummings and Brickowski, power forwards breaking down
at or near the end of their careers, were forced into the post by
default. Karl felt he couldn't count on McIlvaine, and in 1996,
felt the same way about Ervin Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   To make his defensive system work, Karl wanted super-athletic
players between 6-4 and 6-10 who could defend more than one
position.
</P>
<P>
   Which worked fine, until the playoffs. Not only did the Sonics
lack a banger for the more physical postseason, the demands of
Karl's defense wore out the regulars.
</P>
<P>
   Karl's six-year neglect means the Sonic pivot carousel spins
faster. With limited room under the salary cap, the Sonics will
seek another temporary retread, perhaps 7-foot free-agent Olden
Polynice.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't good enough for the Sonics a decade ago, when he was
their first-round draft choice. Now 34, he isn't likely to have a
late bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice already is part of the tepid legacy that includes Bob
Rule, Jim Fox, Tom Burleson, Jim McDaniels, James Donaldson, Alton
Lister and Benoit Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sonics media guide, the list of top single-game
rebounders goes 12 deep. Only one comes after 1983 _ Cage, in 1991.
Among the club's career rebound leaders, 6-5 guard Nate McMillan is
fifth, trailing Sikma and forwards Shawn Kemp, Cage and Spencer
Haywood.
</P>
<P>
   A good big man always has been an elusive quantity in the NBA.
Bloating due to expansion has created an even higher premium. It
seems the only way the Sonics will get a quality galoot is to pull
a Clipper to get in position to draft one from college.
</P>
<P>
   Short of such a dive, coach Paul Westphal might as well cajole
his old Phoenix Suns teammate, 6-9 Alvan Adams, out of retirement.
Adams can't be much older than Cage and Polynice, and for 50 games
he can stand at 25 feet and shoot.
</P>
<P>
   In a carnival sideshow season just short of featuring bearded
ladies and two-headed calves, Adams would hardly be considered a
freak.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton proposed Tuesday night that the
federal government invest for the first time in the stock market to
strengthen Social Security, as he delivered a confident report on
the State of the Union to a Congress considering cutting short his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in the grand chamber of the House of Representative a
month to the day after he was impeached there, Clinton also urged
Congress to begin contributing $33 billion a year to a new system
of retirement accounts for American workers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The President smiled and even joked with his audience of
antagonists and allies as he ignored the trial steps away in the
Senate _ where lawyers began defending him just a few hours earlier
_ and envisioned using the rest of his term to strengthen the
nation's schools, military forces and programs for the elderly. In
a sure-footed, 77-minute address, Clinton coupled a rosy appraisal
of the nation's state with an urgent appeal for action, flaunting
his laurels but insisting he would not rest on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is working again,'' Clinton said. ``The promise of our
future is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow
the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced Tuesday night that the Justice Department was
preparing to sue tobacco companies, opening a new front in a war
that has repeatedly gained him political ground. He argued that
federal programs like Medicare were due hundreds of billions of
dollars for the costs of treating lung cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The president left it to his lawyers to attack the charges he
broke the law to cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky, the
former intern. But he seized on his State of the Union message as
his most potent defense, just as for the last turbulent year he has
counted on his dogged advocacy of popular programs to sustain him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton exuded ease and a sense of political control, reacting
with unmistakeable delight when both sides of the chamber erupted
in applause for his call for equal pay for equal work by women or
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was more encouraging, you know,'' he said, grinning and
spreading his arms wide as he bent slightly from side to side.
``There was more balance on the seesaw. I like that!''
</P>
<P>
   After the traditional bipartisan ovation welcoming the
president, Democrats applauded far longer and louder, and some of
Clinton's accusers sat with lips compressed and hands folded.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton tried to draw his opponents in. Early, he recalled
the acceptance speech of the new Speaker of the House, Dennis
Hastert, who called for members to work together in a spirit of
civility and bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly that,'' the president said,
turning and extending his hand to the Republican. A surprised
Hastert accepted the handshake.
</P>
<P>
   The president presented his legislative shopping list _ from an
initiative to ease traffic congestion to a $1 billion program to
help people switch from welfare to work _ to a Republican Congress
with far different plans for spending the surpluses accumulating
after decades of deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if some of his plans stand little chance of passage,
Clinton was able to command a television audience for a recitation
of the economic benefits of his leadership _ and an implicit
argument that the trial is an unwarranted distraction from
important business.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our
confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet
our historic responsibility to the 21st century,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling this time ``a new dawn for America,'' he urged his
listeners to ``put aside our divisions'' and find ``a new hour of
healing and hopefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   The president recognized several people in the galleries to
underscore his points. Among them, Sammy Sosa, the home run hitter,
and Rosa Parks, the civil rights demonstrator, brought thunderous
applause that created an image of bipartisan bonhomie, at least on
television. The president also singled out his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, whose loyalty and advice have been key to his political
stamina. ``I'd like to take just a minute to honor her,'' he said.
Mrs. Clinton beamed as the president gazed up at her through
squinting eyes. She rose, sat, then rose again to wave and
acknowledge applause.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Clinton was interrupted about 98 times by the usually
partisan applause.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the peculiar political dynamic unfolding here,
Republican Senate leaders also seemed eager on Tuesday to play down
the trial. They laid out their own legislative agenda in the
morning, insisting that mulling the first removal ever of a sitting
president would not divert them from what the Majority Leader,
Trent Lott, called ``the people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   In giving the Republican response, Rep. Jennifer Dunn of
Washington assured her viewers that ``our country is not in
crisis,'' and that ``no matter what the outcome of the president's
situation, life in America will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton devoted only a fraction of his speech to foreign policy,
joining in one paragraph a statement of pride in Northern Ireland's
peace with a condemnation of the violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Though the president called for sure-fire political initiatives
like putting 50,000 more police officers on the street, he also
used his speech to push beyond his short-term predicament. He urged
a long-term fix to the Social Security system his associates said
he hopes will shine through the historic blot of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a political free fall over the coming budget
surplus, Clinton urged Congress in his State of the Union Message
last year to ``Save Social Security first.'' That proved a deft
political move, stifling Republican appeals for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But with the surpluses growing and a new politics of prosperity
firing legislators' imaginations, Senate Republicans declared that
they would seek a 10 percent cut this year in personal income tax
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Clinton again moved to box them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reach out my hand to all of you in both house of both
parties and ask you to join me in saying: We will save Social
Security now,'' he said. ``Last year, we wisely reserved all of the
surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social Security.
Again, I say, we should not spend any of it until after Social
Security is truly saved. First things first.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For a month, the White House has deliberately leaked out
proposals from Clinton's State of the Union speech to capture
headlines showing the president at work. But it held back its plans
for Social Security as well as for tobacco, to insure that
Clinton's substantative proposals, rather than the spectacle of his
appearance before Congress, would drive Tuesday night's news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued that 62 percent of forthcoming federal surpluses
should be earmarked to preserve Social Security, a program that was
at the heart of the Democratic New Deal but that has since
developed overwhelming popular support.
</P>
<P>
   Another 15 percent of the surpluses, Clinton said, should go to
protect the Medicare program, which assists the elderly with health
care. The president would spend about 11 percent of the surpluses
to create new retirement savings accounts, called ``universal
savings accounts.'' Under his plan, money put into the accounts by
workers would be matched by the federal government, which would
spend some $33 billion a year on the program.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the surpluses _ roughly another 11 percent,
according to the administration _ would go to defense and domestic
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Clinton proposed that $2.7 trillion of a projected $4.4
trillion in surpluses in the next 15 years be reserved for Social
Security. The changes Clinton seeks in the system, the
administration contends, will keep it solvent until 2055. It is now
projected to run out of money to pay the claims of retirees _ who
are expected not only to grow in number but also to live longer _
by 2032.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration's goal is to secure Social Security until
2075, which means Tuesday's plan even by Clinton's standards is
only a partial solution. Clinton made clear that he had no interest
in pursuing politically unattractive options, like tax increases or
what he called ``drastic cuts in benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued that Social Security would be stronger if it
could invest some of its trust fund in the stock market, where it
could earn higher returns than from the Treasury bonds it invests
in now. Although state governments invest their pension plans in
stocks, this would be the first venture by the federal government
into the market.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the administration proposed investing up to 25 percent
of the new money for Social Security, or $700 billion, in stocks
over the next 15 years. Gene Sperling, the director of the National
Economic Council, said that under this plan, Social Security would
never have more than 15 percent of its assets in the market, a
level he called ``far, far more conservative than any pension plan
in the country does.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration proposes to work with Congress to create a
privately managed system to invest the money without political
interference.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans signaled they had no interest in the president's
suggestion. ``Government-controlled investment in markets is
contrary to free enterprise,'' said Bill Archer, the Texas
Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
He said such investment ``will open the doors to all kinds of
mischief involving government dictates, favoritism and cronyism.''
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the surplus money Clinton hopes to reserve for
Social Security _ about $2 trillion _ would, like the money he
would set aside for Medicare, go to pay off the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   That would simultaneously reduce the amount of government debt
and increase Social Security's financial reserves. It would help
bring down interest rates, stimulate new investment and create
conditions for faster economic growth to guard against the strains
caused by the retirement of the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said that under this plan, the federal debt would fall
as a percent of the domestic product from 44 percent today to less
than 10 percent by 2014. When Clinton took office, he said, that
number was 50.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing his fix for Social Security, Clinton heeded the
demands of his core Democratic constituencies, rejecting a
Republican call that individuals be permitted to make some of their
investment decisions about the money the government deducts from
their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he called for maintaining Social Security as a
``defined benefit'' plan, that is, one with a guaranteed payout.
But Tuesday night he also proposed the system of personal savings
accounts, which are similar to what Republicans are seeking as at
least a partial replacement for Social Security. For the president,
the new accounts would supplement Social Security, not replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Each worker would receive some flat payment, say $100, to open
an account. If he or she then chose to deposit more money,
administration officials said, the government would match a portion
of it, perhaps in the form of a tax credit. Sperling said that the
administration favored weighting the matching system so that it
provided greater benefit to lower-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides repeatedly referred to the agenda he presented
Tuesday night as the most aggressive he has offered since 1993 and
far different than the kind of agenda one might expect from a
president contemplating his seventh year.
</P>
<P>
   They were emphasizing that Clinton intended to stick around, and
they were trying to draw a sharp contrast with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed a raft of domestic initiatives, including
several to bolster education. This year, Congress must reauthorize
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as it does every five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The administration hopes to amend the law, which governs aid to
public schools, to demand that states and school systems begin
testing new teachers for competence, identify failing schools and
shut them down if necessary, and end practices like ``social
promotion,'' or moving children into the next grade even if they
have not gained the necessary skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year the government invests more than $15 billion in our
public schools,'' Clinton said. ``I believe we must change the way
we invest that money, to support what works and to stop supporting
what does not work.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ In an almost, but not quite, unanimous display of
support, Democratic members of Congress rallied around President
Clinton on Tuesday night, invoking nearly identical phrases as they
applauded his proposals and urged an end to the partisan warfare
that has threatened his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of Clinton's history of delivering State of the Union
speeches that stretched past newspaper deadlines, Democratic
leaders were faxing out their reactions even before he finished
speaking and were reaching through history for superlatives to
praise his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not since the president's first State of the Union address
have we heard as vigorous an agenda as he set forth tonight,'' said
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. ``He has put
forward an historic and aggressive set of initiatives, taking a
giant leap toward addressing American's concerns as we approach a
new century.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts described the speech as
``an impressive vision for America, an excellent agenda for working
families for the next two years and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York said the speech was
``the best argument for ending the impeachment trial with dispatch
because it showed all important things we should and could be
doing, such as helping Social Security and making the schools
better.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic reviews were not all raves.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the considerable pressure on party members to
support Clinton, some Democrats, particularly liberal ones, were
unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota said, ``His incrementalist
policies as outlined again tonight will not do nearly enough to
bridge the broad and growing chasm that divides the wealthy and the
prosperous from the majority of Americans who continue to struggle
to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone complained that instead, the president had included
what Wellstone described as meager efforts to deal with health
insurance and child care, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than boldly addressing one of the biggest concerns of
many working families, paying for child care, the president has
warmed over last year's plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina attacked Clinton's
plan to use part of the nation's surplus to bolster the Social
Security system, a plan he described as ``nothing more than a
modern-day Ponzi scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   But they were the minority. Most Democrats, emerging from the
chamber after the president's speech, offered strong support for
his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John B. Breaux of Louisiana applauded Clinton's plan to use
part of the surplus to encourage Americans to set up private
savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man's a wonder, he really is,'' Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of
Long Island, N.Y., said of the president. ``I think he was actually
better this year than last year.''

CLIPPERS IMPRESSED WITH SKINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the first round of last summer's NBA draft, the
Clippers selected a post player equipped with the luxury features
of strength, wisdom and an allegiance to hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he's here.
</P>
<P>
   No, Michael Olowokandi is next month's news. The guy we're
referring to is ex-Baylor center Brian Skinner, the Clippers'
selection with the 22nd pick. Skinner was one of five lonely
Clippers to participate in Tuesday's optional workout at Carson's
Veterans Park Sports Complex, and the reviews were favorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good big man,'' new teammate Lamond Murraysaid. ``He's
quick and strong, and he has a nice shot.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the team's abundance of large laborers, the
6-foot-10, 257-pounder newlywed (he and Rebecca Williams were
married Jan. 9) could have a nice shot at playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to do the things, the sure-fire things, that
I know I can do well, and that's defense and rebounding,'' said
Skinner, who took advantage of the NBA lockout by going to low-post
school in Houston. The faculty included such established NBA
postmasters as Hakeem Olajuwon, Antonio McDyessand Shaquille
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to focus on those two things. You do the dirty
things, you can't go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy should please Clippers coach Chris Ford, who
just happened to be a presiding judge during Skinner's first
pre-draft tour last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks when Skinner checked
in for an audition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did good,'' Skinner said. ``Basically, it's how you
perform in a one-hour period.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically seems to be one of Skinner's favorite words, and a
basic, fundamental approach defines his style of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the NBA would be a lot like college,'' he said,
``but it's not. You may only have to be really good at one or two
things, but that may be enough. Basically, you go with what
works.''
</P>
<P>
   Fab Five: Skinner and Murray were joined at Tuesday's workout by
guards Eric Piatkowski, James ``Hollywood'' Robinsonand Charles
``Spider'' Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of this session was a series of sprints _ known in
hoop lingo as ``suicides'' _ conducted by show-no-mercy strength
and conditioning coach Johnny Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first time I did one of these in about four
years,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' absentee list includes forwards Rodney Rogersand
Maurice Taylor (who have yet to attend one of the voluntary
workouts), forward Lorenzen Wright, centers Keith Clossand Stojko
Vrankovic, and point guard Pooh Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Points in contention: While the basketball world waits for the
start of the NBA's free-agent shopping riot, the Clippers remain
mum about their point-guard quest. New Jersey free agent Sherman
Douglas is believed to be a top candidate, but a league source said
the nine-year veteran may be leaning toward remaining with the
Nets. Miami free agent Eric Murdock _ who's expected to remain with
the Heat or replace Douglas as the Nets' backup _ remains in
contention, as does Darrick Martin, the free-agent Clipper.

MEN GAIN COACHING CONTROL ON WNBA BENCHES

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the final coaching pieces fall into place for the WNBA's
third season, half of the now 12-team league will be directed by
men.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Allen, an assistant to Nancy Lieberman-Cline for the
Detroit Shock last season, soon will be named coach of the
Sacramento Monarchs. Deposed New York Liberty Coach Nancy Darsch is
expected to take over the Washington Mystics.
</P>
<P>
   Allen joins Frank Layden (Utah), Orlando Woolridge (Los Angeles)
and Richie Adubato (New York) as former NBA head/assistant coaches
or players at the helm of a WNBA team. The other WNBA male coaches
are two-time Coach of the Year Van Chancellor (Houston) and Brian
Agler (Minnesota), who took the Columbus Quest to back-to-back
American Basketball League titles.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor and Agler also are general managers, as are the
Mercury's Cheryl Miller, Lieberman-Cline, Marynell Meadors
(Charlotte) and Carolyn Peck (Orlando). The other women's head
coaches are Darsch and Linda Hill-MacDonald (Cleveland).
</P>
<P>
   When the WNBA debuted in 1997, seven of eight head coaches were
women. Both midseason coaching changes saw women replacing women.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of 10 teams had women coaches to begin the 1998 season,
but two of the three firings saw women replaced by men (Layden and
Woolridge).
</P>
<P>
   The trend disturbs Lieberman-Cline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's free enterprise, you can hire whoever you want to hire,''
she said, ``but my point is the men have twice as many
opportunities,'' because women are not considered for NBA jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, Milwaukee's George Karl considered hiring Miller
for his staff before deciding the move was too radical for his
first season with the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discussed the possibility (of hiring Miller) with our
management,'' Karl said on his radio talk show in Seattle. ``We
felt in a new situation it was better to go out and make the sure
call than maybe take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Cheryl Miller is a lady who could end up on an NBA
bench some day. She's a pretty tough-minded person. She wouldn't
back down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman-Cline said she has no problems with teams hiring the
likes of Chancellor and Agler, whose collegiate careers were in
women's basketball. And she said until the WNBA has more coaching
stability, the top women's college coaches, male or female, are not
going to venture from their secure and high-paying positions.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who is returning to Turner Sports with the end of the
NBA lockout, is beginning the final season of her initial Mercury
contract.
</P>
<P>
   She missed some of early training camp last season because of
her Turner playoff obligations, turning to the Mercury full time in
late May before a June 11 opener. The impact of her absence was
miniscule compared to the week-of-the-opener arrival of half her
roster from the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   The post-lockout NBA season will conclude about a week later
than the normal regular season, so Miller's assistants, Carrie Graf
and someone yet to be named, will handle much of camp until early
June.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-game WNBA schedule will be announced late this month or
in early February, with play to begin the second week of June.
</P>
<P>
   Miller recently returned from a trip to Australia, where she
watched the Jan. 8 Women's National Basketball League game between
Mercury teammates on the Melbourne teams. The Tigers, with Kristi
Harrower's 14 points and four assists, beat the Bulleen Boomers,
with Michelle Timms' 13 points and five assists, 63-49.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, Adelaide Lightning, Boomers and Sydney Flames are
battling for the final two of four playoff berths.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury center Jennifer Gillom cut short her second season in
Turkey and will appear with teammate Toni Foster to sign autographs
from 6-7 p.m. Saturday before the ASU-Oregon women's game at Wells
Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Foster is running a basketball clinic at the Mesa Senior Center
from 8:30-9:30 a.m. Friday, while Gillom is to be the keynote
speaker at ASU's Martin Luther King rally at noon Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Gillom joined Teresa Weatherspoon, Kim Perrot, Tammi Reiss and
other WNBA players in New York this week to film a Budweiser
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury's Bridget Pettis is second in Italian A1 League
scoring with an 18.6-point average; Brandy Reed is third (20.6) in
the Spanish First Division; Marlies Askamp is first in rebounding
(12.3) and eighth in scoring (17.3) in the EuroLeague; and Michelle
Griffiths has helped her Italian League team in third place. &QL;

CROWD AT RESTAURANT FILLS IN THE BLANKS IN CLINTON'S SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ President Clinton didn't say a word about ``it''.
</P>
<P>
   He boasted about the balanced budget. But he wouldn't talk about
``that''.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called for 50,000 more police officers on the street and
touted the fact that the crime rate has dropped for six years
running. He saluted the Desert Fox troops and praised his wife. But
he never mentioned ``her''.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to. The crowd at Nixon's restaurant and bar said
it all.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Seivert slammed him for his affair with Monica
Lewinsky, while she nursed a Corona beer at this bar, which prides
itself for its political conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is comedy,'' added Chad Howlett, who came to watch the
show after work. ``He's such a joke. No one takes him seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   For 77 minutes, Clinton talked about everything under the sun,
including global warming, Y2K and social security. He trotted out
every feel-good symbol from the civil-rights icon Rosa Parks, to
baseball hero, Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Still few paid total attention. Not many lent their respect.
</P>
<P>
   As Shane Cretacci saw it: ``It's a little too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton took the podium, the crowd at Nixon's already was
betting that he wouldn't be man enough to discuss his impeachment
trial, which threatens to undermine his presidency. That he
wouldn't be repentant.
</P>
<P>
   And when he took time to honor his wife, a woman passing by the
restaurant in Phoenix's ritzy Esplanade couldn't help but yell:
``Give me a break. This is so disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the crowd here came to see if they would have
a change of heart about the president _ and about their elected
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Clancy, who voted for Clinton in 1992, couldn't restore his
faith in them.
</P>
<P>
   Cretacci, a Republican, bashed his party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel good about the way the Republicans have handled
this matter at all,'' he said. ``They've spent too much on this.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of listening, the gang here talked about work. Basic
watercooler chatter. Every now and then, someone would make a
remark about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one table laughs about his social security spiel.
``He's trying really hard to keep the baby boomers happy,'' said a
man at a table.
</P>
<P>
   Stefanie and Michael Lipson managed to make it through dinner
without hearing much of the president's words. ``I'll catch up with
it later,'' promised Michael. ``It's too noisy over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Too add to the festivities, bartender Murray Blake came to work
dressed in a judge's robe and pounds on the bar with his gavel when
the crowd gets too boisterous.
</P>
<P>
   However, he confesses, the robe isn't all in honor of Clinton.
Starting next week, he's going to make Monday night at the bar
``Murray-Ally McBeal'' night, where women can present their case
against their boyfriends and let him issue a ruling on them.
</P>
<P>
   He's off to make another drink. But a woman at the bar leans
over and tells me she doesn't think the president would win a
favorable decision.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton, finally ends his speech, two men at a table get up
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   One turns to me, winks and says: ``It's only fitting that we
came to Nixon's to see the president give his speech. Everything
has a happy ending.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie
Amparano will be taking the pulse of people in the Valley. Do they
care about President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed from
office? What does captivate Americans? She looks for the answers.

DEVILS FOCUS ON RELAY EVENTS  
 HOPE TO CRACK NATION'S TOP 20 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-SWIM-SIDE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even given a lack of athlete consensus as to if or when a
coaching change was needed in Arizona State women's swimming,
opinion is unanimous that the season need not be wasted.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 Championships, Feb. 25-27 in suburban Seattle, begin
five weeks from Thursday. The NCAA Championships, March 18-20 at
the University of Georgia, are an additional three weeks out.
That's not much time to adapt to a new coaching style and pull
together the relays that are so critical to a respectable finish at
nationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoring individually just doesn't do the trick,'' said junior
Casey Murphy, a co-captain. ``So many teams that just bring relays
have scored higher than us. That's what is going to get us into
that top 20 or 15.''
</P>
<P>
   The ASU medley relays and 800-yard free relay are ranked among
the top eight nationally, and the 400 free is 12th. The 200 free is
not among the top 15.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Chasson, now coaching the ASU men and women, thinks both
teams can improve upon their 1998 national finish (men 10th, women
29th) and that the women are capable of cracking the top 20 for the
first time since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Camilla Johansson (backstroke), junior Carolyn Adel
(middle-distance freestyle and individual medley) and freshmen
Riley Mants (breaststroke) and Sarah Baham (butterfly) all have at
least B qualifying times for nationals, with five chances still to
make the automatic cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, co-captain Tiffany Houser, Lauren Morelli, Stephanie
Elwonger and Anna Ericson are others who can qualify, depending how
they adapt to Chasson's workouts and training with the men.
</P>
<P>
   The teams are practicing together from 6-8 a.m. Their afternoon
workouts overlap for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a lot more satisfaction if you beat one of the
guys than to beat a girl,'' said Adel, who agrees that rapport
between the two teams is improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know each other better because you spend so much time
together, and there is definitely a lot more respect because you
know what everybody else does. In separate programs, you kind of
know what they do, but you've never been there and actually done
the same sets, so there is not that same level of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Adel and the freshmen standouts are among those who question why
Coach Tim Hill was removed at midseason.
</P>
<P>
   After a university committee studied attrition within the
program, Hill was placed on administrative leave for the rest of
the school year, with his contract not to be renewed. Hill has been
at the pool almost daily since the change four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a very good relationship with Tim, but the first
time I saw him was kind of awkward because you really don't know
what to say,'' Adel said. ``He actually called me at home (during
semester break) and told me what happened. I think he's handling it
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Chasson made the time to take his new team to a trust-building
ropes course in Scottsdale and hiking on South Mountain and met
individually with each swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the decision was made, the team was kind of coming
apart,'' Chasson said. ``There were people that were pro-Tim,
anti-Tim and ambivalent. So the main thing was to bring everybody
back together.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the team should benefit from having the cloud
of doubt removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, I've really gained so much,'' Houser said. ``I'm
very happy to be here, and I think that's what is making me swim as
well as I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Casey (Murphy) and me, it was difficult because as
captains we have to think for the team. We were seeing a lot of
hurt. We see now the team is kind of turning around, people are
happier, the attitude overall is much better. You can sense that,
and of course that's going to make me swim better because they're
happy, I'm going to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Baham, from Arcadia, Calif., already has set a school record
(54.76 seconds) in the 100 butterfly, breaking a mark that stood
for 17 years, and is third all-time in the 200 fly. Mants, a 1996
Canadian Olympian, is ranked second nationally in the 200 breast
off her time (2:12.70) at the Texas Invitational in early December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks I'm doing really well and is confident that
I'm going to go to NCAAs and I believe it, but I don't expect just
to go,'' Baham said. ``I want to go and be a name up in front. I
got the school record so I guess that's good, but I expect a lot
more out of myself than most people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mants said she is swimming better than she has since the Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real happy here and I like the team, I like the coaches,
the environment,'' she said. ``I never found anything wrong with
Tim. . . . I guess they wanted what was best for the team, and I
guess this is it.'' &QL;

WASHINGTON STATE VIEWERS APPLAUD CLINTON'S SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As Washington state voters watched President Clinton's
State of the Union speech Tuesday night, they seemed to be hearing
his message and marveling at the embattled president's fabled
performance under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared to have succeeded in going over the talking
heads in the nation's capital and connecting with the ``other''
Washington that has twice backed him for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man's ability to pull this off, with the pressure this
bird is under, is really phenomenal,'' said Patricia Fleeson, a
longtime Bellingham civic activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can put the strains on the back burner, put his energy into
a speech like this, and address people with hope and aspiration,''
she added. ``He's somethin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Austin, owner of the Merchants Deli in Walla Walla, added:
``This guy gives a speech, doesn't he? Whether you are a Clinton
enthusiast or opposed to Clinton, you have to agree on his ability
to communicate his message.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has sometimes been faulted by critics for ``bite-sized
proposals'' and the lack of an overarching vision. But the
specifics in Tuesday night's speech appeared to be one of its major
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Tilly, a Chelan County Public Utility District
commissioner, watched Clinton from her home in Wenatchee. He struck
a chord with the former high school music teacher on the issue of
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked what he said about more money for summer school,
after-school programs, children needing special help, and money to
modernize schools. I liked that emphasis,'' Tilly said.
</P>
<P>
   A Snohomish County businessman, Chuck Shigley, chuckled over the
multiplicity of programs that Clinton was able to shoehorn into a
speech that lasted about 77 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm exhausted,'' Shigley added. ``He stuffed at least six
pounds into a five-pound bag. But I liked it for its brightness and
upbeatness.''
</P>
<P>
   Shigley has been a substantial contributor to such Republican
politicians as Sen. Slade Gorton and Rep. Jack Metcalf of
Washington. But he was disappointed at Washington GOP Rep. Jennifer
Dunn's televised response to Clinton, particularly her
no-tanks-in-the-streets reference.
</P>
<P>
   And Shigley noted that Clinton has not been shy about
appropriating ideas from Republicans. Several proposals popped up
last night _ retirement security savings accounts, performance
exams for teachers _ originally suggested by GOP officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded awfully Republican to me, he seems to be taking a
page out of the Republican playbook,'' said Berandine Rogstad,
until recently Republican chairman in Whatcom County. She pointed
to Clinton's talk about local control of education and tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last night's performance, Rogstad still believes Clinton
is ``an embarrassment to our nation. ... No, I don't think he is
credible or effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Natt, publisher of the Daily News in Longview, said,
however, that Clinton's agenda is ``very clever politics''
especially in the context of the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cast such a wide net and couched it in terms that you would
think, `Geez, what laudable goals, and we should work together to
get these things done.' Implicit in this feeling is that he gets to
keep his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Democrats and Republicans, so bitterly divided over Clinton
and different even in their body language Tuesday night, succeed in
working together in the 106th Congress?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty to do and we ought to get at it. As soon as
possible,'' Natt argued. ``If we can get the impeachment matter
behind us, yes, they can work together. We've got to get the
impeachment matter behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not been known for spontaneous humor in his
speeches, one factor that has caused pundits and the public to
wince at how long the president can keep talking.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, however, the president seemed unusually light on
his feet, with quips about the lone congressman who stood and
applauded his proposals to combat the Y2K problem, and his joke
about the inequality in applause from Democratic and Republican
sides of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept a wonderful sense of humor. I was not expecting him to
play the crowd with such wit,'' said Valerie Bystrom, a teacher at
Seattle Central Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Perry, a longtime labor union activist from Bellingham, said
one strength of the speech was that ``Clinton enjoyed himself,
while the Republicans did not enjoy themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But Austin applauded Republicans for their courtesy toward a
president that a majority, at least in the House, have voted to
impeach and are campaigning to remove from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican side of the aisle were very courteous in their
approach,'' he said. ``They set the trial aside.''
</P>
<P>
   But Drew Pettus, a Bellingham attorney, criticized the ``glum,
spoiled-sport'' look on the faces of Republican lawmakers. ``He
(Clinton) created a contrast, of a president dealing with problems
important to the average person, and the other side taking a johnny
one-note approach. They seem to have one thing on their minds:
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Haman, a Republican activist on Whidbey Island, saw part of
the president's speech before going off to a meeting of the Langley
cemetery board. Haman voiced worry that Clinton has appropriated
his party's ideas while the GOP has buried itself with the
impeachment effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having watched Clinton tonight, I was impressed how he once
again picked up on Republicans' issues,'' said Haman. ``Most of his
initiatives have their origins in things we were saying and doing.
But nobody remembers that these belong to the Republican Party.
Perhaps the reason is that we have been so busy trying to destroy
him that we have forgotten how to promote ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were jubilant over the president's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pushed the right buttons for me,'' said Peggy Johnson, an
administrator of a care facility in southwest Washington. She
praised Clinton's proposal of tax credits for families caring for
an aging or disabled relative, and his promise of affordable
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, Clinton still seems to have the ability to
make the country feel bullish and buoyant, despite the never-ending
drumbeat of scandal from Washington, D.C., commentators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is such a contrast,'' said Seattle architect Arne Bystron.
``It is so hard to believe that those people are so wound up
looking at their navels that they can't see what is happening out
in the rest of the country. He can.''

SWIMMING PROGRAM PER FORMING A FLIP TURN AT ASU  
 COACHING CHANGE SEEN AS KEY 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-SWIMMING-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can you hear the buzz?
</P>
<P>
   It's soft, still imperceptible to those outside of swimming, and
perhaps nothing more than the reverberation of a midseason coaching
change and the shift of four-time Olympic medalist Gary Hall Jr. to
Arizona State for training, but it's a sound nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need more good buzz about ASU, and if there's a
combined program and people are happy and they're swimming well,
then that's going to help spread the word to coaches all over the
place and swimmers,'' said Mike Chasson, who in his first season as
ASU men's coach recently inherited the women's team upon the firing
of 14th-year Coach Tim Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more swimmers, male or female, who are swimming fast and
have good things to say,'' the better, Chasson said. ``Let's say
the guys' team is doing really well, but another coach is coaching
the women and they're all unhappy and they're complaining. That's
negative PR for our program.''
</P>
<P>
   That, more or less, was the problem at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   Due to attrition and injuries, the women's senior class that
began with eight swimmers was reduced to one, co-captain Tiffany
Houser. There are seven juniors remaining from an original class of
15. Assistant coaches came and left with regularity.
</P>
<P>
   A committee formed by the athletic department in November to
study the women's team, which fell to its lowest national finish
(29th) under Hill last season, concluded immediate action was
required. So on Dec. 28, rather than continuing a 10-day vacation,
Chasson began integrating the women into a combined program under
his direction.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the timing, the change didn't surprise others in the
club swimming community, which was a surprise to Chasson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they knew it was going to happen when I
didn't know,'' said Chasson, who was hired away from Harvard to
replace the retiring Ernie Maglischo as men's coach. ``I did not
expect to be doing this in the middle of the season, there's no
doubt about it. I didn't expect to be doing it at any point. My
first wish would really have been that Tim had done a great job and
was still going to be coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only comment to (the committee) was if you're really going
to make a change, then I think the best thing for Arizona State
swimming is to have a combined program.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, Southern California, Georgia and Auburn are among the
schools with combined programs, and all have men's and women's
teams in the national top 10. The ASU men (3-2) are ranked 10th,
while the women (5-2-1) are 20th.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean it happens overnight,'' Chasson said. ``It's
taken Frank (Busch, UA coach) about five years to really get it
rolling, then the last couple of years they've been really kicking
butt. When people think about Arizona, they're thinking fast
swimming, not that they have a fast men's team or women's team.
They're thinking swimming is fast. That's the biggest plus about a
combined program.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch, the 1998 USA Swimming Coach of the Year, is in his 10th
year in charge of Arizona's combined program. The women were
runner-up and the men sixth at the 1998 NCAA Championships. Busch's
club program, Hillenbrand Aquatics, was women's and combined winner
at the U.S. Championships.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old Chasson also directs Sun Devil Aquatics, the
club team based at ASU's Mona Plummer Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Chasson points to UA's Rick DeMont and Eric Hansen, former coach
of the Phoenix Swim Club, as head-coach caliber assistants that
Busch is able to retain because of a combined program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can afford to pay quality assistant coaches more money,
which means we're going to get better coaches, and they're going to
stay longer,'' said Chasson, who plans to retain Victor Wales next
season and open the other two assistant jobs to a national search.
``I think the jobs are going to have an incredible amount of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   A third benefit of a combined program, Chasson said, is that the
budget can be used more efficiently with less duplication of
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting, of course, is more demanding for two teams,
especially since Hill did not sign anyone in the fall. Chasson said
Wales has done a good job catching up with the best unsigned
high-school women, and club coaches are contacting him about their
prep juniors. &QL;

LONGLEY TOUTS HIS DEFENSE, SHOOTING  
 COLANGELO CONFIRMS DEAL TO ACQUIRE CENTER FROM BULLS, CLEAR SPACE
ON
 SALARY CAP 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Unofficially, it's official.
</P>
<P>
   Suns President Jerry Colangelo confirmed Tuesday the Suns have a
pending sign-and-trade deal with Chicago for Luc Longley, and the
7-foot-2 center from Australia made his first appearance at
informal workouts at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be specific except to say we expect Longley to be in
a Phoenix uniform, and it's going to be one of those sign-and-trade
deals with Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns will send three players _ Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp
and Bubba Wells _ and a conditional first-round draft pick to
Chicago for Longley.
</P>
<P>
   Longley didn't come cheap, but the Suns took only $4 million
onto their salary cap and cleared $3 million, thus obtaining a
30-year-old starting center while losing only $1 million of cap
space.
</P>
<P>
   That could be an important aspect of the deal if the Suns have
to replace Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   Longley was cautious about assuming that the deal with Chicago
is done, but he said he hopes that it will be when a new collective
bargaining agreement is signed and players can begin signing deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first choice,'' Longley said. ``I'd like to be
here. I don't think any deals are done. Nobody knows what the
salary cap rules are going to be yet. And most of the major players
will fall into place first.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds good. Except Longley drove from Chicago to Phoenix. He's
planning to stay awhile.
</P>
<P>
   And when the deal is done, the Suns will have a center who said
his strengths are his passing ability, defense, midrange jump shot
and savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Phoenix signs me, it's because of my defensive abilities,''
Longley said. ``If I were going to take out an ad in the paper, it
would say, `Defensive post player who loves a warm climate.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Longley was a key component of the Bulls' triangle offense
because of his ability to read a defense and make the correct pass.
But he's also a dependable shooter who can pull defensive shot
blockers away from the basket. He believes Phoenix fans will
appreciate his total game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last four or five years, I've been a very specific role
player,'' he said. ``I'm capable of doing different things.
Basketball has got a lot of different aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Longley couldn't contain his dry humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed the triangle,'' he added, smiling. ``But I can
really let my ballhandling skills flourish in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls apparently made little effort to keep Longley once
Michael Jordan made his decision to retire, and Longley said he was
disappointed and surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other team in the hunt contacted me before the Bulls
did,'' he said. ``But you don't want to be in the carcass of a
once-great team waiting for the (vultures) to come pick us apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've got two young kids. It would be nice to be able to
let them go outside and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Longley played collegiately at New Mexico, and his wife is from
Albuquerque. He also has a new restaurant opening in Scottsdale in
the spring. He said his American roots are planted in the
Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   But he's still an Aussie first.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he'll bring to the Suns if the deal is struck,
Longley thought for only a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australian jokes and Foster's,'' he said. &QL;

CLOSER TO RUNNING FOR WHITE HOUSE, DAN QUAYLE RIPS `LIBERAL
REPUBLICANS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Saying he is ``on the verge of announcing his
candidacy'' for the White House, former Vice President Dan Quayle
has issued a strongly worded attack on ``liberal Republicans,''
with veiled references to other GOP contenders John McCain and
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had it up to here with Republican leaders who are more
interested in pleasing the ``New York Times'' and appearing on
``Meet the Press'' than standing up for what is right and the
people they represent,'' Quayle said in a fund-raising letter
issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have ordered my staff to never _ EVER _ utter the words
`compassionate conservative'! This silly and insulting term was
created by liberal Republicans and is nothing more than code for
surrendering our values and principles,'' Quayle wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possible candidates for president, it is Arizona Sen.
John McCain who has received the most favorable coverage from East
Coast media such as the ``Times'' in recent years. The
``compassionate conservative'' slogan is generally attributed to
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's letter signals the start of the first real contest
between him and other GOP White House contenders in the race to
raise the huge amount of funds needed to be seen as a viable
candidate in 2000. It is estimated that a successful candidate will
have to raise as much as $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The staggering cost of running for president has both Arizona
candidates already scrambling for dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle has scheduled a fund-raising event Jan. 25 during the
Phoenix Open, while McCain is planning a major event at the Arizona
Biltmore in March.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, McCain and Quayle, along with publisher Steve
Forbes, the winner of Arizona's 1996 GOP presidential primary, are
scheduled to appeal to California Republicans at California's GOP
state conference next month.
</P>
<P>
   With its early 2000 primary, scheduled March 7, and its rich
cache of delegates, more than any other state in the nominating
process, California is viewed as crucial to any Western candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Quayle has said he is leaning toward a run for the
White House, but his fund-raising appeal, on ``Quayle 2000
Exploratory Committee'' letterhead, makes clear he is ready to jump
into the contest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain filed his exploratory committee papers Dec. 30. He could
not be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have reached this critical point only after spending many
long hours with my wife and children over the holidays, considering
the pros and cons of such a massive undertaking,'' Quayle wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Quayle added, ``my family agreed that America
desperately needs a strong new leader who can restore faith, trust
and integrity to the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said his deadline for developing a draft presidential
platform is Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Quayle appears to position himself on the right
side of the GOP field with his attack on ``liberal Republicans''
and the ``compassionate conservative'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sick and tired of watching the Republican Party and our
conservative values take it on the chin from Bill Clinton, Al Gore
and the liberal Democrats,'' Quayle wrote.
</P>
<P>
   An aide said Quayle plans to reiterate the message Friday in a
speech before conservatives in Washington, D.C., at the
Conservative Political Action Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new poll shows that McCain is leading the GOP
presidential field in Arizona, while Quayle, who plans to announce
his presidential campaign in Indiana, trails far behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Behavior Research Center poll showed that McCain would lead
with 26 percent of Arizona Republican voters if the primary were
held today.
</P>
<P>
   It also showed Arizona GOP voters support Texas' Bush, giving
him 21 percent, and two-time former Cabinet member Elizabeth Dole,
giving her 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only 9 percent of voters said they would vote for Forbes, who
has become a regular at Arizona GOP functions, and 5 percent said
they would vote for Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 535 voters, taken Jan. 9-14, had a margin of error
of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Earl de Berge said the numbers suggest Quayle's
strongest appeal in Arizona is among older, more conservative
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's backers, he said, ``seem to be more to the right than
McCain or Dole or even Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the South Carolina Republican Party announced Tuesday
that McCain will be the featured speaker at the party's main
fund-raiser this year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will speak at the state's annual Silver Elephant Banquet
March 12, state GOP Chairman Henry McMaster said. &QL;

TOCCHET ENDS SCORING SLUMP  
 MOVES WITHIN 1 GOAL OF 400 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he was in a bit of a slump, having scored only three goals
during a recent 15-game stretch, Coyotes forward Rick Tocchet said
he'd take a goal anyway he could get one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could go off somebody's butt or even go off my own, I don't
care,'' Tocchet said.
</P>
<P>
   He got his wish Tuesday night during a 4-2 victory over the St.
Louis Blues, scoring his 14th goal _ and the 399th of his career _
when he put one in off St. Louis defenseman Rudy Poeschek in the
second period, leaving him just one shy of reaching the 400-goal
milestone he seems to have been chasing for months now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a couple more chances after that (to get No. 400), but
you try not to think about that,'' Tocchet said. ``The way things
were going there for a while, I was starting to say to myself, `I
want to get it this year, not next year.' But you've just got to
keep shooting the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number 399 was ugly, though.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Plate breaking &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick said he is only half looking
forward to the skills competition that preludes the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like doing the rapid-fire contest,'' he said, ``but other
than that . . .''
</P>
<P>
   What about the accuracy event, where players stand high between
the circles and try to break round plates fitted in four spots in
front of the net?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I used to like that one,'' Roenick said. ``Two years in
a row, I broke all four of them in six shots. (Boston's) Ray
Bourque beat me both years, though. He went four for four.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Slap shots &QL;  &QL; 
Versatile center Mike Stapleton, one of the Coyotes' top penalty
killers, did not play Tuesday because of a charley horse he
suffered during Sunday's 1-1 tie in Chicago. He is listed as day to
day.
</P>
<P>
   Two Coyotes farmhands, defenseman Brad Tiley and goalie Robert
Esche, have been selected to play in the American Hockey League
All-Star Game on Jan. 25 in Philadelphia. Tiley leads the
Springfield Falcons in scoring among blueliners, and Esche is the
team's starting goalie.
</P>
<P>
   This is Tiley's second straight All-Star selection. He missed
last year's game, however, because of a broken jaw. Tiley recently
returned to the Springfield lineup after missing four games because
of a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are expected to unveil their third jersey on
Saturday, Feb. 6 when they host the Chicago Blackhawks in a special
1 p.m. start. The jerseys are green and feature the head of the
Coyotes logo.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis defenseman Al MacInnis took over the NHL lead in goal
scoring by a defenseman this season when he collected his 12th on
the power play at the 19:59 mark of the first period. MacInnis
ranks fifth all-time among blueliners with 282 goals _ 11 shy of
Phil Housley and 22 behind No. 3 Denis Potvin. &QL;  &QL;

A NUGGET OF ADVICE FOR MCDYESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He gazed down at the America West Arena practice court and
listened to a familiar sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thump, thump, thump ''.`` .''`` .''
</P>
<P>
   The source wasn't a dribbling basketball but the rapid beat of
his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver''.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, Jerry Colangelo jammed his hands into the deep
pockets of his gray slacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the kid thinking''?``''
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, he felt his anger and blood pressure rise.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo is accustomed to having things his way. He usually
gets what he wants, whether it's a Charles Barkley or a Randy
Johnson or a baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Before last season, the Suns wanted Antonio McDyess and got him,
and paid a high price. Phoenix gave up Wesley Person, Tony Dumas,
plus two first-round and two second-round draft picks for the young
Denver Nuggets star. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trade brought lots of smiles
</P>
<P>
   The day the trade was announced, the boss looked almost as happy
as McDyess, who couldn't stop smiling, and his smile is one of
those smiles that lights up and warms a room.
</P>
<P>
   He was out of dead-end Denver. A Sun now, McDyess proudly held
up his new jersey. No. 34. Barkley's old number.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess had joined a playoff team and an organization with a
winning tradition. He and Jason Kidd represented the new Suns: the
cornerstones of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo stared in silence at the hardwood court Tuesday
morning. There was Luc Longley, the Suns center-to-be. There was
Kidd. But no McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   A free agent, McDyess is home in Houston, or maybe on his way to
Denver. Colangelo and McDyess haven't spoken. The team owner can't
pick up the phone and call the player and ask what he is thinking.
Until the NBA lockout settlement is put into writing, contact
between management and players is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   So Colangelo walks the halls of the empty arena, wondering,
waiting, sensing perhaps the worst is about to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns may lose McDyess, who was the best player on the team
down the stretch last season. Remember the night he scored 37
points against the Lakers in the Forum? During the one-man show,
Bryan Colangelo, seated in the stands, turned and looked at Arn
Tellem, the agent McDyess recently fired. Tellem smiled at
Colangelo, and the smile said, ``He's going to cost you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns never would have traded for McDyess if they hadn't
expected to re-sign him. They were prepared to pay (fill in the
blank). Under the old rules, they could have offered the moon. Now
the most the Suns can pay McDyess in the first year of a new
contract is $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Will McDyess take it? Who knows. The Suns are lucky if the
player's new agent, who also represents Nick Van Exel, returns
their phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of our control,'' Colangelo said. Those five words
sounded foreign to him.
</P>
<P>
   Pros, cons of Denver &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver. Is he nuts''? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McDyess should tune out his friends for a moment and do what
many people do when they are contemplating an important decision,
like whether to accept a new job. Take a sheet of paper. Draw a
line down the center. On the left write ``Pros.'' On the right
``Cons.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Pros'' for going to Denver:
</P>
<P>
   1. Familiar with city.
</P>
<P>
   2. Will play 45 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   3. Get to wear those mittens I bought two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   4. New team has four draft picks, thanks to me.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Cons'':
</P>
<P>
   1. Nuggets won 11 games last year.
</P>
<P>
   2. Team is up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   3. New coach has never coached in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   4. Get to play with Van Exel, who takes shots (lots and lots of
them) instead of Jason Kidd, who gets me shots.
</P>
<P>
   5. Less money.
</P>
<P>
   The decision facing McDyess is what neurosurgeons refer to as a
``no-brainer.'' My simple rule of thumb in advising an athlete
where to play professional basketball is this. Never ever go to a
city where the NFL team wins more games than the NBA team. &QL;

2 ARIZONA CONGRESSMEN SKIP CLINTON'S SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGON _ Rep. John Shadegg was not alone in boycotting
President Clinton's State of the Union address Tuesday. A second
Arizona Congressman, Rep. Matt Salmon, joined in _ although he
cited a lack of business in Washington this as a key reason for
skipping the event _ and so did about 10 other members of the
House.
</P>
<P>
   In the Arizona delegation, Sen. Jon Kyl and Rep. Bob Stump
passed on the speech, but for unrelated reasons. Kyl went home sick
Tuesday afternoon, while Stump watched the speech from his
Washington office, as he has done often in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Arizona delegation attended the address.
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg explained his boycott in a letter to his colleagues
co-written by Rep. Bob Schaffer, R-Colo. ``The president is
demonstrating his lack of respect for the Congress,'' the
Republicans wrote. ``We will not play a role in facilitating his
disrespect.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer, in an interview before the speech, said he was staying
away out of respect for the presidency, which he said Clinton had
``defiled'' by his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Permitting the
speech to go forward, he said, was ``conveying a sense of normalcy
to the country and to the world that I think is inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other members of the House who were reported as
boycotting the president's appearance were Rep. Bob Barr., R-Ga.,
one of the 13 House prosecutors in the Senate impeachment trial,
and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, in a statement, said he would watch the speech on
television but believed it was ``inappropriate and awkward for the
president to make this speech directly to those sitting in judgment
of him and those presenting the case against him in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has led the case seeking Clinton's removal from office. He
also decided not to attend, but it is not an unusual practice for
him, according to a spokesman, because Hyde is not comfortable in
large crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior Republican, Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, decided to
skip the speech, but his spokesman said it had nothing to do with
the impeachment trial. Boehner was in Hawaii with his wife
celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Also conspicuously absent when the justices of the Supreme Court
entered the House chamber was Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who
is presiding over the Senate trial deciding whether to remove
Clinton from office. Rehnquist's aides reportedly had questioned
whether it was appropriate for him to attend the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg gained national attention by announcing he would boycott
the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republic'' readers reacted negatively to the move. Calls and
e-mail were running 2-1 against his decision, with some saying it
showed disrespect for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   One man said he'd never vote for another Republican. Another
condemned both Shadegg and ``The Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares about Shadegg? The Republican Party is dead.
Finished. So is your paper,'' the man said.
</P>
<P>
   But others expressed outrage that Clinton would go before
Congress in the middle of the trial and praised Shadegg for
skipping the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only one who's not a hypocrite. They'll all be
sitting there and applauding the president,'' another woman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Noble, the district director for Shadegg's local office,
said the office received 224 calls in support of skipping the
speech and 162 against.
</P>
<P>
   ``People rarely call to express support,'' Noble said. ``For us
to have those kinds of numbers _ it's significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Paranzino, Salmon's chief of staff, said Salmon stayed in
Arizona to be with his family. He had no meetings in Washington
this week, so he didn't feel the need to attend the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon believes Clinton should have postponed the address.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not making a big issue of it,'' Paranzino said. ``He felt
the timing was inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Stump's chief of staff, Lisa Jackson, said Stump had long
planned to watch the speech from his office. He was not protesting
the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans decided to follow the lead of new House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who wrote in a letter Friday that despite
the ``discomfort,'' Congress had a duty to hear the views of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of respect for the office of the presidency, and for the
state of our union, we will listen to the president's remarks
soberly and with the dignity that befits the United States
Congress,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of Democrats who planned to skip the
speech, and most of the members of the minority party seemed

the Judiciary Committee: ``No one cares about that. Any member of
Congress who thinks there's significant interest in where he parks
his ass for the evening is delusional.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Suns President Jerry Colangelo, frustrated and perplexed, said
Tuesday that he's at his wits' end trying to figure out free agent
forward Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess still had not indicated Tuesday evening whether he will
return to the Suns or sign a deal with the Denver Nuggets, but most
signs were pointing toward his defection to the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the most telling: Colangelo confirmed that the Suns have
not been able to get McDyess' agents to return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 32 years, this is a new one on me,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   A McDyess friend, who is screening his telephone calls, at first
said Tuesday that a decision would come today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to get up in the morning, make his decision and
pack his bags,'' the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   But by Tuesday afternoon, the same friend said McDyess had
decided to take his time and might not make a decision until Friday
or Saturday. McDyess never has met Denver's new coach, Mike
D'Antoni, and could be planning a meeting when contact between
players and teams is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Another delay in finalizing the collective bargaining agreement
between the NBA and its union has pushed the start of training
camps back to at least Thursday and may mean shortening the season
from 50 games to 48 or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   While there were reports Tuesday that McDyess has ruled out the
Suns, sources said the team has not been informed of any decision.
But Colangelo said the Suns will be ready to move to other options
if McDyess chooses to play in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to be prepared if we don't (get him back),''
Colangelo said. ``For every logical reason in the world, he belongs
in Phoenix. He may or may not be influenced by people around him.
We don't have any access to him, so we don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never in a position where it's totally out of our control
like this. We find ourselves in an unusual position, and we just
have to play it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns gave up a lot to obtain McDyess in October 1997: Wesley
Person, Tony Dumas, two first-round draft picks and a pair of
second-round picks in a three-team trade.
</P>
<P>
   The club made that deal expecting to re-sign McDyess. But in the
summer, he fired his original agent, Arn Tellem, and hired Tony
Dutt and James Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, when we made the deal for Antonio, we felt very
confident, based on his representation and his desire to be here,
that we would be able to re-sign him,'' Colangelo said. ``We were
building around Antonio and Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed feelings. I'm very disappointed we gave up what
we did to get Antonio McDyess, but I'd do it again because it was
the right thing to do at the right time. This has nothing to do
with the decision to go after him in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Suns lose the McDyess sweepstakes, Colangelo said the
team will ``go to option B, option C. Life will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   There were reports Tuesday that the next option will be signing
Charlotte free agent center Vlade Divac. But league sources told
``The Arizona Republic'' that the Suns still hope to sign Minnesota
free agent forward Tom Gugliotta if McDyess leaves.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Luc Longley, the Suns could play Divac at
power forward. But Gugliotta seems to be a better fit at that
position. If Gugliotta either turns down the Suns or decides not to
wait on McDyess' decision, Divac is a possibility. The Suns also
could look at other options, such as re-signing Clifford Robinson
and adding another free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The club is known to have considerable interest in Miami free
agent guard Brent Barry, who also is being pursued by the Chicago
Bulls. &QL;

<P>
   AMMAN _ Piloting his own plane, King Hussein returned to Jordan
today following six months of chemotherapy treatment for cancer in
the U.S. While Jordanians publicly celebrated his reported cure
from lymphoma, they privately speculated about who will succeed to
the throne the king has held for 45 years _ and about the future of
their country after his reign.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of succession from King Hussein's point of view is
that Jordan cannot afford a weak ruler because it is less poweful
than all of its neighbors. He knows his dynasty cannot afford to
make too many mistakes. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Egregious and criminal conduct; repeated lying;
adultery, obstruction of justice and perjury. In great detail,
these are the charges that have been lobbed against the President
of the United States in the past few days. Is it any wonder that
Americans have such a low opinion of their politicians?
</P>
<P>
   Except, it seems, they don't. Most of the evidence shows that
Americans have, over the last few years, recovered some of their
trust in politics and government, and calling someone a politician
is no longer the worst insult you can level. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ The president is threatened with impeachment. His
enemies believe he is guilty of high crimes (not to mention
misdemeanors), and want him thrown out of office. They regard him
with a venom that at times defies explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, he is not Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   These days all eyes are on Washington and the president's
impeachment trial. But, for the past six months, a 15-member
Russian parliamentary commission has been busy investigating
whether there are grounds to impeach Boris Yeltsin. &QL;

   Serbian forces may have cleared the bodies from the mosque. They
may have succeeded in hiding some of the evidence from
international observers. But the implications of the massacre in
the Kosovo town of Racak cannot be cleaned up so easily, for the
anger felt around the world has been both heartfelt and genuine.
</P>
<P>
   If we do not wish to see more innocent people die in vain, the
only solution is to intervene in force to secure the separation of
the combatants in Kosovo and to hope that negotiation is forced by
the stalemate. &QL;

   Since paying out a stinging $54 million settlement a few years

<P>
   Almost half of its employees are now black or Hispanic, and
one-third of its supervisory staff are minorities. It has minority
representatives on its board and puts all staff through

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CAN it be merely a coincidence that the hero of Charles Dickens'
classic novel Great Expectations, a young lad who enjoys a life of
quality and growth through the help of an unknown benefactor, is
named Pip?
</P>
<P>
   You decide.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern version, Pip, also known as Scottie Pippen, is
heading for Houston and fresh glories after his unknown benefactor
(Michael Jordan) disappeared into the mists of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you judge this week's development, for content,
drama and hairpin turns, this is one terrific story, part Dickens,
part Alfred Hitchcock. The Rockets have almost lost the capacity to
surprise us, pulling a superstar out of their hats year after year.
First, there was the Clyde Drexler trick, then the Charles Barkley
sleight of hand, and now comes Pippen, who has won six rings,
meaning enough for his shooting hand and one for his toes or nose,
if he were that kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations for the Rockets are now as high as the highest
mountain. In Houston, of course, this would be Mount Olajuwon. It
would appear that by capturing the most desirable free agent on the
market, Les Alexander has made a payment on the new
state-of-the-art arena his heart craves. Give Les credit: He isn't
afraid to pull the trigger. He is a hyperactive deal-maker who has
tried to sneak a hockey team out of Canada, flirted with the NFL,
bought an indoor football club and a women's basketball team and,
for all we know, bid on the exclusive rights to the Y2K virus.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, of course, Rockets management is as talkative as
Marcel Marceau. Until the new labor agreement with the players'
union has been signed and sealed, any discussion about another
team's talent can be construed as tampering. If the Rockets so much
as said Scottie Pippen is ``a good American,'' wham, there goes a
$100,000 fine or more.
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen issued his own news release out of Chicago, which
means this is one deal the Rockets can take to the bank. One way or
another, they already have. Scottie will average more than $13
million a year over the next five seasons. At 33, three years
younger than Hakeem Olajuwon, Pippen becomes the candidate most
likely to lead the Rockets into their new sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   How big is this acquisition? Let's go to the record books.
</P>
<P>
   He restores the Houston franchise to its full quota of NBA
legends _ three out of the 50 greatest. He has been selected seven
times to the NBA All-Star and All-Defensive teams. And he was the
second-leading tourist attraction in Chicago, clearly behind Jordan
but well ahead of the stockyards.
</P>
<P>
   He will be a superb addition to the Rockets' roster, if just to
hear him talk about Michael, whose departure from the game was
treated not like a retirement but as an abdication. Because he is
human, you expect Pippen to be motivated by a desire to prove he
can win a title without Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he has grown weary of being asked about His Airness, but
then you recall Don Larsen's reply to a reporter who wondered if he
ever got tired of answering questions about his perfect game in the
World Series. ``No,'' said Larsen. ``Why should I?''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen can't shake the connection and probably wouldn't if he
could. So he hears the references, how he played Ginger Rogers to
Jordan's Fred Astaire, Robin to Batman, Keith Richards to Mick
Jagger, Lou Gehrig to Michael's Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   But if Scottie was not Jordan's equal, neither was anyone else,
and he never fit the bill as a true sidekick. Both could play
anywhere and do everything, the difference being that Michael
sometimes did it with a smile on his face or his tongue sticking
out. They were teammates for 9{ years, and neither won a title
without the other.
</P>
<P>
   You can't recall a city ever suffering a double hit the size of
this one, although the Florida Marlins' casting off most of a
world-championship team might put Miami close. But the Fish lacked
the history of the Bulls, Michael and Scottie.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie in 1987, Pippen came out of rural Arkansas as a
small-college All-American, distant and unpolished, unsure how to
react to Jordan's constant needling. But Michael had a mission. He
needed to disprove the opinion that he was a super one-on-one
player who could not lead a team. He needed another weapon in his
quest to win a title.
</P>
<P>
   He tested Scottie and found out soon enough that he had the
right stuff. ``There are only a handful of guys,'' Jordan said,
``who understand how to be predators on defense. Scottie committed
to it from day one. That told me he was special. Very few young
guys come in with the idea of doing all the thankless stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the game the Bulls played when they were winning three
titles in a row twice. This is the game favored by Rudy
Tomjanovich. And if Pippen can help the Rockets return to the
trophy room, he won't go unthanked.
</P>
<P>
   Great expectations, indeed.

HELLING RISK WORTH REWARD FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, there is more than a trace of a risk in signing a pitcher
with a 4.41 earned-run average to a three-year, $10.5 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're scoring along with the Rangers at home, get used
to it.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Rick Helling is exactly the kind of risk _
general manager Doug Melvin might call it ``speculative investing''
_ that the Rangers appear ready to take, as they plot their course
for 1999 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, the idea is to tie up young, arbitration-eligible
players to multiyear contracts. There are risks and rewards on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   The player gets a guaranteed payday for two, three or four
seasons. The club, on the other hand, gets to avoid a costly round
or two of unpredictable arbitration. A general manager can give his
owner at least a ballpark idea of what the upcoming seasons' base
payroll will be. ``Cost certainty,'' Melvin calls it.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians have been trying to do the same thing with
their core of young stars. The Pittsburgh Pirates, who can't afford
to be anything but small-market frugal, have followed the same
system in tying up Francisco Cordova and Jason Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signing Rick Helling is part of that way of thinking,'' Melvin
said. ``You're trying to put some of the most valuable parts of
your club together, and then hope that they can interact with your
minor-league system to give you the kind of solid ballclub you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Rangers' case, catcher Ivan Rodriguez is under contract
through the 2002 season, after signing a five-year, $42 million
extension in July 1997. First baseman Rafael Palmeiro is spoken for
through 2003, thanks to the five-year free-agent contract he signed
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton is signed through 2002. Left fielder
Rusty Greer has two more years left on his deal, plus a club option
for 2001. Right fielder Juan Gonzalez is obligated through the 2000
season, though the Rangers will try to sign him to a contract
extension this spring. Closer John Wetteland is also signed through
the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many seasons ago, the Rangers just didn't do business
that way. Young players seemed to progress through annual bouts of
arbitration, where tension and sometimes animosity would take root
between management and the player's agent. As soon as the player
would reach free agency, he'd bolt.
</P>
<P>
   (See Brown, Kevin).
</P>
<P>
   The current cluster of long-term deals, however, gives Melvin a
solid nucleus to build upon. Only Palmeiro is over 30. Ideally, as
Melvin said, the rest of the puzzle would be filled in by the
club's minor-league system.
</P>
<P>
   Just put the numbers in place. Second baseman Mark McLemore has
been a loyal and valuable contributor. But he has one year left on
his contract at $2.4 million, and then is a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Tom Goodwin will make $3.2 million this season
and then, he, too, is a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The two brightest, closest-to-ready prospects in the Rangers'
farm system are a center fielder (Ruben Mateo) and a soon-to-be
second baseman (Kelly Dransfeldt).
</P>
<P>
   More puzzle parts: Subtract the salaries of McLemore, Goodwin,
Roberto Kelly and Luis Alicea (both signed only through 1999), and
you have approximately $8.5 million to spend in the year 2000
toward _ what? Pitching?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some risks involved,'' Melvin concedes. ``The
players you sign long-term have to stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you really have to make sure you pick the right players.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling is Exhibit A of why the Rangers are right to take the
risk. Signing young players to contracts like his gives the team
the luxury of a wider timetable to evaluate its investment.
</P>
<P>
   With more time, again, it's easier to make the puzzle pieces
fit. Trading Dean Palmer, for instance, gave the Rangers Goodwin _
but it also bought more time for Mateo to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin is convinced that pulling the plug relatively early in
the 1997 season _ trading Palmer, Ken Hill and Ed Vosberg _ when
the club was 6 1/2 games out of first place, was a key factor in
winning the AL West title in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be another player or two on this club that we want
to do on a multi-year deal,'' Melvin said. ``If players are willing
to do it and willing to come forward, the Helling signing is
evidence that we're willing to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are risks. But there's also a new owner, and he
doesn't seem to like second place.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Beaming indomitability, President Clinton
shouldered past friend and foe in Congress on Tuesday night to
personify for the nation the question of the hour: Is he on the
brink of destruction, or at some fresh peak of resilience?
</P>
<P>
   ``America is working again,'' Clinton declared as he closed out
an extraordinary Capitol day that arced from accusations to
accolades, from his harrowing impeachment trial to an ebullient
delivery of his State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   Throatily cheered by the Democrats, the president moved across
the House floor as if he indeed believed that the trial to remove
him from office was, at its heart, another initiative-rich
political campaign to be won _ his third and ultimate test to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats shouted encouragement of their champion; House
Republican leaders who led the impeachment campaign remained
noticeably undemonstrative.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of political and personal anguish, Hillary Rodham
Clinton _ no less a &UR;  &LR; scarred veteran of grand jury inquiries than
the president _ looked with smiles upon her husband as if he were
the First Survivor down there detailing the strengths of the Union.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination of watching such a durable, if self-tarnished,
president perform at the very firebase of impeachment prompted
grudging, less boisterous applause from Republicans. Some of his
House Republican prosecutors simply stood as he entered without
applauding the president they are fighting to banish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reach out my hand to those of you of both parties in both
houses,'' Clinton declared, speaking not of his own chances of
political extinction but of Social Security proposals that, he well
knows the polls show, excite Congress' constituents far more than
does the Republicans' impeachment drive.
</P>
<P>
   The House scene presented an eerily exultant blend of lethal
politics within the Capitol and a far more soaring opportunity for
Clinton to reach beyond to the nation at large. His confidence grew
with the ap- plause lines. By the time he introduced Rosa Parks,
the heroine of racial desegregation who refused to get up from a
``whites only'' bus seat in Montgomery, Ala., the President cued
wide applause in happily declaring, ``She may get up or not as she
chooses.''
</P>
<P>
   The mob of watching fellow politicians, aware that Clinton's
popularity ratings have only further solidified since the trial
opened, eyed the president as a wounded but formidable contender
regaining his game, at least for this speech.
</P>
<P>
   He watched them, in turn, for hopeful signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was encouraging, you know?'' the president suddenly
interjected at a bipartisan burst of applause at a pay-equity
propoposal. ``There was more balance on the see-saw!'' he enthused,
nudging forth more applause.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in the audience appreciated Clinton's
endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the same problem, don't we?'' Sen. Ted Stevens of
Alaska asked in commenting on the burdens on the president but also
on his impeachment court. ``It's the strength of the system, not of
any one individual. Our Constitution provides for government to go
on no matter what happens to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of government going on was embodied by Clinton as he
entered the House chamber most eagerly, his smile undaunted, his
spirit seeming far from the Senate dock, just a short stroll to the
Capitol's far side. His own trial, while never explicitly alluded
to in his speech, seemed to punctuate the night as much as all the
bursts of applause.
</P>
<P>
   He talked of moving beyond ``the daily press of events'' and the
``clash of controversy,'' so that future Americans will see that
``we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and
hopefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   Only hours before, the House Republican prosecutors helped to
fill television air time after Tuesday's trial session by
re-arguing their case and reaffirming their certainty that Clinton
deserves a Senate conviction and removal from office. Democrats, in
turn, darkly warned Republicans that they would be viewed by voters
as ``the party of impeachment'' unless they found a swift end to
the trial as much as a fair one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be and must be One America,'' the president firmly
insisted, speaking of immigration in a comment that seemed to
underscore the gravely fractured state of affairs between
legislature and executive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton offered national optimism, not personal apology, as he
faced, in effect, a mass political gathering of his judges and
jurors, defenders and enemies, all packed together in the same
chamber in ritual display of democracy's endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., earlier insisted, ``It seems to me
the impeachment trial has in fact sharpened our focus on
substantive issues,'' as if another day's impeachment argument was
an appetizer for the evening's searing political repast of the
president looking beyond his accusers to the judgment of ordinary
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The double-edged day began with the opening defense argument
before the Senate impeachment court by White House counsel Charles
Ruff, whose lawyerly tone in no way masked the bare-knuckled
resolve of the president's defenders to see to his survival. ``And
so we are here,'' Ruff solemnly declared of the approaching
showdown, proceeding to accuse House Republican prosecutors of
deception, ``nonsense'' and, above all, ``a rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we at that horrific moment in our history?'' he asked the
Senate, fighting back tears in pleading for the president to be
spared removal from office. Seated in the well of the Senate in his
wheelchair, Ruff provided a thematic prologue to the State of the
Union address, defending Clinton by interweaving the notions of the
nation's ``more perfect union'' with the ``human imperfections'' of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff kept the proceeding to little more than two hours, as if
deliberately clearing the day's main focus for the president's
message. Still, the scene displayed how emotionally draining the
occasion was: in the quiver of Ruff's hand as he pleaded before the
silent Senate; in the sudden urgency with which, off camera, the
Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, dispatched an
aide to do something about Ruff's microphone placement that muffled
for a while this most crucial pleading for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the two chambers, a sense of political free fall tinged
the comments of senators doing double-duty as the trial court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best ideas in Washington don't come from Congress,''
declared the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, as
he labored through the day to unveil a legislative agenda devoid of
the tar-baby impeachment issue that has been consuming the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was of similar mind as he addressed ``freedom's House''
Tuesday night, noting that the new speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, had talked hopefully of trying something new in the
Capitol _ ``a spirit of civility and bipartisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly that,'' Clinton slowly
emphasized in his own pleading. For the moment, both sides in his
polarized audience applauded the embattled president.

EXPERT ASKED TO DETERMINE IF OLD CHEST IS TREASURE OR HOAX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHARLES F. BOSTWICK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK _ Uncertain whether a battered chest
found by a Pearblossom archeologist was really left by a Gold Rush
expedition in 1849, National Park Service officials are calling in
an expert to determine whether the treasure is authentic and not a
hoax.
</P>
<P>
   An expert from the National Park Service's Western Archeological
and Conservation Center in Tucson, Ariz., is scheduled to arrive
Thursday to examine the chest, which Jerry Freeman said he found
hidden in a rocky alcove high on Pinto Peak at Death Valley's
western rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is authentic, the real treasure here isn't the
objects,'' said Terry Baldino, supervisory ranger at Death Valley's
main visitor center. ``They can probably be found in any city in an
antique shop. The treasure is who they belonged to and the context
where they were found _ the story they can tell us about the folks
who went across here in 1849.''
</P>
<P>
   The chest is in Park Service custody, turned over Jan. 5 by
Freeman, who found it while exploring possible routes taken by the
lost forty-niners, the first white people to stumble into the
lowest, hottest, driest spot in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Park Service employees are photographing and documenting the
objects, which include $52.75 in pre-1849 gold and silver coins, a
flintlock pistol, bowls, a shawl, a locket, a hymnal, law books and
a letter signed with the name of William Robinson, one of the lost
forty-niners, who died 200 miles away and 26 days after the date on
the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said an attorney has estimated that the chest and its
contents could be worth $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   A Death Valley park staffer checked Internet listings on the
coin prices. They would be worth only several hundred dollars if
there was no historic connection, Baldino said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We personally would all like this to be the real thing,''
Baldino said. ``It really would be a fabulous find. There is so
little left behind by the forty-niners when they trekked through
here that particular month. This would be a treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the factors that make park officials wary is that the
chest, if authentic, went undiscovered for 149 years. The Panamint
Mountains west of Death Valley are rugged, unpopulated and
unforgiving, but they were crisscrossed for decades by hundreds of
prospectors and treasure hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Within months after lost forty-niners found their way out of
Death Valley, treasure seekers showed up in hope of finding silver
deposits in the Lost Gunsight Lode, so named because one miner
picked up a nugget that he later turned into a rifle sight.
</P>
<P>
   They also were looking for $2,500 in coins rumored to have been
buried under a blanket, beneath a creosote bush in the Panamints,
when the exhausted forty-niners were out of water and no longer
could carry anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about all the folks and look at all the holes
poked in the hills, you start to wonder,'' Baldino said.
</P>
<P>
   Baldino said there was a resurgence of interest in the lost
forty-niners during the 1940s as the centennial of Death Valley's
discovery approached. A group interest culminated in the
organization of a group called the Death Valley '49ers, who meet
every November in the area and for years have explored the lost
miners' possible routes.

LACROIX FACES OLD FRIENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Nearly three months after being traded to
the Kings by his father, left wing Eric Lacroix played Tuesday
night for the first time against his former team, the Colorado
Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   In October, with Colorado off to a poor start, there were
murmurs from a portion of the Denver media that Eric Lacroix was on
the Avalanche roster only because his father, Pierre, is the team's
general manager. Notably, a column in the Denver Post ran under the
headline, ``It's time for total eclipse of this son.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lacroix was traded soon thereafter, and when the Kings next
faced the Avalanche, earlier this month, he was unable to play
because of an injury. He was understandably on edge before
Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you play against your old team for the first time,
it's a weird feeling,'' said Lacroix, who began play Tuesday with
no points in 29 games this season but recorded an assist on Garry
Galley's first-period goal. ``I'm very nervous. It helps that it's
been awhile. It would have been tougher if I had to play them right
away (after the trade).''
</P>
<P>
   As for his feelings toward his former teammates, he said: ``I
didn't leave behind 25 enemies. I left behind 25 friends.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Pierre Lacroix said he has put the difficult
situation behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much happened other than it became a distraction,'' he
said. ``Everyone on the team was clear that Eric Lacroix had done
nothing wrong. It was just the fact that he was the son of the
general manager that made it difficult for some not on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he regretted trading for his son in the first place _
the Kings originally had dealt Lacroix to Colorado in 1996 for
goalie Stephane Fiset _ Pierre Lacroix said: ``I never go back on a
decision. I'm a guy who goes very deep in reflection when I make a
decision. When we traded for him, we did it for the right hockey
reasons. When we acquired him, I voted against him as a dad. And
the others said to me, `You can't vote as a dad. You have to do it
for the good of the team.'''
</P>
<P>
   Courtnall returns: After missing two months with a broken ankle,
winger Russ Courtnall returned to the lineup, in a different role
from the one he had when he was injured during a loss at San Jose
on Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   When he was injured, he was on a checking line. Tuesday night,
he began the game on a line with Olli Jokinen and Luc Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different role than I've had since I was here,'' said
Courtnall, who signed with the Kings as a free agent early last
season. ``I'm looking at it as a great opportunity. There's an
offensive opportunity there that hasn't been there since I've been
here. When I came here, (coach) Larry (Robinson) put me in a
checking role, and I tried to take that opportunity and do the best
I could at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Colorado defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh played in just
his fourth game this season and his first against the Kings. He
spent the first three months of the season in a contract dispute
with Colorado before signing a two-year deal worth $6.7 million....
Winger Craig Johnson skated Tuesday morning, but his upper-body
movement clearly was restricted by the pain from the separated rib
cartilage that has sidelined him on a week-to-week basis....
Defenseman Steve Duchesne played after missing one game because of
back spasms.

DEREK HARPER TO JOIN LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every playground needs an adult to keep the kids
in line, and the Lakers just found theirs in Derek Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, 37 years old and a veteran of 15 NBA seasons, will be
signed by the team as soon as the lockout is lifted. His mere
arrival should be a positive influence on a team that is as young
as it is talented.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Lakers themselves, acknowledging their youth, had
frequently listed veteran experience as a primary need.
</P>
<P>
   Harper also gives the Lakers depth at point guard, where
experience was the most lacking. He joins third-year veteran Derek
Fisher and rookie Tyronn Lue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like Derek Fisher a lot. We think he's a very, very good
player.... We really like our young kid (Lue),'' Lakers executive
Jerry West said. ``But I think when you have a veteran, you always
feel a little more comfortable that if things get tough, maybe he
might be better in a particular situation than a younger kid. We
also think he'll be a very steadying influence on some of our
people.''
</P>
<P>
   More than just a longtime veteran, Harper comes with a nice
resume: 90 playoff games, including a Finals appearance with the
New York Knicks in 1994. He's several years past his NBA
All-Defensive team honors (in 1987 and '90), but Harper's work on
that end of the floor was a main consideration.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-4, Harper also has the height to defend against taller
Western Conference point guards, specifically Seattle's Gary Payton
and Phoenix's Jason Kidd. Fisher and Lue both stand closer to 6
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think defensively he can handle most guards out there,''
West said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who took over the starting job in place of an injured
Nick Van Exel last season and led the Lakers into the conference
finals, welcomed the addition of Harper _ even if it means moving
to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``As young as I am, getting a chance to play with or behind, or
however the arrangement will be, with somebody like Derek can only
help me individually,'' said Fisher, who called Harper ``one of the
classiest'' players in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need something like that on our team, especially
someone with as much experience as probably about five of our
(players) combined,'' he added. ``I'm going to be like a student in
a classroom, just listening to everything he says, picking up on
the little things he does in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Who starts and who finishes games will be decided in training
camp, coach Del Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Harper will sign a deal that falls under the minimum-salary
exception, which does not count against the salary cap. Under the
new veteran's salary scale, and as a player with more than 10
years, he will be earn $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also pursued veteran Kevin Johnson but would have had
to use the $1.75-million, middle-class salary exception to sign
him. West is reserving that exception for free agent Rick Fox, whom
the Lakers hope to re-sign.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is entertaining more lucrative offers elsewhere but is still
strongly interested in the Lakers. He could make a decision as soon
as today.
</P>
<P>
   West also confirmed the Lakers will reacquire forward Travis
Knight from Boston, in exchange for forward Tony Battie.
</P>
<P>
   No transactions are official until the lockout is lifted,
sometime in the next day or two.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers continue to mull possible deals for a power forward,
using Elden Campbell as trade bait. Minnesota's Tom Gugliotta,
Sacramento's Chris Webber and Orlando's Horace Grant are still
being rumored as possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice if you had a perfect team, and we try to do the
best we can here,'' West said. ``To say that we don't have an
interest in doing something else would be a terrible lie. But we
are trying to do some other things. If we would get somebody else,
we'd feel good about it, but to say we're close to something would
be false also.''

AGENT SAYS MAVERICKS' OFFER TO CEBALLOS IS INSULTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The agent for free-agent forward Cedric Ceballos
accused the Mavericks of low-balling his client and not negotiating
in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Slaughter said the Mavericks offered Ceballos a
take-it-or-leave-it three-year deal for about $6 million. He said
that none of the years equalled the $2.5 million Ceballos made last
season and that he felt the 6-foot-7, eight-year veteran deserved
better treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have thought Cedric is a dog as a player,''
Slaughter said. ``They figured the man would come running to
anything they offered. It just doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cedric was a great performer for Dallas, and they're asking
him to take a pay cut? You expect them to at least offer him what
he made last year. But ... they decided to be stingy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson said he made a fair
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more than fair,'' Nelson said. ``But I really don't
think a guy should ever sign a contract that he's not happy with.
So if Ced's not happy with what we offered, I'm glad he didn't
agree to it, and he shouldn't agree to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and Slaughter left the door open for Ceballos to change
his mind and accept the offer.
THOMAS ON BOARD
</P>
<P>
   Former TCU standout Kurt Thomas agreed to a one-year, $1 million
deal to play for the Mavericks this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said from the beginning that I wanted to be here in
Dallas,'' Thomas said. ``I've got a one-year deal on the table, and
then when this season is over hopefully they'll offer me a
long-term deal, and then I won't ever have to leave Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries limited Thomas to 23 games the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to show that I'm healthy,'' Thomas said. ``I know I'm
healthy.'' Bradley trade? Nelson first laughed out loud, then
denied a rumor that the Mavericks were about to trade center Shawn
Bradley to the Charlotte Hornets for all-star guard Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I love Shawn, I'd probably have to do that one,''
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked again if there was anything to the rumor, Nelson laughed
out loud again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you tell by my response?'' he said. ``If that's true,
consider it done from this side. I haven't heard of that one.''
WALKER SWITCHES AGAIN
After switching agents over the weekend, Mavericks forward Samaki
Walker apparently has had a change of heart and switched back.
Walker returned to former Los Angeles Lakers guard Norm Nixon
instead of switching to Dallas-based agent Randy Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame myself for making the change before, and I'm man
enough to admit it,'' Walker said. ``You can't have pressures in
this league get to you and allow you to make immature mistakes. I
thought I did that, and I'm back with Norm. I think I need to give
him a fair chance to get the job done.''
BRIEFLY
Mavericks guard Khalid Reeves has changed agents from Slaughter to
Dwight Manley, who represents Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie guard Greg Buckner (6-4, 210) has been added to the
Mavericks' training camp roster. Dallas drafted Buckner in the
second round (53rd overall). He averaged 16.3 points per game for
Clemson last season.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he's trying to work out a deal for second-round
draft pick Ansu Sesay to play in Europe.

WARBURG PINCUS TO CONTROL POST-PRODUCTION FIRM FOUR MEDIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Post-production specialist Four Media Co. agreed
Tuesday to turn over control to Wall Street investment banker
Warburg Pincus Equity Partners in exchange for an $80 million
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Four Media, which has been aggressively buying smaller rivals,
said the funds will allow it to continue expansion through further
acquisitions. The 6-year-old company, with 1,350 employees and
annual revenues of $200 million, wants to become Hollywood's leader
in one-stop services such as editing, mixing, language translation
and conversion to overseas technical standards.
</P>
<P>
   Warburg will own 51 percent of Four Media following completion
of the deal, which will give it 10.2 million existing and new
shares. Under the three-part transaction, Warburg will pay a
14percent premium over Four Media's closing stock price Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street endorsed the deal with shares rising $1.125 Tuesday
to $8 for a 16percent gain. ``This is obviously a very positive
announcement,'' said media analyst Stewart Halpern of ING Barings
Furman Selz, who has a 12-month target price of $12 a share. ``It
really gives the company additional financial firepower to do more
acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which went public in 1997 at $10 a share, had been
controlled by Wall Street investor Michael Steinhardt, who owned 33
percent, and Four Media Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert
Walston, who owned 15 percent. Steinhardt will cash out his stake
while Walston and other managers will own about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Four Media also announced former Panavision executive Jeffrey
Marcketta has been named to the newly created posts of president
and chief administrative officer. Marcketta left Panavision last
year after financier Ronald Perelman bought out Warburg's majority
ownership of the Woodland Hills-based movie camera specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern said Warburg carries a strong reputation as a savvy
investment group and noted that the changes help position Four
Media for growth amid increasing worldwide demand for its services.
``The company's business is very viable,'' he added. ``On a global
basis, entertainment content-related businesses are growing at
low-double-digit rates so the creation of new content and use of
existing libraries requires the kind of services Four Media
provides. It's a winning story.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Media reported earnings last month of $1.98 million, or 16
cents a share, in its first quarter ended Nov. 1, up sharply from
earnings of $225,000 in the 1997 period. Revenues were up 81.7
percent to $49.5 million. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

PETTITTE AGREES TO A DEAL FOR $5.95 MILLION IN '99 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: UPDATES with Isringhausen deal completed; SUBS 2nd graf and
last 3 grafs.) 
 (JT) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Pettitte and the Yankees led what appeared to be
a major retreat from salary arbitration Tuesday. Pettitte was one
of 15 players who had filed for arbitration but reached agreement
on new contracts Tuesday before exchanging salary figures with
their clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 settlements, including one between Jason Isringhausen and
the Mets, left only 38 players to exchange numbers. Among them were
Derek Jeter seeking $5 million to the Yankees' offer of $3.2
million; Mariano Rivera asking for $4.25 million to the Yankees' $3
million, and Edgardo Alfonzo trying for $3.85 million to the Mets'
$2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado of Toronto submitted the biggest number, $6.5
million, which was well short of the record high $9 million Bernie
Williams submitted a year ago. The Blue Jays countered with $4.2
million. The Texas Rangers put in the highest club figure, $4.8
million for Aaron Sele, who put in $6.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, whose 1998 salary of $3.8 million was the highest of
the 62 players who filed for arbitration last week, agreed with the
Yankees on a $5.95 million salary. He can reach an even $6 million
if he pitches 200 innings or more ($25,000 bonus) and is named to
the All-Star team ($25,000).
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said he was not
motivated in the negotiations with Randy Hendricks, the pitcher's
agent, by a desire to avoid arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Hendricks and I essentially put a good-faith effort
forward in trying to assess the market,'' Cashman said of the
negotiations. ``We had a lot of dialogue, a lot of disagreements.
But we analyzed them, had professional discussion and finally came
up with something we both could live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Pettitte's victory total has slipped from 21 to 18 to 16
_ he had a 16-11 record and a career-high 4.24 earned run average
last season _ some have wondered whether he will be dominating in
the future. Cashman is not among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I concerned? No,'' he said. ``A guy who steps up and does
what he did against the Rangers in the division series and the
Padres in the World Series, no, I'm not concerned with Andy
Pettitte at all. He had two periods where he went through slumps
and struggled, but he battled and pulled himself out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman declined to comment on the Jeter and Rivera filings.
Each player had a $750,000 salary last year, when the Yankees
renewed their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Among other players who settled Tuesday instead of exchanging
numbers (with their 1998 salaries in parentheses) were Jose
Hernandez of the Chicago Cubs $2.4 million ($725,000), Dustin
Hermanson of Montreal $2.05 million ($250,000), James Baldwin of
the Chicago White Sox $1.9 million ($300,000), Darren Dreifort of
Los Angeles $1.9 million ($685,000), Sean Bergman of Houston
$1,875,000 ($465,000) and Jay Powell of Houston three years for
$3.65 million ($320,000).
</P>
<P>
   Although the flurry of signings looked like clubs and players
preferred settlement to arbitration _ last year only seven players
settled on exchange day _ Gene Orza of the Players Association said
he didn't see a trend developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it is a function of where the numbers fall or
the relationship between clubs and players,'' Orza said. ``One year
doesn't mean anything. If it happens three years in a row, then
maybe I would say something is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little reason for Isringhausen and the Mets not to
settle because Isringhausen spent all of last season on the
disabled list and pitched very little the previous season. His
agent, Craig Fenech, said he and the club agreed on a contract that
was being held up because management's labor relations committee
was looking at a bonus provision in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Fenech said last night that he and the Mets had reworked the
contract so that the bonus was rolled into the base salary.
Isringhausen will have a $350,000 salary and can earn an additional
$175,000 in bonuses based on how much he pitches.
</P>
<P>
   If the contract had not been completed, the two sides would have
exchanged numbers on Wednesday, the agent said. Fenech didn't say
what those numbers would have been, but the Mets said they were
prepared to submit $300,000 and Isringhausen $450,000. He had a
$220,000 salary last year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Alfonzo, the Mets exchanged numbers with Armando
Benitez, $1,575,000 and $2.4 million; Rey Ordonez, $1.25 million
and $2,275,000, and Turk Wendell $1.05 million and $1,575,000.

NORTHRIDGE MUST WIN STADIUM FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The neighbors who oppose construction of a new Cal State
Northridge football stadium near the site of the old one _
precisely 75 yards to the south of the old one _ want to tell you
it's not Northridge football they oppose.
</P>
<P>
   They also want to tell you they have no ax to grind against the
university.
</P>
<P>
   They also want to tell you they are not weirdos or political
activists but everyday homeowners _ as Linda Tripp might put it _
just like you.
</P>
<P>
   One of their leaders, Pat LoPresti, is a soccer mom ``and a
softball mom and a baseball mom'' who's also a homegrown Green Bay
Packers fan. That's how much she likes sports.
</P>
<P>
   If Northridge played its football games on the Pierce College
field in Woodland Hills as she'd prefer, LoPresti said from her
house in Northridge, ``I'd coordinate the bus trips.''
</P>
<P>
   LoPresti also has a husband, a son and a daughter, a dog and
three turtles, and one of the turtles is missing but certain to
turn up. That's how normal she is.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is great except for the stuff in the first
paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   Because no matter how it's dressed up, a vote against a new
stadium, in the area between Zelzah and Lindley avenues known as
North Campus, is a vote against Northridge football.
</P>
<P>
   If Matadors football is ever going to be more than it is, it's
not going to do it in the little box of splinters known as North
Campus Stadium, which is below Big Sky Conference standards and
scheduled to be razed after next season anyway to make way for a
biotech facility. It's going to do it in a stadium that will
impress recruits, sponsors and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Even a spruced-up Pierce College stadium, a hundred stoplights
away, is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it is not expected to come to that when the
committee assigned to choose the best possible place for the
Matadors' new field holds its ninth _ and final scheduled _ public
hearing Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is expected to brush aside the Pierce proposal and
vote to recommend a stadium be built on North Campus just north of
Lassen Street, a modest little 8,000- to 9,000-seat number with the
flexibility to grow to 15,000 or so.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote, though, half an hour of public discussion is
scheduled, giving the leaders of local homeowners' organizations
one last chance to vent their anger and fears about this addition
to the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In those 30 minutes, starting at 6:30 p.m. in the Grand Salon of
the university's student union, we're likely to hear more passion
than the Northridge football program has stirred up in the past 37
years. Hey, any excitement should be considered progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to give up,'' said Bob Buckles, who has lived
in the neighborhood for 40 years and whose children are Northridge
graduates. ``I love football. I watch it constantly. I go to games
when I can. (But) I am also a resident and I don't want my peace
and quiet disturbed _ mightily.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckles and others in the anti-stadium movement _ which claims
membership in the low thousands _ charge that university
administrators really have their eyes on the revenue a stadium
could generate with non-athletic events.
</P>
<P>
   They say the Fourth of July celebrations in North Campus Stadium
are bad enough, what with the noise and the clogged driveways and
the littered front lawns. Imagine the carnage when the rock
concerts let out!
</P>
<P>
   ``The university (used to be) a plus because there was some open
space with corn fields,'' said LoPresti, who moved into the
neighborhood 12 years ago with her husband Bob, a former Northridge
baseball player who is one of two confirmed stadium opponents on
the site committee. ``We ran with the dog, we flew kites. Now there
are dorms there.''
</P>
<P>
   The ever-changing face of the campus, and the ever-changing
plans for further construction, have led the neighbors to distrust
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen an absolute litany of promises the university has
made and broken,'' Buckles said. ``I've seen, I think, 14 master
plans. I've lost count.''
</P>
<P>
   And the opponents are dubious of future promises, like the site
committee's recommendation that a panel including neighbors be set
up to approve or disapprove non-athletic events for the new
stadium. They claim this committee is stacked and that one would be
too.
</P>
<P>
   All of which David Honda, chairman of the site committee, refers
to as ``paranoia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it has been stirred up by the homeowner
groups (that) really haven't explained to their constituents that
this isn't a stadium, it's a football field,'' Honda said. ``I've
had homeowners call me up and say, `I don't want the Rose Bowl in
my backyard.' This isn't going to be the Rose Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling them paranoid might not be the way to win over the
stadium opponents. If trust is an issue, the administration would
be better off taking steps to restore it. Why not surprise the
homeowners, and actually give them a meaningful say in the
stadium's use?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the stadium will be built whether or not the
neighbors like it, unless they pull a rabbit out of a lawyer's hat.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the site committee will have done its narrowly-defined
job by picking the best possible place for the football team to
play. It's an all-too-rare case of mission accomplished for an arm
of the Northridge athletic program.
</P>
<P>
   After this, the next excitement Northridge football creates
could have a little more to do with football. &QL;

THESAURUS TAKES ACTION TO REMOVE GAY SLURS
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Wash.)  (dal) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster Inc., the nation's oldest and largest dictionary
publisher, on Tuesday took steps to remove references to
homosexuals in its classic collegiate thesaurus amid complaints
about a word list of offensive slurs and synonyms.
</P>
<P>
   That action came after the 150-year-old Merriam-Webster company
and American Online Inc. temporarily removed an online thesaurus on
Friday that contained a word list for ``homosexual'' that included
references to ``faggot,'' ``fruit'' and ``pederast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We very clearly had made a mistake and we wanted to get that
mistake out of the hands of the public and in a position where we
could start working on it very quickly,'' said Deborah W. Burns,
marketing director for Merriam-Webster, which she said was a
privately held company. ``We knew that while a dictionary needs to
be comprehensive, a thesaurus doesn't. We had a lot of unfair
words, unfair terms.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a corporate mistake that had been overlooked for at least
20 years because the same list of synonyms for homosexuals was
circulating in Merriam-Webster thesauruses dating to the late 1970s
that were promoted as ``totally new.''
</P>
<P>
   The words finally drew new scrutiny from gay-rights groups last
week after a radio show host in Seattle used the online version of
the thesaurus and e-mailed the results to a reporter at the GAYBC
Radio Network, an Internet audio news service. The reporter, in
turn, shared the list with a friend in Washington, who started
raising alarms through the Internet, entreating others to send
their complaints to Merriam-Webster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked on a number of fronts,'' said John Aravois, who
runs his own political Internet consulting company, Wired
Strategies, out of Washington. ``First of all, you're never happy
to read 20 different ways that you're less than human. Secondly, I
was shocked that they would use completely inaccurate words like
`pederast,' which essentially means pedophile. The only thing that
wasn't defamatory was `lesbian.' Everything else was words like
`nancy' or `uranist.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burns said the company would probably not revive its online
thesaurus for at least a week while the company's editorial staff
continued to review the reference guide for any other offensive
references. Although the company does not plan to recall any of its
printed material from bookstores, she said that future editions
would also be edited to remove the offending words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to make sure that it doesn't carry offensive
words that label people,'' she said. ``We're looking at the entire
thesaurus.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the company made the decision to excise references to
homosexuals to be consistent with a longstanding policy of not
offering entries for ethnic or racial minorities like Jews, black
people, or people of Hispanic descent because many of the synonyms
were negative. And with that decision, it issued a written public
apology that promised revisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merriam-Webster acknowledges that inclusion of these words was
the result of an error on its part, and it fully extends its
apologies,'' the company said in its statement.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster's swift response pleased some of its critics,
but some remained nettled by the company's decision to eliminate
the reference to homosexuals completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that there won't necessarily be inaccurate
descriptions,'' said John McMullen, a reporter and talk-show host
for the GAYBC Radio Network, who first raised the issue. ``I'm not
entirely happy that they want to withdraw the word altogether. When
I started this, we didn't do this because we wanted to censor any
words. We just wanted them to be accurate in the words they used.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation praised
Merriam-Webster's actions, noting that the group was starting to
check reference guides circulated by other publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we're starting to do more research, it's actually
more prevalent than we thought,'' said Cathy Renna, a spokeswoman
for the alliance. ``It's really not just an issue of
Merriam-Webster. We really have to look at how the definitions have
evolved.''

HIS FULL-TIME MISSION IS THE SUPER BOWL HALFTIME
</HEADLINE>

   Ed Micone, the fellow at Radio City Entertainment who oversees
the Super Bowl halftime show and brings in the big-name talent
(harder than you might think, because what the halftime talent is
paid for the Super Bowl is nothing), is a charming, fun-loving guy.
</P>
<P>
   He's got breakfast waiting when you arrive (he normally doesn't
eat breakfast, Micone says, but maybe the visitors do), and a gag
picture of himself _ and we are talking the top executive at Radio
City Entertainment, here _ dressed up as a Rockette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be comfortable,'' Micone, 49, says at his offices upstairs at
Radio City Music Hall. ``Make believe this is your house'' _ though
who has a house with autographed pictures of Whitney Houston and
Robin Williams and Liza Minnelli on the walls?
</P>
<P>
   Thus it is somewhat painful, after the requisite discussion of
the halftime stars at this year's Super Bowl game Jan. 31 in Miami
(Stevie Wonder, Gloria Estefan and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy), the cost
of producing said halftime show ($3 million) and Micone's track
record (Radio City Entertainment has been involved with six Super
Bowl games) to bring up the sorry matter of the reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Super Bowl, the more money that's spent, the worse it
gets,'' read a 1997 report in The Dallas Morning News. (``We didn't
produce that one,'' Micone says. ``We brought in the talent.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``If they put all of these moments on one video collection,
you'd have one awful video,'' The Chicago Sun-Times said the same
year. (``Who writes these?'' Micone says, equal parts wounded and
amused.)
</P>
<P>
   And, from The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, regarding the '96 show
starring Diana Ross, who was airlifted off the stage at act's end
in a helicopter: ``Why do stars agree to step into the Super Bowl,
anyway, when it's as hopeless a setup as the entertainment world
offers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they like it,'' Micone says. ``Diana Ross, she loved
it. It's a huge event _ we have maybe 800 million viewers. It's a
charitable event _ the sponsor gives $100,000 to the artist's
favorite charity. It's fun. Did you see the show with Diana Ross
going up in that helicopter? She wasn't sitting way in the back.
She was right at the edge. Where did you say this was from?
Pittsburgh. I'm not so worried.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who consider the halftime shows at the Super
Bowl intermission as the time to go to the bathroom or get a beer.
</P>
<P>
   It is the mission of Ed Micone to keep them in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   A former International Creative Management agent who was brought
into what was then Radio City Productions 10 years ago to beef up
concert events, Micone first snagged the National Football League
as a client in 1994, when he recruited Michael Jackson for the
halftime show. Today Micone is executive vice president and
executive producer of Radio City Entertainment, which oversees all
concerts and events at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall
and a number of big-site sports productions. Credited with bringing
big-name entertainers to the Music Hall, he has doubled the concert
revenue in the last 10 years. When Micone attended a Rangers game
recently, his name was flashed in lights.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Cause I'm  &UR; big &LR; ,'' Micone says, laughing at himself. `` Man,
that's what my wife calls me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The son of a dentist in Summit, N.J., Micone was hooked on music
from the time he saw the Beatles on Ed Sullivan when he was 13. He
was a drummer in his own band by the eighth grade. He also
negotiated beautifully for his band: got each member $5 an hour, he
says proudly, with a 10-minute break. At C.W. Post College, Micone
did even better. He booked the band that played the Fillmore East,
in Manhattan, before or after their weekend concerts, at a
much-reduced rate. The Beach Boys played C.W. Post five times.
Micone made money for the college and left school with a career.
</P>
<P>
   At age 26, he married Cheryl Graham, from the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very independent,'' Micone says. ``Before I asked her
to marry me I said, `Imagine this: It's a Friday night, we have
eight people coming over for dinner and I call up and say: ``Hi,
honey. It's Ed. I'm going up to Montreal to see Gordon Lightfoot''
_ he was a client then _ ``I'll be home Sunday.'' I'd love the
response to be: ``Fine, have a good weekend, see you Monday. No
problem.'' '
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `No problem.' I said, `Then we should get married.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Micone negotiated his marriage proposal? ``Probably.''
</P>
<P>
   The Micones have now been married 22 years and have a daughter,
Devon, 15, and a son, Graham, 19. They live in Annandale, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   His salary, Micone does not wish to reveal. What he wants to
share, very much, is the oversize Radio City Entertainment Guest
Book he has started. Down on the floor, excited as a kid with his
autograph collection, sits Micone, flipping through pages signed by
Rosie O'Donnell and Elton John and Adam Sandler and President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this awesome?'' Micone asks. ``Pretty cool, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   He stops at a note from John McColgan, the director of the
Riverdance troupe, whom Micone brought to Radio City.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The best eight days of my life,'' ' Micone reads. ``That's
what I do for a living. That's how I want people to leave. Saying,
`That was the best time of my life.'' '

RANGERS LOSE AGAIN, BUT SHOW SIGNS OF LIFE
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In losing their third consecutive game Tuesday night,
the Rangers probably played better than they have in some of their
17 victories. Although the Ottawa Senators took a 2-1 decision at
Madison Square Garden, the Rangers had a dozen good scoring chances
and competed well against a young, strong team that has chewed up
most of its opponents in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the night, it was a match of tactics and strategy,
and the patient Senators got the big break, midway through the
third period, when they scored the winning goal. The home customers
booed the Rangers in the final minutes, proof that a sophisticated
city is not necessarily full of sophisticated fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the passion tonight was very good,'' Rangers Coach
John Muckler said. ``I thought we worked hard. We got some very
good chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat dropped the Rangers three games below the .500 mark.
Their longest losing streak is four games, at the beginning of the
schedule. The Rangers play Florida at home Thursday night in their
final appearance before the All-Star Game break.
</P>
<P>
   Not participating for a change in the midseason classic is Brian
Leetch, the Ranger captain and attacking defenseman. Leetch has no
goals in his last 18 games. He has six for the season. But Leetch
had many effective shifts Tuesday night and put several shots
toward the net. He played like a man about to break out of a
scoring drought. Typical of his frustration was a play in the final
minute. Trying to pass the puck up ice for a final rush, Leetch
lost control when his stick snapped in half.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch said the stick may have been cracked on the face-off,
just before he got the puck. ``It just broke in my hands,'' said
Leetch, who had four shots on goal. Muckler had said minutes before
that many Rangers are ``squeezing their sticks right now,'' a
hockey expression indicating tension during a scoring slump.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch added, ``We've got to score more than that to win hockey
games.'' The Rangers (17-20-7) have two goals in their last three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky of the Rangers played despite what appeared to be
a stiff and sore neck. Between shifts, while sitting on the bench,
Gretzky took his helmet off and applied a heating pad. In the third
period, Janne Laukkanen of Ottawa poked the puck from Gretzky's
stick at the Senators' blue line and then flattened the Great One
with an unpenalized cross-check to the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spasms in my neck,'' Gretzky said. ``I'm trying to find
out from the doctor what is wrong. Nobody seems to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senators took a 2-1 lead at 9 minutes 43 seconds of the
third period on a goal by Radek Bonk, who stood in front of Mike
Richter's net and directed upward a pass from Andreas Dackell.
Turning over the puck as he tried to skate out of the zone was
Rangers defenseman Peter Popovic, who was bothered by the
unpenalized hook of Magnus Arvedson.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took a 1-0 lead on a first-period power-play goal,
their first with the manpower advantage in four games. The Senators
tied it at even strength later in the period, and the second period
was scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring for the Rangers, at 7:56, was John MacLean, his 16th
goal of the season. He put a rebound past Ottawa goalie Ron
Tugnutt, who had stopped a back-handed shot by Adam Graves. Setting
it up with a pass from behind the Ottawa net was Gretzky, who got
the other assist.
</P>
<P>
   After another Rangers power play, Ottawa countered and scored at
15:10. Bruce Gardiner got credit after his pass across the slot was
accidentally deflected by Leetch. The Rangers on the ice may have
been tired from setting up plays at the other end of the ice. A
young team of strong skaters, the Senators play a disciplined style
under the coaching of Jacques Martin. They often wait back in the
neutral-zone trap and take advantage of turnovers with
counter-rushes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators' captain and best player is Aleksei Yashin, who set
up the tying score by carrying the puck up ice and fighting off a
check before passing to Gardiner. Yashin came into the game with 20
goals and 31 assists for a team-best 51 points. In the plus/minus
ratio, he led the Senators with a plus-19.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Yashin and Pavel Bure led the Russian Olympic team
to a silver medal in Nagano, Japan. A large player at 6 feet 3
inches and 228 pounds, Yashin plays with an unusual combination of
size, grace and power, which might remind fans of a certain age of
Jean Beliveau, the Montreal Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   Yashin had five shots on goal Tuesday night, most of any player.
``We've worked hard at our skill level and our work level,'' Yashin
said of the Senators (24-14-6), who are 9-1-3 in their last 13
games. ``A lot of teams respect us very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senators, an expansion team in 1992-93, struggled in their
first few seasons. With patience and high draft choices, they have
now built a contender. Even their uniforms have improved. On
Tuesday night, they wore their alternate ``third'' jerseys, mostly
red with a diagonal black sash across the middle with a gold
centurion head on the front. Except for the classic logos and
uniforms of the Old Six teams, this is one of the best-looking
National Hockey League outfits. The team has asked the league to
wear these uniforms regularly next season.

STALEMATE IN TALKS ON SAIPAN GARMENT WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT COLLIER  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 
SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands _ On this tiny, tropical piece of
American soil in the western Pacific, local officials backed by key
Republican figures in Congress are waging an increasingly bitter
tug-of-war with the Clinton administration and human rights
activists.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Caught in the middle is a foreign workforce laboring in
conditions of sweatshop-style exploitation that are perfectly legal
in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands but banned
throughout the rest of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute worsened Tuesday when local Republican leaders told
a visiting team of Clinton administration officials that they will
not give up the islands' exemption from federal immigration,
customs and labor laws. Human rights groups and U.S. officials say
this has allowed indentured servitude, dire working conditions and
poverty wages to flourish on Saipan.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Marianas' commonwealth status also allows U.S.
apparel corporations doing business in the islands to avoid tariffs
and to claim that products manufactured there are ``Made in the
USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Since they were enacted two decades ago, the loopholes have
transformed the Northern Marianas from a forgotten backwater into a
billion-dollar player in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the visitors from Washington say the exemptions must be
withdrawn voluntarily _ or Congress will do it for the islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Although attempts to remove the loopholes have been blocked by
congressional Republicans, support for their elimination is growing
on Capitol Hill. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., and Senator Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, are each sponsoring similar legislation to
that effect.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure for reform was brought to American public attention
last week by a sweeping series of class-action lawsuits filed in
California and federal courts. Human rights groups and a labor
union accused such well-known apparel firms as San Francisco's The
Gap, Nordstrom, J. Crew, Tommy Hilfiger and Burlingame's Gymboree
of tolerating a wide variety of labor abuses by subcontractors on
Saipan. They seek $1 billion in lost wages and damages for 25,000
workers, most of whom are Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   In the charged atmosphere leading up to Tuesday's start of talks
on Saipan, both sides engaged in a bout of name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the United States suffer a continuing financial
loss of $200 million a year in tariffs _ for the dubious privilege
of explaining to the rest of the world why it tolerates the
Northern Marianas' human rights record?'' asked Allen Stayman, who
as director of the Interior Department's Office of Insular Affairs
is the top federal official for U.S. territories in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are alien workers human beings, or are they simply inputs in a
production process?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The islands' legislature fired back, unanimously approving a
resolution accusing the federal govrnment of ``embarking on a
vicious campaign to destroy the garment industry'' and
``insinuating arrogantly that the third-class U.S. citizens of the
Northern Marianas should not and cannot improve their economic
status at the expense of secured jobs for the first-class U.S.
citizens in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's negotiations are scheduled to continue until Friday,
an exercise both sides admit is mainly for Washington consumption.
Federal officials said Wednesday that talks had virtually broken
down, with each side refusing to budge.
</P>
<P>
   At issue, both sides agree, is a key component of the role the
United States plays in the global economy _ whether corporations
must obey American labor and human rights standards wherever they
do business, as the Clinton administration wants, or whether free
trade and local autonomy will prevail over all else, as Republican
leaders like House Majority Whip Tom DeLay advocate.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine a more incongruous place for such a
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-mile-long island of Saipan is lush but has a ragged feel.
Along Beach Road, which fronts the azure though polluted waters of
the Philippine Sea, large five-star hotels are crowded together
with sleek duty-free shops, honky-tonk bars, American fast-food
restaurants and the corrugated metal shells of garment factories.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Northern Marianas standoff also has elements of the
mainland civil rights battles of the 1960s _ angry federal
officials saying that morality and the law are on their side,
glaring down local officials who claim the right to do things their
way and who complain about Washington's arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Largely missing, however, is a protest movement by the workers
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northern Marianas, the estimated 40,000 foreign laborers
are seen and not heard. They form almost the entire private-sector
workforce _ including 15,000 in the booming garment industry, where
factories owned largely by Chinese and Korean businessmen produce
$2 billion worth of clothes annually for American firms.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign workers also staff the tourist industry, which draws
hundreds of thousands of Japanese each year to the islands'
beaches, barrier reefs and World War II battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike elsewhere in the United States, the foreigners are
allowed in only on one-year work permits, which can be renewed
solely at the request of an employer. Almost all workers were
forced to pay a fee ranging from $2,000 to $8,000 to labor
recruiters in their home countries to obtain the jobs, and many
borrowed heavily from hometown loan sharks to pay the fee. If a
worker is laid off for any reason, including protesting working
conditions or union organizing, he or she must find another job
within 90 days or be deported. Since the minimum wage is $3.05 per
hour, anyone fired from a job is likely to be shipped home without
enough money to pay off their debts _ a dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
   The net result, labor advocates say, is that employers have
near-total power over their workers, who live in fear of being sent
home summarily.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's lawsuits hit like a bomb in the islands, prompting a
near-unanimous outcry from local politicians and residents, who
form a privileged economic class far above the imported workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Marianas have only 27,000 U.S. citizens, most of
whom belong to the Chamorro indigenous group and work for the
patronage-ridden local government. Average incomes are more than
four times higher than the wages earned by the average foreign
worker.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 percent of local households have full-time domestic
servants _ a rate that puts the islands on a par with the
wealthiest communities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Saipan Tribune, a daily newspaper owned by Willy Tan, a Hong
Kong tycoon who owns Tan Holdings Corp., the Northern Marianas'
largest garment manufacturing firm, thundered that the lawsuit was
``a dastardly trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Pixley, spokesman for Tan Holdings, called the move ``a
political maneuver by the Clinton administration, Democrats and
labor unions to destroy the Northern Marianas.''
</P>
<P>
   At Saipan's public beach parks, where Chamorros traditionally
gather on weekends to picnic on barbecued pig, sentiment was the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a good thing here,'' said Manny Camacho, a
30-something local resident as he cradled a beer can. ``If someone
wants to come work for me for pennies, why shouldn't they be able
to? I mean, why stop them?''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation pushed by Miller and Murkowski faces tough
opposition on Capitol Hill. A similar bill was blocked in committee
last year by DeLay, R-Texas, who fiercely defended the Northern
Marianas' exemptions, claiming that the islands' garment industry
is a sign of ``free-market success.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberals in Washington and the Clinton bureaucrats are
intentionally trying to kill economic freedom and return the
Northern Marianas to the days of welfare dependency,'' DeLay said
during a visit to Saipan.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the U.S. mainland adopt a Mexican guest-worker
program like the Northern Marianas' with ``whatever wage the market
will bear.''

HEWITT, TEEN-AGE WILD CARD, UPSETS PIOLINE
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennis is on the rise in Australia, as the record crowds
coursing through the turnstiles confirm. And the way Lleyton
Hewitt, a 17-year-old wild card, played Tuesday night in upsetting
13th-seeded Cedric Pioline, 6-3, 6-1, 6-1, in the first round of
the Australian Open, will do nothing but increase the enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   With his baggy clothes, slight frame and clearing complexion,
Hewitt looks more like a young man who belongs on a skateboard than
on Center Court at a Grand Slam event. But anyone who watched his
perfectly disguised lobs and bold passing shots and returns against
Pioline could see that the teen-ager was in his element and
flirting with that state of grace tennis players call ``the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt defeated Patrick Rafter, a countryman, last week in
Sydney, and last year he became the youngest player in 10 years to
win an ATP event, defeating Andre Agassi along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Though he struggled for much of last season, he reached the
final again in Adelaide two weeks ago and the quarterfinals in
Sydney. Now, in Melbourne, he has his first victory in a Grand Slam
event, and it came against a player who has already reached two
Grand Slam finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously a guy who feeds off the home crowd,'' Pioline
said. ``I think he did just about everything he wanted to do out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other seeded men's players were also beaten Tuesday. The
first to fall was No. 12 Albert Costa, beaten by Martin Damm of the
Czech Republic in five sets. The second to fall made more noise in
Melbourne: It was No. 4 Carlos Moya, who was beaten by Nicolas
Kiefer of Germany in four sets.
</P>
<P>
   Moya was still recovering from a virus he caught in the first
week of January in Perth that kept him in bed for several days. He
made numerous errors, failed to capitalize on Kiefer's short shots
and generally bore little resemblance to the player who won last
year's French Open and reached the semifinals of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, seeded fifth, sent a message to the field, overwhelming
the potentially dangerous Hernan Gumy of Argentina, 6-0, 6-3, 6-0.
No. 2 Martina Hingis, No. 5 Monica Seles and No. 10 Steffi Graf
advanced with ease in the women's event.
</P>
<P>
   No. 12 Anna Kournikova also won, but it was anything but easy.
She served 17 double faults in the opening set of her match with an
American, Jill Craybas, and finished with 23 double faults, losing
her serve eight times in 13 attempts. The remarkable thing was that
she still won, 7-6 (7-1), 7-5.

CLAM BOAT AND CREW OF 4 DISAPPEAR OFF NEW JERSEY
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. _ For the second time in less than
two weeks, a commercial clamming boat has vanished in the surging
Atlantic Ocean off New Jersey, this time leaving only a large oil
slick, a few pieces of debris and no sign of her four crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The 74-foot vessel, the Adriatic, apparently went down on Monday
afternoon amid high winds and heavy seas shortly after the crew was
able to send a garbled Mayday call that gave no indication of her
location. And after nearly 24 hours of searching, the Coast Guard
on Tuesday evening reported finding only a life ring, an empty
survival suit, some buckets, pots, cups and a first-aid kit.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon Tuesday, the Coast Guard sent divers into 60
feet of water about eight miles southeast of Barnegat Light, but
the divers found no sunken debris, said Lt. John Brenner, a
spokesman at the Coast Guard's station in Atlantic City. He said
two cutters and a helicopter would continue searching overnight
from the shoreline to 14 miles out into the Atlantic. But he held
out little hope of finding the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The sinking of the Adriatic was yet another sobering blow to the
men along the commercial fishing docks on Channel Drive in this
small town that is at once a fishing village and oceanfront
playground. In the last two weeks, two other commercial clammers
have been lost in the Atlantic, and another was wrecked on a jetty.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 6, the Beth Dee Bob sank off the coast of Manasquan,
with the loss of her four crew members. On Jan. 8, the Cape Fear,
which left Point Pleasant Beach several months ago to clam off New
England, sank off New Bedford, Mass. Two crew members were lost.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday, a day before the Adriatic vanished, the Ellie B,
a 65-foot Rhode Island boat using Point Pleasant Beach's wharves
temporarily, struck one of the rock jetties at the mouth of the
Manasquan Inlet, just north of here, and broke up. Her three crew
members jumped overboard and were saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating to think they're just gone, just gone,'' said
Jim Parascandolo, who regularly fished the Atlantic for whiting and
squid until he started raising his family 19 years ago. ``Everyone
has a shiver today.''
</P>

<P>
   The Adriatic apparently vanished about 3 p.m. on Monday after
sending an unintelligible distress call, the Coast Guard said. The
only words that Coast Guard radio operators could make out were
``Mayday, Mayday,'' Brenner said. Operators could not understand
the ship's name in the distress call, he said, and since no
location was given, no search could be started.
</P>
<P>
   Radio operators, he said, called for a repeat of the distress
call and asked ships off New Jersey if they had heard it. Neither
request brought any new information.
</P>
<P>
   At about 8 p.m., he said, the Coast Guard got a call from
officials at Barney's Dock in Atlantic City saying that the
Adriatic had been scheduled to dock there at 7 p.m. and was an hour
late.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard started to search immediately and found the
slick and the bits of debris two hours later, Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   At about the time the Adriatic called in the Mayday, the
Atlantic was stormy. The National Weather Service said Tuesday that
its forecast for the Atlantic for midafternoon Monday was for
southerly winds of 25 to 30 knots, with seas of 5 to 7 feet. At
about 5 p.m., two hours after the distress call, the Weather
Service said it issued a special marine warning, advising ships of
winds above 34 knots and increasing waves.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Cohen, owner of Point Pleasant Packing, a wholesale
company here that used to buy the Adriatic's clams, said
speculating about the Adriatic's problems was futile. Commercial
fishing, he said, is one of the nation's riskiest occupations. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``The fact we've had four accidents in 13 days doesn't mean
it's getting riskier,'' Cohen said. ``The risk doesn't get more or
less.''

A CHANGE OF HANDS FOR A CATSKILLS MECCA
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ In legal terms, the auction in Courtroom
520 at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court here was titled ``97-20487 Fre-Par
Laboratories Inc., A New York Corporation, Chapter 11 Hearing of
Sale.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the standing-room-only crowd of more than 100 who jammed
Judge Adlai Hardin's chambers, this was no ordinary court
proceeding. It was the end of an era for a beloved but beleaguered
cultural icon: the Concord Resort Hotel in the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   After closing its doors for good in November following 61 years
of stewardship by the same family, the financially troubled hotel
was auctioned off Tuesday for $10.25 million to Concord Associates
LP, a New York development group headed by Joseph Murphy, a hotel
developer. Concord Associates beat out two other bidders in a
lengthy, meandering court proceeding that sandwiched more than five
hours of legal parrying around an auction that, in the end, took
only 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Concord Associates, which put down a $2 million deposit to enter
the auction, now has 10 days to close the deal. If it is
successful, the group will get the green light on its plans to turn
the hotel into a destination _ not for the crowds of Jewish
families who were long the main patrons of the hotel, but for
business travelers, conventioneers and outdoor enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hotel needs a completely new image,'' said Louis
Tallarini, executive vice president of Value Investors Inc.,
Murphy's real-estate company in Manhattan. ``We intend to fully
renovate the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallarini said that the group plans to work with the Sheraton
Hotel chain to renovate the hotel at a cost of $40 million to $50
million. He said the new hotel, which would be called the Sheraton
Concord Resort Hotel and Convention Center, would be marketed as a
top-notch resort on 1,710 acres (twice the size of Central Park)
with 2{ golf courses, 40 indoor and outdoor tennis courts and
boundless other recreational activities.
</P>
<P>
   The new hotel would employ about 1,500 people _ many of whom,
Tallarini said, would presumably be drawn from a pool of former
Concord employees who have been barely scraping by since the hotel
shut down on Nov. 3. More than 400 people lost their jobs, and
about 60 employees who had been living in the hotel suddenly became
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the hotel might be open by next January _ a
pleasant prospect for Sullivan County officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The county is very pleased,'' said Rusty Pomeroy, chairman of
the county's Legislature. ``We wanted to get a developer who's
going to keep the property on the tax rolls and invest and create a
new resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Many decades ago, the Concord, in the community of Kiamesha
Lake, about 90 miles northwest of New York City, was the newest and
swankiest place in the Catskills for weddings, bar mitzvahs and
family reunions. It was part of the Borscht Belt, a group of
resorts that catered to a mostly Jewish clientele, and for many
years, it occupied a place in many hearts as a family vacation
home.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1960s and 1970s, people were looking elsewhere _
Florida, Atlantic City, even Europe _ for entertainment and
leisure, especially with the availability of jet travel. Through it
all, some people said, the Concord and many other Catskills resorts
did not adjust accordingly. And one by one, the famous resorts
closed.
</P>
<P>
   The Concord held out until November, when, saddled by more than
$20 million in debt, it was forced to close.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom Tuesday were several people who had nothing to
do with the legal proceedings. They were, it turns out, long-time
customers of the Concord who wanted to know what would become of
their dear, frail friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched the Concord grow from her infancy, and I'm a very
sentimental person,'' said Gloria Chait, 69, who drove up from
Flushing, Queens, with her husband to witness the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the finality I was looking for,'' she said. ``I was
looking for the future.''

SLAYING OF WITNESS WAS COINCIDENCE, PROSECUTOR SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ Calling the occurrence ``purely
coincidental,'' the Union County prosecutor said Tuesday that a man
who was shot to death over the weekend, just two days before the
opening of a murder trial in which he was to testify as an
eyewitness, had not been killed to prevent his testimony but had
instead fallen victim to his own involvement with drugs and guns.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the prosecutor, Thomas V. Manahan, came just
moments after an assistant prosecutor asked a judge in Union County
Superior Court to postpone the case, saying the ``execution'' of a
key state witness had left other witnesses terrified. He pleaded
with the judge to give investigators two weeks to solve the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Edwin R. Alley, denied the request for an
adjournment, siding instead with lawyers for the three defendants
in the case who argued for their clients' right to a speedy trial.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, investigators did not need two weeks. Minutes
after the judge's ruling, at a news conference across the street in
which Manahan was expected to comment on the ruling, he announced
that the death of the witness was not related to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying that it was purely coincidental,'' Manahan said.
``An unfortunate tragedy that sometimes occurs when people who are
involved in the illicit drug trade and guns get caught up with
matters that sometimes result in the termination of their life.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Manahan said that the witness, Dylan George, had a criminal
record involving drug and weapons charges, but he would not discuss
the evidence that led investigators to conclude that the shooting
and the trial were unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   George, 29, was found fatally shot on Sunday in a parked car in
Plainfield, officials said. An acquaintance of George, Michelle
Milligan, 14, who had been sitting in the passenger seat of the
car, was also shot. She remained unconscious and in critical
condition Monday at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New
Brunswick and has been unable to speak to investigators. Officials
expressed the belief that George, not Ms. Milligan, was the target
of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   George had been scheduled to testify against Tanny Miller and
Bobby Clayton, who are charged with murder in connection with the
fatal shooting of a Plainfield man in 1996 during a robbery. A
third defendant, Leroy Golden, faces armed robbery and weapons
charges in the same case. All three men have been in prison
awaiting trial.

KINGS FADING FAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ It was only a few days ago that the Kings seemed in
prime position to make a strong run for a playoff berth in the
second half of the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   But as they awaken today, with one game remaining before the
All-Star break and 38 to go in the season, the Kings' hopes once
again are fading.
</P>
<P>
   The latest setback was a 5-4 loss to the Colorado Avalanche on
Tuesday night before an announced crowd of 9,692 at the Forum, a
defeat in which Kings goalie Stephane Fiset struggled against his
former teammates. A Donald Audette goal with 12 seconds to play
made the final score deceptively close.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Kings (16-24-4) to 1-3-1 in their last five
games and left them five points behind San Jose and St. Louis in
the race for the final two Western Conference playoff berths. Joe
Sakic scored twice for Colorado (21-19-4), which had been 1-5-1 in
its last seven visits to the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The only good news for the Kings was that Eric Lacroix recorded
his first point this season and Russ Courtnall had a goal and an
assist in his first game in two months after recovering from a
broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix, playing against Colorado for the first time since he
was traded to the Kings early in the season, assisted on a Garry
Galley goal 5:58 into the game that gave the Kings a 1-0 lead. It
was the first point for Lacroix in 30 games this season and his
first in 41 games dating to last season. Lacroix hasn't scored a
goal in 42 games dating to last season.
</P>
<P>
   The lead lasted less than seven minutes, erased by Sakic's first
goal, a rising shot from the right circle that went between the
legs of defenseman Doug Bodger and over Fiset's glove at 12:16.
</P>
<P>
   Ten seconds later, Shean Donovan redirected a shot from the left
point by Chris Drury past Fiset, giving the Avalanche the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second period, Courtnall partially fanned on a shot
from the slot. The shot fooled Colorado goalie Patrick Roy, the
puck skittering over his right shoulder and into the net at 3:16,
tying the score, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   But 4:30 later, Sakic blasted an unscreened slap shot from the
left circle between Fiset's pads, and Stephane Yelle scored in
similar fashion three minutes after that when the Kings got caught
deep in the offensive zone and allowed a 3-on-1 rush.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes into the third period, the Kings had a chance to
cut the deficit to 4-3, but Roy stopped Courtnall on a breakaway,
and about a minute after that, Valeri Kamensky scored on a
breakaway of his own, making it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille scored his 25th goal this season and the 503rd of
his career with 13 minutes to play, bringing the Kings to within
5-3. Audette scored on a power play and with Fiset off for an extra
skater with 12.8 seconds left, accounting for the Kings' final
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, the ominous upcoming schedule doesn't hold
a great deal of promise as far as getting back in the playoff race
is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for the Kings are the New Jersey Devils, who are nine
games above .500 and visit the Forum on Thursday. Then, after
Sunday's All-Star Game in Tampa, the Kings hit the road for games
against Dallas, Washington, Buffalo and Philadelphia, four teams
that are a collective 36 games above .500.
</P>
<P>
   After those games, the Kings will have just 33 to play, and will
have to consider themselves fortunate if they aren't any further
behind in the standings than they are today.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to find some scoring, too.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Kings are mired in notable goal-scoring droughts.
Among the forwards, Pavel Rosa has one in 14, Yanic Perreault has
none in six and four in 37, Jozef Stumpel has one in seven, Olli
Jokinen has none in eight and one in 21, and Vladimir Tsyplakov has
none in 10.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Kings' defensemen, they've scored a combined 10 goals
this season _ one fewer than St. Louis' Al MacInnis and Vancouver's
Adrian Aucoin have all by themselves.

N.Y. MAYOR DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM LOBBYIST MARRIED TO HIS AIDE

   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said Tuesday that his
administration would stop doing business with a lobbyist who is
married to one of his top aides, though he said the lobbyist had
not persuaded the city to grant special parking privileges to a
major Wall Street firm.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after the Daily News reported on Tuesday
that the city had granted the privileges to Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
after the firm hired Suri Kasirer as a lobbyist. Kasirer is married
to Bruce Teitelbaum, who spent more than two years as the mayor's
chief of staff and now runs Solutions America, a political action
committee formed by the mayor last spring to raise money for
travel, political seminars and potential campaigns for higher
office.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Tuesday that he alone had negotiated the parking
arrangement, which allows limousines picking up employees of
Goldman, Sachs to idle in zones where parking is otherwise
prohibited. The mayor said that Jon Corzine, the former chief
executive of Goldman, Sachs, had proposed the arrangement during a
breakfast meeting they had last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need a lobbyist to deal with this administration,''
Giuliani said. ``Goldman, Sachs alone, I think, pays 20 to 25
percent of the remaining unincorporated business tax in this city.
So we want to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasirer refused to comment on Tuesday.

CONNECTICUT OFFICER IS CHARGED WITH MURDER
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A police officer in New Milford, Conn., turned himself in to
State Police on Tuesday after being charged with murder in the
shooting death of an unarmed suspect last month.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Scott B. Smith, 27, is charged with killing
Franklyn Reid, also 27 and from New Milford, about 11 a.m. on Dec.
29.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators with the state Attorney's Office in
Waterbury, Smith used excessive force and shot Reid in the back,
just below the neck, while he was on his knees after a foot chase.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators' report, which was released on Monday, said
that Reid suffered a contact wound, indicating that the gun was
pressed against his back, ``or close to it,'' State Attorney John
A. Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, a felon with a record that included convictions for
assault and sexual assault, was wanted on charges including
violating probation, six counts of telephone harassment and three
charges of failure to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and his partner, David Shortt, were backing up another
officer who had been pursuing Reid when they spotted the suspect at
a New Milford gas station. Reid ran away and Smith chased him on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told investigators that after he caught Reid and forced
him to his knees, he did not see the suspect's hands, and that Reid
made a quick move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed at the time he was either going to shoot me or stab
me,'' he said. ``Out of fear for my life at that instant, I
discharged my weapon one time, striking Mr. Reid.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has been on the police force in New Milford for about
two years, was released on $250,000 bond after being arraigned in
Superior Court in Bantam, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly said he believed that Smith was the first Connecticut
police officer charged with murder for a killing that occurred
while on duty. If convicted, he would receive a mandatory sentence
of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's lawyer, Thomas J. Allingham, said his client would hold
a news conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is also the target of a civil rights wrongful death
lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport by
Reid's family. The lawyer for the family, Richard Bieder, did not
return a telephone call Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting has raised questions of racial bias, since Reid was
black and Smith is white. New Milford has a population of about
27,000, and less than 1 percent, about 200 people, are black.
Neither Mayor Art Pietler nor James D. Sweeney, chief of the
42-member Police Department, returned calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Allingham said, ``Race didn't have anything to do with this
event.''

PROSECUTORS SEEK TO PUT GOTTI ON TRIAL TWICE
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Almost a year to the day that John A. Gotti
was indicted on racketeering charges and accused of being the
acting head of the Gambino crime family, federal prosecutors asked
a judge on Tuesday to allow them to try Gotti twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want as much blood as they can get,'' said Gotti, 34,
shaking his head as he left a hearing at the U.S. Court for the
Southern District here on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have asked Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. to allow
them to try Gotti along with two other men, Salvatore Locascio and
Vincent Zollo. All three are accused of extortion, loan sharking
and fraud. That case is expected to last about two months.
</P>
<P>
   Then the government would like to put Gotti, the son of John J.
Gotti, the imprisoned Gambino crime family boss, on trial again _
this time along with three other defendants on more limited charges
of selling phony prepaid telephone calling cards. That case could
also last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Gotti links the various crimes together, this
commonality _ now limited to one defendant _ does not negate the
fact that the other five defendants will ultimately sit through
substantial portions of the trial unnecessarily,'' Carol L.
Sipperly, the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the case, wrote
in a letter to the judge last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's lawyers objected to the strategy, noting that the case
was now far simpler than it was when it started last Jan. 21, when
23 people were indicted en masse and lawyers and defendants had to
be spread out over several courtrooms just to find enough seats.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most other defendants have pleaded guilty and there are
only six men left, with far less evidence required. And so, said
Sarita Kedia, one of the defense lawyers, they can easily be
prosecuted together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gotti shouldn't have to endure two trials,'' Ms. Kedia
said. ``We want one trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The government should either try the six men together, Ms. Kedia
said, or allow the evidence regarding Gotti's alleged involvement
in the calling card scam to be presented during his racketeering
trial. The three other defendants in the telephone card case,
including Denny McLain, a former pitcher for the Detroit Tigers,
could be tried separately, she said. Parker said he would rule on
the issue next week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prosecutors were unsuccessful in two attempts Tuesday to
restrict Gotti's actions. They sought to have Gotti's bail revoked
because of an incident in November when he strayed farther on his
property than is allowed _ later saying he was playing soccer _ and
was out of range of electronic monitoring for 20 minutes. The judge
refused the request.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also unsuccessfully objected Tuesday to allowing
Gotti to meet with any of his former co-defendants, saying he had
too much influence over them. Ms. Sipperly said that on Jan. 12,
just before Gregory DePalma, 66, and his son Craig, 32, pleaded
guilty to racketeering charges, they met with Gotti and his lawyer
for a jail house interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gotti was directing the DePalmas' plea,'' Ms. Sipperly
said. ``He had a 15-minute visit on Jan. 12 with the DePalmas to
tell them not to implicate him. It was exactly what Mr. Gotti was
taking care of that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kedia called the government's scenario ridiculous. She said
that Gotti did not know the DePalmas were preparing to plead guilty
that day.

REFERRALS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION FALL IN NYC
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time since 1990, New York City schools
have cut down on the number of children they are referring for
evaluations to determine whether they should be placed in special
education, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew
announced Tuesday. They attributed the decline to improvements in
educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing one of the thorniest problems the schools face _ one
with racial as well as educational dimensions _ the mayor and the
chancellor said that referrals since September were down 25
percent, or about 3,800 children, from the same period a year ago.
At a joint news conference at City Hall, they said the decline
resulted from new procedures to identify students with learning
problems and give them the help they need outside the context of
special education.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said that Crew, supported by the mayor, was simply
trying to crack down on referrals to special education. The city
has been under pressure from the Office of Civil Rights in the
federal Education Department to stem what federal officials say are
disproportionate referrals of black and Hispanic students into
special education; in June, a mayoral task force called for
policies leading to fewer referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Special education classes are supposed to help children with
learning or behavior problems, but usually end up as pathways to
academic failure, with few children ever returning to regular
classes or receiving a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of
Teachers, said Tuesday that some school districts had responded to
the mayor's task force by trying to impose an outright ban on
referrals, regardless of whether children were receiving the help
they needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly has been a re-evaluation of how to do
referrals,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ``And that's clearly come down
from both the mayor as well as the chancellor, to the point where
we've had to stop the abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weingarten did not cite specific districts, but she said
that when the union complained that children might not be getting
the services they needed, Crew had ordered districts to evaluate
any children who needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Crew said he had not set any quotas for reducing the
number of referrals. ``This is not about setting a target
numerically,'' he said. Rather, he said, teachers had found other
programs to help children with learning problems. In particular, he
cited Project Read, a $150 million program started last year to
provide remedial reading instruction to about 104,000 children
during and after school.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid
Society, said he feared that the reduction in referrals would not
be accompanied by an increase in the number of teachers, aides and
guidance counselors whom children with learning and behavioral
problems need.

GIULIANI SAYS HIS TRASH REMARKS GOT TWISTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-TRASH-TALKS) 
(bl) 
By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Making it clear that he was tired of talking trash,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani tried Tuesday to contain the furor over his
comments last week that a ``reciprocal relationship'' exists
between the cultural mecca that is New York City and out-of-state
communities whose residents generate garbage in their pursuit of
enlightenment here.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor used the word ``spin'' and its grammatical cousins
nine times in arguing that the news media had misrepresented his
discussion of a private company's contract to ship the city's
garbage to Virginia. The news reports prompted Virginia Gov. James
Gilmore to dash off a letter to Giuliani last week in which he took
umbrage at any suggestion that New York City's cultural
achievements ``obligate Virginia and other states to take your
garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written reply, which was sent Tuesday and released publicly
by City Hall, Giuliani said: ``There is no reason for you to be
offended. No one is obligated to accept New York City's garbage. It
is a relationship of mutual benefit entered into freely and
voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a news conference Tuesday, the mayor was less restrained
in defending his earlier comments. ``I didn't say that they were
obligated to take the garbage,'' he said. ``Somebody put that spin
on it, so now they're spinning based on the spin, and then
everything is spun around.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose after Waste Management Inc., a national disposal
company that transfers 2,400 tons of city garbage a day to Virginia
and other destinations, signed a contract with a barge company to
ship up to 4,000 tons a day to a new port in Charles City, Va.
Giuliani has contended that federal laws protecting interstate
commerce allow such contracts, which are often with poorer
communities that need revenue. City officials also say that the
arrangement creates thousands of jobs and is environmentally sound.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that while presenting this argument last week, the
mayor never said that other states were ``obligated'' to take the
city's trash. But the context of his comments suggested that the
city was owed some consideration because of its stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Virginia like to utilize New York because we're a
cultural center, a business center,'' he said at the time. ``What
goes along with being a cultural and business center is you're very
crowded. We don't have the room here to handle the garbage that's
produced not just by New Yorkers but by the three million more
people that come here that utilize the place every day. So this is
a reciprocal relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had also said that the city contributes billions of
dollars more to the federal government than it receives, so ``one
of the things we need from the rest of the country is to assist
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the mayor said that he felt no need to apologize ``for
an unfair spin, or an erroneous spin, that somebody else puts on
the comments that I actually make.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Mark Miner, the press secretary for Gilmore, said
that the mayor's letter suggested he was backpedaling. ``The
wording that he's using today as opposed to last week is much
different,'' Miner said. ``I think he realized what he said last
week was inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on issues beyond this thing called ``spin,'' Giuliani
said the garbage debate was purely a matter of business. ``If you
want the money that goes with it, you take the garbage,'' he said.
``If you don't want the money that goes with it, we can move on and
find lots of other opportunities and places.''

 HOW CLINTON TURNED THE BIZARRE DAY TO HIS ADVANTAGE  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Whatever the euphemism used to describe President
Clinton _ the split-screen president, the great compartmentalizer,
the political Houdini _ it fell short Tuesday as he pulled off a
feat that will go down in Washington legend.
<P>
   In the afternoon on one of the most bizarre days ever witnessed
in the Capitol, the U.S. Senate sat at Clinton's impeachment trial
for felony perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, the Senate joined the House, which passed the
articles of impeachment exactly one month ago, to hear him deliver
his State of the Union message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awkward timing, yes, but that's OK,'' said Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., as she left the impeachment trial and headed back
to her office before the speech. She said she fully expects the
speech to boost Clinton's public approval rating, adding,
``although I don't know how much more popular he can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Clinton speak, one would never know that anything
else was going on in Washington besides health-care tax credits or
teacher standards or changes to Social Security. It was an eerie
demonstration of Clinton's fierce determination against wounds _
however self-inflicted _ that would have leveled other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But the impeachment cloud was clear enough inside the House
Chamber, where Clinton's unspoken predicament hung nearly palpable
in the air. Democrats gave a rousing cheer at first lady Hillary
Clinton's entrance, as if lending every ounce of moral support they
had. They embraced him, and pumped his hand and clapped his back as
he walked toward the podium.
</P>
<P>
   And throughout his address, Democrats rose every few seconds in
extended boisterous ovations for Clinton throughout his long
address, while Republicans mostly sat, sometimes applauding
politely, but generally looking deeply cynical.
</P>
<P>
   Some seemed to be gritting their teeth, others sometimes
chuckled, as Clinton claimed credit for welfare reform and budget
surpluses that they pushed through against veto threats.
</P>
<P>
   Newport Beach Republican Chris Cox, a member of the GOP House
leadership, acknowledged the cynical smiles. ``It was because the
president was announcing for the first time support for programs he
had opposed prior to this evening,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan to remove the Social Security earnings limit for
seniors who work ``was none other than (House Speaker) Denny
Hastert's bill, which the White House has opposed,'' Cox said,
``and the president didn't credit anyone for years of work on that,
even though they were all seated in the chamber. I've sponsored it
since 1989. And he called on Congress to pass it when his
opposition has stopped it all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who helped escort Clinton into the chamber, said Clinton
``was noticeably awkward and uncomfortable beforehand, compared
even to last year, when his State of the Union followed by six days
the first announcements of his affair with a White House intern.''
</P>
<P>
   The usually sociable Clinton ``had trouble making small talk,''
Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton seemed fully at ease once he reached the embraces
and smiles of Democrats, who greeted him with rousing enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Democrat Maxine Waters, one of Clinton's fiercest
defenders on the House Judiciary Committee, was riveted to his
every word, calling out ``Yes, Yes'' with ebullient applause when
Clinton mentioned rebuilding schools or drug coverage in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a president delivered a State of the Union
speech while under trial for impeachment. Of course, only one other
president has been impeached, and that was 130 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Postponing the speech, as some had once suggested, was never
even contemplated at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally his call,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif.,
who had dropped in to watch part of the impeachment trial in the
morning, even as he praised Clinton's education initiatives and
private accounts for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we wanted him to know he's welcome, and we are going
to welcome him as the president of the United States,'' Dreier said
just before the speech. ``It's very apparent to me that he
obviously wanted to do it, so we're going to recognize the
importance and reverence of the institution, and we will treat him
appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox put it more bluntly. ``We were all there out of respect for
the office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yuba City Republican Wally Herger said Clinton offered some
``very positive goals'' but said early cost estimates of Clinton's
proposals had tallied $57 billion, ``just when we're beginning to
balance the budget and pay down the $5.5 trillion national debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Herger said he was initially skeptical about Clinton's
appearance, but agreed with Speaker Hastert's decision to extend
the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans hardly felt warm. ``Just looking at the
applause,'' Herger said, ``the fact that it was respectful and not
much more than that speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives were irked, although they held their tongues
in public. ``It's even worse than it was last year,'' said a Senate
GOP leadership aide. Referring to GOP Senators, he said, ``Any of
their peers they know, Democrat or Republican, would not be so
graceless or tactless as to show up at this time. But the lowest
level of behavior is what they've come to expect from Bill
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, by contrast, were thrilled that Clinton was
plowing forward. ``This whole impeachment trial is bogus,'' said
Oakland Democrat Barbara Lee. ``It should have never been voted out
of our House. The president is doing the absolute right thing to
present his State of the Union because the people of this country
deserve a president and a congress who are doing the business of
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always relished his State of the Union address, an
opportunity to outline his policy agenda in a setting of high
presidential pomp and political leadership, walking down the aisle
pumping the hands of the nation's lawmakers, before a crowd
including his cabinet, the justices of the Supreme Court and the
military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, all carried live on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton again listed a raft of his favorite policy proposals,
describing dozens of of programs with energy and enthusiasm, as if
in a final campaign, but this time, it was a campaign to
resuscitate his presidency and his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   It was no easy task. House Republicans and a handful of
Democrats had a month ago voted to impeach him. The House
prosecutors who had just spent three days before the Senate
denouncing him for felony crimes and urging his removal from
office, sat sternly facing him.
</P>
<P>
   Senators, Democrat and Republican, had days before taken an oath
to ``do impartial justice'' and were hours before sitting at his
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Walnut Creek Democrat Ellen Tauscher said she was ``just happy
to see that this evening, at least for as long as the president was
speaking, is to some extent about the working families of Alameda
and Contra Costa counties ... that we're talking about things
tonight that are finally about the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   How many of Clinton's proposals will pass is another question.
Rep. Randy Cunningham, R-Calif., characterizing the icy reception
of the Republicans, said Clinton ``always gives a good speech but
he ran out of money after the first 10 minutes.''

SAIPAN AND THE NORTHERN MARIANAS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT COLLIER  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Saipan, the largest of the Northern Marianas, is home to the
Chamorro indigenous people, who remain a privileged class today.
The island was claimed for Spain by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 but
was virtually depopulated during 350 years of Spanish rule. It was
governed by Germany from 1899 to 1914, then conquered by Japan in
World War I. During the subsequent years, the Japanese heavily
developed fishing and sugarcane industries.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1944, nearly 40,000 Japanese troops and several thousand
Japanese civilians died defending Saipan and neighboring Tinian
against invading U.S. Marines. In the final days, the Japanese
troops ran out of ammunition yet nearly overran U.S. lines with
suicidal bayonet charges. Thousands more jumped off cliffs to their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 U.S. soldiers were killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, the Tinian airstrip was the world's busiest airport,
serving as the launching pad for the intensive American bombing of
Japanese cities. The planes that dropped the atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki took off from Tinian.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the Northern Marianas were administered by the
United States under U.N. authority as a trust territory. The
islands slumped into somnolence and obscurity, and fishing and
farming were abandoned. From 1953 to 1962, Saipan was closed to the
U.S. public and was used by the CIA as a training center for
Chinese anti-Communist guerrillas. In 1978, the islands became a
self-governing U.S. commonwealth, and in 1986, residents were
granted U.S. citizenship, although they cannot vote in federal
elections. Tourism and clothes manufacturing started in the
mid-1980s, and grew rapidly with heavy Asian investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Marianas' economy is rigidly balkanized, and local
attitudes rely on stereotypes that would be considered shockingly
racist on the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign workers make up 91 percent of the private workforce, in
which occupation is largely determined by national origin. Most
hotel workers are Filipino, while most garment workers are Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese are given garment production work because they are
viewed as hard-working, obedient and unlikely to protest. (In
China, unions are part of the oppressive government structure, and
independent, American-style unions are unheard of.)
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say the Northern Marianas system promotes a
parasitic relationship in which the indigenous islanders live off
the fruit of sweatshop labor by an indentured foreign workforce
while ceding overall control to Asian tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   Another unsavory aspect of Saipan is the growth of prostitution.
Internet ads tout the island as a sex destination, and it ranks
with Bangkok and Manila as a regional sex-industry haven. Federal
law-enforcement officials say Japanese and Chinese organized-crime
syndicates have taken control of Saipan's sex trade and are now
using it as a beachhead to expand into drug trafficking and other
businesses.

CLINTON SEES A `NEW DAWN' 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
Washington _ President Clinton, appearing undaunted by his own
impeachment, introduced a sweeping agenda for his remaining time in
office last night, proposing scores of new policies including huge
infusions of cash to bolster Social Security and Medicare.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Addressing the nation from the very chamber where two articles
of impeachment were passed against him last month, an upbeat
Clinton spoke forcibly for nearly 11/2 hours, without a single
reference to the scandal that has plagued his administration for
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps in the daily press of events, in the clash of
controversy, we do not see our own time for what it truly is _ a
new dawn for America,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The nationally televised speech provided Clinton a chance to
present a remarkable smorgasbord of policy initiatives, from
testing teachers and fixing Y2K computer problems to protecting
against international terrorism and ending job discrimination
against gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   It also capped an extraordinary day that began with the
president's legal team defending him against charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice, providing the nation an odd juxtaposition
of their chief executive's strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand before you to report that the state of our union is
strong,'' said Clinton, who by one count was interrupted by
applause 95 times.
</P>
<P>
   Returning repeatedly to the populist programs that have been a
hallmark of his presidency, Clinton announced a new initiative
against the tobacco industry. He said the Justice Department will
take the industry to court over reimbursement for health care
costs. White House aides said the president's upcoming budget will
include a new 55-cents-a-pack tax on cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As everyone knows, our children are targets of a massive media
campaign to hook them on cigarettes,'' Clinton said. ``I ask this
Congress to resist the tobacco lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   The president insisted repeatedly that the nation's good
fortunes, and its newly found budget surplus, should be preserved
to prepare for economic challenges as the ``Baby Boom'' becomes the
``senior boom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our
confidence rising, now is the time for this generation to meet our
historic responsibility to the 21st century,'' Clinton said.
``Let's get to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton strode into the House chamber accompanied by Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate Pro Tem Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., just eight hours after the president's attorneys
opened their defense in the Senate trial over his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the chamber, there were only occasional signs of
awkwardness. All but a handful of lawmakers attended the speech.
Even the House ``managers'' who are bringing the case against him
stood to applaud at numerous intervals, such as when Clinton paid
tribute to Chicago Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa, who was seated in
the gallery between first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore's wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were more subdued than usual, and according to one
report, photographers overheard Lott as he left the chamber asking
a companion whether Clinton had ``no shame.''
</P>
<P>
   In the official GOP response, RepS. Jennifer Dunn of Washington
state and Steve Largent of Oklahoma outlined their disagreement
with the president over his failure to call for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Largent concluded by saying that ``reconciliation requires the
humility and courage to say, `I'm sorry. I was wrong. Will you
forgive me?,''' apparently in reference to Clinton's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The president set a bipartisan tone at the top of his speech
when he turned to greet the newly elected speaker of the House,
Dennis Hastert of Illinois, and declared:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Speaker, at your swearing in, you asked us all to work
together in a spirit of civility and bipartisanship. Mr. Speaker,
let's do exactly that.''
</P>
<P>
   However beyond the flowing rhetoric, the policy initiatives
outlined in the speech immediately set up a major confrontation
between Clinton and House Republicans, who have called for an
across-the-board 10 percent tax decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the budget surplus to be spent on three broad
areas: Social Security, Medicare and a new program to allow
individuals to supplement their Social Security savings with a
government program similar to a 401(k) account.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed that 62 percent of what the White House
estimates will be a $4 trillion budget surplus over the next 15
years be set aside for Social Security to ensure that the system
remains solvent through the year 2055.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we must aim higher,'' the president said, calling on
Republicans to join him in the politically difficult decisions that
must be made to keep the retirement system solvent for the
remainder of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic departure from past practice, Clinton proposed
that up to a quarter of new Social Security money be invested in
private markets, in the hopes that it will earn higher returns.
Many economists, including Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan, have warned that public investments in private companies
runs the risk of politicizing the market.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also proposed a new program for Universal Savings
Accounts, which would allow individuals to spend pretax dollars on
retirement accounts, and up to $600 billion over the next 15 years
to improve Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation is determined not to let our growing old place
an intolerable burden on our children and their ability to raise
our grandchildren,'' he said. ``Our economic success and fiscal
discipline now give us the opportunity to lift that burden.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks hailed by gay and lesbian groups, Clinton spoke in
defense of the Employment Non-discrimination Act and the Hate
Crimes Prevention Act, which would bolster efforts against
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discrimination or violence because of race or religion,
ancestry or gender, disability or sexual orientation, is wrong,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He made a strong appeal to expand international trade, calling
for a new round of negotiations under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Reiterating initiatives that have been announced almost on a
daily basis over the past couple of weeks, the president also urged
spending billions of dollars for new programs on child care,
education, crime-fighting, the environment and the Pentagon. And he
called for raising the minimum wage by $1 an hour over two years,
to $6.15.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, as has been typical of his previous six State of the
Union addresses, spent relatively little time on foreign policy. He
said the United States must step up its efforts to prepare against
possible chemical or biological warfare, and proposed $4.2 billion
_ a 70 percent increase _ to dismantle and destroy Russia's nuclear
arsenal and redirect the work of Russian scientists from weapons to
civilian research.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said the United States will continue to
contain Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. ``And we will work for the
day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the killing of more than 40 ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo, Clinton said the United States and NATO allies ``are
pressing the Serbian government to stop its brutal repression in
Kosovo, to bring those responsible to justice.''

KINGS FADING FAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It was only a few days ago that the Kings
seemed in prime position to make a strong run for a playoff berth
in the second half of the NHL season.
</P>
<P>
   But as they awaken today, with one game remaining before the
All-Star break and 38 to go in the season, the Kings' hopes once
again are fading.
</P>
<P>
   The latest setback was a 5-4 loss to the Colorado Avalanche on
Tuesday night before an announced crowd of 9,692 at the Forum, a
defeat in which Kings goalie Stephane Fiset struggled against his
former teammates. A Donald Audette goal with 12 seconds to play
made the final score appear closer than it was.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset shouldered much of the blame for the loss, particularly
for allowing shots by Joe Sakic and Stephane Yelle to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his poor performance, Fiset said: ``I felt pretty
good out there. I just have no clue. Some nights, you try
everything and the puck still goes in.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Kings (16-24-4) to 1-3-1 in their last five
games and left them five points behind San Jose and St. Louis in
the race for the final two Western Conference playoff berths. Joe
Sakic scored twice for Colorado (21-19-4), which had been 1-5-1 in
its last seven visits to the Forum. The only good news for the
Kings was that Eric Lacroix recorded his first point this season
and Russ Courtnall had a goal and an assist in his first game in
two months after recovering from a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news was that the Kings gave Colorado numerous scoring
chances by making fundamental mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of the five goals came directly from giveaways by us,''
coach Larry Robinson said. ``The biggest glaring mistakes we made
were trying to make little plays at the blue line and throwing the
puck to the middle of the ice.... No, it's not acceptable, and yes,
we've been telling them not do do it. But you can't beat a dead
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Kings were the first team on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix, playing against Colorado for the first time since he
was traded to the Kings early in the season, assisted on a Garry
Galley goal 5:58 into the game that gave the Kings a 1-0 lead. It
was the first point for Lacroix in 30 games this season and his
first in 41 games dating to last season.
</P>
<P>
   The lead lasted less than seven minutes, erased by Sakic's first
goal of the game, a rising shot from the right circle that went
between the legs of defenseman Sean O'Donnell and over Fiset's
glove at 12:16. Ten seconds later, Shean Donovan redirected a shot
from the left point by Chris Drury past Fiset, giving the Avalanche
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Courtnall brought the Kings even early in the second period, but
4:30 later, Sakic blasted an unscreened slap shot from the left
circle between Fiset's pads, and Yelle scored in similar fashion
three minutes later when the Kings got caught deep in the offensive
zone and allowed a 3-on-1 rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you give up a goal five-hole (between the legs),''
Fiset said of the goals by Sakic and Yelle, ``it's a bad goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes into the third period, the Kings had a chance to
cut the deficit to 4-3, but Roy stopped Courtnall on a breakaway,
and about a minute after that, Valeri Kamensky scored on a
breakaway of his own, making it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille scored his 25th goal this season and the 503rd of
his career with 13 minutes to play, bringing the Kings to within
5-3. Audette scored on a power play and with Fiset off for an extra
skater with 12.8 seconds left, accounting for the Kings' final
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, the ominous upcoming schedule doesn't hold
a great deal of promise as far as getting back in the playoff race
is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for the Kings are the New Jersey Devils, who are nine
games above .500 and visit the Forum on Thursday. Then, after
Sunday's All-Star Game in Tampa, the Kings hit the road for games
against Dallas, Washington, Buffalo and Philadelphia, four teams
that are a collective 36 games above .500.
</P>
<P>
   After those games, the Kings will have just 33 to play, and will
have to consider themselves fortunate if they aren't any further
behind in the standings than they are today.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to find some scoring, too.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Kings are mired in notable goal-scoring droughts.
Among the forwards, Pavel Rosa has one in 14, Yanic Perreault has
none in six and four in 37, Jozef Stumpel has one in seven, Olli
Jokinen has none in eight and one in 21, and Vladimir Tsyplakov has
none in 10.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Kings' defensemen, they've scored a combined 10 goals
this season _ one fewer than St. Louis' Al MacInnis and Vancouver's
Adrian Aucoin have all by themselves.

   STATEOFUNION-ASSESS (Washington) _ Without once uttering the

   &LR; FRANCE-THREE-STARS (Paris) _ Starting up and running a
three-star restaurant is an astonishingly expensive proposition. A
typical three-star restaurant has two employees for every guest.
And with France's heavy taxes and formidable social charges, even
lunch and dinner bills of up to $500 per person fail to cover
costs. A debate is simmering in France over just how much trouble
the 21 three-star restaurants are in. How creative _ not just in
their cooking, but in their financing _ do chefs have to be, merely
to survive? Many now have backers; one is even going public. Will
the wildly escalating costs of running these establishments drive
the best and the brightest elsewhere? By Frank J. Prial.

their own chicken stock, despite the constant urgings that it's the
only legitimate way to go. If you're among the abashed, buck up.
Confident cooks have known for years how to take a can of chicken
broth, a bouillon cube or even a cup of water and make the most of
it. And no apologies are necessary; it's still real cooking. Even
the best chefs will tell you so. By Mark Bittman. With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   APERITIFS (Undated) _ On most fronts, American diners have
become more sophisticated and demanding, but when faced with the
aperitif moment, they flinch. ``Something to drink before the
meal?'' is a question brimming with promise. But the truth is, most
people are confused about what an aperitif is and what it is
supposed to do, and that includes professional bartenders. Is it
the same as a cocktail? If not, then where is the dividing line?
Questions like these have challenged the finest minds in drinkdom.

 ENTERTAINMENT No 417 - January 20, 1999  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT SUMMARY -- No. 417 -- Jan. 20, 1999 We are
offering the following articles for sale. Please contact us for
availability your country. Best regards, Karl Horwitz
</P>
<P>
   1. MELANIE GRIFFITH'S WALK ON THE WILD SIDE It's been 11 years
since Melanie Griffith charmed the world as the baby-voiced heroine
of ``Working Girl'' (1988.) Since then, she's made lots of films
and lots of headlines as well, remarrying Don Johnson, divorcing
him and then marrying Spanish star Antonio Banderas. Now she's
reinventing herself as a character actress in the controversial
``Lolita,'' and as a heroin addict in ``Another Day in Paradise.''
In this interview Griffith talks about how she brought her own past
drug problems to bear on her role as an addict, why at 41 she is
venturing into the world of independent films and how she and
Banderas handle a family whose four children have a total of three
different fathers and two different mothers. By Jeanne Wolf. 1,400
words + photo. 2. FROM CUBE TO TUBE : SCOTT ADAMS TAKES 'DILBERT'
OUT OF HIS CUBICLE He's already visible in 1,900 newspapers, 16
books, a popular website and more than 100 licensed products, but
now Dilbert (about a profoundly over-burdened engineer trapped in
his microscopic cubicle,) is about to reach his biggest audience
yet, with a new animated series. It's only the latest triumph from
cartoonist Scott Adams, who also serves as the series' co-executive
producer and co-writer. Adams talks about the new series, how he's
learning to write for television and how his comic strip cured him
of his lifelong shyness. By Ian Spelling. 1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
KENNETH BRANAGH ON HELENA, HAPPINESS AND THE ART OF ACTING Kenneth
Branagh has wielded the sword of Henry V and shaped the monster of
Frankenstein, but his latest film is one of the most unique in his
career. Not only is it a rare venture into a contemporary story and
a particularly difficult role as a troubled artist involved with a
victim of Lou Gehrig's Disase, but ``The Theory of Flight''
co-stars Helena Bonham Carter in the first film they have made
together since becoming a couple. Branagh talks about the new film,
the pluses and minuses of co-starring with his girlfriend, his
divorce from frequent co-star Emma Thompson and why the man many
consider to be his generation's greatest actor has, nevertheless,
struggled with self-doubt. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo.

<P>
   4. GETTING OFF THE NANNY TRACK : FRAN DRESCHER ON LIFE AFTER
'THE NANNY' Behind her nasal voice and calculated ditziness, Fran
Drescher is nobody's fool. As star, executive producer and
occasional director of her long-running hit ``The Nanny,'' she has
capitalized on her comic persona to create a hit movie, a
best-selling book and one of the funniest shows on television.
Drescher talks about her recent decision to end the series after
this season, her efforts to expand her interests and capabilities
behind and in front of the camera, why she chose to rock the
``Nanny'' boat by having her character get married and have a baby
and how she is continuing to deal with life after her 17-year
marriage to high-school sweetheart Peter Jacobsen, from whom she is
now separated. By Christopher Loudon. From TV Guide Canada. 1,400
words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 5.
A MATTER OF PRIDE : CHARLEY PRIDE'S ENDURING LOVE AFFAIR WITH MUSIC
Virtually none of today's country singers has had to contend with
the social and cultural barriers that confronted country music's
greatest black entertainer, Charley Pride. Now secure in his place
in music history, Pride, 60, talks about his early struggles, the
white musicians who opposed and supported him, why he doesn't have
a recording contract at present and why there are still so few
black artists in the world of country music. By Jerry Armor. 1,300
words + photo. 6. EMILY WATSON FAITHFUL TO GENIUS OF 'JACKIE' Emily
Watson received an Oscar nomination for her remarkable screen debut
in ``Breaking the Waves'' (1996,) as a troubled young woman who
spoke to God. Now, for only her third film role, there's Oscar talk
again. In ``Hilary and Jackie,'' Watson plays the celebrated
cellist Jacqueline du Pri, whose life was as dark and turbulent as
her music was sublime. But the Scottish actress is quick to point
out that she is really far more normal - and content - than the
characters she plays. By Joshua Mooney. 1,200 words + photo. 7.
JAMES COBURN WELCOMES MEAN ROLE IN 'AFFLICTION' Hollywood veteran
James Coburn was writer-director Paul Schrader's first and only
choice to play the abusive, alcoholic and altogether frightening
father of the Nick Nolte character in the dark, uncompromising
movie ``Affliction.'' Coburn, 70, naturally, was flattered.
Schrader said he wanted an actor whom you associated with a
Hollywood male hero. So Coburn certainly fit the bill. By Kenneth
M. Chanko. From The Boston Globe. 1,400 words + photo.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The last two years have been fabulous years
economically. Inflation has disappeared; unemployment, like murder,
is down to levels not seen since the 1960s, and growth is a
vigorous 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has made millionaires irrelevant. To be rich
today, one has to be a billionaire. Nothing in the memories of
those now alive compares with what has happened in 1997 and 1998.
Even in the high-living 1980s, the misery index _ inflation plus
unemployment _ was always far higher.
</P>
<P>
   True, we are in the midst of the longest peacetime expansion in
American history. Yet, as in all economic stories, there is another
side.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly longer view shows median family incomes that haven't
risen since the early 1970s, yet the average wife is working 15
more weeks a year than she did back then. Real wages for 80 percent
of the male labor force are below where they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 90 percent of the stock market gains have gone to the top
10 percent of the households, and the bottom 60 percent of
Americans cannot benefit from the market boom because they don't
own any stock. There have been better years in the past: Growth was
6.5 percent in 1964 and 1965, inflation was much lower in 1961 and
1962, and unemployment was at 3.5 percent in 1968 and 1969.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans don't want to hear that other story, any more than
they want to hear about President Clinton's impeachment trial.
Americans want to party.
</P>
<P>
   The right defining statistic for the last two years is the
negative savings rate first recorded in September 1998. Negative
savings rates hadn't been seen since 1933. The Great Depression was
under way, unemployment was approaching 30 percent, earnings had
collapsed, unemployment insurance benefits had yet to be invented,
no one had heard of welfare, and assets had to be sold if someone
wanted to eat. Consumption was above income because for too many
people there was no income.
</P>
<P>
   A very different story has to be told to explain 1998's negative
savings rates. Americans felt rich because of the booming stock
market and, not surprisingly, wanted to spend some of their new
wealth. Consumption exceeded income not because incomes were down
but because wealth was up.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were tired of watching their wealth grow on paper and
wanted to feel and touch some of their money with
bigger-than-that-of-my-neighbor sport utility vehicles,
10,000-square-foot homes or other conspicuous consumption.
</P>
<P>
   This story sounds reasonable until you think about it for more
than a microsecond. Negative savings rates first occurred in
September when the market was plunging. At that time there were
real fears of an American meltdown of 1998 that would rival the
collapse of Japan's bubble economy in 1990. Russia was going down
the tubes and carrying some very big banks with it. Bankers Trust
and Bank of America announced billion-dollar losses.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil was shaking, as it is now, and it seemed likely that it
would carry the rest of Latin America down with it, as it does now.
A government-organized rescue was being shaped for a
trillion-dollar hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, to
prevent it from pulling down the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve Board lowered interest
rates three times in four weeks _ once on an emergency basis. In
September no one was predicting that soaring stock prices would
return in November. Those who had been market optimists in August
were scorned.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this bad news dampened Americans' desire to spend.
They consumed like the stock market was going up when in fact it
was going down. Americans simply wanted to party, party. And in
part because they did so, the market went back up.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems that the interesting questions about 1997 and 1998
are probably sociological and not economic. These two years were
good economically, but we seem to feel far better about them
sociologically than their performance warrants. Why?
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of reasons to party.
</P>
<P>
   One can have a party to celebrate a victory. However one
calibrates America's performance in the last two years, it is far
better than that of the rest of the world. In 1990 only one of the
10 most valuable companies in the world was American. In 1998 nine
of the 10 most valuable companies in the world were American.
</P>
<P>
   One can also have a party to push out of one's mind, at least
for a short period, things that one would rather not think about.
There is a lot to push out of one's mind: the impeachment trial,
dying children in Kosovo, a failing peace agreement in the Middle
East and chaos in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that the political analysts have it wrong on Clinton's
impeachment. They explain the opinion polls supporting the
president with the argument that the public gives him credit for
the economy's performance and doesn't want to take a chance on
disrupting those good results. But do that many Americans truly
believe that the good economy would disappear if Clinton
disappeared?
</P>
<P>
   Or one can have a party simply to announce that ``I am rich.''
In this case, the bigger the party, the better. The whole purpose
of the party is to make my neighbors envious of my success.
</P>
<P>
   Americans can of course want to party for any one of these
reasons. They must remember that like all parties, the good times
have to end. But who wants to think of the prospects for 1999 _ our
ballooning trade deficit, Brazil's incipient meltdown, slower
economic growth _ when 1998's party is still under way?

 &HT;    Training to identify child abuse surveyed
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Only about half of Texas professionals who
regularly come in contact with children say they are required by
their employers to learn the signs of child abuse or neglect. But
83 percent of the teachers, police officers, social workers,
doctors and other professionals surveyed say they have been trained
to recognize signs of trouble, a new report released Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by University of North Texas researchers
for the Children's Trust Fund of Texas, follows a recent state
study that found that the number of Texas children known to have
died from abuse or neglect rose more than 70 percent between 1997
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent contradictions between the two studies could not be
immediately explained.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Trust Fund of Texas, established by the Texas
Legislature in 1985, helps set state child abuse policy and
provides money for local child abuse prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the first of its kind in Texas, and researchers
didn't know whether other states have produced similar reports. As
a result, they were unable to say whether training has improved or
declined in Texas or how the state rates nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two percent of the 601 police officers, court officials,
social service workers, child care providers, teachers, principals,
school counselors and health care providers who were surveyed by
telephone said they had to undergo training on child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-four percent of law enforcement officers said training
was required, while only 52 percent of health care providers, 36
percent of school teachers and 21 percent of court officials said
they had to undergo training.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin Police Department and the Austin Independent School
District both require child abuse training.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of respondents said they were
``definitely'' trained adequately to recognize abuse, but more than
33 percent said they were only ``somewhat'' prepared and a little
over 4 percent said they were ``not at all'' equipped to recognize
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Scott McCown, who oversees the placement of
Travis County abused and neglected children into safe homes, noted
that among state caseworkers, training is closely linked to
employee turnover. Because workers often leave for less-stressful
jobs, it is difficult to maintain a corps of experienced and
well-trained caseworkers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two kinds of training: There's your initial training
and there's continuing training,'' McCown said. ``We need both of
those, and to take advantage of it, you've got to have people stay
on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, McCown warned Gov. George W. Bush and the
Legislature that Child Protective Services was increasingly
strained. Using a citizens' grievance procedure outlined in the
Texas Constitution, McCown delivered a data-packed petition to Bush
and lawmakers. He recommended that 2 cents of every dollar from the
state's anticipated multibillion-dollar budget surplus be set aside
to help abused and neglected children.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Miguel Wise, whose 1997 bill mandated the study, said he
plans to propose legislation that would expand training on child
abuse. But he acknowledged that money could be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Additional training obviously will be a larger drain on local
police departments and state agencies,'' said Wise, D-Weslaco. ``We
may not be be able to get all the hours we'd like to see without a
city or county going broke.''

 &HT;    Annoying phone-based pitches have made us fear taking calls
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I punched the speaker-phone button on a kitchen
wall phone and then hit the the speed-dial number of a friend whose
wife was in the hospital recovering from an operation.
</P>
<P>
   If he answered, I intended to pick up the handset to talk to
him. I've never liked to be put on a speaker phone. Your voice
reverberates like you're talking into a washtub. I also don't like
the feeling that I could be talking to a roomful of people.
</P>
<P>
   My friend answered. But before I could raise the handset, he
hung up.
</P>
<P>
   I hit the redial button.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, why did you hang up so quick?''
</P>
<P>
   ``After I say 'hello,' and no one answers immediately, I hang
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it didn't take me that long,'' I said. ``I was just
reaching for the handset when you hung up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Telemarketers have that little pause in there after you answer
the phone before they say anything,'' he explained. ``They drive my
crazy. That's why I hang up if there's a pause after I answer the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of such a thing,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot you've never heard about. I pay attention. You
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a point. I've never analyzed nuisance calls from
telemarketers with a stopwatch. My method to prevent telephone
salesmen from invading my privacy with their relentless sales
pitches is to allow my answering machine to pick up telephone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Very few telemarketers will leave a message on an answering
machine. They just dial some another poor sap's telephone. They
play the odds. Eventually, someone will answer and present the
opportunity for money to flow into the caller's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   My answering machine method is far from satisfactory, however.
Although attitudes have changed a lot since answering machines
first came out, there still are a lot of people besides
telemarketers who don't like to talk to a machine.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with my answering-machine solution to
telemarketers is that I have to be within earshot of the machine to
tell if someone I want to talk to is leaving a message. That's a
pain.
</P>
<P>
   And if I do pick up the phone quickly enough when I'm expecting
a call, we both have to wait until my own irritating answering
machine message is finished playing.
</P>
<P>
   All of this trouble is caused by telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to avoid unwanted sales pitches is Caller ID. A
number of my friends say they don't answer the phone without first
checking their Caller ID to see who is calling. Telemarketers
generally block their names and telephone numbers from showing up
on caller ID.
</P>
<P>
   Texas must have more telemarketing than any other state. Or
perhaps Texans have less tolerance for telemarketing than other
Americans. Or maybe we're simply nosier than other people because
Texans believe in Caller ID nearly as much as the death penalty,
which means nearly everyone has Caller ID.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with screening out telemarketers with Caller ID is
that people are missing phone calls they might want to take because
some calls come from areas in which Caller ID is not offered.
</P>
<P>
   People who block Caller ID out of a sense of personal privacy
often don't get their calls answered because many people will not
answer a phone call unless they can tell who is calling.
</P>
<P>
   Telemarketers, bless their souls, are people, too. They're out
there earning a living by churning up $550 billion in annual sales
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But telemarketers also are people who are driving many otherwise
sane Americans crazy. Telemarketers are ruining the convenience and
pleasure of owning and using a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   I want to be able to answer my telephone again without being
hassled by strangers trying to take my money.

 &HT;    What black women want: A spiritual man
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Looks didn't even make the list.
</P>
<P>
   (Not that anybody would mind a date with Denzel Washington...)
</P>
<P>
   Spirituality, sensitivity and strength of character are the most
vital traits in a mate, according to a new book called All the Man
I Need: Black Women's Loving Expressions on the Men They Desire.
</P>
<P>
   White women, on the other hand, tend to go for guys who display
affection and treat them as equals. But more on that later.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many women's magazines talk about what men want in women,''
says Anaezi Modu, who co-wrote the book with fellow Princeton grad
Andrea Walker. ``I wanted to know what women valued. In their own
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Modu, inspired by a GQ ad that asked, ``What makes a man a
gentleman?'', decided to pose a similar question in contest form:
Describe your ideal partner in 75 words or less. Although she and
Walker offered a $1,000 prize and approached numerous women's
magazines, only Essence and American Woman were interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't set out to do a survey of just black women,'' Modu
says. ``And then we were overwhelmed by nearly 2,000 responses from
Essence readers.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Woman survey, meanwhile, generated fewer than 200
letters from its predominantly white readership _ too small of a
sampling _ so Modu and Walker narrowed the focus of their book to
black women. They chose 350 submissions from the Essence mailbag
for All the Man I Need, which also includes passages from black
writers, former slaves and religious texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that surprised me was that an overwhelming
majority of submissions were written in the form of poetry,'' says
Walker, 41, who is black. ``There was a rhythm to what these people
were writing. Many didn't care that they disqualified themselves
from the contest because they went over 75 words. They just felt
certain things needed to be said.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those things:
</P>
<P>
   ``He will possess intellect and integrity, constantly striving
for self-improvement while empowering others. A preservationist for
family, Christian and moral values.'' _ Deidre Wilson,
Robersonville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal man is an intellectual with common sense. He is
strong even when no one is looking. His beauty lies in his generous
spirit and belief in God. He is nobody's victim and feels no need
to carry his legacy like a cross.'' _ Adrienne Maynard-Melchor,
Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to toss out the complex description of Mr. Right and be
thankful for a level-headed brother with a job!'' _ Shetina Dawn
Wallace, Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   While some responses were humorous, most revealed a sincere
desire for an honest, respectful, God-fearing man.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you read the entries, you can feel the African-American
cultural influences in the way the women express themselves,'' says
Modu, 38, who lives with her daughter in Providence, R.I., and runs
her own design, marketing and architectural management firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong emphasis on spirituality is a reflection of the
black experience in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious conviction, however, appeared much less frequently in
white respondents' essays. The most sought-after mate, according to
American Woman readers, is one who shows affection (i.e., sends
flowers, remembers birthdays, calls during the day).
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we had so few American Woman responses, we couldn't
make a direct comparison,'' says Walker. But she added that many
traits _ sensitivity, loyalty and integrity among them _ were
common denominators.
</P>
<P>
   ``But spirituality by far and away was the most glaring
difference. In hindsight, this is to be expected. Part of growing
up in the black community is learning to turn to a higher power to
guide the way. It's ingrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing that struck me was the heavy emphasis on
romantic gestures in the American Woman readership,'' says Walker,
a married attorney in Newark, N.J., with two kids. ``Not to say
that Essence women don't want this, but they seemed to be saying,
`Sure, that stuff is nice, but here are my basic requirements.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference in the essays was that white women stated
more often the need for equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Essence women, equality is important, too, but it wasn't
mentioned in an equal-rights context. The thought is, `I've been
independent for so long, and I've borne the burden of raising a
family for so long that I've had ``equality.'' I'm ready for some
sharing of responsibilities.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Debra Johnson of West Palm Beach, who answered the ad,
responsibility and spirituality make up her ideal man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independent enough to make responsible decisions and strong
enough to progress despite the obstacles,'' she writes, on Page
142. ``Spiritually secure and aware, he must be faithful to himself
before he can be faithful to anyone else.... A giver _ mentally,
spiritually, emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been into looks,'' says Johnson, 28, an
administrative assistant who is divorced and has a 6-year-old
daughter. ``I go for a sense of humor because that usually leads to
a good personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about flowers.''

 &HT;    Author hopes to lift weight of world from fat folk
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Cynthia Last was disgusted with her
obesity.
</P>
<P>
   A teenager struggling with self-worth, she vowed not to let her
looks define her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured my best chance of finding success was by developing
my intellect,'' she writes in her new book, The 5 Reasons Why We
Overeat: How to Develop a Long-Term Weight Control Plan That's
Right for You ($19.95, Birch Lane Press.)
</P>
<P>
   Last studied psychology in college, particularly behavioral
sciences, and developed a weight-loss plan for herself. She focused
on the psychological reasons she was eating, not the diets that
never worked.
</P>
<P>
   She dissolved from a size 11 to a size 5, a weight loss she's
maintained for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to eat due to anxiety and impulsivity,'' says Last, now
a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   That meant she had to focus on reducing the tension and stress
that led to self-medicating with food, and to become more aware of
what and where she was eating.
</P>
<P>
   Once she did that, the weight loss kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is similar to smoking cigarettes, or using alcohol. It's
a substance you use to try to cope with life. The better able you
are to develop coping skills, the less you will rely on these kinds
of substances to get through day to day life,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   The book divides overeaters into five types: The Impulse Eater,
The Hedonist, The Stress Reducer, The Avoider, and The Energizer.
</P>
<P>
   The Hedonist, for example, is an outgoing person who uses food
as a pleasure trip, savoring and devouring slowly. They tend to
gain weight by consuming too many calories. Weight-loss treatment
focuses on substituting lower-calorie, yet tasty foods, and working
other enjoyable activities into their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Last's plan includes a self-test to identify which eating type a
reader is. The purpose is for readers to start making changes
immediately _ no sessions with a therapist required.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things that are new in the book,'' says Last,
also a professor at Nova Southeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It poses psychological solutions. You use an anxiety treatment
plan, for example, to learn how to face and solve problems. Other
weight-loss programs offer dietary solutions to an emotional
problem. This book conceptualizes overeating as primarily
psychological and offers entirely psychological answers. It also
offers an entirely different treatment program, based on the reason
you overeat.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's one big no-no, no matter what type of overeater you
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you not to weigh yourself while you're learning the
skills. The weight is the wrong focus,'' she warns. ``If you
eliminate why you overeat, the weight will drop off.''

 &HT;    Boca Brings On The Old Masters
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Pierre-Auguste Renoir is one of the
world's great painters. Al Hirschfeld is one of the century's great
caricaturists. Masters in different fields, their work celebrates
life.
</P>
<P>
   Renoir died in 1916 at 78, after creating about 6,000 paintings.
He never stopped working despite crippling arthritis. At 95,
Hirschfeld continues to produce his lively drawings of show-biz
personalities for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   There's another connection between these two different artists _
both have shows in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   Renoir and The Cote d'Azur: Homage and Celebrations opened
earlier this week at the Boca Raton Museum of Art. In Line With Al
Hirschfeld opens Saturday at the International Museum of Cartoon
Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to do a retrospective _ the greatest
masterpieces of Renoir,'' said Boca Raton Museum director George
Bolge. ``What we're doing is re-creating a sense of the working
environment of a great artist at the peak of his popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which has already sold about 10,000 tickets, comes
from The Renoir Museum in Cagnes-sur-Mer in the south of France.
The museum is in the artist's former home on the Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition runs through March 14 and has about 95 paintings,
drawings, sculpture and ceramics by Renoir and others, as well as
such artifacts as the great man's chair, coat and easel.
</P>
<P>
   Renoir's late work from Cagnes-sur-Mer is controversial, or at
least unusual in the way it was created. He settled there with his
family around 1905. The son of a poor tailor, he was a cheerful,
common-sensical man who had achieved financial success. He was
``perhaps the first great artist who never painted a sad picture,''
noted writer Octave Mirbeau.
</P>
<P>
   But, by around 1912, he was confined to a wheelchair with
rheumatoid arthritis and painted with the brush strapped between
his twisted fingers. He continued to push himself, even deciding to
try sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   His noted dealer, Ambroise Vollard, arranged to find him a pair
of hands. Vollard asked the sculptor Aristide Maillol to work with
the older man, but Maillol was too far along in his own style to
make a collaboration work. So Vollard found a young Spaniard named
Richard Guino.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sat down and worked on drawings together,'' said Bolge.
``They worked on sculptures together. The old man would be there,
say something and touch the clay,'' and Guino would then add or
subtract the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end, Renoir wasn't doing a great deal of
painting,'' Bolge added. ``But sculpture opened up a new vista for
him.'' The ideas kept coming. ``You couldn't kill that creative
zeal. You can see the artist continuing to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition contains only six small paintings by Renoir but
34 sculptures by Guino/Renoir, as well as some of Guino's own work.
There are also portraits of the master done by artists visiting
Cagnes-sur-Mer. ``Artists liked to paint the master painting,''
Bolge noted.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will cost about $150,000, making it the museum's
most expensive ever, he said. And there's talk of the local museum
shipping a contemporary art exhibition to The Renoir Museum. Bolge
would like to push the idea of forming a sister-city relationship
with Cagnes-sur-Mer.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that tucked away in the south of France are a
number of other unusual museums devoted to French masters. ``We
wouldn't mind doing more of this kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Renoir gained fame as an Impressionist, and spent a
lifetime painting beautiful women, Hirschfeld has spent his long
life caricaturing women _ and men _ with wit and empathy.
</P>
<P>
   The Hirschfeld show, which runs through May 9, features
approximately 70 drawings and prints, including caricatures of such
luminaries as Greta Garbo, Charlie Chaplin, Zero Mostel, Laurel and
Hardy and Vanessa Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   Born in St. Louis in 1903, Hirschfeld published his first New
York Times caricature in 1928. It depicted the Scottish vaudeville
star Harry Lauder. But Hirschfeld had already established a
reputation in show business by that time.
</P>
<P>
   He began as an office boy at Goldwyn Pictures in 1920. Two years
later, he was art director at Selznick Pictures. He was noted for
his movie-poster work before his first theater caricature, which
appeared in The New York Herald Tribune in 1926. He agreed to work
exclusively for The Times in 1943. The deal was sealed with a
handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his famous caricatures, the show has drawings and
sculpture by the teenage Hirschfeld, movie posters and political
caricatures of the likes of Ross Perot and famed union leader John
L. Lewis. Hirschfeld will be honored at a museum reception on Jan.
30.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the chance to play everybody's favorite Hirschfeld
game _ locating his daughter Nina's name, which he has been hiding
within his drawings since 1945.

 &HT;    Adkins' diet: True grit and a big plate of hits
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In John Wayne-speak, country singer
Trace Adkins is one tough hombre.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the 6-foot-6, 37-year-old Louisiana native has
weathered a hurricane while working on an offshore oil rig. He's
survived two near-fatal car accidents _ his nose had to be sewed
back on after one of those. He lopped off his left pinkie once
while opening an oil barrel and told doctors to sew it back on at
an angle so he could still play guitar. A bulldozer nearly cut off
his legs. And an ex-wife once shot him through the heart.
</P>
<P>
   All of which adds gravity when he says that his next album, due
out later this year, is ``do or die'' for his career.
</P>
<P>
   Do or die for a guy who's almost bought the farm so many times?
Sounds serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really needs to be successful,'' says Adkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really do anything about that fact or dwell on it. I
can only do what I can to make the best record I can make. If radio
embraces that, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   His first effort, Dreamin' Out Loud, sold more than a million
copies in 1996 and produced two monster hits, the lonesome
tearjerker Every Light in the House and (This Ain't) No Thinkin'
Thing.
</P>
<P>
   His second album, Big Time in 1998, sold more than 500,000
copies and scored well with the song Lonely Won't Leave Me Alone,
but it didn't pass muster for Adkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was a disappointment,'' he said. ``It's sold just
under a million copies, but it should have been a better album.''
</P>
<P>
   He and veteran Nashville producer Emory Gordy have polished off
17 tracks for Adkins' third release, tentatively titled Get Real.
They're in the process of honing the songs and culling them to
about a dozen tunes for the final disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best adjective I can use to describe it is that it's a
little more mature,'' he said. ``Lyrically, vocally,
instrumentally, it's just more ... mature. I think that just comes
with growth, with being in the business and getting more
comfortable with yourself and more at ease with how you want to
project yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was a dip in quality, Nashville didn't notice. The
Country Music Association nominated him for a Horizon Award in
1998, essentially anointing him as a star in the making. The
TNN/Music City News Awards also named him the Male Star of
Tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   And he's garnering the respect of idols such as Buck Owens and
Merle Haggard. ``Waylon Jennings called the other day and said he
wrote a song he thought I might like,'' Adkins said. ``That blew me
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Adkins first started performing with a gospel quartet when he
was a high school student in Sarepta, La. He continued to sing
gospel throughout his years at Louisiana Tech University, where he
studied petroleum technology. A vocal teacher suggested he consider
studying opera, but he decided to use his rich baritone to pursue a
career in country music.
</P>
<P>
   He worked on an oil rig for a few years after graduation and
played honky-tonks on weekends before being discovered by a Capitol
Records executive at a roadway beer joint in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   His live performances, in fact, may be his best kept secret.
When he opened for Clint Black in June, he stoked the crowd to the
point that women were screaming by the time he left the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shows have always done well,'' he said. ``The rumor has
gotten around that we do a pretty decent show.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean he'll be doing the usual amount of
hip-swiveling when he performs at the fair. Adkins said he tailors
his road show for the family crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little cleaner,'' he said. ``I like to say my show is
same for every audience, but it's not. In a club or in a venue,
it's a more mature show. I cut my teeth in beer joints and when I
go back and do a show there, it's a beer joint show. At the fair,
it's just a good, family show, but that's cool too. I love every
kind of venue.''

 &HT;    What makes a good-looking chick? Think all chickens are created
equal?
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Bleach jobs and blow-drys, clipped nails
and preening. Yes, it's chicken-judging time at the South Florida
Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Birdly beauty is all in the breeding, owners say. You have to
have a pretty face and nice legs. And you have to make a good first
impression, because judging can take just seconds, says Dale
Porcher, local poultry judge and a West Palm Beach veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Any of this sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Like human beauties, good-looking chickens have a lot in common.
They must have faces smooth and fine in texture, and beaks in
proportion to their well-rounded heads.
</P>
<P>
   And the beauty must be natural. Chickens with mascara dabbed on
imperfections, for instance, are disqualified, Porcher says.
</P>
<P>
   When he makes the rounds of cages, Porcher carries a copy of the
American Poultry Association's The Standards of Perfection, which
contains pictures of the ideal breeds. Judging is easy _ whichever
chicken looks the most like its picture wins.
</P>
<P>
   Could a similar ``standard of perfection'' for humans exist?
``That's garbage,'' Porcher says quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Not that people aren't trying. New Mexico State University
psychologist Victor Johnston has even created a computer-enhanced
face of the ``perfect'' woman, complete with full lips and dainty
bone structure.
</P>
<P>
   Such beauty ideals have been tied to a woman's fertility,
Johnston says. Full lips and delicate bones are considered ``high
estrogen markers,'' and fertility is desirable in a mate. With
today's fertility clinics and drugs, though, and women in their 50s
having babies, those ``markers'' are irrelevant, Johnston says. But
the beauty ideal lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Good looks mean even less with chickens. A winner doesn't mate
better, owners say. It doesn't taste better. It doesn't even
produce more eggs.
</P>
<P>
   A blue-ribbon bird is just the result of good food, a thorough
shampoo and a little pluck. Would those outside the poultry
community see beauty in Taylor's prize-winner? We asked West Palm
Beach plastic surgeon Frederic Barr to take a gander at the Buff
Brahma hen and give us feedback. Barr did more than that; he
composed this couplet: ``Her beak is petite with a slight
coquettish flair/her neck is quite youthful, not a hint of a wattle
there.'' (Later, he admitted, ``I'm a fish person. I've never even
owned a parakeet.'') THE PERFECT CHICKEN? When a group of farmers
compiled The Standards of Perfection for chickens a century ago,
they created a different one for each breed. No judging Brahmas
against Rhode Island Reds. Give different looks a chance, they may
have mused. That doesn't mean they weren't picky. Here's what your
aspiring Buff Brahma cochin bantam hen has to measure up to: Comb:
Five points, no wrinkles Beak: Stout at the base Face: Smooth, fine
in texture Eyes: Medium in size Wattles: Small, nicely rounded
Earlobes: Oblong Head: Neat, fairly full in skull Neck: Short,
nicely arched, plumage very full Back: Very broad, shoulders broad
Tail: Short, broad at base, carried rather low Wings: Small,
well-folded and carried with no drooping Breast: Low in front, of
great breadth and depth Body-fluff: Full and well-rounded Legs: Set
well apart, straight when viewed from the front Lower thighs:
Moderately large, with great profusion of soft fluff plumage Hocks:
Well-covered with a profusion of soft, flexible feathers Shanks:
Short, stout in bone Toes: Four on each foot, straight,
well-spaced, middle and outer toes heavily feathered to ends
Weight: 34 ounces THE PERFECT CHICK? Defining a female ``standard
of perfection'' is much more murky. But researcher Victor Johnston
at New Mexico State University tried. In a project conducted over
the Internet, he asked thousands of people to rate several faces on
a scale of 1 to 9. From that, he ``bred'' the perfect face. Eyes:
Large, well-spaced Cheekbones: High Nose: Small Chin: Delicate
Forehead: High Lips: Full This is just a computer image, of course.
The real perfect woman, he says, would have to be Ingrid Bergman.

 &HT;    Hummel Museum struggles against financial woes
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Inside a vault that guards a trove of loaned
artwork sits a portrait of the artist as a young nun. The black and
white photograph of a smiling Sister Maria Innocentia _ her hands
neatly tucked in the sleeves of her habit _ stands out against the
vault's white walls and the stacks of cardboard boxes that hold her
drawings.
</P>
<P>
   The German nun, born Berta Hummel, is internationally recognized
as the artist whose drawings captured tender moments of children at
play. She also is the namesake of the Hummel Museum _ a source of
civic pride in this city whose heritage is distinctly German.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a little more than six years after it opened, the Hummel
Museum has hit hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've fallen behind in our payments,'' said Doreen Schaeffer,
the executive director. ``The bank has been more than patient with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit museum, a refurbished savings and loan building
that houses the world's largest collection of Hummel's charcoal and
pastel drawings and oil paintings, is behind $60,000 on mortgage
payments, utilities and salaries and has $350,000 in long-term
debt, Schaeffer said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which draws about 20,000 visitors a year, has
counted on admissions, memberships, gift shop sales and local
benefactors to defray expenses. But the October floods that ravaged
Central Texas hit New Braunfels hard, destroying businesses and
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big donors have been hurt, and you don't have the guts to
ask them for more,'' said local resident Sieglinde Schoen Smith,
who helped found the museum and who, as a child in Germany, was a
model for some of Hummel's drawings.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was facing closure this month, but new donations _
most of them from the M.I. Hummel Collectors Club, which has more
than 300,000 members, and Goebel, the German company that produces
figurines based on Hummel's drawings _ will keep it open for now.
Museum President John Lovett said the facility must retire its
long-term debt and raise money for an endowment fund to secure its
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an international treasure,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Immortalizing childhood
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith and Hummel grew up in southern Germany, though they
were born 32 years apart.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's father was a garment manufacturer who employed nuns from
a Franciscan order in the Convent Siessen to sew clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Hummel was already a well-known artist whose work
supported the convent, which she had joined in April 1931. She had
sold the licensing rights for the figurines to Goebel, whose sales
saved the company's factory from closure in 1935. Before that, her
images graced postcards and greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's father, who she says ``was more Catholic than the
pope,'' commissioned the nunin 1942 to do a portrait of his
16-month-old daughter. She wore a dress adorned with bluebells and
a garland of the flowers on her head that she had worn in a spring
children's festival.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Smith accompanied her father to pick up the
portrait _ a Christmas present for her mother. As they waited,
Smith, dragging a puppet of a joker behind her, stood in front of
the convent's Christmas tree, her mouth agape as she stared at one
of the lighted candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sister Hummel came down the steps to the hallway and spotted
me right away, and with great joy said, `Don't move. I'll be right
back,' '' Smith said. The nun returned with a pad and charcoal; she
quickly sketched the image and handed it to Smith's father.
</P>
<P>
   Both pieces, ``Child with Bluebells'' and ``Sieglinde's First
Tree,'' became Hummel figurines.
</P>
<P>
   Wartime art defied Nazis
</P>
<P>
   Berta Hummel was born in 1909 and died at age 37 from
tuberculosis. She was, by all accounts, a spirited nun who
sometimes defied convention.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the Nazis took half the profits from her
artwork. The government shut down the convent and its school, but
Hummel continued to draw.
</P>
<P>
   Though her work is most often associated with the happy,
chubby-cheeked children of the figurines, she also produced
numerous religious works. As the war raged, Hummel drew pictures of
angels underneath a six-pointed star and wearing robes adorned with
the star that represents Judaism. She drew a postcard-size
Christian cross with a Jewish menorah laid over the image and a
single candle blazing in the middle, her way of expressing the
validity of both faiths under God. ``If she would have been caught
with that little picture in her pocket it would have been bye-bye
Sister Hummel,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The war cut the Smith family off from the convent. Smith
wouldn't return until 1987 _ 24 years after she had moved to Fort
Worth. The nuns, who were chronicling Hummel's work, were excited
to find out that Smith was the little girl in the copies of two
pieces they had been unable to trace.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving Prints
</P>
<P>
   After returning to Texas, Smith and her husband, Bill, decided
to make prints of Sieglinde's originals. They drove to New
Braunfels to meet Ken Armke, a Hummel dealer, who agreed to
distribute a limited edition of the prints.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had they begun marketing the prints when attorneys for
the licensing house Ars A.G. of Switzerland notified them that
reproductions of original Hummels was the company's exclusive
right. Hummel herself had sold the company all publishing rights to
her art.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths flew to Switzerland to work out a deal. The couple
also learned that the company had more than 300 Hummel originals
stored in crates. Sieglinde Smith said the president, Jacques
Nauer, told her Hummel's work was so popular in the United States
that he was negotiating to open a museum in New York or at Disney
World's Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had a better idea. ``Maybe a small town, a town where
Sister Hummel would have liked to live during her life time, maybe
a town with a German heritage would be more suited,'' she told
Nauer.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths moved to New Braunfels in 1991, and with the help of
Armke and the Chamber of Commerce, Nauer agreed to put the museum
there. It opened in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the original artwork, the museum features an exhibit of
Hummel's life, including her easel, her private kneeler from the
convent and other artifacts. It also displays more than 1,500
Hummel figurines, many of them on loan from private collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 57, restored many original drawings herself after
learning the process from a University of Texas museum curator.
With eraser shavings, a Q-Tip and magnifying glass, she
painstakingly cleaned each piece of artwork, removing decades of
accumulated dirt.
</P>
<P>
   She keeps the shavings and Q-Tips handy inside the vault where
she works at a table underneath the photo of Sister Hummel.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of the museum's closing weighs heavy on Sieglinde's
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's past sad,'' she said. ``The artwork's in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum's board of directors plans to sit down with its
creditors this month, Schaeffer said. ``The board will have to sit
down and talk, make some decisions and go from there.''

 &HT;    The squeaky-clean Kim Alexis talks about God, kids and local tv
project
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ At first, former supermodel Kim Alexis is
so perfect, so distressingly polished, that you want to shake her
until her teeth (never a cavity!) rattle like a handful of dice.
</P>
<P>
   It's not her fault, really. She just keeps saying these things
in that calm, pleasant, TV-ready voice.
</P>
<P>
   Things like, ``I was a great kid. I can't imagine that I did
much wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``My morning routine takes about two minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``I never had to wear braces or glasses when I was a kid.''
Acne? ``No acne.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a relief, then, to sit in on the taping of her television
show, Parenting in the '90s and Beyond, in Delray Beach and watch
her say ``de-shi-sions'' instead of ``decisions'' and roll her eyes
like anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Alexis? That someone would even have to ask shows how
quickly the world of modeling sheds its skin.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis was one of a handful of women _ Kelly Emberg and Christie
Brinkley were others _ so tall and blond and dominant in the early
1980s that someone came up with the term ``supermodels.'' Alexis
remembers hearing it after she signed a contract with Revlon in
1983 and someone told her she was one.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the era of successors Linda-Naomi-Claudia-Cindy-Kate.
And these days, Alexis, 38, is two decades older than even the
average model.
</P>
<P>
   But she's not crying about it.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis holds the record for Glamour covers (29) and once made
headlines for being Vogue's cover girl in back-to-back months, but
now she can't remember the last time she was on the cover of
anything.
</P>
<P>
   And she hardly keeps in touch with anyone from her modeling
days. When another '80s supermodel, Carol Alt, was in Africa
recently, the two exchanged e-mails. And Alexis stays in touch with
Emberg, Rod Stewart's girlfriend before he married model Rachel
Hunter. ``But I don't really hang out with anybody,'' Alexis says,
and these days that means anybody outside her family.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, former NHL player Ron Duguay (they married
in Tampa), live in Southern California with five kids among them _
two sons from Alexis' first marriage, Duguay's two daughters and
the couple's 4-year-old son, Noah.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day it's been more than a week since Alexis
has seen them. While Duguay keeps house _ he even buys Alexis'
clothes and packs them _ she travels to work on various projects,
such as commercials for Monistat, infomercials for a teeth whitener
and even a bit part in Eddie Murphy's Holy Man. She calls home
every day.
</P>
<P>
   Three times a year, she visits the Five Star Productions studio
in Delray Beach to tape bits for the show on parenting. (The next
one will air at noon Feb. 6 on WFOR-Channel 4 in Miami.)
</P>
<P>
   The show's set is your basic American living room, with flowers
and photos and fake sunlight that does not move an inch across the
carpet. The photos are not of Alexis' family and probably came with
the frames, says a show employee.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis, says director Bill Horneck, ``comes with nothing but her
clothes and her smile.''
</P>
<P>
   The walls are not thick enough. A truck rumbles by, and taping
stops, and everyone plays the game of ``What's that sound?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a garbage truck to me,'' Alexis says. A few
minutes later a train passes, then something else. ``A plane!''
someone guesses. ``A Piper Cub!'' Alexis says, looking around
playfully, a challenge. ``But where is it going, though?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vero Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a car horn breaks up a take on breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for the noise, taping could be done already.
Alexis usually nails her lines in a couple of tries.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, she answers Horneck's questions about his
4-day-old daughter, Julia. (How long for the eyes to focus? he
asks. Two weeks, she says.)
</P>
<P>
   Then they start on the whole stork concept. ``It's dumb,''
Alexis says. ``Who ever thought of a dumb stork? What does a stork
have to do with newborns?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hel-lo,'' Horneck replies, ``how else do the babies get
there?''
</P>
<P>
   Alexis' black dress pants are now a size 10. That came with
having a third son, she says. The weight came off easily enough the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   She had her first boy when she was 25, modeling like crazy and
using an IUD. It was a surprise, both to her and her first husband,
a Jacksonville businessman. ``God determined when I would have
kids,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   With Alexis, ``God'' is not just a toss-off comment, like
``knock on wood.'' She walks into her dressing room and returns
with her Bible, in its quilted blue carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bad marriage,'' she says, talking about her first
husband. ``I reestablished myself with this.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past seven years, she has answered fan mail with her
photo and a verse of Scripture. When asked about her most unusual
fan, this is her answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four months ago, a man wrote me back. He said he was
planning to murder his cellmate. But he got my picture with the
Scripture in a swap. He said he pulled it out and read it, and it
changed him. He really had had the whole thing planned out.''
</P>
<P>
   (The quote was from Romans, Chapter 12: ``Recompense no man evil
for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be
possible, as much lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.'')
</P>
<P>
   She put that story in her new book, A Model for a Better Future,
which she describes as a Christian book on morals and a self-help
book for mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Her philosophy now, she says, is ``What's the use of something
if it doesn't benefit people?''
</P>
<P>
   So she picks projects such as her other television show, Healthy
Kids, for the Family Channel, or her appearances on the 700 Club,
where she is the fashion and nutrition correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   If she hadn't moved from modeling to speaking roles, she says,
she either would be retired from the business or doing catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   No nips or tucks or lifts for her, no surgical anti-aging magic.
She doesn't even diet. `` `Diet' is a stupid word _ no one knows
what it means anymore,'' she says. Because she is allergic to
anything made with wheat, though, she eats carefully. Veggies, eggs
and meat, lots of salad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sparkle in my eyes is from the inside,'' Alexis says, and
she doesn't mean that to be sappy.
</P>
<P>
   Modeling, it turns out, was a fine way to make a living. Alexis
would love to land the cover of Vogue again, but if she asked, she
says, ``they'd laugh at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall, ``All-American'' blondes have given way to models with
what she calls a ``peculiar'' look. Quirky is in.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she's 38 and a size 10. As always, incredibly young and
incredibly thin is in, too.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis says the young models today are not as . . . she pauses,
then comes up with three words: trained, responsible, and
conscientious. ``They expect to be paid and don't expect to work as
much,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Example _ if I were modeling today, I would be standing
instead of sitting now, so I wouldn't be wrinkling the pants. These
girls are all over the place, goofing up their hairdos. They're not
as self-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   She was raised to be responsible, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there anything she's done that she wouldn't want her kids
doing? Hmmm, she can't think. In high school in upstate New York,
when she wasn't swimming or marching in the band, she even asked
for extra homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' she says, finally, ``maybe I would say, `Don't go to New
York City at age 18.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Too late, perhaps. Her oldest son, Jamie, 12, recently was
``discovered'' by a talent scout. He has not yet started modeling,
Alexis says.
</P>
<P>
   But Mom is looking for agencies now. As usual, she'll carry her
Bible with her.

   Q: It was reported recently that England's Royal Mint had
introduced a coin in memory of Princess Diana, with her portrait on
one side and the image of Queen Elizabeth II on the other. How can
I obtain one?
</P>
<P>
   A: The memorial coin, introduced in London Jan. 5, is available
now in cupro-nickel, with gold and silver proof coins to follow
later in the spring. The commemorative, with a portrait of Diana in
profile on one side and the standard image of Queen Elizabeth II on
the other, is about the size of a silver dollar. The initial
version costs $14.95, plus $4.95 for postage and handing. The price
of the silver and golf proof coins will be announced later. In the
United States, orders and inquiries should be addressed to the
British Royal Mint, Cheyenne, WY 82008-0031. For information, call
1-800-221-1215.
</P>
<P>
   Each coin is packaged with a selection of photographs of the
princess and printed quotes from Queen Elizabeth and Earl Spencer,
Diana's brother. Beginning July 1, the cupro-nickel BU (Brilliant
Uncirculated) memorial coin will be available from banks and post
offices in the United Kingdom at its face value of five pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can a man who says he speaks no English and is not a U.S.
citizen receive a summons to become a juror?
</P>
<P>
   A: Names of potential jurors are obtained from several sources,
and they don't deal with the person's language ability. But jurors
must be U.S. citizens, so non-citizens who receive a summons need
to respond to the court, indicating their non-citizen status, which
makes them not qualified to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can we bid on the O.J. Simpson items that will be
auctioned in Los Angeles?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absentee bidders will be able to purchase a catalog for $10
describing items contained in the 75 lots of sports memorabilia,
furniture and decorative arts, rugs and paintings seized by court
order from Simpson's residence. The catalog just went to the
printer, Butterfield spokesman Levi Morgan told Q&AMP;A, and is
expected to be ready Jan. 25-26. It will have the complete
inventory, so potential bidders will be able to select items of
interest and submit absentee bids by fax or phone. Catalogs can be
ordered by calling 1-800-223-2854 (extension 525) or via the
auction house's Web site (http://www.butterfields.com). Morgan said
more than 60 percent of Butterfield's buyers make absentee bids
instead of attending auctions in person at the firm's galleries in
Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The property will be available for public preview 9 a.m.-5 p.m.
Feb. 12 at the Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield gallery, 7601 Sunset
Blvd., Los Angeles, with items offered to highest bidders starting
at 6 p.m. (local time) Feb. 16. The property, consigned for sale by
attorney Michael Myers, the State Court receiver, is to be sold on
behalf of the families of Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson,
and Ronald Goldman, both murdered in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Included among the auction items are about 90 of Simpson's
sports trophies, including his 1968 Heisman Trophy, as well as
several Tiffany style lamps, Asian furniture, and a painting,
``Picasso Girl,'' by former disco diva Donna Summer.

<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that U.S. planes returned to the
aircraft carrier Carl Vinson after carrying out a raid against
Iraq. Who is or was Carl Vinson, and why is an aircraft carrier
named after him?
</P>
<P>
   A: The USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70, nicknamed ``The Gold Eagle,''),
the third Nimitz-class aircraft carrier to be commissioned, is part
of the Navy's Pacific fleet. Vinson (Nov. 18, 1883-June 1, 1981), a
Democrat, served two terms in the Georgia House of Representatives
and in 1914 won a race for a vacant seat in the U.S. House of
Representatives. He served in Congress from Nov. 3, 1914, to Jan.
3, 1965. In the House, he was chairman of the Armed Services
Committee 1949-53 and again 1955-65. During the 1930s, Vinson,
grand-uncle of former Sen. Sam Nunn, advocated a substantial
strengthening of the Navy. Believing that peace depended upon a
strong military posture, in 1950 Vinson criticized defense
reductions proposed by Defense Secretary Louis Johnson. During the
Eisenhower administration, Vinson opposed the doctrine of massive
retaliation relying on nuclear weapons, and emphasized instead the
importance of maintaining a strong conventional force capable of
dealing with less than total war.

<P>
   Q: How can we determine how long food products will be safe to
consume? With the year 2000 coming up and Y2K problems expected,
many people will be stocking up on supplies.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not a food-safety issue, said nutritionist Chris
Rosenbloom, professor at Georgia State University and spokeswoman
for the American Dietetic Association. To assure optimal quality,
look for canned goods with a ``best if used by'' date on the label
or can. Most canned foods are safe for one year, she added, and
their shelf life can be assured by storing in a cool, clean and
dark pantry or cupboard.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen foods stay good for four months to 12 months, depending
on the type of food. A whole cut of meat, for example, lasts longer
than something that has been cut up. The foods should be frozen in
their original packaging, because commercial packaging usually is
air-tight, Rosenbloom added. Items such as non-fat dry milk also
can be stored, because all you do is add water when you need it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a billboard saying the rock group Hole is up for a
Grammy award. Can you print some background information about them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's the scoop, excerpted from The New Rolling Stone
Encyclopedia of Rock &AMP; Roll. Hole was formed in Los Angeles in 1990
by Courney Love. By the time she formed the group with Eric
Erlandson, Love already had appeared as a vocalist in San Francisco
in an early incarnation of Faith No More and the all-female band
Sugar Baby Doll.
</P>
<P>
   Hole began garnering attention with live performances and two
early singles, ``Dicknail'' and ``Retard Girl,'' and English tours
and the two recordings made Hole the darling of the United Kingdom
music press. Things slowed down during Love's courtship and
eventual marriage, in 1992, to Nirvana's Kurt Cobain. In 1994,
Cobain was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, at the
same time Love's album ``Live Through This'' (with Erlandson, Patty
Schemel and Kristen Pfaff) was winning rave reviews. After bassist
Pfaff overdosed on heroin in 1994, Love enlisted Canadian bassist
Melissa Auf Der Maur.
</P>
<P>
   Love's ``Celebrity Skin'' is up for three Grammies, including
rock album.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend told me that Atlanta is second only to Denver in
elevation among major U.S. cities. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Several cities with sizable populations are higher. Here
are some examples, with populations based on July 1996 Census
Bureau estimates, and elevations: Denver, 497,840 (5,260 feet);
Albuquerque, N.M., 419,681 (4,955 feet); El Paso, Texas, 599,865
(3,695 feet); Tucson, Ariz., 449,002 (2,390 feet); Las Vegas,
376,906 (2,000 feet); Oklahoma City, 469,852 (1,195 feet); Phoenix,
1,159,014 (1,090 feet); and Atlanta, 401,907 (1,050 feet).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the FBI still have people in North Carolina searching
for Eric Robert Rudolph?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Most certainly we do,'' said FBI spokeswoman Celestine
Armstead. ``There likely will be a presence there until Rudolph is
captured.'' The Southeast Bomb Task Force is made up of agents from
the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; and Georgia
Bureau of Investigation, she added. Rudolph has been charged with
the fatal bombing at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park July 27,
1996; the double bombings at the Sandy Springs, Ga., Professional
Building Jan. 16, 1997; the double bombings at Atlanta's Otherside
Lounge Feb. 21, 1997; and the bombing of the New Woman All Women
Health Care Clinic in Birmingham, Ala., Jan. 29, 1998, killing
Birmingham police officer Robert Sanderson and severely injuring
Emily Lyons, the clinic's head nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the ``super collider'' that was in the
news several years ago? Were any significant developments
attributed to it, or was the project scrapped?
</P>
<P>
   A: The super-costly project collided with budget realities and
was stopped in its tracks, but only after $2 billion had been spent
on it. The Superconducting Supercollider (SCC), designed to allow
physicists to create and study high-speed collisions of atomic
particles, was approved by Congress in 1989 after the selection of
a site near Waxahachie, Texas. Its development was dogged by
construction delays and cost overruns, and many scientists had
questioned its practical value.
</P>
<P>
   Although the project survived several congressional attempts to
kill it, it finally bit the dust for good in 1993 when the House
voted to order House-Senate conferees to revise a bill attempting
to keep it alive and kill it for good. Under a conference-committee
agreement, the $640 million originally allocated to the SSC for
1994 was left in the energy bill to pay to shut down the project,
whose costs to complete by then had escalated to a predicted $4.4
billion. More than 14 miles of particle-collision tunnel and dozens
of other facilities had been built, but had to be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was reading your recent answer about the people in the
Taster's Choice commercials, it occurred to me that Michael, the
man across the hall, is none other than Giles on ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer.'' Can you confirm? Who are the other actors in the
now-canceled Taster's Choice romantic triangle?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right about the actor portraying Michael in the coffee
commercials. He is Anthony Stewart Head, who later would become
Rupert Giles, the mentor of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' Sharon
Maughan played the woman in the commercials and Trevor Eve was her
ex-husband. Maughan and Head are British stage performers who
played similar romantic parts in TV commercials for Gold Blend
coffee, a Nestle's brand sold in Britain. Eve, also British, played
a much heftier role in a two-part drama, ``The Politician's Wife,''
aired in 1996 by Masterpiece Theater.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that political public opinion polls are conducted
by organizations that call people's homes on weekdays between 8
a.m. and 5 p.m.? Most working-class Americans wouldn't be home, so
it wouldn't be a fair cross-section.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Gallup Organization, which calls itself ``the world's
leading source for public opinion data since 1935,'' says its
polling hours are restricted to 5 p.m.- 9:50 p.m. weekdays, 10
a.m.-6 p.m. Saturdays, and 3 p.m.-9 p.m. Sundays. ``People who say
we call during daytime hours on weekdays are misinformed,'' said
Maura Strausberg, research librarian at Gallup's headquarters in
Princeton, N.J. She also said telephone numbers are computer-picked
at random, and people are not asked their political affiliation,
``so if people are upset with what the polls show, that means
they're upset with the American public.'' Gallup's procedures and
findings on political and other polls are consistent with those of
other polling organizations, Strausberg added.

<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported on donations to the American Red Cross
while Elizabeth Dole was its president. Is Hillary Rodham Clinton
still the spokeswoman for the Salvation Army? What were the total
contributions from the time she was appointed until now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton's role with the Salvation Army was not comparable to
that of Dole, president of the American Red Cross for eight years.
Clinton was spokeswoman only for the Salvation Army's 1994
Christmas campaign. It was a one-time fund-raising effort. In 1994,
the organization's Christmas kettle campaign raised about $65
million, about $1 million more than the previous season, said Army
spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Jones. Several previous first ladies,
including Eleanor Roosevelt and Barbara Bush, had been national
campaign chairpersons, as have nonpolitical figures such as Johnny
Carson. There was no national spokesperson this past holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm sure I read somewhere that there would be no leap year in
2000. I can't recall the reason. Can you advise me?
</P>
<P>
   A: Next yearwill be a leap year and will have a Feb. 29. As
explained in World Almanac 1999, a leap year occurs in every year
that can be evenly divided by four, except the years that mark the
even hundreds, such as 1500. The only century years that are leap
years are those that can be divided by 400, such as 1600 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell me about Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli? I
haven't been able to find out much about his developing career or
his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   A: Bocelli grew up among the vineyards and olive groves of his
family estate in Lajatico, a community in rural Tuscany near Pisa.
Visually impaired by glaucoma from birth, he was struck in the head
by a soccer ball at 12 and lost the remainder of his sight due to a
brain hemorrhage. He studied piano as a child, and learned to play
both flute and saxophone, at the same time developing a passion for
opera. He studied law at the University of Pisa, earning a law
degree in 1986. While in law school, he earned money by performing
in piano bars.
</P>
<P>
   After a year as a court-appointed defense attorney, Bocelli quit
and began studying voice with tenor Franco Corelli, continuing to
appear at piano bars to pay for lessons. In 1987, a student, Enrica
Cenzatti, walked in and fell in love ``first with his voice, then
with him,'' as she once told an interviewer. Married in 1992, they
have two sons.
</P>
<P>
   After winning an audition, Bocelli toured Europe in 1992 with
Italian rock star Zucchero Fornaciari. The next year Bocelli made
his first recording, and in 1994 he recorded his first album, which
went platinum in a matter of weeks. His 1996 single of ``Con te
Partiro'' (``Time to Say Goodbye'') broke sales records across
Europe, and was followed by ``Romanza'' (``Romance''), a collection
of ballads that topped charts worldwide. Earlier this month he was
nominated for a Grammy in the ``new artist'' category.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of insurance policy would President Clinton have
that would give him $475,000 to apply to the Paula Jones $850,000
settlement? Do we know the name of the insurance company?
</P>
<P>
   A: The company is Chubb Group Insurance, which had funded part
of Clinton's legal defense. Administration officials said $475,000
came from a Chubb policy against civil liability that Clinton
purchased years ago, before he was president. The policy is known
as a personal liability umbrella, an option often available on
standard homeowners' policies.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $375,000 of the Jones settlement came from a blind
trust containing investments for the president and Hillary Rodham
Clinton. That was personal money, most of it made by the first
lady, who has been the family's major breadwinner during the
president's 25-year political career.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw where Barbra Streisand will perform at the MGM Grand in
Las Vegas on New Year's Eve 1999. Do you have any information about
tickets?
</P>
<P>
   A: No information is available yet, according to the casino
hotel. Those interested are welcome to call 702-891-7488 later to
check, but at this time no reservations are being taken, and no
confirmation of anything is available, a spokeswoman for MGM Grand
VIP Casino Services told Q&AMP;A. She couldn't even provide a suggested
date when information might become available, but said people ``can
call as often as they wish.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard a quote that ``the sword of Damocles may hang over
Clinton's head.'' Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both Cicero and Horace tell the story of the flatterer
Damocles, a 5th century court follower of Dionysius I (405-367
B.C.), the Elder of Syracuse. Damocles annoyed Dionysius with his
constant references to the ruler's great power and consequent
happiness. Deciding to teach the sycophant the real perils of
power, he invited Damocles to a magnificent banquet, surrounding
him with luxuries that only a king could afford. Damocles enjoyed
the feast until he glanced up and saw a sword, suspended by a
single hair, pointing directly at his head, after he which he lay
there cowering, afraid to eat, speak or move.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson was that there always are threats of danger, fears
and worries that prevent the powerful from fully enjoying their
power. The ``sword of Damocles'' has become a symbol of those
fears.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When a vehicle is entering an Interstate highway from an
on-ramp, who has the right of way? I always understood that it was
the entering vehicle, unless signs state otherwise, but I don't
think a lot of drivers out there know this.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the responsibility of the driver coming down the ramp to
merge safely into traffic, said Pam Short of the Georgia Department
of Public Safety. To put it the other way, it is not the
responsibility of drivers already on the Interstate to let the
entering vehicles in. So, the traffic already on the highway has
the right of way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the U.N. resolution authorizing the United States to
establish the no-fly zone over northern and southern Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   A: After Iraq's 1991 loss in the Gulf War, Iraqi troops launched
a campaign of repression against Kurds, mostly in northern Iraq,
and other people opposed to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Those
actions were condemned by the United Nations Security Council in
U.N. Resolution 688, which ordered Iraq to end the repression. To
enforce the U.N. resolution, and to check the Iraqi military, the
United States and its Gulf War coalition partners told Iraq its
military aircraft would be shot down if they flew north of the 36th
parallel or south of the 32nd parallel. The southern boundary later
was raised to the 33rd parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the telecasts of pro football games, viewers could see an
imaginary line showing where the offense needed to go for the first
down. How is that done?
</P>
<P>
   A: L-VIS (Live Video Insertion System), developed by Princeton
(N.J.) Video Images, is described by the company as ``a system of
proprietary hardware and software designed to insert electronic
images into live televised broadcasts.'' The inserted images may be
two- or three-dimensional, static or animated, opaque or
semitransparent, and may be placed so they appear to exist on the
playing field. If a player or other object moves in front of an
inserted image, the L-VIS system is programmed so that the passing
object obscures that portion of the inserted image.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Epstein of Princeton Video Image told Q&AMP;A that
applications can be tailored to the market of specific TV
audiences. For example, an advertising image can be made to appear
on the wall of a stadium behind a pitcher, let's say in a game
between the San Francisco Giants and the San Diego Padres. People
at the ballpark may see a blank wall; TV viewers in San Diego will
see an advertisement from a company targeting them; and TV viewers
in San Francisco may see yet another image tailored specifically
for them. Before the broadcast, the images to be inserted _ such as
the first-down line _ are prepared and the operator identifies the
location in the broadcast scene where they will be inserted. The
L-VIS system recognizes the scene in ``real time'' during the
broadcast and inserts the image as instructed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is NBC's Tom Brokaw's professional and educational
background?
</P>
<P>
   A: He started at KMTV in Omaha, Neb., where he was morning news
editor in 1962-65. In 1965-66, he was a news editor and anchor of
the 11 p.m. nightly news broadcast at WSB-TV in Atlanta. As
explained in Current Biography, since NBC didn't have a
network-staffed bureau in the South at that time, Brokaw also
contributed occasional reports on the burgeoning civil rights
movement to the network's ``Huntley-Brinkley Report.'' In 1966
Brokaw moved to the West Coast to become a reporter, and
subsequently anchor, of the late-night newscasts at KNBC-TV, the
network's owned-and-operated station in Los Angeles. In April 1971
he was chosen by NBC to anchor an edition of ``First Tuesday,''
NBC's monthly prime-time news magazine. In 1973 he became NBC's
White House correspondent, and in 1976 he took over as host of
``Today.'' In 1982 he became anchor and editor at ``NBC Nightly
News.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Thomas John Brokaw on Feb. 6, 1940, in Webster, S.D., he
graduated in 1962 with a degree in political science from the
University of South Dakota.

Clinton. That was personal money, most of it made by the first
lady, who has been the family's major breadwinner during the
president's 25-year political career.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw where Barbra Streisand will perform at the MGM Grand in
Las Vegas on New Year's Eve 1999. Do you have any information about
tickets?
</P>
<P>
   A: No information is available yet, according to the casino
hotel. Those interested are welcome to call 702-891-7488 later to
check, but at this time no reservations are being taken, and no
confirmation of anything is available, a spokeswoman for MGM Grand
VIP Casino Services told Q&AMP;A. She couldn't even provide a suggested
date when information might become available, but said people ``can
call as often as they wish.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard a quote that ``the sword of Damocles may hang over
Clinton's head.'' Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both Cicero and Horace tell the story of the flatterer
Damocles, a 5th century court follower of Dionysius I (405-367
B.C.), the Elder of Syracuse. Damocles annoyed Dionysius with his
constant references to the ruler's great power and consequent
happiness. Deciding to teach the sycophant the real perils of
power, he invited Damocles to a magnificent banquet, surrounding
him with luxuries that only a king could afford. Damocles enjoyed
the feast until he glanced up and saw a sword, suspended by a
single hair, pointing directly at his head, after he which he lay
there cowering, afraid to eat, speak or move.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson was that there always are threats of danger, fears
and worries that prevent the powerful from fully enjoying their
power. The ``sword of Damocles'' has become a symbol of those
fears.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When a vehicle is entering an Interstate highway from an
on-ramp, who has the right of way? I always understood that it was
the entering vehicle, unless signs state otherwise, but I don't
think a lot of drivers out there know this.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the responsibility of the driver coming down the ramp to
merge safely into traffic, said Pam Short of the Georgia Department
of Public Safety. To put it the other way, it is not the
responsibility of drivers already on the Interstate to let the
entering vehicles in. So, the traffic already on the highway has
the right of way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the U.N. resolution authorizing the United States to
establish the no-fly zone over northern and southern Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   A: After Iraq's 1991 loss in the Gulf War, Iraqi troops launched
a campaign of repression against Kurds, mostly in northern Iraq,
and other people opposed to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Those
actions were condemned by the United Nations Security Council in
U.N. Resolution 688, which ordered Iraq to end the repression. To
enforce the U.N. resolution, and to check the Iraqi military, the
United States and its Gulf War coalition partners told Iraq its
military aircraft would be shot down if they flew north of the 36th
parallel or south of the 32nd parallel. The southern boundary later
was raised to the 33rd parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the telecasts of pro football games, viewers could see an
imaginary line showing where the offense needed to go for the first
down. How is that done?
</P>
<P>
   A: L-VIS (Live Video Insertion System), developed by Princeton
(N.J.) Video Images, is described by the company as ``a system of
proprietary hardware and software designed to insert electronic
images into live televised broadcasts.'' The inserted images may be
two- or three-dimensional, static or animated, opaque or
semitransparent, and may be placed so they appear to exist on the
playing field. If a player or other object moves in front of an
inserted image, the L-VIS system is programmed so that the passing
object obscures that portion of the inserted image.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Epstein of Princeton Video Image told Q&AMP;A that
applications can be tailored to the market of specific TV
audiences. For example, an advertising image can be made to appear
on the wall of a stadium behind a pitcher, let's say in a game
between the San Francisco Giants and the San Diego Padres. People
at the ballpark may see a blank wall; TV viewers in San Diego will
see an advertisement from a company targeting them; and TV viewers
in San Francisco may see yet another image tailored specifically
for them. Before the broadcast, the images to be inserted _ such as
the first-down line _ are prepared and the operator identifies the
location in the broadcast scene where they will be inserted. The
L-VIS system recognizes the scene in ``real time'' during the
broadcast and inserts the image as instructed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is NBC's Tom Brokaw's professional and educational
background?
</P>
<P>
   A: He started at KMTV in Omaha, Neb., where he was morning news
editor in 1962-65. In 1965-66, he was a news editor and anchor of
the 11 p.m. nightly news broadcast at WSB-TV in Atlanta. As
explained in Current Biography, since NBC didn't have a
network-staffed bureau in the South at that time, Brokaw also
contributed occasional reports on the burgeoning civil rights
movement to the network's ``Huntley-Brinkley Report.'' In 1966
Brokaw moved to the West Coast to become a reporter, and
subsequently anchor, of the late-night newscasts at KNBC-TV, the
network's owned-and-operated station in Los Angeles. In April 1971
he was chosen by NBC to anchor an edition of ``First Tuesday,''
NBC's monthly prime-time news magazine. In 1973 he became NBC's
White House correspondent, and in 1976 he took over as host of
``Today.'' In 1982 he became anchor and editor at ``NBC Nightly
News.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Thomas John Brokaw on Feb. 6, 1940, in Webster, S.D., he
graduated in 1962 with a degree in political science from the
University of South Dakota.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ Take One.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or E-mail
him at q&AMP;(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that England's Royal Mint had
introduced a coin in memory of Princess Diana, with her portrait on
one side and the image of Queen Elizabeth II on the other. How can
I obtain one?
</P>
<P>
   A: The memorial coin, introduced in London Jan. 5, is available
now in cupro-nickel, with gold and silver proof coins to follow
later in the spring. The commemorative, with a portrait of Diana in
profile on one side and the standard image of Queen Elizabeth II on
the other, is about the size of a silver dollar. The initial
version costs $14.95, plus $4.95 for postage and handing. The price
of the silver and golf proof coins will be announced later. In the
United States, orders and inquiries should be addressed to the
British Royal Mint, Cheyenne, WY 82008-0031. For information, call
1-800-221-1215.
</P>
<P>
   Each coin is packaged with a selection of photographs of the
princess and printed quotes from Queen Elizabeth and Earl Spencer,
Diana's brother. Beginning July 1, the cupro-nickel BU (Brilliant
Uncirculated) memorial coin will be available from banks and post
offices in the United Kingdom at its face value of five pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can a man who says he speaks no English and is not a U.S.
citizen receive a summons to become a juror?
</P>
<P>
   A: Names of potential jurors are obtained from several sources,
and they don't deal with the person's language ability. But jurors
must be U.S. citizens, so non-citizens who receive a summons need
to respond to the court, indicating their non-citizen status, which
makes them not qualified to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can we bid on the O.J. Simpson items that will be
auctioned in Los Angeles?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absentee bidders will be able to purchase a catalog for $10
describing items contained in the 75 lots of sports memorabilia,
furniture and decorative arts, rugs and paintings seized by court
order from Simpson's residence. The catalog just went to the
printer, Butterfield spokesman Levi Morgan told Q&AMP;A, and is
expected to be ready Jan. 25-26. It will have the complete
inventory, so potential bidders will be able to select items of
interest and submit absentee bids by fax or phone. Catalogs can be
ordered by calling 1-800-223-2854 (extension 525) or via the
auction house's Web site (http://www.butterfields.com). Morgan said
more than 60 percent of Butterfield's buyers make absentee bids
instead of attending auctions in person at the firm's galleries in
Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The property will be available for public preview 9 a.m.-5 p.m.
Feb. 12 at the Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield gallery, 7601 Sunset
Blvd., Los Angeles, with items offered to highest bidders starting
at 6 p.m. (local time) Feb. 16. The property, consigned for sale by
attorney Michael Myers, the State Court receiver, is to be sold on
behalf of the families of Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson,
and Ronald Goldman, both murdered in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Included among the auction items are about 90 of Simpson's
sports trophies, including his 1968 Heisman Trophy, as well as
several Tiffany style lamps, Asian furniture, and a painting,
``Picasso Girl,'' by former disco diva Donna Summer.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, 323-850-5843.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that U.S. planes returned to the
aircraft carrier Carl Vinson after carrying out a raid against
Iraq. Who is or was Carl Vinson, and why is an aircraft carrier
named after him?
</P>
<P>
   A: The USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70, nicknamed ``The Gold Eagle,''),
the third Nimitz-class aircraft carrier to be commissioned, is part
of the Navy's Pacific fleet. Vinson (Nov. 18, 1883-June 1, 1981), a
Democrat, served two terms in the Georgia House of Representatives
and in 1914 won a race for a vacant seat in the U.S. House of
Representatives. He served in Congress from Nov. 3, 1914, to Jan.
3, 1965. In the House, he was chairman of the Armed Services
Committee 1949-53 and again 1955-65. During the 1930s, Vinson,
grand-uncle of former Sen. Sam Nunn, advocated a substantial
strengthening of the Navy. Believing that peace depended upon a
strong military posture, in 1950 Vinson criticized defense
reductions proposed by Defense Secretary Louis Johnson. During the
Eisenhower administration, Vinson opposed the doctrine of massive
retaliation relying on nuclear weapons, and emphasized instead the
importance of maintaining a strong conventional force capable of
dealing with less than total war.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can we determine how long food products will be safe to
consume? With the year 2000 coming up and Y2K problems expected,
many people will be stocking up on supplies.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not a food-safety issue, said nutritionist Chris
Rosenbloom, professor at Georgia State University and spokeswoman
for the American Dietetic Association. To assure optimal quality,
look for canned goods with a ``best if used by'' date on the label
or can. Most canned foods are safe for one year, she added, and
their shelf life can be assured by storing in a cool, clean and
dark pantry or cupboard.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen foods stay good for four months to 12 months, depending
on the type of food. A whole cut of meat, for example, lasts longer
than something that has been cut up. The foods should be frozen in
their original packaging, because commercial packaging usually is
air-tight, Rosenbloom added. Items such as non-fat dry milk also
can be stored, because all you do is add water when you need it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a billboard saying the rock group Hole is up for a
Grammy award. Can you print some background information about them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's the scoop, excerpted from The New Rolling Stone
Encyclopedia of Rock &AMP; Roll. Hole was formed in Los Angeles in 1990
by Courney Love. By the time she formed the group with Eric
Erlandson, Love already had appeared as a vocalist in San Francisco
in an early incarnation of Faith No More and the all-female band
Sugar Baby Doll.
</P>
<P>
   Hole began garnering attention with live performances and two
early singles, ``Dicknail'' and ``Retard Girl,'' and English tours
and the two recordings made Hole the darling of the United Kingdom
music press. Things slowed down during Love's courtship and
eventual marriage, in 1992, to Nirvana's Kurt Cobain. In 1994,
Cobain was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, at the
same time Love's album ``Live Through This'' (with Erlandson, Patty
Schemel and Kristen Pfaff) was winning rave reviews. After bassist
Pfaff overdosed on heroin in 1994, Love enlisted Canadian bassist
Melissa Auf Der Maur.
</P>
<P>
   Love's ``Celebrity Skin'' is up for three Grammies, including
rock album.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend told me that Atlanta is second only to Denver in
elevation among major U.S. cities. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Several cities with sizable populations are higher. Here
are some examples, with populations based on July 1996 Census
Bureau estimates, and elevations: Denver, 497,840 (5,260 feet);
Albuquerque, N.M., 419,681 (4,955 feet); El Paso, Texas, 599,865
(3,695 feet); Tucson, Ariz., 449,002 (2,390 feet); Las Vegas,
376,906 (2,000 feet); Oklahoma City, 469,852 (1,195 feet); Phoenix,
1,159,014 (1,090 feet); and Atlanta, 401,907 (1,050 feet).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the FBI still have people in North Carolina searching
for Eric Robert Rudolph?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Most certainly we do,'' said FBI spokeswoman Celestine
Armstead. ``There likely will be a presence there until Rudolph is
captured.'' The Southeast Bomb Task Force is made up of agents from
the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; and Georgia
Bureau of Investigation, she added. Rudolph has been charged with
the fatal bombing at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park July 27,
1996; the double bombings at the Sandy Springs, Ga., Professional
Building Jan. 16, 1997; the double bombings at Atlanta's Otherside
Lounge Feb. 21, 1997; and the bombing of the New Woman All Women
Health Care Clinic in Birmingham, Ala., Jan. 29, 1998, killing
Birmingham police officer Robert Sanderson and severely injuring
Emily Lyons, the clinic's head nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the ``super collider'' that was in the
news several years ago? Were any significant developments
attributed to it, or was the project scrapped?
</P>
<P>
   A: The super-costly project collided with budget realities and
was stopped in its tracks, but only after $2 billion had been spent
on it. The Superconducting Supercollider (SCC), designed to allow
physicists to create and study high-speed collisions of atomic
particles, was approved by Congress in 1989 after the selection of
a site near Waxahachie, Texas. Its development was dogged by
construction delays and cost overruns, and many scientists had
questioned its practical value.
</P>
<P>
   Although the project survived several congressional attempts to
kill it, it finally bit the dust for good in 1993 when the House
voted to order House-Senate conferees to revise a bill attempting
to keep it alive and kill it for good. Under a conference-committee
agreement, the $640 million originally allocated to the SSC for
1994 was left in the energy bill to pay to shut down the project,
whose costs to complete by then had escalated to a predicted $4.4
billion. More than 14 miles of particle-collision tunnel and dozens
of other facilities had been built, but had to be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was reading your recent answer about the people in the
Taster's Choice commercials, it occurred to me that Michael, the
man across the hall, is none other than Giles on ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer.'' Can you confirm? Who are the other actors in the
now-canceled Taster's Choice romantic triangle?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right about the actor portraying Michael in the coffee
commercials. He is Anthony Stewart Head, who later would become
Rupert Giles, the mentor of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' Sharon
Maughan played the woman in the commercials and Trevor Eve was her
ex-husband. Maughan and Head are British stage performers who
played similar romantic parts in TV commercials for Gold Blend
coffee, a Nestle's brand sold in Britain. Eve, also British, played
a much heftier role in a two-part drama, ``The Politician's Wife,''
aired in 1996 by Masterpiece Theater.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Headline here
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas Lawyer jokes ... You like 'em, I like 'em, grandma
likes 'em, everybody likes lawyer jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one I bet you haven't heard, though it's been around for
some 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Lee Thompson, having gone to school on the GI-Bill after
serving in World War II, had finally gotten his law degree,
returned home to Lufkin and hung out his shingle, eager for
business.
</P>
<P>
   Business, at it turned out, wasn't so eager for him. Days passed
into weeks, weeks into months while Billy Lee lived day to day,
hand to mouth, trying to support his young family.
</P>
<P>
   His friend and colleague, Clark Anderson, sought to reassure him
that the business would come, just give it time. This very day,
Clark would say, might be the day when the kind of lawsuit a lawyer
dreams of comes your way.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Billy Lee put much stock in what his friend said. Clark
was a good lawyer, but more than the law, Clark enjoyed a good
time. The secret to a happy life, he'd tell you, was to be happy.
</P>
<P>
   But, 'lo and behold, there came a day when a letter arrived in
Billy Lee's mail that promised exactly what Clark had predicted the
kind of lawsuit a lawyer dreams of.
</P>
<P>
   Scratched out in pencil on notebook paper, it read something
like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Lee Billy,
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard from our cousin that you have made a lawyer. I want
you know how proud I am. I always knew you would do good. You come
from fine folks, your mother especially.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you are busy being an important lawyer at the county
seat, but I hope you can find it in your heart to help me with this
terrible thing that has happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few months back, one of the company trucks ran over me while
I was walking past the mill on my way to Wednesday night prayer
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver was drunk, like he always is half the time.
Everybody had been telling the company they ought to fire him
before something like this happened, but they wouldn't listen. I
don't know why, but some people say it's because he is a nephew of
the owner's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upshot is, I am hurt bad in my back so that I can't hardly
get around. The company wants me to take some cash they've offered
but it doesn't seem like very much for how bad hurt I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much left, except those the medals I brought back
from the war. I am hoping you can advise me on what to do. I am
afraid they are trying to take advantage of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still live in the same place, behind the school. You can
find it easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truly yours,
</P>
<P>
   ``Cousin John.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.S. Remember me to your dear mother.''
</P>
<P>
   No return address, no telephone number. The postmark indicated a
rural area that covered much of the south end of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Lee searched his memory for a clue as to Cousin John's
identity. He asked friends and family, and though some had a vague
recollection, nobody could recall for sure a Cousin John.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Lee took it on himself to find Cousin John, leaving the
office for days at time, when he should have been working on deeds
and wills, driving the farm roads of the county, searching for that
house behind that school, wherever it was.
</P>
<P>
   It was several weeks later that the second letter arrived:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Lee Billy,
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought by now I would have heard something from you. I know
you must be busy but I need help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company lawyer is nagging me to sign a paper and take
their deal. I don't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``My back is getting worse, and the medicine the doctor
prescribed is awfully expensive. I am here almost all the time.
Please contact me soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truly yours,
</P>
<P>
   ``Cousin John.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Lee searched the south part of the county, the north part
of the county, the river roads and pig trails, but no Cousin John.
He was losing sleep over it and, worse, knew that he was about to
lose the chance of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   He could think of little else, night and day, even at parties
when members of the county bar association got together for no
other reason than to celebrate being lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   There Billy Lee stood, a cold drink in his hand, wondering if
he'd ever hear from Cousin John again, when Clark eased up behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Slapping him on the back, Clark inquired, ``How you doing, Lee
Billy?''
</P>
<P>
   So it was, all those years ago, when lawyer jokes were the jokes
lawyers played on each other.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Billy Lee and Clark are now lawyers in heaven where, I
imagine, Clark is having a good time and Billy Lee is still trying
to get even.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ I've never analyzed nuisance calls from
telemarketers with a stopwatch. My method to prevent telephone
salesmen from invading my privacy with their relentless sales
pitches is to allow my answering machine to pick up telephone
calls. Very few telemarketers will leave a message on an answering
machine. They just dial some another poor sap's telephone. They
play the odds. Eventually, someone will answer and present the
opportunity for money to flow into the caller's bank account.

his incessant focus on himself. (Matthews, Atlanta Journal).

<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ I've never analyzed nuisance calls from
telemarketers with a stopwatch. My method to prevent telephone
salesmen from invading my privacy with their relentless sales
pitches is to allow my answering machine to pick up telephone
calls. Very few telemarketers will leave a message on an answering
machine. They just dial some another poor sap's telephone. They
play the odds. Eventually, someone will answer and present the
opportunity for money to flow into the caller's bank account.
(Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco Tribune-Herald)

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ It was the editors' idea that I
attend the George W. Bush Inaugural Ball for people 35 and under.
My bosses think it's funny to send an old, limping, sore,
gray-headed columnist such as myself to the young people's affair
to see if they'll actually let me in. Of course, they let me into
the Young Texans Ball. The Republicans sold me a ticket for $40 to
get in, just like they did to everybody else. What do they care how
old I am? All they wanted was my money. (Kelso, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED TUESDAY.

   SOUTH-JEWS _ She saw Halley's Comet, crawling out of bed at 3
a.m. on May 16, 1910, worried about ``what will happen to us when
we pass through its tail.'' She was horrified when Leo Frank, a
friend and her husband's first cousin, was lynched in 1915 within
20 miles of her Atlanta home on Washington Street by an
anti-Semitic mob. She was ``shocked'' when the Titanic went down,
but ``thrilled'' by the countless ``acts of self-sacrifice'' of
doomed men ``standing bravely, calmly, even gaily'' as they helped
women and children fill the lifeboats. She gave refuge to refuge to
a family of African-Americans during bloody race riots here in 1906
in which 10 blacks and two whites were killed. She sent her three
Jewish brothers - one with the unlikely nickname of Bubba - off to
fight in World War I, tried to ignore the latent and blatent
anti-Semitism of early 20th century Atlanta. Helen Jacobus Apte,
born in Hawkinsville in 1886, was an ``ordinary'' Atlanta
housewife, fiercely proud of being Jewish and a southerner, who
faithfully recorded the history of the city, and the world, in a
diary she kept from her marriage in 1909 until her death in 1946.
Found by chance in 1995, her elegantly-written words have just been
published in a new book, ``Heart of a Wife: The Diary of a Southern
Jewish Woman,'' that records in detail most important events that
occurred over some four decades. (Hendrick, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 45. WITH ILLUSTRATION and PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   FEMINISTS _ The feminist movement sold women the wrong bill of
goods, making women believe they could postpone marriage and
children to concentrate on their careers. But now the daughters of
women who followed those rules are realizing they can't have it
all, says Diane Crittenden. She urges women to get married young,
have children early and put family over career. Crittenden, 35, is
editor of Women's Quarterly, a conservative newsletter, and her new
book is ``What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us.'' (Hill, Atlanta
Journal-Cnstitution). 20-25. WITH PHOTOS.

<P>
   RENOIR _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Pierre-Auguste Renoir is one of
the world's great painters. Al Hirschfeld is one of the century's
great caricaturists. Masters in different fields, their work
celebrates life. Renoir died in 1916 at 78, after creating about
6,000 paintings. He never stopped working despite crippling
arthritis. At 95, Hirschfeld continues to produce his lively
drawings of show-biz personalities for The New York Times. There's
another connection between these two different artists _ both have
shows in Boca Raton. (Schwan, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TRACE-ADKINS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In John Wayne-speak,
country singer Trace Adkins is one tough hombre. Consider that the
6-foot-6, 37-year-old Louisiana native has weathered a hurricane
while working on an offshore oil rig. He's survived two near-fatal
car accidents _ his nose had to be sewed back on after one of
those. He lopped off his left pinkie once while opening an oil
barrel and told doctors to sew it back on at an angle so he could
still play guitar. A bulldozer nearly cut off his legs. And an
ex-wife once shot him through the heart. All of which adds gravity
when he says that his next album, due out later this year, is ``do
or die'' for his career. Do or die for a guy who's almost bought
the farm so many times? Sounds serious. (Houck, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.

<P>
   LAST-WEIGHTPLAN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Cynthia Last was
disgusted with her obesity. A teenager struggling with self-worth,
she vowed not to let her looks define her. ``I figured my best
chance of finding success was by developing my intellect,'' she
writes in her new book, The 5 Reasons Why We Overeat: How to
Develop a Long-Term Weight Control Plan That's Right for You
($19.95, Birch Lane Press.) She dissolved from a size 11 to a size
5, a weight loss she's maintained for 20 years. (Susman, Palm Beach

   BLACKWOMEN-WANT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Looks didn't even make

<P>
   KIM-ALEXIS _ DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ At first, former supermodel
Kim Alexis is so perfect, so distressingly polished, that you want
to shake her until her teeth (never a cavity!) rattle like a
handful of dice. It's not her fault, really. She just keeps saying
these things in that calm, pleasant, TV-ready voice. Things like,
``I was a great kid. I can't imagine that I did much wrong.'' And
``My morning routine takes about two minutes.'' (Anna, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.

   HUMMEL-MUSEUM _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Inside a vault that guards a
trove of loaned artwork sits a portrait of the artist as a young
nun. The black and white photograph of a smiling Sister Maria
Innocentia _ her hands neatly tucked in the sleeves of her habit _
stands out against the vault's white walls and the stacks of
cardboard boxes that hold her drawings. The German nun, born Berta
Hummel, is internationally recognized as the artist whose drawings
captured tender moments of children at play. She also is the
namesake of the Hummel Museum _ a source of civic pride in this
city whose heritage is distinctly German. Now, a little more than
six years after it opened, the Hummel Museum has hit hard times.

   FBN-49ERS (San Francisco) _ There is nothing new about Bill

to say about him. None of which is his fault, necessarily. By RAY

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Duncan Watts was pursuing his Ph.D., his adviser was Steven
Strogatz, who has written scientific papers with Rennie Mirollo,
who was a teaching assistant for Steve Maurer, whose mother used to
live down the hall from my Grandma Rose in a high-rise in
Hackensack, N.J. Small world, right?
</P>
<P>
   Such coincidences crop up a lot. According to cocktail-party
lore, every pair of people on the planet _ a randomly chosen Inuit
and a Parisian, a Solomon Islander and a dude from Nebraska _ are
connected by a chain of at most six acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   I personally, to drop only a few names, am two steps from Prince
Charles and Stephen Hawking, three steps from Marilyn Monroe and
King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, four steps from King Juan Carlos of
Spain, and close friends with the brother of a childhood buddy of
the crown prince of Holland. And chances are you too have similar
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Strogatz and Watts study ``small worlds'' _ networks that
consist of lots of little cliques, but in which a few members of
each clique have connections to other, more distant parts of the
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small-world effect is not just a curiosity about social
networks,'' says Strogatz, an applied mathematician at Cornell.
``It occurs in many different kinds of networks throughout nature
and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The small-world effect could have a lot to do with how diseases
like AIDS spread, for example: The idea that everyone is at most
six degrees apart takes on a sinister significance when we look for
shared sexual partners instead of shared acquaintances. It could
also explain how rumors spread, says Watts, who is now a
post-doctoral fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematically minded people, Strogatz explains, often approach
the small-world question with a simple calculation: Suppose I have
100 friends, each of whom also has 100 friends. A hundred times 100
makes 10,000 friends of my friends. If each of those 10,000 people
has 100 friends, there will be 1 million people three degrees away
from me. Five steps away, there are 10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a lot of people would say it's not surprising that the
degree of separation is small,'' concludes Strogatz, ``because
within five steps you've done the whole planet.''
</P>
<P>
   But that calculation presumes that each 100 friends are 100 new
people. In the real world many of one's friends know each other.
And it's easy to imagine a very exclusive clique of 100 people in
Greenwich, Conn., say, who know only one another and wouldn't dream
of associating with anyone outside their circle. Conceivably, no
chain of acquaintances connects you or me with any member of that
clique.
</P>
<P>
   ``So how do you even begin to think about these sorts of
networks?'' Watts asks.
</P>
<P>
   Watts and Strogatz began with a beautifully structured network
called a ring graph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of a lot of people standing in a circle holding hands,''
Watts says. ``Say there are a million people and you know 100 of
them. You know 50 people on your left and 50 people on your right,
and they are the only ones you can communicate with. What if you
want to get a message to person number 500,000 on the other side of
the circle _ how do you do that? Well, you shout the message to
your farthest friend, number 50 to your left side, and say, `Pass
it on.' The best they can do is shout to their 50th friend to the
left, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, there are 5,000 steps between pairs of people in
this world. And 5,000 degrees of separation, as Watts points out,
is an awful lot.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine the same million people standing in the same circle.
Each still has 100 friends. But instead of knowing only the 50
people to the left and the 50 to the right, everyone chooses
friends at random from the million people available. Now when he
and Strogatz calculate the average degree of separation between two
people, it comes out to about four.
</P>
<P>
   What happens between the orderly world and the random one? To
find out, Watts and Strogatz started with an orderly model and
carefully messed it up, making worlds that were progressively more
random. So instead of knowing the 50 people to your right and the
50 to your left, you might know the 50 to your right and 49 of the
50 to your left. But number 17 to your left is a stranger; instead
you're close friends with number 307,411.
</P>
<P>
   These new connections quickly bring the world closer together,
Watts says. In fact, it takes only a tiny number of rewirings _
less than 1 percent of the total connections _ to bring the average
degree of separation down from 5,000 to just over four, close to
the average degree of separation of a random world.
</P>
<P>
   How common are these small worlds in nature? Strogatz and Watts
began looking around for networks in which every connection was
known, allowing them to determine the shortest possible path
between any two points. Such networks were hard to find, but they
turned up three: the neural network of a nematode worm; the power
grid of the western United States; and the Hollywood graph, a
database of everyone who has ever acted in a feature film. People
use this very database _ available on the Web at
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/(TILDE)bct7m/
</P>
<P>
   bacon.html _ to play a game called Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,
tracing connections between the ``Footloose'' thespian and other
Hollywood luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Although Watts and Strogatz chose those three examples because
they were the only networks they could find in which all the
connections were known, all turned out to be small worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this as widespread a phenomenon as we guess it is?''
Strogatz asks. ``I would look forward in the future to work by,
say, neurologists mapping out brain networks or other nervous
systems. The people who study ecology could study food webs _ which
organisms are eating each other. In economics it would be
interesting to trace out networks of markets and consumers and
buyers and sellers. I'm sure there are people who are thinking
about network theory in economics and in finance _ it could be at
the level of whole nations interacting, or even just individual
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And chances are, you know someone who knows someone who knows
someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows those people.

   It was Christmas 1997, the peak of Hong Kong's bird flu crisis,
and Kennedy Shortridge, an Australian virologist who has called
Hong Kong home for almost 27 years, was in the Cheung Sha Wan
Wholesale Poultry Market with a team testing poultry for the avian
influenza virus designated A (H5N1).
</P>
<P>
   The previous spring, the virus had killed thousands of chickens
in farms bordering southern China. In May 1997 it killed a
3-year-old boy whose preschool had kept little chicks and
ducklings.

   Now this fluky virus was breaking out in humans again _ four
cases were confirmed in November, 13 in December. A third of the
victims were dying.
</P>
<P>
   Shortridge knew that the birds would have to go. So on Dec. 29,
the government slaughtered all the chickens in the markets and
farms, well over a million birds. No more human H5N1 cases.
</P>
<P>
   But what if H5N1 mutated into a form more at home in humans? Or
what if it joined in unholy matrimony with a human flu virus and
created viral offspring that spread easily _ flying from person to
person through coughs and sneezes?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Webster, a virologist at St. jude Children's Research
Hospital in Memphis, fears the result.

</P>
<P>
   Our world has been swept by three influenza pandemics in this
century. Virtually every person on Earth was infected with the
Spanish flu in 1918, and an estimated 30 million died.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian flu of 1957 killed about 70,000 Americans (figures for
the rest of the world are not known), and the Hong Kong flu of 1968
killed about 36,000.
</P>
<P>
   As far as we know, these flu pandemics, and the epidemics that
occur like aftershocks in between them, are caused by the influenza
virus' changeable nature: Epidemics result from genetic ``drift'' _
tiny mutations just large enough to let the virus slip by many
people's immune systems; pandemics, on the other hand, involve a
seismic ``shift'' _ gene substitutions so large they leave pretty
much everyone defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   Flu viruses belong to one of three families, designated
influenza A, B and C. Pandemics appear to be a specialty of type A
viruses (a group to which the Hong Kong chicken flu belongs).
</P>
<P>
   Like all flu viruses, they use single-stranded RNA as their
genetic material, and they make sloppy mistakes when they copy
themselves, so bit by bit the viruses change _ they drift from
their original form.
</P>
<P>
   But type A viruses are odd: Their RNA genome comes in eight
segments. If two different type A viruses infect the same cell at
once, they can shuffle their gene segments like cards in a deck.
</P>
<P>
   This reassortment can produce viral subtypes with combinations
of genetic material unlike any our immune systems are used to, with
genes that code for completely new H or N proteins, and maybe other
proteins as well.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, flu researchers were beginning to understand
that reassortment was behind the sudden shifts that underlie
pandemics. They were also beginning to accept that the donors of
the new, dangerous genes were probably animals.
</P>
<P>
   It had long been known that domestic pigs get the flu: Every
fall since 1918, pigs in the United States have come down with
classic swine flu, a gift of the virus H1N1, which is a relative of
the 1918 human virus.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong flu of 1968, however, had a hemagglutinin (a type
of protein) related to one found not in pigs but in birds.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of that pandemic, Webster became part of an
international surveillance team that would seek out the world's
wild flu reservoirs. By analyzing flu viruses in animals,
researchers hoped to trace the source of the genes that mingled
with human flu viruses to create such terrifyingly deadly strains.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s and early 1980s, Webster and his colleagues at
St. Jude amassed an impressive amount of evidence implicating birds
_ including ducks, geese, gulls and small shorebirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell,'' Webster says, ``you can find (influenza
viruses) wherever you look in migrating waterfowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterbirds are infected by the fecal-oral route. They pour out
huge quantities of virus in their feces. Surprisingly, the viruses
are passed from bird to bird but cause no disease at all.
</P>
<P>
   The genes of these bird viruses are at an apparent evolutionary
standstill _ so nicely adapted to their hosts that new mutations
offer no advantages and thus are not perpetuated.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger problems come when flu viruses get into domesticated
birds like chickens and turkeys _ species in which they are not so
well adapted _ and the evolutionary brakes are taken off. The
viruses make their new hosts sick, the hosts' immune systems
respond, and the viruses mutate to avoid the immune systems. They
may even kill their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   There had already been evidence that the 1957 and 1968 flu
pandemics were caused by human viruses that had substituted avian
genes _ probably from waterfowl _ for some of their own. Yet
catching flu from pigs seemed more likely.
</P>
<P>
   While humans don't carry receptors for bird flu on their cells,
pigs do. The going theory was that flu viruses might reassert more
easily, and become more compatible with humans, if they mixed in an
intermediate host like a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Pigs on farms in Asia (where both the 1957 and 1968 pandemics
originated) are often kept close to ducks and chickens. And pigs
have receptors in their snouts not just for their own swine virus
but for bird and human viruses as well.
</P>
<P>
   So, potentially, a pig could snort up a bird virus in infected
droppings or water, inhale a human virus spread by a coughing
farmer, and become a mixing vessel for the two. The viral progeny
might then infect humans nearby.
</P>
<P>
   What the Hong Kong outbreak has now demonstrated is that a
direct hop from birds to humans is absolutely possible. Maybe pigs
aren't as crucial as was thought. Yet, for now, the
pig-as-mixing-vessel theory is still seductive.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, researchers are catching their breath, immensely
relieved that H5N1 was nipped in the bud. But Webster feels that
another hop from birds to humans will occur in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong outbreak, he adds, ``served as a warning of what
could happen. It was a killer _ like 1918 on its way.''

   It was Christmas 1997, the peak of Hong Kong's bird flu crisis,
and Kennedy Shortridge, an Australian virologist who has called
Hong Kong home for almost 27 years, was in the Cheung Sha Wan
Wholesale Poultry Market with a team testing poultry for the avian
influenza virus designated A (H5N1).
</P>
<P>
   The previous spring, the virus had killed thousands of chickens
in farms bordering southern China. In May 1997 it killed a
3-year-old boy whose preschool had kept little chicks and
ducklings.

<P>
   Now this fluky virus was breaking out in humans again _ four

   When Duncan Watts was pursuing his Ph.D., his adviser was Steven
Strogatz, who has written scientific papers with Rennie Mirollo,
who was a teaching assistant for Steve Maurer, whose mother used to
live down the hall from my Grandma Rose in a high-rise in
Hackensack, N.J. Small world, right?
</P>
<P>
   Such coincidences crop up a lot. According to cocktail-party
lore, every pair of people on the planet _ a randomly chosen Inuit
and a Parisian, a Solomon Islander and a dude from Nebraska _ are
connected by a chain of at most six acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   I personally, to drop only a few names, am two steps from Prince
Charles and Stephen Hawking, three steps from Marilyn Monroe and
King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, four steps from King Juan Carlos of
Spain, and close friends with the brother of a childhood buddy of
the crown prince of Holland. And chances are you too have similar
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Strogatz and Watts study ``small worlds'' _ networks that
consist of lots of little cliques, but in which a few members of
each clique have connections to other, more distant parts of the
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small-world effect is not just a curiosity about social
networks,'' says Strogatz, an applied mathematician at Cornell.
``It occurs in many different kinds of networks throughout nature
and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The small-world effect could have a lot to do with how diseases
like AIDS spread, for example: The idea that everyone is at most
six degrees apart takes on a sinister significance when we look for
shared sexual partners instead of shared acquaintances. It could
also explain how rumors spread, says Watts, who is now a
post-doctoral fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematically minded people, Strogatz explains, often approach
the small-world question with a simple calculation: Suppose I have
100 friends, each of whom also has 100 friends. A hundred times 100
makes 10,000 friends of my friends. If each of those 10,000 people
has 100 friends, there will be 1 million people three degrees away
from me. Five steps away, there are 10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a lot of people would say it's not surprising that the
degree of separation is small,'' concludes Strogatz, ``because
within five steps you've done the whole planet.''
</P>
<P>
   But that calculation presumes that each 100 friends are 100 new
people. In the real world many of one's friends know each other.
And it's easy to imagine a very exclusive clique of 100 people in
Greenwich, Conn., say, who know only one another and wouldn't dream
of associating with anyone outside their circle. Conceivably, no
chain of acquaintances connects you or me with any member of that
clique.
</P>
<P>
   ``So how do you even begin to think about these sorts of
networks?'' Watts asks.
</P>
<P>
   Watts and Strogatz began with a beautifully structured network
called a ring graph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of a lot of people standing in a circle holding hands,''
Watts says. ``Say there are a million people and you know 100 of
them. You know 50 people on your left and 50 people on your right,
and they are the only ones you can communicate with. What if you
want to get a message to person number 500,000 on the other side of
the circle _ how do you do that? Well, you shout the message to
your farthest friend, number 50 to your left side, and say, `Pass
it on.' The best they can do is shout to their 50th friend to the
left, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, there are 5,000 steps between pairs of people in
this world. And 5,000 degrees of separation, as Watts points out,
is an awful lot.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine the same million people standing in the same circle.
Each still has 100 friends. But instead of knowing only the 50
people to the left and the 50 to the right, everyone chooses
friends at random from the million people available. Now when he
and Strogatz calculate the average degree of separation between two
people, it comes out to about four.
</P>
<P>
   What happens between the orderly world and the random one? To
find out, Watts and Strogatz started with an orderly model and
carefully messed it up, making worlds that were progressively more
random. So instead of knowing the 50 people to your right and the
50 to your left, you might know the 50 to your right and 49 of the
50 to your left. But number 17 to your left is a stranger; instead
you're close friends with number 307,411.
</P>
<P>
   These new connections quickly bring the world closer together,
Watts says. In fact, it takes only a tiny number of rewirings _
less than 1 percent of the total connections _ to bring the average
degree of separation down from 5,000 to just over four, close to
the average degree of separation of a random world.
</P>
<P>
   How common are these small worlds in nature? Strogatz and Watts
began looking around for networks in which every connection was
known, allowing them to determine the shortest possible path
between any two points. Such networks were hard to find, but they
turned up three: the neural network of a nematode worm; the power
grid of the western United States; and the Hollywood graph, a
database of everyone who has ever acted in a feature film. People
use this very database _ available on the Web at
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/(TILDE)bct7m/
</P>
<P>
   bacon.html _ to play a game called Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,
tracing connections between the ``Footloose'' thespian and other
Hollywood luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Although Watts and Strogatz chose those three examples because
they were the only networks they could find in which all the
connections were known, all turned out to be small worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this as widespread a phenomenon as we guess it is?''
Strogatz asks. ``I would look forward in the future to work by,
say, neurologists mapping out brain networks or other nervous
systems. The people who study ecology could study food webs _ which
organisms are eating each other. In economics it would be
interesting to trace out networks of markets and consumers and
buyers and sellers. I'm sure there are people who are thinking
about network theory in economics and in finance _ it could be at
the level of whole nations interacting, or even just individual
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And chances are, you know someone who knows someone who knows
someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows those people.

the small-world question with a simple calculation: Suppose I have
100 friends, each of whom also has 100 friends. A hundred times 100
makes 10,000 friends of my friends. If each of those 10,000 people
has 100 friends, there will be 1 million people three degrees away
from me. Five steps away, there are 10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a lot of people would say it's not surprising that the
degree of separation is small,'' concludes Strogatz, ``because
within five steps you've done the whole planet.''
</P>
<P>
   But that calculation presumes that each 100 friends are 100 new
people. In the real world many of one's friends know each other.
And it's easy to imagine a very exclusive clique of 100 people in
Greenwich, Conn., say, who know only one another and wouldn't dream
of associating with anyone outside their circle. Conceivably, no
chain of acquaintances connects you or me with any member of that
clique.
</P>
<P>
   ``So how do you even begin to think about these sorts of
networks?'' Watts asks.
</P>
<P>
   Watts and Strogatz began with a beautifully structured network
called a ring graph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of a lot of people standing in a circle holding hands,''
Watts says. ``Say there are a million people and you know 100 of
them. You know 50 people on your left and 50 people on your right,
and they are the only ones you can communicate with. What if you
want to get a message to person number 500,000 on the other side of
the circle _ how do you do that? Well, you shout the message to
your farthest friend, number 50 to your left side, and say, `Pass
it on.' The best they can do is shout to their 50th friend to the
left, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, there are 5,000 steps between pairs of people in
this world. And 5,000 degrees of separation, as Watts points out,
is an awful lot.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine the same million people standing in the same circle.
Each still has 100 friends. But instead of knowing only the 50
people to the left and the 50 to the right, everyone chooses
friends at random from the million people available. Now when he
and Strogatz calculate the average degree of separation between two
people, it comes out to about four.
</P>
<P>
   What happens between the orderly world and the random one? To
find out, Watts and Strogatz started with an orderly model and
carefully messed it up, making worlds that were progressively more
random. So instead of knowing the 50 people to your right and the
50 to your left, you might know the 50 to your right and 49 of the
50 to your left. But number 17 to your left is a stranger; instead
you're close friends with number 307,411.
</P>
<P>
   These new connections quickly bring the world closer together,
Watts says. In fact, it takes only a tiny number of rewirings _
less than 1 percent of the total connections _ to bring the average
degree of separation down from 5,000 to just over four, close to
the average degree of separation of a random world.
</P>
<P>
   How common are these small worlds in nature? Strogatz and Watts
began looking around for networks in which every connection was
known, allowing them to determine the shortest possible path
between any two points. Such networks were hard to find, but they
turned up three: the neural network of a nematode worm; the power
grid of the western United States; and the Hollywood graph, a
database of everyone who has ever acted in a feature film. People
use this very database _ available on the Web at
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/(TILDE)bct7m/
</P>
<P>
   bacon.html _ to play a game called Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,
tracing connections between the ``Footloose'' thespian and other
Hollywood luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Although Watts and Strogatz chose those three examples because
they were the only networks they could find in which all the
connections were known, all turned out to be small worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this as widespread a phenomenon as we guess it is?''
Strogatz asks. ``I would look forward in the future to work by,
say, neurologists mapping out brain networks or other nervous
systems. The people who study ecology could study food webs _ which
organisms are eating each other. In economics it would be
interesting to trace out networks of markets and consumers and
buyers and sellers. I'm sure there are people who are thinking
about network theory in economics and in finance _ it could be at
the level of whole nations interacting, or even just individual
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And chances are, you know someone who knows someone who knows
someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows those people.

   It was Christmas 1997, the peak of Hong Kong's bird flu crisis,
and Kennedy Shortridge, an Australian virologist who has called
Hong Kong home for almost 27 years, was in the Cheung Sha Wan
Wholesale Poultry Market with a team testing poultry for the avian
influenza virus designated A (H5N1).
</P>
<P>
   The previous spring, the virus had killed thousands of chickens
in farms bordering southern China. In May 1997 it killed a
3-year-old boy whose preschool had kept little chicks and
ducklings.
</P>
<P>
   Now this fluky virus was breaking out in humans again _ four
cases were confirmed in November, 13 in December. A third of the
victims were dying.
</P>
<P>
   Shortridge knew that the birds would have to go. So on Dec. 29,
the government slaughtered all the chickens in the markets and
farms, well over a million birds. No more human H5N1 cases.
</P>
<P>
   But what if H5N1 mutated into a form more at home in humans? Or
what if it joined in unholy matrimony with a human flu virus and
created viral offspring that spread easily _ flying from person to
person through coughs and sneezes?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Webster, a virologist at St. jude Children's Research
Hospital in Memphis, fears the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the world's population would be dead by now.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Our world has been swept by three influenza pandemics in this
century. Virtually every person on Earth was infected with the
Spanish flu in 1918, and an estimated 30 million died.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian flu of 1957 killed about 70,000 Americans (figures for
the rest of the world are not known), and the Hong Kong flu of 1968
killed about 36,000.
</P>
<P>
   As far as we know, these flu pandemics, and the epidemics that
occur like aftershocks in between them, are caused by the influenza
virus' changeable nature: Epidemics result from genetic ``drift'' _
tiny mutations just large enough to let the virus slip by many
people's immune systems; pandemics, on the other hand, involve a
seismic ``shift'' _ gene substitutions so large they leave pretty
much everyone defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   Flu viruses belong to one of three families, designated
influenza A, B and C. Pandemics appear to be a specialty of type A
viruses (a group to which the Hong Kong chicken flu belongs).
</P>
<P>
   Like all flu viruses, they use single-stranded RNA as their
genetic material, and they make sloppy mistakes when they copy
themselves, so bit by bit the viruses change _ they drift from
their original form.
</P>
<P>
   But type A viruses are odd: Their RNA genome comes in eight
segments. If two different type A viruses infect the same cell at
once, they can shuffle their gene segments like cards in a deck.
</P>
<P>
   This reassortment can produce viral subtypes with combinations
of genetic material unlike any our immune systems are used to, with
genes that code for completely new H or N proteins, and maybe other
proteins as well.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, flu researchers were beginning to understand
that reassortment was behind the sudden shifts that underlie
pandemics. They were also beginning to accept that the donors of
the new, dangerous genes were probably animals.
</P>
<P>
   It had long been known that domestic pigs get the flu: Every
fall since 1918, pigs in the United States have come down with
classic swine flu, a gift of the virus H1N1, which is a relative of
the 1918 human virus.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong flu of 1968, however, had a hemagglutinin (a type
of protein) related to one found not in pigs but in birds.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of that pandemic, Webster became part of an
international surveillance team that would seek out the world's
wild flu reservoirs. By analyzing flu viruses in animals,
researchers hoped to trace the source of the genes that mingled
with human flu viruses to create such terrifyingly deadly strains.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s and early 1980s, Webster and his colleagues at
St. Jude amassed an impressive amount of evidence implicating birds
_ including ducks, geese, gulls and small shorebirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell,'' Webster says, ``you can find (influenza
viruses) wherever you look in migrating waterfowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterbirds are infected by the fecal-oral route. They pour out
huge quantities of virus in their feces. Surprisingly, the viruses
are passed from bird to bird but cause no disease at all.
</P>
<P>
   The genes of these bird viruses are at an apparent evolutionary
standstill _ so nicely adapted to their hosts that new mutations
offer no advantages and thus are not perpetuated.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger problems come when flu viruses get into domesticated
birds like chickens and turkeys _ species in which they are not so
well adapted _ and the evolutionary brakes are taken off. The
viruses make their new hosts sick, the hosts' immune systems
respond, and the viruses mutate to avoid the immune systems. They
may even kill their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   There had already been evidence that the 1957 and 1968 flu
pandemics were caused by human viruses that had substituted avian
genes _ probably from waterfowl _ for some of their own. Yet
catching flu from pigs seemed more likely.
</P>
<P>
   While humans don't carry receptors for bird flu on their cells,
pigs do. The going theory was that flu viruses might reassert more
easily, and become more compatible with humans, if they mixed in an
intermediate host like a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Pigs on farms in Asia (where both the 1957 and 1968 pandemics
originated) are often kept close to ducks and chickens. And pigs
have receptors in their snouts not just for their own swine virus
but for bird and human viruses as well.
</P>
<P>
   So, potentially, a pig could snort up a bird virus in infected
droppings or water, inhale a human virus spread by a coughing
farmer, and become a mixing vessel for the two. The viral progeny
might then infect humans nearby.
</P>
<P>
   What the Hong Kong outbreak has now demonstrated is that a
direct hop from birds to humans is absolutely possible. Maybe pigs
aren't as crucial as was thought. Yet, for now, the
pig-as-mixing-vessel theory is still seductive.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, researchers are catching their breath, immensely
relieved that H5N1 was nipped in the bud. But Webster feels that
another hop from birds to humans will occur in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong outbreak, he adds, ``served as a warning of what
could happen. It was a killer _ like 1918 on its way.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If online retailers steamrolled their way into the spotlight
during the past holiday season, one thing is clear: They crushed a
few toes along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have long lamented the state of customer service on
line, but perhaps never as vociferously as in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Stories abound of vendors that shipped late, sent the wrong
product and then ignored complaints, or that required customers to
pay the cost of returning goods and then tacked on restocking
charges. And then there's the loathsome ``auto response''
electronic mail reply, with advice on everything but what the
customer asked about.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to sum up online customer service in a word, David
Cooperstein, senior analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet
consulting firm, responded: ``Pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Web sites have the powerful advantage of making companies seem
accessible and easy to interact with. it's an appearance that all
kinds of companies, not just retailing, can have troubl living up
to.
</P>
<P>
   Brightware, an e-mail software company, reported Thursday that
it had tried contacting the 100 largest American public companies
by e-mail. Twenty-six either did not accept e-mail or made it so
difficult to find the e-mail forms on their Web sites that the
surveyors gave up trying. Of the remainder, only 15 responded
within three hours; 10 didn't reply at all.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Garelick of Somerville, Mass., knows the frustration of
unrequited e-mail. In early December he ordered the movie ``Out of
Sight'' on DVD from Bigstar Entertainment, an online movie
retailer. Between Dec. 28 and Dec. 30, Garelick sent e-mail to
Bigstar three times, asking why the movie hadn't arrived. ``I
would've been fine with an auto response,'' said Garelick, who
eventually received the disk in January. ``I just wanted an
assurance that they were at least working on it. From now on, I'm
not doing business on line with anyone who doesn't have a phone
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a number to call was small comfort to Duke Nguyen of
Cincinnati. Nguyen said he ordered three items from the Internet
site of Intuit in early December and then tried to change his order
by phone. ``Every time, after 20 or so minutes of waiting, I gave
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He tried faxing in his order change. but the original items were
delivered to him. ``Finally, I called and just put on my speaker
phone while I waited,'' he said. After an hour someone answered and
he was able to arrange a return. But then Intuit credited him for
less than the full value of the goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He tried using a new e-mail button on Intuit's Web site but got
an automated response suggesting, among other things, that he call
customer service. ``I'm computer-literate,'' Nguyen said. ``But
when it comes to service, these things scare the heck out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry leaders say problems often occur because
companies rush to get products and prices onto their Web sites
while underestimating the time and resources needed for customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   But David Levipsky, executive vice president of Bigstar, said
that wasn't the case with his site. The company had anticipated a
holiday rush by installing a ``very cutting-edge'' e-mail system,
he said, adding, ``So it's surprising to me that this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Intuit, Larry Wolfe, senior vice president for the
company's tax-software division, said the company does the best it
can. ``Often in December and January, there are times when people
wait longer than we'd like them to wait,'' he said. ``But we take
it very seriously, and we work very hard to keep call times down.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say poorly designed Web sites draw complaints. ``If a
site is designed well, most of the complaints don't happen,'' said
Cooperstein of Forrester, noting that many sites fail to offer
enough information so that customers can help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for consumers, analysts said, is that Internet
merchants are starting to learn two lessons: that ignoring e-mail
is the best way to turn customers into enemies, and that improving
Web sites is more cost-effective than dedicating battalions of
employees to answer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The e-mail deluge everybody was worried about we looked at as
a total gift,'' said Matt Hyde, director for online sales at REI, a
retailer of outdoor goods. ``We've made hundreds of changes to our
site based on customer service data.''
</P>
<P>
   A result: The ratio of e-mails to orders at REI dropped sharply,
he said, and so did payroll costs for customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer uses a combination of software and employees to
respond to its 10,000 weekly e-mails, answering three-quarters of
them within a day, said Manish Mehta, a senior online support
manager for the company. Dell's Web site features a wide range of
self-service information, including detailed technical support
tips.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers are becoming less tolerant of poor service from online
retailers. ``Consumer expectations have definitely grown, because
certain sites have set a high standard,'' said Jakob Nielsen, a
site design expert and publisher. ``Fair or unfair, other sites
have to live up to that standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so. But Kent Krueger, co-founder of the Sitstay GoOut
Store, said sites that are honest with consumers can weather
service problems. Sitstay, which sells specialty products to dog
owners, was the only Web site to get a five-star rating for
customer support among 500 rated in December by Bizrate, a market
research company that surveys online shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started selling doormats with little Yorkies on them and
got a huge number of orders that we weren't prepared for,'' Krueger
said. ``So we got in touch with everyone and told them who we were,
what had happened, and we were working on it.'' As a result, he
said, no customers canceled orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, if you're honest and have a little fun, people
will have a good attitude,'' he added. ``But it could also be that
dog owners are just a different breed.''

A WARNING TO THE WIRED WORLD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early days of the Internet's commercial ascendancy, back
in 1996, Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder and chairman of the Internet's
retail whale, Amazon.com, made a simple observation that should
have signaled problems ahead for technology companies that assumed
that the information age would be business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a lot of people talking about business models, but I
don't hear much about customer value,'' Bezos said.
</P>
<P>
   If value was going to be the key, a lot of business models were
going to have to change _ most notably the telecommunications
industry's, on which the Internet was being built. But instead of
clanging like a gong in the heads of telecommunications executives,
the cautionary logic of those words apparently continues to fall on
deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Few industries have gorged themselves on digital commerce with
greater appetite than the telecommunications companies. But the
result has been a wired world that to many customers seems like a
cross between the best-known works of Edvard Munch and Jean-Paul
Sartre: we scream, but there is no exit.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone services provide a sharp and unfortunate contrast to
online retailers like Bezos, who realized early on that keeping
customers is a lot easier than losing them to substandard service
and continually enticing new ones into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rare consumer today who has only one horror story to
tell. Some engage in regular battle with cellular telephone
duopolies and their arcane and incomprehensible pricing structures,
which sometimes even charge for calls that their own networks are
incapable of delivering.
</P>
<P>
   Others are continually confronted with pager services with
sporadic delivery that charge by the alpha-numeric character and
employ operators who apparently have no schooling in even the
basics of abbreviation.
</P>
<P>
   Still others are engaged in conflicts _ which now involve the
Federal Communications Commission _ over so-called casual customer
rates for long-distance calls, socking consumers with the
functional equivalent of $28 for a $1 gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the telephone is the most common bridge to
cyberspace, and as Internet and other online service providers
reach a broader and less sophisticated market, the Internet
revolution is in danger of becoming a latter-day Boston Tea Party
as customer complaints mount about responsiveness and overcharging.
</P>
<P>
   Customer satisfaction rates for companies that were once blue
chips in the telephone industry are sinking, said Nick Donatiello,
president of the consumer research firm Odyssey LP.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T's image, for example, has rebounded somewhat, but it had
been declining steadily for the past few years,'' Donatiello said.
The phone giant was rated ``very good'' by 63 percent of U.S.
households in 1994 but dropped sharply, to 37 percent, in 1997 in
Odyssey's surveys before rebounding to 55 percent last year.
``Still, it's not nearly what it was,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Why are these companies, so central to the continued growth of
the digital universe, so apparently intractable about providing
value to customers?
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' Donatiello said, is that ``virtually everyone
in the telecom industry has had the luxury of treating their
customers like garbage for a very long time, first because they had
a monopoly _ and some still do _ while others have geographic
oligopolies.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he says, they are in a position not to care very
much whether customers are satisfied with the quality or value of
the services they sign up for.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most profound differences between online retail and
the business of providing telecommunications, for example, is that
customers find it a simple task to compare the prices of a book
from several vendors.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, telecommunications providers _ cellular and
long-distance, especially _ seem to take pride in making it almost
impossible to do so, with complex rates that vary by day of week,
time of day and sometimes, it seems, the phases of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to comparison shop is one reason consumers are
moving to support the trend toward flat-rate services, Donatiello
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't like to have the meter running on anything
that has to do with entertainment, information or communication,''
he said. ``That's why we saw such a huge uptick in the adoption
curve of online services when America Online went to its flat-rate
model,'' now $21.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The single-price model may also account for the popularity of
AT&AMP;T's Digital One plan, which offers customers in certain cities a
flat rate of $90 a month for 600 minutes of cellular calls to or
from anywhere in the United States. The popularity of that plan, in
turn, is setting off a frenzy among other wireless providers to
offer their own flat-rate plans.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer attitudes suggest that may not be enough.
Increasingly, people want to simplify the enormous complexity of
their wired lives by buying all their telecommunications_ local
phone service, long distance, cellular, cable television and
Internet connections _ from a single provider.
</P>
<P>
   Though AT&AMP;T again says it is leading the charge with its
purchase of the cable television giant Tele-Communications Inc.,
Donatiello says consumers apparently do not hold out much hope that
even moves this bold will make their lives easier to understand or
manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that consumers don't think any kind of
company would do a good job'' providing a full range of services,
he said. ``Their No. 1 choice was a long-distance company, and only
37 percent of U.S. households said they would do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Local phone companies got a 36 percent confidence rating as
potential one-stop providers, while cable television companies
scored only 21 percent, and Internet service providers a paltry 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So in the end, consumer attitudes signal trouble ahead for
acquisitive telecommunications companies like AT&AMP;T, despite the
benefits it promises from its TCI merger and deals with high-speed
Internet services like At Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse than the blind leading the deaf,'' Donatiello said.
``The bad has married the ugly, and somehow they expect the
children to be the good. Lip service alone won't get you there _
the first thing they still have to prove is that they're worthy of
their customers' business.''

 Support for Net Pioneer's UFO Theory  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's all alien to me.
</P>
<P>
   The phone calls and e-mail poured in last week after The
Chronicle's front-page story on Joe Firmage, the Internet pioneer
who was forced to resign as chief strategist at USWeb/CKS because
of his belief in aliens and UFOs.
</P>
<P>
   Firmage's otherworldly theory, detailed in his 600-page online
treatise, ``The Truth'' (www.thewordistruth.org), is a doozy: He
links many of history's major religious and technological events to
``visits'' from extraterrestrials. He even recounts a close
encounter of the third kind in his Los Gatos home in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The readers' overwhelming verdict? Firmage, 28, is an earnest,
brilliant individual who has put the truth, as he sees it, before
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on to something big that bears further investigation,''
said Suleiman Edmondson, a writer-TV producer based in Richmond.
``What Joe is saying is very accurate. Elements of the secret
government know about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Harold Puthoff, a respected physicist at the Institute for
Advanced Studies in Austin, Texas: ``These are certainly
speculative and provocative theories, but on the other hand, he's
not a crackpot. As far as whetherwe'll meet up with E.T., the jury
is still out. The proof is yet to be found. The fact that (Firmage)
opened up the issue required a lot of courage. He stuck his neck
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Marrs, a journalist in Dallas who has written extensively
about UFOs and the Kennedy assassination, said: ``Firmage is a
brilliant guy. He picked the brains of top researchers to come up
with his ideas. There have been dozens of works on the
Roswell-technology connection.''
</P>
<P>
   An authoritative read is the 1997 book ``The Day After Roswell''
by the late Colonel Phillip J. Corso and Bill Birnes, publisher of
UFO Magazine in Los Angeles. Like Firmage, they contend that the
origins of high-tech inventions such as lasers and the microchip
can be traced to a purported alien spacecraft crash in 1947 in
Roswell, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Truman absolutely wanted technology companies like
Bell Labs and IBM to take a look at material from the wreckage,''
Birnes said. ``Joe is right on.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, a Daly City woman who supports Firmage, claims that
she has been visited by aliens 33 times and has been implanted with
alien materials. And another man swore that extraterrestrials are
in cold storage at the White House. Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing fan club and wall-to-wall media coverage
(CNN, ``Hard Copy,'' WCBS-AM), Firmage's unique views are
tantamount to career suicide. Be careful what you wish for.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, he tendered his resignation, and he has spent
the past few days fielding a blizzard of media requests. Fearing a
market and public relations backlash, executives of USWeb/CKS, an
Internet services company worth about $2 billion, are trying to
keep a low profile. Nonetheless, he has his defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the same skepticism about the JFK assassination when I
came out with my book (`Crossfire: The Plot to Kill Kennedy') in
1989,'' Marrs said. ``Now, my conclusions of a government
conspiracy are in the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   So does this whole high-tech episode merit a future segment on
``The X-Files''?
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the popular TV program declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   OVERSEAS INTERNET: The World Wide Web is an American fad but
hardly a hit in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While an estimated 60 million Americans _ almost a quarter of
the population _ are surfing the Web, less than 10 percent of
Europe's 350 million citizens regularly venture into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   A major culprit: Slow acceptance of telecom deregulation
overseas has limited online penetration in Europe. In Italy, for
example, only 5 percent of the population is connected to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That should change dramatically during the next few years,
however, as telecommunications rules loosen and foreign governments
encourage more Net connections to businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net will grow at an explosive rate, especially in
countries such as France, Sweden, Holland, Germany and England,
where Social Democratic governments are encouraging sales of
tax-free, low-cost computers,'' said Johan Stuel von Holstein,
founder of IconMedia Lab, the largest Internet service company in
Europe. ``Those countries want everyone to have access to PCs at
home and at work.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden, about 65 percent of the population is logged on.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, major European corporations, led by Volkswagen and
BMW, have vast Net access. Indeed, online-related revenues abroad
will skyrocket to $64.4 billion in 2001 but still lag far behind
the United States.

BOOKS SHED LIGHT ON BIRTH OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   History books about the birth of cyberspace and the gestation of
the Internet have proved quite popular lately. Computers are
rapidly changing the world around us, and with the coming of the
next century there is almost as much impulse to turn and look back
as there is to look forward.
</P>
<P>
   But late last year a different kind of history was published by
Basic Books. Called ``Extra Life: Coming of Age in Cyberspace,''
this book is a startlingly personal and moving account of what it
was like in the late 1970s and 1980s to grow up with the new
technology. In this short book, David Bennahum packs in details of
his early experiences with computer games (hence the title),
software piracy, and drugs. He explains why kids like himself, who
saw themselves as perpetual outsiders, found solace among their
machines and eventually friendship in the extended computer family.
Bennahum, who now writes for Wired magazine out of its New York
advertising office, does much to shatter the Generation-X myth that
portrayed him and those of his age group as a bunch of troubled
teenagers and slacker young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Bennahum spent years working on Extra Life, and it has taken a
lot of twists and turns in the process. Although the end result is
pretty close to his original vision, getting there took him on his
own personal journey through the history of thinking machines. For
several years now Bennahum has been sharing this journey with
nearly 5,000 other readers through his free Internet mailing list,
MEME. He's also created the Community Memory mailing list, for
discussions on the history of cyberspace. Information on both of
these mailing lists, their archives, and details on how to join
them, are available on Bennahum's Web site www.memex.org. There you
will also find something quite rare: the full text of Bennahum's
interviews with such luminaries as Nicholas Negroponte, James
Gosling, Richard Stallman, and Jon Postel.
</P>
<P>
   A very different history of the last two decades of cyberspace
can be found in Dorothy E. Denning's new book, ``Information
Warfare and Security,'' published last month by Addison Wesley.
Denning, a professor at Georgetown University, has long been a
recognized leader in the field of computer security, but she made a
name for herself in the lay press in the 1980s when she tracked
down, interviewed, and wrote very sympathetic scholarly articles
about young computer attackers. A short time later Denning hooked
up with the FBI, where she learned a good deal about the darker
side of computer espionage and information warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Denning is probably best known as the leading
academic to favor the regulation of encryption technology. For this
reason, many people had feared that a book by Denning on
``information warfare'' would be a long polemic in favor of
increased government controls over technology and the need to
sacrifice civil liberties in favor of national defense. Thankfully,
``Information Warfare and Security'' is nothing of the sort.
Instead, it's a balanced presentation of the whole gambit of
computer security issues, from computer viruses and insider threats
to the possibility of disruption or manipulation of the stock
market. But unlike other authors, who mostly try to scare the
reader into taking the threat seriously, Denning instead looks at
many of the claims made by information warfare enthusiasts to see
if they actually hold up.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Jan. 10, 1992, ABC's ``Nightline'' aired a story
about a hostile computer virus that the Central Intelligence Agency
had introduced into Iraq shortly before the start of the Gulf War,
after US News and World Report had run a story on the same subject.
Allegedly the virus had been sent to Iraq in an infected printer.
Although a lot of computer scientists disbelieved the story, it was
nevertheless reported as fact by many publications during the
following. But in the first chapter of her book, Denning shows
convincingly how this story originated in an April 1, 1991, column
that John Gantz had written for InfoWorld, a computer trade
newspaper. Apparently the story had first been translated into
Japanese, where the significance of the April 1 date was not
appreciated, and then re-translated back into English by a foreign
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   For a more in-depth look at the criminal mind, I'd recommend
Donn B. Parker's ``Fighting Computer Crime,'' published by Wiley.
Parker has spent more than 30 years tracking down computer
criminals and solving high-tech crimes; this book is actually a
revised edition of the book that he published with the same title
in 1983! Because of his age and experience, Parker is one of the
few computer crime experts who is able to write authoritatively
about crimes involving mainframes and banks. The book also has a
good amount of common-sense advice _ for example, why you might
want to write down your computer passwords, despite warnings not to
do so, and how to keep these written passwords from being
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Besides simply surveying the landscape, ``Fighting Computer
Crime'' also presents a new framework for information security.
</P>
<P>
   While some security-minded managers might find this the most
relevant part of the book, because it gives concrete policies that
an organization can implement, I found it a bit drawn out.
</P>
<P>
   A book with considerably more technical leanings is Eric
Greenberg's ``Network Application Frameworks: Design and
Architecture.'' Greenberg has an impressive resume, having been one
of the lead security managers at Netscape Communications, and one
of the individuals responsible for Sprint International's global
Internet backbone. This book, also published by Addison Wesley,
gives a good overview of the Internet's plumbing, from the details
of the TCP/IP protocol and the new IP version 6, to distributed
object-oriented applications built from Java. If you ever wondered
exactly what bytes make up a TCP/IP header but didn't have time to
read the Internet RFCs, or if you need to know the difference
between NetWare 4.x and NetWare 5, this is the book for you. If you
don't have any idea what my previous sentence means, then there are
probably better books for you to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Books are enjoying something of a resurgence lately, probably
the result of our heady economic times. Bennahum's book is priced
at a reasonable $23 list, and is available at 30 percent off at
many stores. Both the Denning and Parker books are priced at
$34.95, and you'll be hard-pressed to find it discounted anywhere.
Meanwhile, ``Network Application Frameworks'' is priced at $49.95!
</P>
<P>
   Since authors like Greenberg or Denning typically only see a few
dollars for each book that sold, I wonder just how longer these
high-priced, paper-based intellectual property delivery systems are
going to be a part of our world.

Browse without leaving a cookie trail 
By Mark Clothier

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Surfing the Web is getting to be a little like living
in a glass house _ much of what you do goes noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Those who run Web sites use things called ``cookies'' and
``referrers'' to see what we search for, where we go and what we
buy. The cookies and referrers give the information to Web sites,
market researchers and ad agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most browsers let you control whether you want to accept
cookies. With Netscape's browser, you can find it under the
``edit'' part of the toolbar, then look in the ``advanced''
category.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, shutting off the cookie accepter shuts off your
access to some sites, or at least limits what you can do there.
</P>
<P>
   A software product from a Cambridge, Mass., company blocks
cookies for you, without limiting your access to different Web
sites. interMute which can be downloaded from
http://www.intermute.com, sells for $19.95. A 14-day trial copy is
free.
</P>
<P>
   The software also lets you restrict other things, including Java
applets (the bit-heavy applications that make Web site ingredients
flash, scroll and move), banner ads and background music.
</P>
<P>
   The program acts as a filter between your browser and the Web.
It works on most common browsers, including recent versions of
Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape's browser. Once
installed, the program runs when the computer starts.
</P>
<P>
   interMute works on Windows 95, 98 and NT platforms, as well as
on UNIX and any Java-compatible system.
</P>
<P>
   Companies willing to pay to lure online shoppers
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, Forrester Research predicts advertisers will spend $605
million to get you to do your car shopping online, $187 million to
convince you to house-hunt online and $460 million so you will
check the Web classifieds for job openings. That's up from 1997
totals of $16 million, $5 million and $48 million for car, house
and job shopping online ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   So far, those doing the shopping are mostly just browsing. A
Millward Brown Interactive study asked 527 Internet users about
online auto-shopping habits. The 1998 study found that while 42
percent of those surveyed used the Internet to research their car
purchase, only 0.6 percent bought their car online.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly attractive features are likely to increase
those numbers. Some auto-shopping sites let you place a free
classified ad, find trade-in and market prices for cars, check loan
and insurance rates, and check through a database of recalls.
http://www.autoweb.com, http://www.carpoint.msn.com and
http://www.autos.yahoo.com offer several of those features.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a home loan on the Web is also becoming more popular.
Myers Internet Services predicts 12 percent of all mortgage
applications will take place on the Internet by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Portal sites such as http://www
</P>
<P>
   .excite.com and http://www.yahoo
</P>
<P>
   .com offer features that let you calculate mortgage rates and
get credit reports as well as information about schools and home
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Time to get a printer as good as your photos
</P>
<P>
   So, you got your new scanner or your digital camera for the
holidays, and now you want to start printing the pictures. But your
poor printer quality makes them look like pulp comic drawings.
</P>
<P>
   It might be time to upgrade your color printer to match your
scanner and digital camera. Hewlett-Packard released the HP DeskJet
882C for the home market. The photo-quality printer has a suggested
retail of $299.
</P>
<P>
   The new HP DeskJet prints up to eight pages per minute. It uses
Hewlett-Packard photo resolution enhancement color-layering
technology to print photo-quality images. The feature creates the
photo-quality image by blending tiny drops of ink.
</P>
<P>
   The printer comes with a CD-ROM that lets you edit your photos
and create greeting cards, banners and calendars.
</P>
<P>
   The printers are available at most major electronics retailers
and online at http://www.shopping.hp.com.

THE WAR CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are two words you haven't seen in a while: Browser wars.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, journalists like me loved to handicap the titanic
struggle between Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp.
for dominance of the Internet browser market. Then, suddenly, many
of us lost interest. The Netscape-Microsoft story got swallowed up
in the larger antitrust fight between Microsoft and the federal
government. And then America Online Inc. struck a deal to buy
Netscape, a decision interpreted by many as an act of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly; in fact, the struggle continues. Netscape will soon be
under new management, and its strategy in the browser fight has
certainly changed. But the company is still clinging to the 50
percent share of the market belonging to its Communicator browser,
and it's even trying to squeeze out a profit from Web surfers
who've gone over to the enemy's Internet Explorer (IE).
</P>
<P>
   I've already written of Smart Browsing, a Netscape feature that
lets you find popular sites by simply typing a product name into
the Communicator address bar. Type ``Mercedes Benz,'' for instance,
and you go straight to the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape once would have used this feature to keep customers
from defecting to the Microsoft browser. These days, the company is
more interested in driving traffic to its Netcenter Web site. After
all, browsers are now given away, but companies pay by the eyeball
to advertise on Netcenter. The more visitors to the site, the more
profit for Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   And that explains Netscape TuneUp for IE, a free program that
adds Smart Browsing to Microsoft's browser. Along the way, TuneUp
resets the browser's home page to the Netcenter site, where you're
hit with advertisements urging you to sign up for a free e-mail
account.
</P>
<P>
   It's a clever way to snatch eyeballs from the competition, and
it works. I still use the Microsoft browser on my Windows machines,
but thanks to Netscape TuneUp, I'm now a regular at Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape plans to pull a similar trick with Smart Download, a
freebie for pulling down files from the Internet. It's good for
people with only one phone line, because Smart Download has an
interrupt feature. You can halt a download in midstream, make a
call, and restart where you left off.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Smart Download is available only through the Netscape
browser, but the company says it'll soon offer a version compatible
with IE. Why? Because Smart Download bombards users with Netscape
ads as it runs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft's goal in the browser wars has never
changed _ total domination. Its new browser tweaks are aimed at
getting you to use IE and only IE. And not just on Windows
machines.
</P>
<P>
   I've been a loyal Netscape user on my Apple iMac, but
Microsoft's sharp new IE 4.5 browser for the Mac has me thinking
thoughts of treason. Browsing software brings out the best in
Microsoft's coders, and its new Mac browser has a bunch of powerful
new features.
</P>
<P>
   Registering on Internet shopping sites or free e-mail services
gets a lot easier, thanks to a feature called AutoFill. The browser
stores your name, address, and other personal data. When a site
requests this information, click the AutoFill button and the the
form is filled out automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Printing Web documents can be an ugly business. IE 4.5 fixes
that with features that'll make any Web page look good on paper.
For instance, you can resize the type to make it fit properly, and
delete background colors and ad banners before printing.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Page Holder, which lets you store favorite pages in
a sidebar to the left of the main browser window. Plug in the home
pages of favorite Web sites, like CNN.com or Boston.com. Click a
link on the home page, and the main browser window takes you there,
while your home page stays in the sidebar. You can travel all over
the Web, without leaving the place you started.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Microsoft being so nice to us? Like Netscape, the
company's ultimate goal is to drive Web traffic to Microsoft-owned
sites. That's the imperative that now drives the new, improved
browser wars. And that's why both Netscape and Microsoft will
continue to tempt us with new and improved browsers.

STUDY SUGGESTS BASICS FOR E-COMMERCE SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By WENDY TANAKA   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some Web sites get a million visits a day, but
success lies in how to convert those visits into actual on-line
sales to customers who visit again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Studio Archetype Inc. professes to have a solution. The company
recently released a study stating that sales are driven by consumer
confidence in a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is trust and maintaining an ongoing relationship
with customers,'' said Clement Mok, founder of the San
Francisco-based Web site designer. ``It's fine to get one-time
transactions. Everyone's willing to buy once. But how do you
encourage people to go back?''
</P>
<P>
   Studio Archetype's report, which was done in conjunction with
Cheskin Research Inc. of Redwood Shores, Calif., said Web sites
that have six characteristics will engender the most trust from
consumers. The six are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Solid brand-name recognition of the company or product.
</P>
<P>
   _ Easy navigation. If customers have to click too many times to
get what they need, they will likely get frustrated and not want to
call up the site again. Customers also get frustrated if they click
on links that don't exist or don't work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good customer service. Sites must state how merchandise orders
are processed, how orders will be delivered, and how customers can
return products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good presentation of information.
</P>
<P>
   _ State-of-the-art technology.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seals of approval. The survey found that consumers were more
apt to buy from Web sites that had the logos of security and
privacy endorsers, like VeriSign and TrustE, on their pages. Logos
for major credit card companies that have contracts with the site
also made consumers more comfortable about buying from that site.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Web sites have these signs, it means they're legitimate
sites,'' said Davis Masten, a principal at Cheskin Research.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been plenty of attention on security and
privacy in Web site transactions, Masten said those issues were
part of the bigger consumer trust issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken trust to reliability,'' he said. ``It says what (a Web
site) is going to do and not misrepresent itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Studio Archetype clients have found the company's six-point
model useful.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc. said Studio Archetype's
redesign of its main Web site had dramatically improved business.
</P>
<P>
   Rakesh Sapra, director of interactive marketing at UPS, said his
company's Web site _ www.ups.com _ went from tracking 100,000
orders per month in 1995 to about 1 million trackings a month due
to better site navigation and overall design.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet analysts took issue with some of the findings and
the methodology of the study by Studio Archetype and Cheskin.
</P>
<P>
   Erina DuBois, digital commerce analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San
Jose, Calif., said Web sites with seals of approval did not hold
more sway with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of consumers don't read about privacy stuff,'' she said.
In addition, DuBois said, ``Certificates, like VeriSign, are not in
wide use. Most consumers don't know what VeriSign is.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the other five components outlined in the report, DuBois
said they were ``basic, 101, Web site stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But she strongly agreed that Web site customer service is going
to become more and more critical in doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know, how do I handle returns? Whom do I call
if I have a return? Is there an 800 number, e-mail, fax?'' DuBois
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many consumers don't have an easy way of returning items or
getting more information on line, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything will have to be integrated at the back end,''
DuBois said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she sees e-commerce evolving.
</P>
<P>
   ``'97 was like, `Hey here's my site,''' DuBois said. ``'98 was,
`Let's make it easy to buy.' '99 will be customer service. How do I
retain them? Maybe some sites will have a button you can click on
to dial customer service.''

SNOW DAY IS FOR SURFING AS PUPILS PLAY ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hang up the sled. Put Scrabble back in the box. Surfing is the
new snow day activity of choice.
</P>
<P>
   That would be surfing on the Web, of course, not the water
(unless you want to try the moving waves on Go Surf,
www.geocities.com/TheTropics/4271/gallery.html).
</P>
<P>
   With industry experts estimating that more than 5 million
children nationwide have Internet access, a day of canceled classes
means clogged chat rooms and crowded cartoon Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Internet service providers estimate that use jumps more than 10
percent during the winter, and Bell Atlantic, whose phone lines
connect people to the Internet, reported swollen activity
throughout New York state Thursday, with the system logging its
average daily volume of 120 million calls by 5 p.m., barely
two-thirds of the way through the day.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that spike is probably from increased phone calls and
more adults working from home, two phenomena often associated with
stormy weather. But experts also believe it is partly because when
dozens of districts in the New York region declared a day off
Thursday, thousands of schoolchildren scrambled to their desks at
home to click the day away.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Mele, 15, a sophomore at Fairfield High School in
Connecticut, spent about three hours playing Half Life, a
three-dimensional interactive shooting game. Lisa Kravitz, 13, an
eighth-grader at Pelham Middle School in Westchester County, N.Y.,
went to www.gurl.com and looked up her horoscope. And a New Jersey
teen-ager scrolled the love-life advice boards and exchanged
instant messages with her friends, some of whom live just down the
block.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Berry of Darien, Conn., who has two sons, said, ``When you
and I were kids, we would talk to our friends all day at school and
then call them when we got home; they e-mail each other.'' Her
sons, Nicholas, 8, and Christopher, 11, exchanged computer messages
with friends Thursday morning to plan their snow-shoveling
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nice to know that they're using their minds,'' Berry
said. ``A lot of these games are pretty hard. I think there's
educational value online. If there's no school, they're certainly
still using their writing skills and communication skills, and
hopefully picking up some education along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online's Ask the Teacher feature typically collects
about 6,000 homework questions a day. But e-mail is the top online
activity for children younger than 13, according to a recent survey
by Jupiter Communications, an Internet research company. Games and
surfing the Internet ranked second and third, and homework was
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really get frostbitten'' online, said Lisa, who
built a snowman Thursday before clicking on the computer. ``You
can't really get to many places'' in the snow, she said, ``and the
Internet's right here, and you can go all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On Teen People on Line, a popular site for children that can be
accessed through America Online, the ``Daily Buzz'' Thursday bore
the headline, ``Snowed in? Get Surfing.'' It suggested cuddling up
to the computer with a mug of cocoa and checking out sites to color
with virtual crayons (www.kidalex.com/index.html), get movie
reviews (www.girlsonfilm.com/film/navigation), and climb Mount
Everest _ virtually (www.everest.mountainzone.com/98).
</P>
<P>
   Karen-Kristie Prior, community manager of Teen People On Line,
said the normal peak period for her Web site is from 3 p.m. to
midnight. But in the winter, there are days with thousands of
postings between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason that it's popular is kids, they want to
talk to one another,'' Prior said. ``If they're not in school,
they're missing that social outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, many children and teen-agers interviewed by
telephone and e-mail said they spent their snow day doing nothing
more exotic than chatting with friends on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually like talking to my friends on the computer more,''
Christopher Berry said. ``I just do. It's good because I can play
computer games while I'm talking to them on the Internet.''

I GOT THAT OL' MS. PAC-MAN FEVER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - One of my first jobs out of college was editing a
weekly newspaper in California's ``Silicon Valley.'' It was fun
putting out the ``Cupertino Courier,'' but I was a little too
efficient and found myself with lots of free time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I never told the boss! Instead, I'd join a couple
other guys who edited other weekly newspapers owned by the same
newspaper chain and we'd all sneak across the parking lot to a
nearby convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   Our goal: The Ms. Pac-Man machine!
</P>
<P>
   I hate to admit this _ especially in print _ but we used to
spend about an hour a day pumping quarters into that stupid
machine, which stood in the store's front window and exposed us to
numerous odd looks from productive members of society.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't care. We were Ms. Pac-Man addicts. We lived for the
chance to guide Ms. Pac-Man through her maze, gobbling dots and the
four monsters. My friend, Steve, actually developed a sore wrist
from using the joystick too much.
</P>
<P>
   I know. It all sounds very pathetic. But it was fun. And we were
young and crazy.
</P>
<P>
   So what's my excuse now?
</P>
<P>
   Yep. Twenty years later, I find myself playing Ms. Pac-Man
again. This time it's on my home computer using Microsoft's Revenge
of Arcade. The $25 CD-ROM package comes with Ms. Pac-Man and other
ancient arcade games such as Rally-X and Mappy.
</P>
<P>
   I've had it for a few weeks now, and signs of my old addiction
are reappearing. Sometimes I sneak in to our spare room to play a
quick game. And I've even created a desktop shortcut so I can
launch Ms. Pac-Man without delay!
</P>
<P>
   There's something about those old arcade games that I can't
explain. Some of them never interested me. But some of them, not
just Ms. Pac-Man, are fun enough that I'd rather play one of them
instead of a new 3D adventure game.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, well. I consider myself lucky _ not because I can now play
Ms. Pac-Man without needing quarters, but because my wife has yet
to voice an observation I know she's made: Playing Ms. Pac-Man is
one heck of a sorry way to use a Pentium II computer! &QL; 
Macintosh news to use
</P>
<P>
   After the recent Macworld Expo/San Francisco '99 trade show,
Apple unveiled a number of new computer models, including Power Mac
G3s and iMacs that come in assorted colors, not just the original
translucent blue.
</P>
<P>
   PC-makers have taken notice of the iMac's popularity, which has
been credited with turning Apple back to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   (For a more detailed look at the new iMacs, check out Gene
Steinberg's column on Arizona Central at
www.azcentral.com/computing/news/mac/steinberg.shtml.)
</P>
<P>
   A prediction for 1999: By year's end, look for PC-makers to
offer PC versions of the iMac _ colorful and sculpted
IBM-compatible machines that will make the old beige boxes look,
well, like old beige boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of iMacs, Apple Computer has finally eased up on its
pricing. For several months, no matter where you looked to buy, an
iMac was going to cost you $1,299. Period. Now, retailers are free
to price according to demand. Initially, the cost of the all-in-one
machine dropped to about $999. But the last time I checked, some
online retailers were offering iMacs for $979.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MP3 to the rescue!
</P>
<P>
   In a recent column, I discussed the popular MP3 format for music
files. The technology has taken over music sites all over the Web,
offering computer users the ability to download near CD-quality
music in just minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've heard from several readers who have had trouble
downloading the necessary software to play MP3 files. Apparently,
many download sites have been too busy to handle all the download
requests.
</P>
<P>
   The download problem seems to have affected Macintosh users a
bit more severely, perhaps because Mac users tend to be more active
online than PC users. So, if you're a Mac user looking for a copy
of the MP3 player MacAmp, check out www.macamp.com. If that site is
busy, check a mirror site at
ftp://mirror.doit.wisc.edu/mirrors/apple/macamp/.
</P>
<P>
   If you love MP3 but want to play the files with something other
than WinAmp or Mac-Amp, a reader named Ron suggests you try
Sonique, an MP3 player for your PC made by Night55 Inc. You can try
Sonique at www.sonique.com.

   Meanwhile, sources tell me that the Diamond Rio, a Walkman-like
player that can hold up to 60 minutes of MP3 music files, will in
the future be able to play music files in other formats as well.
Some readers were wondering about that, as they've discovered that
MP3 isn't the only data-compression format being used on music
files.
</P>
<P>
   And did I say MP3 would be big? That prediction is holding true,
at least for now. An IDG.net reporter covering the recent Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas reported that MP3 was on everybody's
mind. Samsung Electronics, for example, announced it will roll out
its own MP3 devices under the name Yepp. The devices don't have the
memory of Diamond's Rio, but are smaller, about the size of a
credit card. It seems as though the MP3 cat is out of the bag,
regardless of how strongly the recording industry opposes it. &QL; 
Don't worry. Be happy!
</P>
<P>
   Well, here we are in the final year before the dreaded Y2K bug
attacks. As you know, it's supposed to hit at midnight Jan. 1. What
say we all spend the night sitting in a cornfield somewhere?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, OK. Dumb idea. While we're thinking of what else to do, here
is some of the latest Y2K news:
</P>
<P>
   - From the I-Guess-This-Was-Bound-To-Happen Department:
``Wired'' magazine recently reported that Y2K blacklists are
starting to crop up. Yep. Companies that have solved their Y2K
problems don't want to mess with businesses that haven't solved
their Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wired'' reported that banks have started assigning customers
with low-, medium- or high-risk ratings. Even Federal Express has
gotten into the act, branding primary business partners with the
colors green, yellow or red depending on how much work they've done
toward solving their Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wired'' pointed out that some federal guidelines actually
require such ``leper lists'' be created as part of ``appropriate
risk control.''
</P>
<P>
   - Don't let the federal government's involvement in the ``leper
lists'' fool you. Uncle Sam is as far behind in solving its Y2K
problems as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a reassuring quote from Joel Willemssen of the General
Accounting Office:
</P>
<P>
   ``All the government agencies will not be done on time,'' he
recently told CNN. ``There will be some failures. Right now as a
country we do not know where we stand on water, power and
telecommunications.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot dog! That cornfield is starting to sound better and better!
</P>
<P>
   - And if Y2K isn't enough for you to worry about, the ``New York
Times'' reports that there's a time-related glitch that will rear
its ugly head in certain Windows applications April 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The bug, which Microsoft has owned up to, will cause programs to
behave as if it was an hour earlier than the correct time shown by
internal Windows 95, 98 and NT clocks.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the bug is supposed to correct itself a
week later on April 8, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   So, start planning now. You'll be able to wander in to work an
hour late for an entire week in 2001. If the boss complains, you
can blame your home PC! &QL;

CUTTING THE POWER TO THAT PASSWORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When my dear daughter set up our new computer,
she somehow set it up with a power-on password. I have tried many
times to get rid of it, with no success. I don't mind typing a
four-letter word every time I turn my computer on, but I'm curious.
Why can't I get rid of it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Say the Secret Word
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WORD: Only one four-letter word? Every time I sit down at
my computer it takes 15 or 20 of those, a few eight-letter ones
and, occasionally, the 12-letter biggie before I can get it to work
the way it's supposed to. Consider yourself lucky.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm wondering is why your kid put a password on there in
the first place unless she's gone paranoid from one too many
``X-Files.'' I could understand it if your computer were sitting in
a busy office with a bunch of nosy co-workers, like mine is, but
that's hardly the case. And I doubt you have all that many Russian
spies traipsing through your house looking for nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   You can get rid of it, but you're going to have to find the
manual that came with the computer. Power-on passwords aren't
stored on the hard drive, so even if you rebuilt Windows from
scratch, it would still be there. The password is stored on a chip
with the rest of your basic system information, such as how much
memory or which type of hard drive you have.
</P>
<P>
   You need to find out how to start your computer's setup program,
which will allow you to change the info on that chip. The manual
should have instructions on changing or clearing the password. Your
brand of computer may even let you clear the password by monkeying
with some settings on the motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Last week, I cut out your column on testing
your computer for the year 2000. I now cannot find the article. Can
you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why Too Kay
</P>
<P>
   DEAR KAY: Why sure! It's right there behind the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Many books on Windows NT include a CD for NT
Server good for 120 days. After running Service Pack 3 (downloaded
from Microsoft) I have run it for far longer. A friend ran Service
Pack 4 and the system went dead. The moral: Leave well enough
alone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bandit
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BANDIT: Well, nobody ever said the people at Microsoft were
stupid. You might find a way to cheat them once in a while, but
they eventually close all the little loopholes. And now that they
know about you, you can expect the guys in black body armor to show
up at your door any minute.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Do you know anything about the Office 2000
preview? Is it crippleware (i.e., does it expire after 60 days or
something?).
</P>
<P>
   _ Early Adopter
</P>
<P>
   DEAR EARLY: Hey, pay attention! I thought I just said the
Microsoft guys aren't stupid. For 20 bucks they're giving you the
opportunity to own buggy, pre-release software that expires on Aug.
1. And so far, thousands and thousands of lemmings have jumped off
that cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. If you send me $20, I'll send you the pre-release version
of next week's column, full of unfinished thoughts and
ungrammatical sentences. I know, I know. What would be so different
about that?

FED OFFICIAL DISPUTES Y2K ECONOMIC CRISIS THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROSS KERBER AND KIMBERLY BLANTON   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Casting aside gloomy predictions about the impact of
Year 2000 computer glitches on the economy, a top Federal Reserve
official said Tuesday she does not expect the US economy to go into
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Minehan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
and one of the co-chairs of the Fed's Y2K committee, disputed a
widely cited forecast that there is a 70 percent chance software
problems caused by the date change to Jan. 1, 2000 would lead to a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The bleak forecast comes from the prominent Wall Street
economist, Ed Yardeni, who is chief economist of Deutsche Bank
Securities in New York. He predicts that software disruptions could
slow transportation, knock out telephone services, and generally
throw business operations off stride.
</P>
<P>
   By Yardeni's thinking, the impact of turning the calendar over
to Year 2000 would be comparable to the oil-price shocks of 1973,
which threw the United States into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Although Minehan has ``a lot of respect for Yardeni,'' she said
in an interview Tuesday, ``It just doesn't seem realistic to say
that it would produce, all by itself, a recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Minehan said she believes that a more moderate forecast by
DRI/McGraw Hill, the economic forecasting firm Lexington, Mass., is
more realistic. Released last March, DRI described a scenario in
which businesses are required to spend more and stock up on
computer hardware, adding about 0.1 percent to the economy's total
product in 1999. Then, in 2000, limited disruptions caused by
computer malfunctions as well as a loss of productivity by workers
could reduce GDP by just 0.2 percent. There is ``a 20 percent
probability that reality will be this bad or worse,'' DRI/McGraw's
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Minehan suggested it is also conceivable that businesses would
build inventories later this year. ``Just as some people might
themselves prudent if they took out a little extra cash, some
businesses might attempt to stock supplies and other things'' in
expectation of problems with their electricity or other services,
Minehan acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, the impact would be minimal, she said. The inventory
buildup would be adjusted in 2000 in what is known as an
``inventory cycle''; the two would cancel each other out.
</P>
<P>
   Minehan's comments were part of a broader push by the Fed to
bolster public confidence in the ability of large financial
institutions and the central bank system _ the lifeblood of the
economy _ to cope with the looming date change.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming specific economists, Fed Governor Edward W. Kelly
told a Senate committee last April that forecasts of a Y2K-induced
recession were ``probably a stretch.'' Kelly and Minehan are among
four co-chairs of a Fed committee preparing the US central bank for
2000 and assessing the potential impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Minehan's critique of Y2K economics appears to be the first
direct comment by a Fed official specifically about Yardeni's
forecast. Her comments take on added significance because she is
also chairwoman of separate Fed committee that has been working for
more than two years with the 12 regional banks and their member
financial institutions to prepare for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   On that point, Minehan sought to reassure: ``Everything at the
Fed that is mission critical is Y2K ready,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not realistic to think there will be no glitches either.
There will be glitches,'' she said. ``But, as far as we can see, at
this point, a reasonable scenario is that most important things
will work, at least from the perspective of the financial services
arena.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Yardeni in an interview Tuesday, reiterated his
recession forecast, which was based in part on his reviews of
company filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be right about this,'' Yardeni said.

TEE TIME ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SUSAN FORNOFF   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There are those who say golf is better than sex.
Well, traffic on the Internet offers evidence that golf is almost
as good as sex.
</P>
<P>
   According to Golf Link research, golf is the second most
requested term on Internet search engines. A single quick Yahoo
search yields 7,192 Web sites _ more than football and baseball
combined, many more than tennis, cycling and running combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the business world, a Web site has become as important as a
business card,'' said Mil Jones, sales and customer service
representative of Golf Link.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics of the Internet match up so well with those
of golfers,'' said Dan Murnan, founder of the expansive Cybergolf
site. ``The incomes are in the high $50s for both, the percentage
of college-educated players and Internet users is in the low 60s,
and 30 to 35 percent travel frequently. And there are so many ways
for golfers to use the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo golf course head pro Gary Monisteri is hard at work on
upgrading his own modest site to include tips and links, hoping
that golfers eventually will be able to make tee times over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think golfers like to analyze any and all parts of the game,
always wanting to study and learn and gather more info,'' he said.
``The Net offers them that vehicle for endless information.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``endless'' only begins to describe the extent of golf
information available on the Internet. There are the big news sites
_ GolfWeb might be described as the ESPN of golfers _ and magazine
sites, but there are places to find golf jokes, buy golf equipment
and seek divine intervention for one's golf game.
</P>
<P>
   Planning a trip to Scotland? www.golfscotland.com can get you
started. Want to get married on a golf course in the San Francisco
area? Start at www.weddinglinks.com and see where it takes you.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many golf sites on the Web, it's impossible to do
any kind of definitive top 10 list. Let's just call these 10
favorites:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cybergolf (www.cybergolf.com) is one of the best-looking and
liveliest golf sites around, and it still manages to load
remarkably quickly for all of its action. Two particularly great
features are the free stat tracker, to analyze your game by a
scorecard you can print and carry, and the video lessons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golf Link (www.golflink.net) specializes in bringing together
golf businesses and golfers, so the point of its Web site is to
draw you in and make you want to stay awhile. There are game tips
and a provocative feature called ``mind game'' to keep you busy,
and a fun little golf tale to keep you entertained. One great
feature is on photo tips for those who like to take pictures on the
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golf Online (www.golfonline.com) has come a long way in the
last year, transforming itself from an advertisement for Golf
magazine into an attractive, inviting and well organized
information center. Like the magazine's 18-holes format, there are
18 buttons, into areas for women, seniors, juniors, tours,
instruction, etc. One of the best February features is an animated,
slow-motion sequence of Karrie Webb's powerful swing, one you'll
watch again and again.
</P>
<P>
   _ iGOLF (www.igolf.com) has partnered with Golf Online to bring
you two great features. One is the Players Club, which for $19.95 a
year allows you to play the Pro Am Challenge fantasy game for great
prizes, gives you pro shop discounts and tracks your game
statistically; the other is the ``personal profiler,'' which asks
you 26 questions and then delivers lessons geared to your
weaknesses. The lessons will keep you busy for a while _ 101 were
offered in response to one query.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golf.com (www.golf.com) is produced by NBC and Golf Digest.
Its best features are its ``kidz golf'' pages of fun for juniors,
and its search engine, which can help reduce the clutter if you're
looking for specific tips or articles.
</P>
<P>
   _ GolfWeb (www.golfweb.com) is the giant in the industry, the
place to go for this minute's news from the golf world, with lively
commentary and the busiest discussion groups and forums around.
There's little that you can't find here, although it may take you a
while because the search engine is a bit unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golf Heaven (www.longdrive.com) is an advertising arm, but it
is worth an occasional look just for its joke of the month and joke
archives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Global Golf Guide (www.globalgolfguide.com) has something for
the discriminating golf traveler: multimedia fly-by tours of a few
of the best golf courses in the world, including Pebble Beach and
St. Andrews, plus travel information for those going overseas for
their golfing holiday. You can make tee times in Scotland right
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Golf Channel (www.thegolfchannel.com) is a useful tool for
those who are tuning in via satellite dish. You can participate in
most of their programs by e-mailing in your questions or comments,
or pick up a quick tip or video lesson from their instruction
pages.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour, LPGA, PGA of America and USGA all have worthy
sites, too, but there's one other site that's essential for every
golfer's bookmarks. That's the Weather Channel (www.weather.com),
where you can create your own home page that offers a five-day
forecast for your city and up-to-the-second Doppler radar and
satellite for your region.

VIDEO GAME BECOMES OSCAR CONTENDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID BLOOM   
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's an Odd, Odd, Odd, Odd World.
</P>
<P>
   Abe the Mudokon is a little different: froggy face, topknot, bad
posture, greenish skin, three-fingered hands, mouth partially sewn
shut. In short, a real looker.
</P>
<P>
   He's also the star of Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, the computer game
and now, a short, quirky animated tale trying to cadge an Oscar
nomination for best animated short film.
</P>
<P>
   Abe's creators at Oddworld Inhabitants of San Luis Obispo are
billing it as the first time a computer game's animations have
become the basis for an Oscar competitor, something
animation-industry observers say is probably correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true as far as I can see,'' said Wendy Jackson, a Los
Feliz-based animation consultant and writer. ``They don't really
have a claim unless they get nominated, but in terms of nomination,
it's never been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Baisley, editor in chief of Animation magazine in Agoura
Hills, said she can't recall any shorts based on videogame work
either among all the hundreds of pieces her staff sees every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe I've heard of one originating from a game,''
Baisley said. ``It hasn't been unusual to see that stemming from TV
shows or features, and it may have happened for one created for the
Internet. But probably not, because the quality of the Internet
animation is not good enough to (compete). Now (the competition)
has much higher production values.''
</P>
<P>
   The production values aren't a problem for the Oddworld piece,
however. Many recent games, created either for computers or
consoles such as Sony's PlayStation, use eye-popping animated
opening sequences and ``interstitials'' between game levels.
Powered by increasing graphics capabilities, programming savvy and
many of the same animation programs used in movies, the work is
increasingly of movie quality in games such as LucasArts Star Wars
Rogue Squadron on the Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   The great look of Exoddus in particular isn't a surprise,
either, given the Hollywood special-effects backgrounds of Oddworld
founders Sherry McKenna and Lorne Lanning.
</P>
<P>
   The two worked for most of two decades with such special effects
stalwarts as Douglas Trumbull and Rhythm and Hues before striking
out to create what McKenna calls ``movie-quality games.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first try, Abe's Oddworld, was a million-seller, leading
to the Exoddus successor and to the decision to create a separate
short film using some of the 25 minutes of high-quality
computer-generated animation they had created for that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just blown away'' last fall when Lanning showed her the
game's animation all strung together, McKenna said. ``I said, `This
is Academy Award stuff.' Then I said, `Wait a minute. Why not?'''
</P>
<P>
   To make the animation eligible for the Oscars, however, it had
to be released before the game came out, under Academy Award rules
designed to protect the film business. That gave Lanning two weeks
to create additional animation that would tie the interstitials
together in a coherent narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Then the company had to arrange a short premiere run in a
Burbank theater last October and show the film enough times before
a paying audience to make it eligible for the Oscars, McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Hollywood will (thumb) their noses at us, but so
what?'' McKenna said. ``At least it's a start. Maybe people will
realize not all games are the way we preconceive them.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece tells the story of Abe's crusade to save his fellow
Mudokons from oppression and extinction at the hands of another
grotesque species, the Glukkons, who use Mudokon bones and tears to
create an addictive drink at the SoulStorm Brewery.
</P>
<P>
   The short film is a first step in McKenna's long-term goal of
creating products that aren't violent, can appeal to a broad
audience and can be easily translated to movies, television and
other venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to eventually get into movies that we, as opposed to
Hollywood, control,'' McKenna said. ``We want to create a database
that can transfer to movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are successful this first time around will be
interesting to watch, said Jackson, because the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences just passed rules that made ineligible
animation created for television series and pilots.
</P>
<P>
   TV work had in the past been a fertile source of excellent
animated shorts from such cable children's channels as Nickelodeon
and the Cartoon Network, Jackson said. Now that part of the
increasingly busy field of animation is clear, though plenty of
other competitors here and abroad are still jostling for attention,
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have been some nominees in there'' from television
without the rules changes, Jackson said. ``Since those got nixed,
it really opened up some opportunities. I think the people at
Oddworld are very clever and saw an opportunity before anybody else
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest new area of competition will come from the companies
that make and use special-effects programs as they let their
employees create shorts both for corporate demo reels and to
provide them a creative outlet, Baisley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oddworld's'' major competition for the nomination includes
work from Walt Disney Animation, Digital Domain and Blue Sky
Effects as well as a stop-motion clay animation piece called
``More,'' Baisley said. That latter piece was created by Mark
Osborne with backing from the Large Format Cinema Association, a
trade group for the IMAX and similar massive-screen theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a big fan of the first Oddworld game, said she believes
``Oddworld'' can compete fairly well with those contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if anyone could do it, they proved themselves with
that first game,'' Jackson said. ``I'm really curious to see if the
academy will go for it though. Some folks in the TV arena might
feel a little jilted. But it's definitely an emerging area that you
can't ignore anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   BAMBI FIGHTS BACK: One of the most unlikely success stories of
recent years in the computer game business has been the runaway
sales of Deer Hunter and a series of knockoffs and successors,
mostly sold in stores such as Wal-Mart rather than traditional
gaming outlets.
</P>
<P>
   In them, would-be game hunters stalk a variety of prey with a
variety of weapons and locations. The games themselves are
generally startlingly low-tech, deliberate to the point of glacial
and widely mocked by the twitch-happy crews running most gaming
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The games also are ripe for parody, and that's finally come
along with Simon &AMP; Shuster Interactive's Deer Avenger for the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Avenger allows Bambo, the toughest buck in town, to take up an
M-16, bazooka or deer-pellet-laden slingshot against hunters. It
even comes with ``special hunter stalking devices,'' such as a
variety of hunter calls like ``Help, I'm naked and have a pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   As jokes go, it's pretty hilarious. As games go, it's not bad.
And it's sure to be the only hunting game likely to be played on
the office computers of the People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals. &QL;

DON'T BE BLIND TO PLUSES OF HAVING 3-BUTTON MOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.1998 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm a computer novice, but I just got a new one, and I really
like it. I have seen several references to three-button mice. I
went to look at them and even saw four-button mice! Can you tell me
why I might want more than two buttons? And why would I even
consider four?
</P>
<P>
   A: You certainly don't need more than two buttons, but having
three and maybe even four means more convenience.
</P>
<P>
   In Windows 95, 98 and NT 4.0, the left mouse button is used to
select and launch files and programs, while the right mouse button
is used to do all kinds of nifty things that are largely
conveniences. The most important is to generate pop-up menus. What
these menus include depends on what's being clicked upon, a feature
known as ``context sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   If you right-click on the open Windows 98 desktop, you'll get a
different set of menu choices than if you were to right-click on,
say, an icon on the desktop. Novices often don't play with this
feature, but it is very, very handy, and is a quick way to learn
about the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   For example, most people who use Microsoft Word, Microsoft Works
or Corel's WordPerfect probably cut or copy a word by highlighting
the word, then moving the mouse cursor to the button bar at the top
and hitting the Cut or Copy buttons. But you also can right-click
on the highlighted word and Cut and Copy will appear there as menu
choices. This is faster than dragging your mouse cursor across the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   What happens, though, when you add a third mouse button? Windows
doesn't have a natural use for a third button, though the software
that comes with these mice lets you program the middle button to do
things.
</P>
<P>
   On my system, for example, I have the middle button programmed
to act as a double-click. When I want to launch something that
doesn't respond naturally to the single-click feature of Windows
98, I use that middle button. When I was using Windows 95, which
didn't have the single-click option, I just about wore that middle
button out!
</P>
<P>
   Many mice now come with a wheel that doubles as a middle button.
The wheel is used to scroll up and down through long documents, and
it's great for reading Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   I use one of those four-button mice you talked about, a Logitech
MouseMan Wheel. The fourth button is where the thumb rests, and I
have it programmed to perform an auto-scroll _ click the button,
and all I have to do is move the mouse downwards and the page
scrolls automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's now a beta-test version of Internet Explorer 5 I can
get from Microsoft. I really like version 4, and I want to try 5,
but I have Windows 98. Since IE4 is integrated into the Windows
desktop, will installing 5 give me problems?
</P>
<P>
   A: It shouldn't give you any more problems than any other
beta-test software. Internet Explorer 5 is designed to work with
the Windows desktop, as is version 4, so you should not normally
anticipate any conflicts. I have it installed on a couple of
machines _ but not my everyday system _ and it seems to work just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   However, beta software is unfinished software. There is plenty
of work left to be done on IE5, and there are plenty of bugs in it.
If you have access to a secondary machine, I'd put it there first
before moving to the system that you use every day.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you buy the Office 2000 beta for Microsoft, it
will try real hard to convince you to install IE5, though it will
take no for an answer.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The time? About 10 years from now. The place? A busy
city newsroom. The circumstances? A breaking story, perhaps a
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter grabs a note pad, a tape recorder and something else:
a mobile journalist work station that includes equipment that will
plug the user into the Internet, allow transfer of information from
editors and tap into a data base of information about the
reporter's surroundings. It includes eyeglasses with built-in
liquid-crystal displays, a small high-speed wireless modem and a
global positioning satellite hookup that can pinpoint location to
within an inch.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vision of the future that a group at Columbia University
_ John Pavlik, director of the Journalism School's Center for New
Media, Steven Feiner, a professor of computer sciences, and some of
their students _ is working to make into a reality. A prototype of
the work station, about the size of a large backpack, is being
developed with about $120,000 a year in grants from the Office of
Naval Research and the National Tele-Immersion Initiative, an
organization that promotes the use of computer networking
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The system works interactively. In the future, a miniature
camera may make it possible to beam images from remote spots to a
home base, like a newsroom or a television studio.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlik said the work station, if eventually shrunk to an easily
portable size, could become an important information-gathering
tool, giving ``better access through wireless technologies to a
wide spectrum of information, including the Internet, but also to
remotely located experts and editors.'' It could provide immediate
context for reporting, he added, leading to greater accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The project was not originally developed as a reporter's tool.
Feiner was researching what is called mobile augmented reality when
he and Pavlik realized its journalistic possibilities. Feiner said
he hoped to make the work station no larger than a hand-held radio
and reduce the cost to about $150, so that it would appeal to
ordinary consumers. He said travelers could use it as an aid in
exploring cities, ``something akin to a Michelin guide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Naval Research has less pedestrian uses in mind:
it wants the work station to provide information to soldiers on a
battlefield. Dr. Larry Rosenblum, a researcher at the Naval
Research Laboratories, said, ``We want to give a marine a natural
interface without having him have to stop and punch into a
computer.''

TOILING NOT SO SECRETLY IN SWITZERLAND, A WINDOWS EMULATOR GAINS
ON  MICROSOFT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In painting the perils that could topple his mighty Microsoft
empire, William H. Gates likes to invoke the theoretical young
programmer toiling in obscurity somewhere, at work on the software
project that could overtake the industry-dominating Windows
software operating system.
</P>
<P>
   As effective a rhetorical device as Gates may find this when
confronting antitrust enforcers, he may not have considered the
possibility that the obscure toiler already exists in the person of
a 28-year-old Swiss programmer, Alexandre Julliard. For the last
four years Julliard has been coordinating a little-noticed
international project that is intended to let PC users run their
normally Windows-dependent programs on Linux _ a free operating
system, whose devotees would very much like to overthrow
Microsoft's hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   The project is known as Wine, which is short for Windows
emulator.
</P>
<P>
   In the computer industry, emulation refers to the ability of one
type of software to imitate software of a different technical
standard so completely that the difference is virtually invisible
to the user. If Julliard's Wine mission succeeds, it will be
possible for users of personal computers to operate all their
favorite Windows applications _ whether Microsoft's own popular
Word or Excel programs or thousands of others _ without need of the
underlying Microsoft Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the project cannot be considered a success. Most Windows
programs run only partly _ if at all _ with Wine, and using it
still requires a computer geek's special skills. But some 20,000
different users visit the Wine site on the World Wide Web
(www.winehq.com) every week. New versions of Wine are being issued
via the site every couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A data base at the winehq.com site keeps track of nearly 1,000
popular Wine-converted Windows programs and users' ratings of them.
The ratings use a scale in which 5 denotes perfect Windows
compatibility and 0 indicates the program will not even run. Wine
versions of Microsoft's Word and Excel currently carry low average
ratings of 1.4 and 1.6. But some games are earning high marks, like
Blizzard's Starcraft, which has a current rating of 4.6.
</P>
<P>
   Each incremental Wine improvement offers evidence of the growing
strength of the so-called open source software movement, a
quasi-spiritual commitment by engineers within the software
industry whose deity is the Linux operating system. In the open
source approach to software development, the original programmer's
instructions are freely shared and subsequent program development
frequently takes place on a volunteer basis. Proponents of the
movement, which is gaining a wide following around the world, argue
that open source is the path to higher quality, more reliable
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The motives are not necessarily nonprofit. Since last month, for
example, the Corel Corp., the big Toronto-based maker of programs
like Word Perfect and Corel Draw, has had more than a half-dozen
programmers devoted to the Wine project in hopes of speeding the
translation of the company's products to Linux.
</P>
<P>
   A Corel executive says the company is rapidly expanding this
effort and that other software companies are considering joining
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stepping up to contribute in a big way,'' said Derek
Burney, Corel's executive vice president for engineering. ``The
software is good, and when people realize that, it could turn into
an avalanche.''
</P>
<P>
   Julliard, who coordinates the Wine project as a volunteer effort
on nights and weekends from his home in Lausanne, Switzerland, says
such mounting support is encouraging. ``I think we have the means
to compete against Microsoft,'' he said. Like many people in the
open source community, he says he is motivated in part by his
dislike of Microsoft's business tactics and its control of the
computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most free software developers, I don't like them at
all,'' Julliard said of Microsoft. ``And I think their way of doing
business is hurting the whole computer industry.''
</P>
<P>
   If Wine were to succeed, it would be conceivable for PC users to
remain entirely independent of Microsoft's Windows operating
system. And that could make Linux, which until now has had its
biggest impact in the market for corporate server computers, a
direct head-to-head competitor with the heart of Gates' business.
</P>
<P>
   Julliard acknowledges that he and his informal Wine group of
some 150 programmers around the world are still far from achieving
their goal of creating what they envision as a level playing field
in the software world. And yet their effort could help expand the
emergent Linux movement beyond the current core of adherents, most
of whom are computer professionals responsible for corporate and
institutional networks.
</P>
<P>
   Unleashing the computer industry from Microsoft could bring a
new era of innovation in software and hardware alike, the Wine
backers say.
</P>
<P>
   At least those are the selling points being made in an effort to
attract corporate sponsors anxious for an alternative to
Microsoft's desktop dominance. To keep Wine going, Hal Bennett, an
independent Silicon Valley marketing executive, in December started
a grass-roots fund-raising effort he calls Bacchus.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has no publicly disclosed commitments so far,
Bennett is trying to persuade a number of corporations to make
significant financial commitments to the Wine project to speed its
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett says his fund-raising argument is compelling, in light
of current corporate computing costs. ``Large corporations are
paying a huge amount of money to Microsoft,'' he said, ``and that
would go to zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Wine backers in Silicon Valley hope Wine will
improve enough that computer makers will want to offer it and the
Linux operating system on new machines as an alternative to
Windows. Such commercial support from the hardware industry would
seem to be a necessary prerequisite if business computer users are
to rely on free software.
</P>
<P>
   ``At what point will Wine become stable enough for a computer
manufacturer to have the ability to say to a customer, `I'll ship
you this machine with either Windows or Linux?''' asked John Shoch,
a venture capitalist at the Asset Management Corporation in Palo
Alto, Calif. ``That would have the effect of clamping on
Microsoft's air supply and putting margin pressure on them for the
first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft does not appear ready to strap on the oxygen masks
just yet. Emulation software like Wine has ``many potential
Achilles' heels,'' said Ed Muth, a group product manager for
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers clearly make a big tradeoff when they use
emulation,'' Muth said. ``It is not as robust and reliable as
native implementations.'' He also predicted that the Wine group
would have trouble finishing its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``With emulation the last 10 percent of the compatibility takes
95 percent of the work,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If anything, Muth maintains, the Wine effort is a backhanded
compliment to Microsoft's Windows. ``The hype around Wine
demonstrates the applications that are of the most interest are
Windows applications,'' he said, ``and the most stable and reliable
environment to run Windows applications is Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly emulation as a strategy in the software industry has
had only limited success in the past, in part because programs
usually run significantly more slowly when they are emulated. Even
when successful emulation can be achieved, keeping the software up
to date can be a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, for example, the computer work station maker
Sun Microsystems Inc. developed an emulator known as WABI that was
designed to let the Windows programs available at the time run on
Sun's non-PC hardware. Although WABI was a technical success, it
ended up having little commercial value, in part because it was
impossible to keep up with the continuously evolving Windows
operating system standard.
</P>
<P>
   But Wine's supporters say that the program is not an emulation
program in the traditional sense of the word, because the software
is not converting Windows instructions to make them compatible with
the Intel microprocessors that are the brains of Windows PCs.
Instead, Wine restricts itself to mimicking Windows' applications
program interfaces _ small program modules within Windows that
provide the instructions to other programs for specific tasks like
saving a file on disk or drawing an image on the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general there are no fundamental technical reasons why
performance should be a problem for Wine,'' said Douglas Ridgway, a
physicist in Canada who maintains the winehq.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, the Wine fund-raiser, insists that the technology will
win adherents because of a wide perception that Microsoft's
domination of the software industry is stifling innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked at Xerox PARC in 1976 as a researcher,'' he said
alluding to Xerox's seminal Palo Alto Research Center. ``And now
it's 23 years later, and we have the same quality of computing.
That says that whatever forces have been in play in the computer
industry haven't been innovative.''

CHALLENGING PRICELINE.COM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Washington patent lawyer is challenging a fundamental patent
issued last summer to Priceline.com Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Thomas Woolston, contends that he filed for a patent
about 16 months before Priceline applied for its patent in
September 1996 covering an online auction system that allows
consumers to bid for items like airline tickets over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Woolston's patent, which was issued in December, in part covers
a computerized marketplace that enables ``the purchaser to
speculate on the price of collectibles in an electronic market for
used goods while assuring the safe and trusted physical possession
of a good.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Woolston, a baseball fan, first thought of his invention
as a way to buy and sell baseball cards over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although that is very different from the business that Priceline
conducts _ it advertises widely, with the actor William Shatner
concluding ``I told you Priceline was going to be big, really big''
_ Woolston contends that his patent covers the buyer-driven auction
model of doing business on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   His start-up venture, Mercexchange, is at this point little more
than a company name and a board in search of venture capital.
``We're defining our markets right now,'' Woolston said.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com operates a system under which consumers go to an
Internet site and name the price they are willing to pay for
airline tickets, hotel rooms and other items. Priceline then tries
to find an airline or other company willing to accept that price.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Walker, vice chairman and founder of Priceline, dismissed
Woolston's challenge. ``When you have a landmark patent, you have
to expect, as we did, that all kinds of people are going to come
out of the woodwork to claim that the Patent Office made a mistake
and that they really invented it first,'' he said. ``Our patent is
no exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolston said he discussed working with Priceline.com to develop
the auction technology but that the talks failed because the
company ``expressed no serious interest in cooperation.'' Woolston
has requested that the Patent Office conduct a proceeding known as
an interference. It could be months before the agency decides
whether to initiate such a review, which could then take several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, such disputes over issued patents must be fought out
in the courts. But for technical reasons, Woolston is able to
challenge the Priceline patent through the Patent Office _ a far
less costly way to challenge a patent.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said it was ``not inconceivable'' that the Patent Office
would grant the interference, but expressed confidence that
Priceline.com's patent would survive such scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline was assigned patent 5,794,207. Woolston received
patent 5,845,265.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 &HT;    Score a touchdown at Super Bowl party table
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Super Bowl Sunday is a uniquely American celebration of a
uniquely American game. In the 32 years since the first Super Bowl
was played in 1967, the day has turned into a grand nationwide
party. Not only for die-hard football fans but for just about
everyone else, it is almost impossible not to get caught up in the
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   While the TV is the center of this party, food plays an
essential role in Super Bowl Sunday tradition. This is not a day
for delicate souffles, fussy pastries or cucumber sandwiches. Super
Bowl food should be easy to eat, hand-held if possible, it should
be tasty, there should be lots of it and it should go well with
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl Sunday fare most likely will be eaten from the
La-Z-Boy or the sofa. It should be assumed that the eater can, at
any moment during the game, jump up, stomp, yell and maybe even
lose control of the eating mechanism altogether. The food could
easily end up thrown onto the carpet, or on the ceiling or hurled
at the dog. Got the picture?
</P>
<P>
   In spite of this, it is indeed possible to put on a lovely,
civilized and refined (well, maybe not refined) Super Bowl party
for your nearest and dearest fans.
</P>
<P>
   A must-visit is Kraft Foods Super Bowl site at
http://www.kraftfoods.com/html/features/superbowl/index.html, which
goes a long way toward helping you organize the shindig. It begins
with great suggestions on decorating your ``playing field'' (i.e.,
table) by covering it with green paper or plastic, using white tape
to create yard lines and the liberal use of toy footballs, pompoms,
pennants and megaphones. Then there is the food. Chicken wings,
chili and chips and dip are served by the metric ton on Super Bowl
Sunday. All fine fare, of course, but why not make this the year to
diversify?
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has divided the day into three sections, with recipes to
fit. First there is ``Warm Up,'' with recipes for hot and cold
appetizers, dips and punches. At ``Break and Huddle'' you will find
sandwiches and salads; and at ``Cool Down'' there are recipes for
post-game desserts and tempting coffees.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, though dated, at http://
cocktails.miningco.com/library/weekly/aa011998.htm, also offers
excellent advice, tips, activities, games, trivia and recipes.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to go light on the advice but are looking for tons
of Super Bowl recipes, Epicurious fills the bill. In attempting to
``elevate the tone'' of the event, Epicurious, at
http://food.epicurious.com/eeating/e04superbowl/superbowl.html,
comes up with a multitude of wonderfully creative menus and recipes
for pizzas, salsas, spreads, dips, sandwiches and noshes.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to any of these sites will help you score a touchdown on
the big day.

   Kathy Seamen's (e-mail) request for the Rocky Road Candy recipe
from the back of a 1982 package of Borden's chocolate chips was
answered by Irene Osborne of Morrow, who says she's used it for

`FLARING' SATELLITES IGNITE ASTRONOMICAL DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By Michael Browning   
 c. 1999 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Piercing the night with sudden shards of
light, a new globe-girdling array of 79 communications satellites
called Iridium, lofted by Motorola Inc., is already arcing across
the heavens, emitting brilliant ``flares'' from their
super-reflective antenna-panels, bedazzling and bedeviling
astronomers by turns.
</P>
<P>
   For earthlings able to afford the $3,000 cellphones capable of
using the satellites, the Iridium satellites are a modern miracle,
enabling instant wireless voice and data communication between any
two points, anywhere on the planet. The $500 pager units for the
network are manufactured locally, at Motorola's Boynton Beach
plant. The $5 billion system has already been successfully tested,
and Motorola hopes to have 5 million subscribers by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Six necklaces of 11 satellites each now surround the earth,
arrayed longitudinally, creating a bead-like electronic cage within
which the world slowly spins. Because some of the satellites have
malfunctioned and others are being used as backups, there are 13
more aloft than are actually needed.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere on Earth is unreachable anymore, thanks to this new
network.
</P>
<P>
   But an unanticipated side effect of the satellites _ brilliant
solar reflections of light as they pass overhead _ has caused
concern among astronomers, some of whom see the satellites as yet
another source of light pollution in a world where the magic and
majesty of the star-sown night sky are already under assault from
myriad streetlights and neon signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think it's a shame that yet another natural resource
has to be ruined by an unregulated commercial venture,'' said Mike
Stebbins, a computer analyst who is past president of the New
Hampshire Astronomical Society. ``Why should those of us who do not
wish to call the North Pole have to endure the clutter of those who
do?''
</P>
<P>
   Too new to gauge effect
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Fredrickson, president of the Astronomical Society of
the Palm Beaches, said the flares were too new a phenomenon to have
impacted club members yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that eventually the Iridium flares will become a
nuisance to people taking shots of different parts of the sky,
looking for comets, asteroids and novae in distant galaxies,''
Fredrickson said. ``We will have a ROBOscope project doing exactly
that, and I feel like it's just a matter of time before someone
takes a picture of one of these flares.''
</P>
<P>
   But, added Fredrickson, for people who are interested in
satellites, rockets and space flight, rather than ``pure
astronomy,'' the flares may prove exciting.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer intensity of the Iridium flares has to be seen to be
believed. For up to 20 seconds, the evening or early morning sky
will suddenly emit an eye-needling flash, 100 times brighter than
the planet Venus, equal to all the light of a crescent moon. Then,
as swiftly and unexpectedly as it appeared, the spark of light
vanishes.
</P>
<P>
   So bright are the flares that they can sometimes be seen in
broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Computer programs available over the Internet can help predict
to the second exactly when the flares will be visible and precisely
where in the sky they will appear.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned satellite observer Paul Maley, of the NASA/Johnson
Space Center Astronomical Society, was the first to correctly
identify the cause of the flares in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I learned that a bright glint had been observed by one
amateur astronomer in Canada (Dr. Brian K. Hunter of Ontario), then
another, it occurred to me that these might not be accidents,'' he
recalled. ``Many satellites can occasionally flare up to look like
very bright stars for short periods. But the super high brightness
of the Iridiums was the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the days went on, I began to do some reading on the
constellation design. Through professional contacts I was able to
get in touch with someone at Motorola. After that, things began to
fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the designers at Motorola were as surprised as
anyone to find that the satellites were flaring. It turned out that
the triple-vaned door-size Main Mission Antennas (MMAs), made of
aluminum and coated with silverized Teflon, were almost perfect
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-degree tilt of the antennas away from the axis of the
satellite would catch the sunlight and flash it down to Earth at
certain times and in certain places.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite watchers began to speak of the ``Golden Hour'' and the
``box,'' the time and place in the sky where Iridium flares were
most likely to appear.
</P>
<P>
   The satellites do not always live up to predictions. Some are
tumbling in orbit, useless. Others, for reasons as yet unexplained,
flare twice. The brightness of the flares varies, depending on how
far away from the center of the satellite's exact north-south path
the observer is standing; they are brightest in a narrow swath
about three miles wide.
</P>
<P>
   Two computer programmers, Rob Matson and Randy John, wrote a
program that is available on the Internet
(http://members.aol.com/skysatrj/) and Maley still recalls the
thrill of awaiting the launching of multiple Iridium satellites
aboard American, Russian and Chinese rockets. As the satellites
slipped into north-south orbit, all five flared gloriously, in
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In August 1997, I was able to videotape the flaring of all
five recently launched objects within a two-minute period as they
passed west of Houston,'' Maley said. ``It was quite unbelievable
to see one after the other brightening up to surpass the brilliance
of every star in the sky that morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iridium satellites contain no iridium. The name comes from a
miscalculated number. It was originally believed that 77 satellites
would be needed to cover the Earth completely, and 77 was the
atomic number for iridium on the periodic table of elements. Later
it was found that only 66 were needed, but since 66 was the atomic
number for the element dysprosium, and ``dysprosium'' doesn't sound
as catchy as ``iridium,'' Motorola decided to keep the original
name.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike high-orbit communication satellites, which relay a
terrestrial signal straight back to Earth, the Iridium array move
in low Earth orbit, handing off the signal from one satellite to
the next, like the baton in a relay race, until it reaches the
proper destination and is beamed down to a ground relay station.
Because the satellites travel north to south and south to north in
six orbital planes, the farther north or south you are, the more
flares you will see.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the North Pole, theoretically you could see as many as
1,000 flares a month,'' Maley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Blessing or a Curse?'' asked Florida-based astronomer Philip
Chien in one of the first articles to discuss the Iridium flares,
in the May 1998 issue of Sky &AMP; Telescope. Chien concluded that,
because the flares are so brief, and relatively predictable,
astronomers ought to be able to plan around them.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other light pollution
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more than 8,000 artificial objects in space, and
every one of them has the potential for leaving a streak on a
long-duration photographic exposure. So in percentage terms,
(these) additional objects and a handful of upper rocket stages do
not add up to a very large addition,'' Chien wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider the Iridium satellites as `light pollution,'
'' said Lee Dolan, responding to a question posted in connection
with this article on CompuServe's Astronomy Forum. ``Around where I
live (in a garden condominium complex) there are bright sodium
vapor lamps under the eaves, and I have enough trouble finding a
place around here where I don't have any lights shining in my eyes.
Tell me about light pollution!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit to being an Iridium addict,'' e-mailed Malcolm
Ellis of Cambridgeshire, England, replying to the same question.
``I find the predictability a great boon and conversation piece,
when I can say to friends, `Come outside and see this.' And there
spot, on time, a glorious flare. Even my 3-year-old grandson and
6-year-old granddaughter are impressed with my apparent
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Maley believes the satellites are an exciting new celestial
phenomenon, one that should literally spark people's interest in
the heavens. ``They are so highly visible, they are bound to draw
the public's attention to the sky.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Lawyer jokes, old-style
 &HT;    (Eds: Resending with headline, editing.)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Lawyer jokes ... You like 'em, I like 'em,
grandma likes 'em, everybody likes lawyer jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one I bet you haven't heard, though it's been around for
some 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Lee Thompson, having gone to school on the GI bill after
serving in World War II, had finally gotten his law degree,
returned home to Lufkin and hung out his shingle, eager for
business.
</P>
<P>
   Business, at it turned out, wasn't so eager for him. Days passed
into weeks, weeks into months while Billy Lee lived day to day,
hand to mouth, trying to support his young family.
</P>
<P>
   His friend and colleague, Clark Anderson, sought to reassure him
that the business would come, just give it time. This very day,
Clark would say, might be the day when the kind of lawsuit a lawyer
dreams of comes your way.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Billy Lee put much stock in what his friend said. Clark
was a good lawyer, but more than the law, Clark enjoyed a good
time. The secret to a happy life, he'd tell you, was to be happy.
</P>
<P>
   But, lo and behold, there came a day when a letter arrived in
Billy Lee's mail that promised exactly what Clark had predicted _
the kind of lawsuit a lawyer dreams of.
</P>
<P>
   Scratched out in pencil on notebook paper, it read something
like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Lee Billy,
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard from our cousin that you have made a lawyer. I want
you to know how proud I am. I always knew you would do good. You
come from fine folks, your mother especially.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you are busy being an important lawyer at the county
seat, but I hope you can find it in your heart to help me with this
terrible thing that has happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few months back, one of the company trucks ran over me while
I was walking past the mill on my way to Wednesday night prayer
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver was drunk, like he always is half the time.
Everybody had been telling the company they ought to fire him
before something like this happened, but they wouldn't listen. I
don't know why, but some people say it's because he is a nephew of
the owner's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upshot is, I am hurt bad in my back so that I can't hardly
get around. The company wants me to take some cash they've offered
but it doesn't seem like very much for how bad hurt I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much left, except those medals I brought back
from the war. I am hoping you can advise me on what to do. I am
afraid they are trying to take advantage of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still live in the same place, behind the school. You can
find it easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truly yours,
</P>
<P>
   ``Cousin John.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.S. Remember me to your dear mother.''
</P>
<P>
   No return address, no telephone number. The postmark indicated a
rural area that covered much of the south end of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Lee searched his memory for a clue as to Cousin John's
identity. He asked friends and family, and though some had a vague
recollection, nobody could recall for sure a Cousin John.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Lee took it on himself to find Cousin John, leaving the
office for days at a time, when he should have been working on
deeds and wills, driving the farm roads of the county, searching
for that house behind that school, wherever it was.
</P>
<P>
   It was several weeks later that the second letter arrived:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Lee Billy,
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought by now I would have heard something from you. I know
you must be busy but I need help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company lawyer is nagging me to sign a paper and take
their deal. I don't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``My back is getting worse, and the medicine the doctor
prescribed is awfully expensive. I am here almost all the time.
Please contact me soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truly yours,
</P>
<P>
   ``Cousin John.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Lee searched the south part of the county, the north part
of the county, the river roads and pig trails, but no Cousin John.
He was losing sleep over it and, worse, knew that he was about to
lose the chance of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   He could think of little else, night and day, even at parties
when members of the county bar association got together for no
other reason than to celebrate being lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   There Billy Lee stood, a cold drink in his hand, wondering if
he'd ever hear from Cousin John again, when Clark eased up behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Slapping him on the back, Clark inquired, ``How you doing, Lee
Billy?''
</P>
<P>
   So it was, all those years ago, when lawyer jokes were the jokes
lawyers played on each other.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Billy Lee and Clark are now lawyers in heaven, where, I
imagine, Clark is having a good time and Billy Lee is still trying
to get even.

 &HT;    Great performance by Hurt makes story of obsessive love
worthwhile
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Love and Death on Long Island'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see one of the best performances that probably
won't be nominated for an Oscar, you need to see John Hurt in this
melancholy but very funny spin on obsessive love.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt plays Giles De'Ath, a middle-aged writer who personifies
everything fusty, British and Old World. So it's more to his
surprise than anyone else's when he becomes enamored of a young
American teen idol named Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley), star of
a series of shlocky, ``Porky's''-like comedies. He tracks the young
star down in Long Island and insinuates himself into his life. But
the attraction is less a sexual one than a leverage for Giles to
awaken to the neon-bright possibilities of pop culture and to find
a brand new facet of his long-smoldering personality.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt is brilliant in the part (though Academy members may forget
his work since the film barely was distributed last year), and
Priestley is equally fine as the puppyish young stud. Grade: B+

 &HT;    Mini reviews of movies recently released on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' (R) _ A vivid, funny look at coming
of age on the fringes. Vivian Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne) is the
odd girl out in a post-divorce family led by a father (Alan Ar-
</P>
<P>
   kin) who, every three months or so, skips out on rent and moves
his brood to another fleabag on the edge of Beverly Hills. Director
Tamara Jenkins re-creates the humiliations of adolescence with
wince-inducing accuracy. Lyonne is terrific at navigating the
waters of teen angst. Grade: A -
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Smoke Signals'' (PG-13) _ A bittersweet coming-of-age comedy
about two Native Americans who leave their dilapidated reservation
to go to Arizona to fetch their father's (one biological, the other
spiritual) ashes. Rambling and rough around the edges, with a honed
casualness that suggests the early '70s, Chris Eyre's debut film is
still definitely worth a look. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Buffalo 66'' (unrated) _ Don't shuffle off to this
``Buffalo.'' Former Calvin Klein underwear model Vincent Gallo
wrote, directed and stars in this uneven fable about an ex-con who
kidnaps a voluptuous teen (Christina Ricci) to pose as his wife
while he visits his parents (Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston). The
first half is amusingly bonkers, thanks to the cast, but overall,
the film is all over the place _ self-pitying and sardonic, arty
and maudlin. Grade: C -
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Return to Paradise'' (R) _ Hardly paradise. Three guys party
hard together in Malaysia. Two (Vince Vaughn and David Conrad)
return home and find out, two years later from a lawyer (Anne
Heche), that the third (Joaquin Phoenix) has been jailed on drug
charges since they left and will be hanged in eight days unless
they return to share the responsibility. But that also means
sharing the jail time. It's a terrific moral dilema that's
squandered by an inept script. Grade: C-

 &HT;    You name it _ title can make, break a flick
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's in a name? Plenty, according to the movie marketing
mavens. That's why ``Playing by Heart,'' ``Stepmom'' and ``At First
Sight'' are on theater marquees instead of ``Dancing About
Architecture,'' ``Goodnight Moon'' and ``Sight Unseen.'' That's why
``Lost Moon'' became ``Apollo 13'' and ``Everybody Comes to
Rick's'' became ``Casablanca.'' And why just about every movie
Woody Allen has ever made wasn't released under its original title:
``Untitled Woody Allen Project.'' Here are some pictures you might
want to rent at your local video store. Just don't look for them
under their original title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Thousand''
</P>
<P>
   You know it as: ``Pretty Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The original title was ``Three Thousand'' because that's how
much money Richard Gere first promises Julia Roberts in the film.
But according to director Garry Marshall, when test audiences were
given the premise and that title, they thought it was something
about hookers from the moon (maybe their memories of ``2001: A
Space Odyssey'' got them confused).
</P>
<P>
   ``My Posse Don't Do Homework''
</P>
<P>
   You know it as: ``Dangerous Minds''
</P>
<P>
   The original title was ``My Posse Don't Do Homework'' because,
as is so often true with name changes in Hollywood, that was the
title of the book by LouAnne Johnson, the inner-city teacher whose
experiences provided the movie's framework. But words such as
``Posse'' and ``Homework'' didn't exactly scream ``new Michelle
Pfeiffer movie.'' To her credit, Pfeiffer fought with the producers
(Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer) over the title change, but she
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cop Tips Waitress $2 Million''
</P>
<P>
   You know it as: ``It Could Happen to You''
</P>
<P>
   The original title came from a tabloid newspaper headline that
topped the real-life story of a New York cop (Nicolas Cage) who
gave a waitress (Bridget Fonda) half a lottery ticket in lieu of a
tip. The marketing department should've worried less about the
title and more about how to sell audiences on this low-key charmer
(it tanked in theaters). But the dominant artistic force in
Hollywood _ the test audience _ decreed the title was too
descriptive. According to writer-director Andrew Bergman, the focus
groups felt, ``You sit there waiting for (Cage) to give her the
money.'' As opposed, I guess, to waiting for Godzilla to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stray Dogs''
</P>
<P>
   You know it as: ``U-Turn''
</P>
<P>
   Director Oliver Stone preferred the original title for his cult
film starring Sean Penn as a drifter who runs into trouble in the
form of Nick Nolte and Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   But the powerful Stone had to bow out when an even more powerful
(well, more venerable) director objected. Japanese master Akira
Kurosawa threatened to sue, claiming it was too close to ``Stray
Dog,'' the English-language title given one of his films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anhedonia''
</P>
<P>
   You know it as: ``Annie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he got past the ``Untitled Woody Allen Project'' phase, the
filmmaker wanted to call his 1977 Oscar winner ``Anhedonia,'' which
means an inability to experience pleasure. But then he found out
that no one knew what ``anhedonia'' meant. However, the new title
wasn't just a way of giving in to everyone else's more limited
vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggested a shift in emphasis in the movie, from Allen's
own misery to his relationship with Diane Keaton.
</P>
<P>
   Other titles you won't find: ``Suck the Bullet'' (``Dead Men
Don't Wear Plaid''), ``Dangerous Days'' (``Blade Runner''), ``Billy
the Third'' (``Tommy Boy''), ``I Was a Teenage Teenager''
(``Clueless'') and ``E.T. and Me'' (guess what?).

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 The Trials and Tribulations of PC Installations  
 By Dan Fost   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past few months, I've heard Bill Gates and Craig Barrett
_ the chief executives of computer giants Microsoft and Intel _
give speeches exhorting the industry to make personal computers
easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, as I helped my mother-in-law buy and set
up a new PC, I learned that Gates and Barrett still have some work
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about the endeavor was easy. Not the purchase, not the
setup, not even filling out the rebate forms.
</P>
<P>
   Although selling to my mother-in-law, a self-described computer
illiterate, is a challenge, she is precisely the type of person the
industry needs to win over if it is to continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   My in-laws are great, but technologically, they're stuck in a
time warp.
</P>
<P>
   I heard a computer consultant tell my brother-in-law last week
that his company now had e-mail and that a Web page would be up and
running soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great,'' my brother-in-law replied. ``What's the
difference between e-mail and a Web page?''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, his parents are not too far ahead of him. In
fact, the most active e-mailer in the family is grandma, who just
traded up to an iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Intel CEO Barrett knows the problem. A month after he turned 59,
he told an industry gathering in Palm Springs, ``The main reason
people my age don't want to use a computer is they're afraid
they'll break them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's my mother-in-law. She's 62 and has the time and the money
to own a computer but fears crashes and error messages.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of people, she just wants it to work.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 years, she's used a PC with a 286 MHz processor.
It ran DOS, had no graphics and used near-obsolete 51/4-inch floppy
disks. But it worked. She was happy.
</P>
<P>
   She recognized, though, that her computer at home should be
compatible with the Windows 95 machines at her office, and she also
wanted to tiptoe into e-mail and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I told her she probably didn't need to spend more than $1,000
for a computer, and I said she should ask for a 56K modem, Windows
98 and Microsoft Word _ basic stuff.
</P>
<P>
   She asked a family friend, a retiree who spends hours on end
chatting away online in his basement.
</P>
<P>
   He sent her to a small firm in the Portland suburbs that
custom-builds computers.
</P>
<P>
   She went to that store. She might as well have gone to Ulan
Bator, Mongolia, for all she understood. She faxed me the specs.
</P>
<P>
   It was virtual gibberish: gigabyte 100 MHz P2/ATX motherboard,
64 MB 100 MHz SD-Ram Dimm memory, ATI 8 MB 3D AGP Xpert'98 video
card, and on and on. Is a normal person supposed to understand
this? In deciphering the list, I saw it was actually a heck of a
deal: a 350 MHz chip from Advanced Micro Devices, a 17-inch
monitor, 64 megabytes of RAM and a 4.3 gigabyte hard drive _ even a
separate 51/4-inch floppy drive, so she could transfer her old
files _ all for under $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   So I said, ``Buy it.'' So she bought it.
</P>
<P>
   When I got to her house, I took everything out of the boxes and
tried to hook it up. It seemed to go fine, except they had
forgotten to add the 51/4-inch drive, and there was no place to
plug in the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   We called. They said, ``Oops.''
</P>
<P>
   We took it back to the store. They installed the drive, gave us
a quick tutorial and shoved us out the door.
</P>
<P>
   We took it home, hooked it up and _ because I had already
ordered her an Internet account _ tried to get online. It started
to dial, and the screen froze.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, every time we tried to connect, even to Microsoft to
register the software, the screen froze and the dialing stopped.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the system did not have Microsoft Word _ the only
reason she really needed a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, because it was a custom-built computer, it came with no
manuals. No support.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I left town for a week of skiing and my
mother-in-law returned the computer. When I returned, I had one
afternoon to help coordinate the purchase of a new machine for her.
</P>
<P>
   A sales clerk at Office Depot was very helpful. He taught us
some vagaries of the computer we were eyeing: It comes with
Microsoft Works. If you wanted to upgrade to Microsoft Office 97
(even though it's now 1999), that's $200. If all you want is
Microsoft Word, that's also $200, so you might as well upgrade
because Word is part of Office. (Ah, Microsoft.)
</P>
<P>
   We bought a Hewlett-Packard 4450, with an HP monitor (because
that way you get a rebate) and an HP printer (because then you get
an even bigger rebate). In picking a printer, we kept in mind that
my mother-in-law didn't care about color cartridges or dots per
inch but that she just wanted no paper jams.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, my wife and her father were able to un-box it and
plug it all in. Things seemed to be getting easier. Yellow cords
went into yellow plugs. HP had included a manual and a big colored
map.
</P>
<P>
   (I couldn't be there because, in my burgeoning career as a
computer consultant, I was at grandma's, trying to sift through all
the little drawings on America Online.)
</P>
<P>
   I stayed up late, loading Office 97 and getting the Internet
service provider configured.
</P>
<P>
   My wife sought to assemble the rebate material, which turned out
to be a scavenger hunt for receipts, serial numbers and labels
carved off of the giant cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, just before I headed to the airport, I showed
my mother-in-law the machine. ``Let's send an e-mail,'' she said
excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   The machine dialed in. She wrote her e-mail. She hit send. The
program quit, the modem disconnected, the screen froze, and I
taught her the magic of control-alt-delete.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,'' she said. ``I'm just going to use it as a word
processor.''

 &HT;    Skaggs' picking keeps tradition ticking
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ricky Skaggs modestly says he's ``just trying to make a living''
from bluegrass music, but fans of his fast flat-picking and high
lonesome sound safely assume the money's secondary to him. An
accomplished childhood player who tired of touring and retired _
briefly _ at age 19, Skaggs, 44, deftly carries the driving,
often-syncopated sound perfected by Bill Monroe and Ralph Stanley,
two of his several idols, toward the next century. Solidly
classical are the ``Ancient Tones'' on ``How Mountain Girls Can
Love'' and ``I Believe in You Darling.'' At the same time, a lovely
new instrumental (``Connemara'') and a fresh tune about the old
disasters of the heart and mines (``Coal Minin' Man'') prove
perfection-chasing Skaggs and his powerful Kentucky Thunder band,
up for two bluegrass Grammys when the awards are made Feb. 24, can
generate as well as replicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ancient Tones''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs Family Records / DNA. 11 tracks.
</P>

   The verdict: Great, by anyone's standards but his own.

 &HT;    DiFranco shifts into jazzier gear
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody's cooler than Ani DiFranco, the scrappy, self-invented
singer-songwriter and roving cult figure who, if you follow the
business pages of The New York Times, has put her hometown,
Buffalo, N.Y., back on the road to financial prosperity _ seemingly
single-handedly. The success of her record label, Righteous Babe,
and the steady growth of her audience, puts DiFranco in an enviable
spot: She can flirt with celebrity but still cruise just under
pop's often-compromising radar.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new-school folkie's last album, ``Little Plastic
Castle,'' threatened to blow her cover, ``Up Up Up Up Up Up'' is
low-key and much less conceptual. It's a loose-hanging collection
of songs that shifts between socially conscious observations (``
'Tis of Thee,'' the title track) and emotional conversations with
lovers and family. The thoughtful protest stuff is heartfelt but
disposable, while the confessionals often boast a raw, engaging
integrity. Slippery grooves, funky organ vibes and the singer's
sometimes risky forays into jazz-style vocalizing give the album an
improvisatory flow that's quietly refreshing, even though there's
nothing here with the visceral punch of 1995's artistic
breakthrough, ``Dilate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Up Up Up
</P>
<P>
   Up Up Up''
</P>
<P>
   Ani DiFranco. Righteous Babe. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>

   A funkier, friskier DiFranco.

It's easy to stay on time, anywhere in the world 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My computer runs at 400 MhZ (Macho 6, or 0.24 ounces
per thousand of blood testosterone). Nonetheless, it was 10 minutes
slow this morning.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered this lamentable condition while examining a neat
little program called Time and Measures, from QM Labs.
</P>
<P>
   In its default configuration, T&AMP;M presents the user with a
two-frame window, the larger showing a pretty globe. You can rotate
it side to side, up and down. To do anything with it, you find the
country in which you are interested, zoom in until you find a city,
and click on the city.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller frame will then provide you with the correct date
and time in that city, as well as its longitude and latitude in
case you are navigating. If you don't want to go through all this
show and tell, you can just select a city from a long list.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the program's only trick. As the title indicates, it
will also convert measurements: Fahrenheit to Celsius or Kelvin in
temperatures, and English/metric in weights, volume, area and
distance. Type the number you wish to convert into the appropriate
box, click convert, and the conversions are shown instantly.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you type ``3'' into the ounce box, you get not
only what that amounts to at every level of metric weight, but its
portion of a pound and even a ton.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few disappointments in T&AMP;M. It doesn't have as many
cities as it should _ nothing is shown, for instance, between Accra
and Monrovia on the west coast of Africa. One assumes the
intervening countries and capitals are all on the same time zone,
but it seems as though they ought to be there nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   In the weight conversion feature, grains are not addressed.
</P>
<P>
   T&AMP;M costs $35, and you can download a free demo from
http://www.qmlabs.com. However, if you are connected to the
Internet, you really don't need to buy a program for these
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Date and Time Gateway at http://www.bsdi.com/date/ will give you
the time _ OK, it's military time, but I know you can figure it out
_ for just about any city in the world. Local Times Around the
World at http://www.hilink.com
</P>
<P>
   .au/times/ does the same. Global Metric Time Service (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .globalmetric.com/time/) is a nice site intended to let you set
up a list of five cities and get the local time there every time
you log in.
</P>
<P>
   For measurement conversions, all you need _ more than you need,
probably _ is Megaconverter (http://www.megaconverter.com/). Here,
you can find that 1 U.S. gallon is equal to 15.68628 Danish paegl,
as well as 3.78541 liters. It will also tell you that 4.5 grains
equals 0.01029 ounces, or 0.00072 Polish funts.
</P>
<P>
   In checking on the time sites, I discovered my computer's clock
was running 10 minutes slow. At the National Institute of Standards
time page (http://www.bldrdoc.gov/timefreq/javaclck.htm), I found a
neat little program you can download, then run every time you log
onto the Internet. It will check with the NIS page, reset your
clock to conform with the atomic clock, and go away in the blink of
an eyeball _ 0.815 of a second, or 1.51 Moldavian grunts.

 &HT;    `Damage' wreaks classy havoc
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Juliette Binoche was ``Oscar winner Juliette Binoche''
(for ``The English Patient''), she glowed opposite Jeremy Irons in
``Damage,'' a steamy but classy tale of a conservative politician
who risks his career and his marriage when he becomes sexually
besotted with his son's new girlfriend. An artful application of
cool gloss to raw acts of betrayal and passion, the movie burns
like dry ice. Now, here's the bonus: The DVD version offers both
the unrated and the R-rated cut. Plus an interview with the
director, the late Louis Malle.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Let your mouse find that phone number 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Afew years back, the virtues of the then-new computer
CD-ROM drive found a real home with truly useful programs that
allowed you to look up telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot more useful than using a telephone directory,
because the programs harness the computer's ability to search
through a lot of information.
</P>
<P>
   So if you had an old friend named Fields who used to live in
Arkansas, you could try directory assistance, but you wouldn't get
very far. But, using the CD, you had a good chance of finding him.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you remembered his first name, or knew the city he lived
in _ information would help you narrow the search.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a big downside to these CD programs. For one
thing, they were enormous. Even the massive storage provided by the
CD wasn't enough to hold every telephone listing in the country,
all the addresses and all the phone numbers. So, if you had to
search for that same name in several regions of the country, you
might have to change discs three or even four times before finding
the right number.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the online world has made a real difference. There
are several fine Web sites where you can perform the same sort of
searches, looking for names, phone numbers, addresses, even e-mail
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Although using the Web to look up numbers can be slow, and if
you have only one phone line, you have to log off to place the
call, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   First, the information is stored in a giant database, so you
don't need to spend time changing CDs. Second, the information is
usually updated often. CD programs also offer updates but _ unless
you want to buy a new update a couple of times a year _ it's
unlikely the information will be as current. Third, since there are
several sites that offer this type of help, you can switch from one
service to another and search more records than you could with a
single program.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's take a look at some of these Web-based search
services.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best is called Switchboard, and you'll find it at
http://www.switchboard.com. As you would expect, you can use it to
find a telephone number or an address. And it also is a good source
for e-mail addresses. (Be careful, though. People seem to change
e-mail addresses about as often as shirts and _ before sending off
a personal note based on what you find _ send a test note to make
sure you are reaching the correct person.)
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard is reasonably fast (although there will be times
when the load of a lot of simultaneous users slows things down).
And it's usually accurate. So just those attributes, coupled with
the fact that it's free _ unlike a CD program _ make it worth
using. But, as they say on those late-night TV commercials, there's
still more.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you don't know the name but do know that you need to
find a specific professional.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for doctors, lawyers, dentists, accountants or
Realtors, for instance, you can search the directory using those
categories.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially handy if you are in unfamiliar territory
geographically and need help.
</P>
<P>
   Another service that works much the same way is Bigfoot at
http://www.bigfoot.com/. While, subjectively at least, Switchboard
seems more likely to find a match, Bigfoot is a good service and
definitely worth bookmarking.
</P>
<P>
   That's because neither directory is as complete or thorough as
your hometown phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Some names are missing from these services, and you can't beat
the convenience of searching both services.

 &HT;    
 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As a 10-year-old glued to the TV through the summer of
Watergate, I remember the air of gravity that hung over the
proceedings, the sense that it was a dreadful necessity to put a
president on trial.
 &HT;    I don't recall authority figures having to explain that it was a
national crisis _ even to a kid, that was pretty obvious.
 &HT;    And yet, one of the oddest things about the impeachment weekend
just before Christmas was the constant stream of reminders that
America again was again experiencing such a crisis. Legislators and
commentators kept trying to find more dramatic ways to frame the
events taking place.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton, they intoned, was about to become only the SECOND
president ever impeached. He would be our FIRST ELECTED president
ever impeached. All through the holidays and on into January the
tone remained the same: We were having the first Senate trial of a
president in 130 YEARS.
 &HT;    Watching TV was like having someone grab you by the lapels and
shout, Don't you understand this is supposed to be historic!
 &HT;    Clinton's impeachment is historic in the sense of it being an
event historians will puzzle over in decades to come. But what
those historians will have to ponder is not how it shook the
country, but why it didn't. They will have to explain how the
country experienced the form of a constitutional crisis without the
content of one, how an impeachment could drive a president's
approval rating up instead of down.
 &HT;    They may be better disposed than contemporary observers of the
Clinton scandal to look beyond the Dow Jones industrial average for
an explanation. For Clinton's weathering of the Lewinsky scandal
represents something that is truly historic _ a break in the way
the American presidency functions.
 &HT;    For the 60 years or so that preceded Clinton's election in 1992,
the nation lived through what might be described as the heroic
phase of the American presidency. Not that all modern presidents
have been heroes, of course. But beginning in the late 1920s, the
country was enveloped in a succession of crises _ the Great
Depression, World War II and the Cold War. We measured our
presidents against their roles in these great events.
 &HT;    Thankfully, we're now living in different times. The nation is
at peace and growing more prosperous, not merely or even mostly as
a consequence of executive decision-making, but as a backdrop to
it. This places a different and in some ways more difficult burden
on the leader of the free world.
 &HT;    An American president now has a more diffuse and bewildering
job. He must focus on a series of comparatively minor problems at
home, make sense of international confusion and compete for the
public's attention with more captivating forms of entertainment.
 &HT;    Clinton has not failed to keep his public entertained. To some
it has seemed like a tragedy, to others a sitcom. Following the
pattern of his career in Arkansas and of his accident-prone 1992
campaign, Clinton as president has repeatedly toyed with ruin,
practically digging his own grave, only to pop back up,
Houdini-like, after everyone thought he could no longer be
breathing.
 &HT;    With his impeachment on charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice, his dialogue with disaster has reached what is likely to
be its final phase (though another eruption is always possible).
 &HT;    The debate is no longer over Clinton's continued viability as a
politician, because he faces no more elections. The stain of
impeachment cannot be washed away by what he does in his remaining
time in the White House, because part of what his impeachment means
is that the House of Representatives is no longer much interested
in doing business with him.
 &HT;    A conviction in a Senate trial would make Clinton history sooner
rather than later, but whether he is convicted, acquitted or
censured as a result of some Senate-White House deal, it does not
seem too soon to try to characterize his presidency. Clinton is the
president who, for better and worse, turned the White House into a
governor's mansion.
 &HT;    Clinton was worried about his legacy long before he learned, a
year ago, that the world was about to learn about Monica Lewinsky.
In his book, ``Behind the Oval Office,'' Dick Morris described a
Sunday-morning phone conversation in August 1996 on the topic of
how Clinton would rate in the history books.
 &HT;    Clinton agreed he wasn't a top-tier president, but wondered what
he could do to make it into the ranks of Morris' second tier, with
Harry Truman, Theodore Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson and Ronald Reagan.
(Morris said he'd have to do three big things: make welfare reform
work, balance the federal budget and smash international terrorism,
on top of some littler things.)
 &HT;    Though the word ``legacy'' has a positive cast, presidential
historians often use it to convey a more neutral meaning. A legacy
is properly understood as a mark left on the country for good or
for ill. Popular democracy is Andrew Jackson's legacy. The national
park system is part of Theodore Roosevelt's. The New Deal, which
molded the modern federal government, is FDR's. Watergate is
Nixon's.
 &HT;    There are legacies of neglect, such as Ronald Reagan's bequest
to his successors of a vast federal budget deficit (offset by his
affirmative legacy of drawing the cold war to a surprising and
successful close). Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush, to
name three of our last five presidents, arguably left no major
legacy at all. The same is true of the late-19th-century presidents
who populate the murk between Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt.
 &HT;    We know something else about presidential legacies. Matters that
loom large now will diminish in retrospect. Clinton's popularity,
and by extension his survival as president, do rely heavily on the
extraordinary strength of the economy, now in the eighth year of
what will soon become our longest known peacetime expansion. But
over time, even that impressive statistic is likely to fade in
importance.
 &HT;    A lousy economy can define a presidency, as it did for Herbert
Hoover. But the simple fact of a good economy tends not to make a
legacy. If it did, Eisenhower, Johnson and Nixon would be
considered greater presidents than FDR and Truman.
 &HT;    There is already a rough consensus among historians that Clinton
is a significant president. He stands to be remembered, most
obviously, for causing a big scandal and getting impeached, but
also for getting re-elected, something no Democrat since FDR had
done.
 &HT;    But Clinton, I think, will also be remembered for reforming the
federal government and for reshaping his party. Most strikingly,
Clinton, like Andrew Jackson and FDR, has changed the very nature
of the American presidency. Where those two presidents expanded the
role and importance of the presidency, Clinton has downsized the
office, both in the negative sense of stripping away some of its
dignity and in the positive one of making adjustments demanded by
the historical moment.
 &HT;    Coming to the White House from the governor's mansion in Little
Rock, Clinton has recast the presidency on the more modest model of
his previous job. Unlike presidents, governors have few
opportunities to be visionaries. Instead, they do what Clinton has
done _ a job of crisis management, political accommodation and
governmental reform.
 &HT;    In one way, the public doesn't expect much from a governor; in
another way it expects a great deal. A governor is expected to
address whatever issues arise, from upgrading the skills of his
state's work force to reducing traffic congestion on its highways.
 &HT;    Financial constraints deny governors the possibility of grander
schemes. Within the confines of balanced and limited budgets,
however, they can distinguish themselves with creative
social-policy ideas. In smaller states, the governor is a familiar
figure whose blunders and foibles are as well known as his cartoon
caricature.
 &HT;    If the governor proves himself intelligent and capable, people
tend to be willing to indulge a fair amount of rascality on his
part. As flawed as he may be, he's all that protects them from a
Legislature that's inevitably far worse than he is.
 &HT;    Governors, of course, don't shape foreign policy. There's no
doubt Clinton will be remembered as primarily a domestic president
and perhaps the first in a line of domestic presidents who followed
the Cold War.
 &HT;    Clinton ran on domestic and economic issues in 1992, in answer
to George Bush's international focus. His platform, ``Putting
People First,'' the most detailed policy statement ever issued by a
candidate, elaborated a series of ideas about how to make
government more effective.
 &HT;    Clinton has improved a range of federal agencies and programs.
But what may stand as most significant is not just that he mended
broken policies, but that in fact he managed to restore the feeling
among Americans that domestic government works.

 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    From his first presidential campaign, Bill Clinton was guided by
a revised philosophy of government's role.
 &HT;    Perhaps one of the most underappreciated things Clinton did
during his first year in office was expanding the Earned Income Tax
Credit, a program by which the federal government supplements the
income of low-wage workers.
 &HT;    Clinton's notion was that if you work full time, you shouldn't
have an income below the poverty line. A government commitment to
this principle exemplified his reform liberalism. As a successor to
the New Deal-Great Society archetype of ever-expanding social
benefits, Clinton proposed a more modest, reciprocal model, one
based on what he has described as an exchange of opportunity for
responsibility, and hence a model based on more limited
expectations of what the federal government can do.
 &HT;    During his 1992 campaign, Clinton characterized this notion, in
a phrase coined by Will Marshall of the Progressive Policy
Institute, as the ``New Covenant.'' Clinton's subsequent successes,
such as national service and welfare reform, have come from
applying this notion of a limited social contract.
 &HT;    His early failures occurred when he strayed from it, relapsing
into the older pattern of delivering new federal benefits from on
high. Most notable was his failure in health care.
 &HT;    It's possible that a better-designed and more politically astute
plan could have placed his presidency on stronger footing. But
Clinton botched the design and marketing of his plan, setting
himself at odds with moderates in both parties whose support he
needed.
 &HT;    Considering himself a centrist reformer, Clinton didn't see the
potential for his ``managed competition'' scheme to be portrayed as
an oldfangled liberal spending program.
 &HT;    What Clinton didn't yet get was the depth of the discontent with
the way government was working. When he took office, trust in
government had been steadily eroding for a quarter century. In
1964, 76 percent of Americans told pollsters they thought they
could trust government to do the right thing all or most of the
time. In 1994, the year Clinton's plan for health-care reform
fizzled, the number who said they trusted government bottomed out
at 15 percent.
 &HT;    The nature of this disillusion is a debate of its own, but it
was based at least in part on the failures of government in welfare
and public housing, in worsening crime and deteriorating public
education.
 &HT;    This loss of confidence easily attached itself to Clinton's
attempt to award the federal government another vast
responsibility. Clinton was regarded as someone who had promised
change and failed to deliver. This frustration came to fruition in
1994.
 &HT;    Not until the ascendancy of the Gingrich Congress did Clinton
fully grasp the depth of disenchantment with Washington. But from
that point on, Clinton began to understand that he had to grapple
with this corrosive skepticism.
 &HT;    Michael Waldman, Clinton's chief speech writer, remembers
sitting with him in the White House residence working on last
year's State of the Union address. At one point, according to
Waldman, Clinton paused and remarked that ``FDR's mission was to
save capitalism from its excesses. Our mission has been to save
government from its own excesses so it can again be a progressive
force.''
 &HT;    The idea of Clinton as the savior of liberal government will
strike many as perverse. Following the 1994 election, Clinton faced
tremendous criticism, not just from Republicans but also from
Democrats who felt he was trying to jettison, inan effort at
conciliation, the party's bedrock beliefs.
 &HT;    The lightning rod for this anger became his nefarious political
consultant Dick Morris, whom Democratic traditionalists saw as
pulling Clinton not in the direction of reform, but toward a dead
centrism derived from opinion polls. Clinton was much ridiculed for
proposing microinterventions like free walkie-talkies for
neighborhood watch groups.
 &HT;    But what Clinton was beginning to understand was that
government's failures weren't arcane managerial issues; they were
questions of public trust. While devising gubernatorial-scale
programs that encapsulated his New Covenant approach, he proceeded
to address the two biggest causes of that mistrust.
 &HT;    First, Clinton agreed to the Republican goal of a balanced
budget. But where the GOP long supported a balanced budget as a
means of downsizing government, Clinton saw it as a way to
reinvigorate government. From his first economic plan in 1993,
Clinton regarded the deficit as a problem serious enough to warrant
putting many of his pet projects on hold.
 &HT;    What he subsequently discovered was that by operating within the
context of a balanced budget, he could argue for expanding spending
in certain areas, like school construction or national service,
without being accused of fiscal irresponsibility. The federal
budget had become like a state budget. Only if government was
convincingly limited in size could it hope to get away with
activism.
 &HT;    His second and arguably more important decision was following
through on his campaign promise to end welfare ``as we know it.''
Many liberals mistook Clinton's interest in the subject as
political; they saw the subtext as race baiting. In fact, Clinton
saw welfare as disruptive of the proper relationship between
government and its citizens. The system's unpopularity was not just
because of its being counterproductive or a waste of resources, but
because it offered something for nothing.
 &HT;    Members of Clinton's cabinet objected strenuously to his
decision to accept a modified Republican bill based on the idea of
block grants, and a few of his own policy makers resigned in
protest over the issue. The smoke of battle obscured the fact that
Clinton was following through on his New Covenant notion of welfare
reform and not merely acceding to a punitive rollback.
 &HT;    Clinton could also see that the country's governors, already
embarked on a variety of welfare-reform experiments, were in the
best position to know how the system might be fixed. Only in the
last year has it become evident that Clinton did reform welfare
largely in the way he said he would with pretty much the results he
anticipated.
 &HT;    Welfare rolls have declined from 5 million families in 1995 to 3
million in June 1998. A downturn in the economy could curtail this
progress by making it harder to place people in jobs, but at the
moment the national picture is one of drastically declining levels
of dependency with scant evidence of increased misery.
 &HT;    These promising signs have been accompanied by progress in other
areas in which government has failed. Under Henry Cisneros, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development actually began breaking
up pockets of concentrated poverty by tearing down parts of the
worst urban housing projects and moving to voucher-based subsidies.
 &HT;    Cities have also benefited from two changes that may have been
largely incidental to Clinton's agenda _ a big drop in crime and
the end of a long-term increase in out-of-wedlock births. Together
these developments have begun to have a tipping-point effect for
America's urban centers.
 &HT;    It's too early to say that these improvements have restored the
30-year slide in faith in government. But from its low in 1994,
confidence in government had recovered more than 20 points by early
1998. Impeachment has driven it down a bit _ but to nowhere near
its lowest level.

 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Before Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, conventional wisdom
held that the Democrats faced a crisis. After 12 years of GOP White
House rule and defeat in five of the previous six presidential
elections, the party had seemingly ceased to become competitive at
the presidential level.
 &HT;    Peter Brown's 1991 book, ``Minority Party: Why Democrats Face
Defeat in 1992 and Beyond,'' was one of several arguing the thesis.
White working-class and suburban middle-class voters, according to
the conventional wisdom, were abandoning the party in droves
because of its excessively liberal positions on crime, welfare,
foreign policy and ``values'' issues.
 &HT;    How could the Democrats become politically competitive again in
an era when what the party once stood for _ an expanding federal
role _ was proving less and less popular? The party itself was
deeply divided over how and whether it should evolve.
 &HT;    On one side was a group of centrist reformers clustered around
the Democratic Leadership Council. On the other was a rump of
liberal traditionalists, including labor unions and minority groups
who viewed DLC positions as treasonable to their basic beliefs.
 &HT;    Clinton has faced the problems of his party _ at least at the
presidential level _ methodically, systematically and effectively.
To a remarkable degree, he has succeeded in making once seemingly
incurable ailments vanish, while giving back to the Democrats the
kind of well-oiled national political machine they had before 1968.
 &HT;    His first task was pulling thorns from the party paw. Asked
which party did a better job handling crime, voters chose the GOP
by a margin of 18 points in 1991.
 &HT;    Clinton reversed this pattern by jettisoning Dukakis-era
positions such as opposition to the death penalty while exploiting
the one aspect of the issue where public opinion diverges from the
dictates of GOP interest-group politics: gun control.
 &HT;    Clinton doesn't have much of a basis for claiming that it's his
policies that have reduced crime rates over the past several years,
but he has put away the charge that Democrats don't like punishing
criminals. Recent surveys show the parties polling essentially even
on the issue.
 &HT;    What's most remarkable is not that Clinton has taken crime and
other reliable wedge issues away from Republicans. It's that he has
done so while unifying a party that was itself divided over these
issues. In 1992, both the New Democrats and the traditionalists
supported Clinton in the belief that he was, at heart, one of them.
 &HT;    Perhaps inevitably, both sides were disappointed in the way he
governed. For much of his first term Clinton was out of favor with
the center or the left of his party, or both at the same time.
 &HT;    In his first two years, the DLC saw Clinton as swinging left
with his health-care plan and tax increase. In his second two
years, liberals griped over Clinton's accession to a balanced
budget and welfare reform. But by the time of the 1996 election,
Clinton had again forged an alliance.
 &HT;    Many people are puzzled about how Clinton has been able to
appease liberal constituencies while flouting their principles _
confronting unions with Nafta, poor blacks with welfare reform,
teachers with charter schools and feminists with Paula Jones.
 &HT;    The simplest explanation is that he has restored a model last
seen among Democrats during the presidency of Lyndon Johnson, when
those joining his coalition got to experience victory and taste
power. Clinton has created a sense of partisan pride powerful
enough to quell the narcissism of small differences.
 &HT;    This thrill of putting up a good fight against a common enemy _
something presidents as different as Ronald Reagan and Franklin
Roosevelt once created and used _ has overcome ideological and
sometimes moral scruples. Democratic activists have taken the
advice Clinton gave a group of them in 1981: ``When someone is
beating you over the head with a hammer ... take out a meat cleaver
and cut off their hand.''
 &HT;    It hasn't always been pretty, or even, perhaps, ethical. Since
1992, Clinton's style has been to dispense with qualms and play
politics in as ruthless and relentless a way as the GOP. In the
1980s, Reagan and George Bush were charged with relying on polling
to an unprecedented degree. Clinton has gone them one better,
market-testing his rhetoric, then deploying it with a numbing
repetitive precision.
 &HT;    He answered the slick fabrications of Michael Deaver with the
more subtle and compelling mythography of Harry Thomason and Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason. He dug deeper for dirt on his opponents,
devised more effective 30-second attack ads and showed great
ingenuity in exploiting loopholes in the campaign finance law.
 &HT;    The biggest change is financial. In the 1980s, the GOP advantage
in fund-raising was as high as 5 to 1. In the 1992 election cycle,
Clinton and Ron Brown, then chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, whittled it down to 3 to 2. In 1996, Clinton and Harold
Ickes nearly caught up in the chief corporate category, so-called
soft money, bringing in $123 million to the GOP's $138 million.
 &HT;    They did this with willful blindness about the sources of these
funds. Clinton's attitude is that because the rules aren't enforced
and Republicans are preventing him from creating a level playing
field, he is free to fight as dirty as they do.
 &HT;    Since the Lewinsky scandal, various sectors of the ideologically
disgruntled Democratic ``base'' _ those who might be thought to be
less than keen about Clinton's small-bore, poll-driven,
corporate-friendly centrism _ have been the president's staunchest
supporters.
 &HT;    Black leaders disappointed with Clinton over matters ranging
from the balanced budget to welfare reform have flocked to his
defense. Among blacks, Clinton's approval rating remains as high as
Ronald Reagan's rating was among conservative Republicans.
 &HT;    This is a testament in part to the real feeling Clinton evinces
over racial issues, as well as to black sensitivity to
prosecutorial unfairness and sympathy for victims of persecution.
But it also speaks to a different kind of party, one in which
members are willing to settle for half a loaf.
 &HT;    Republicans, on the other hand, now face the problem of a
radical base that has lost its willingness to postpone
gratification. The adage that Democrats look for heretics while
Republicans seek converts has ceased to apply.
 &HT;    To a remarkable degree, the parties have switched places.
Clinton's political formula is now almost universally regarded as a
winning one for Democrats. All of the serious contenders for the
2000 Democratic nomination have indicated their desire to continue
in the same basic direction.
 &HT;    Al Gore, Bill Bradley and John Kerry have all positioned
themselves as Clinton Democrats. The potential contenders who do
not fit this profile _ Paul Wellstone and Jesse Jackson _ are
running as protest candidates. Clinton's ``Third Way'' formula has
an international following as well. From a historical viewpoint,
the question is whether a Democratic successor will be able to
carry off Clinton's balancing act within the party.
 &HT;    There is a worrisome analogy in the GOP, where Reagan became a
successful two-term president by appeasing the religious right
while reaching out to moderate voters. Bush's efforts to sustain
this equilibrium made the Republican right truculent to the point
of self-destructiveness. Today the GOP remains badly divided,
looking back to the Reagan years as an irretrievable golden age.
 &HT;    Clinton's successor, almost certain to lack his political gifts
and perhaps his ruthlessness, faces an enormous challenge in
maintaining the Clinton coalition.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even if President Bill Clinton is not convicted by the U.S.
Senate and does finish his second term, impeachment will still be
in the first paragraph of his obituary.
 &HT;    At some level, Clinton can't escape becoming a historical joke.
 &HT;    He is now and forever our priapic president, who takes his place
alongside our drunken president, Ulysses S. Grant, our napping
president, Calvin Coolidge, and our treacherous president, Richard
Nixon.
 &HT;    Whatever else he does in office, Clinton will not be able to
keep this out of his capsule biography: He's the one who had oral
sex with a 21-year-old intern in the Oval Office, got caught, lied,
caused a national spectacle and saw it undermine his second term.
This story line may be tempered with sympathy.
 &HT;    In a longer view, Clinton's libido may not differentiate him
from Franklin Roosevelt (who died with his mistress, not his wife)
or John Kennedy (who arranged orgies in the White House swimming
pool). But it will be hard to avoid the view that there was
something more reckless about Clinton, because he had no basis for
thinking the press would protect him, as it did his predecessors.
 &HT;    Nor can Clinton escape his reputation for being slippery. He is
not the first president to lie, or lie under oath. But he will
surely be remembered as someone who habitually played games with
the truth.
 &HT;    Clinton is the president who said he never inhaled, who told a
national audience, ``I did not have sexual relations with that
woman'' _ and considered it true because his definition of sexual
relations did not include receiving oral sex.
 &HT;    The most evasive of these lines, such as ``It depends on what
the meaning of the word 'is' is,'' are destined for inclusion in
Bartlett's. Clinton is to hairsplitting legalisms what Yogi Berra
is to tautological absurdities; he seems nearly to have invented
the form.
 &HT;    It will also be recalled that he was disloyal to friends and
took advantage of people who worked for him. Early in his
presidency, Clinton failed to stand by nominees in trouble, even
when they were old friends like Zoe Baird. He has taken advantage
of faithful aides, using and disposing of them when convenient, as
with Harold Ickes, whom Clinton threw overboard after Ickes
finished the dirty work involved in getting him re-elected.
 &HT;    His sexual incontinence was itself a betrayal of people who
spent years working for him, some of whom faced their own legal
problems because they helped protect him. He led subordinates like
his former press secretary Michael McCurry to damage their own
professional reputations by amplifying his lies. Clinton will be
remembered as, among other things, a cad.
 &HT;    But more significant than what the impeachment episode says
about Clinton's character may be what it tells us about national
mores at century's end. Contrary to the prediction of many
reporters, myself included, the scandal not only did not end his
presidency; it actually made a president re-elected on a ``values''
agenda more popular.
 &HT;    When the scandal first broke a year ago, Washington reporters
were still dealing with the issue of whether to protect the public
from information they assumed it was too unsophisticated to handle.
Few suspected how much the rest of the country had changed in the
previous decade. The America of today is no longer the America of
1987, the year that Gary Hart was driven from a presidential race
by the Donna Rice scandal and that Clinton decided not to go for
the nomination after his aide Betsey Wright presented him with a
list of ex-lovers capable of sabotaging his candidacy.
 &HT;    Clinton is not simply the beneficiary of the arrival of a more
tolerant moral standard; he is personally responsible for its
application to politics. He was the first presidential candidate to
publicly acknowledge that he had committed adultery. Some have
argued that, based on the famous ``60 Minutes'' appearance, in
which he acknowledged causing pain in his marriage, there was an
implicit bargain between Clinton and the voters. If we elected him,
he promised to sin no more.
 &HT;    But the real proposition was direct and explicit: Clinton stood
for office on the basis of what he could do rather than who he
would be. Unlike previous presidents, he proposed to be hired on
the basis of his abilities and his approach to government, not his
qualities as a moral exemplar. He was promising to be a good
governor.
 &HT;    Such a promise is built into Clinton's own view of government.
His notion of a ``New Covenant'' implies a transformation in
expectations. Washington no longer delivers solutions to our
problems; it merely helps us to solve them. Not looking to
government as an all-purpose savior implies no longer putting
politicians on a pedestal.
 &HT;    To perform their new role, leaders don't have to be ideal human
beings, superior projections of ourselves. They merely need to
understand our problems and help us grapple with them. If they hold
up their end of the bargain, by governing well, we won't go beyond
ours by judging them harshly for inevitable human failings. While
he has surely tested our commitment to this pact, Clinton has held
up his end of it.
 &HT;    The compact that Clinton embodies has emerged as our country's
de facto standard of political morality. We are still less
dismissive of marital infidelity than, say, the French. But like
the Europeans and Canadians, we now distinguish public from private
in the lives of our leaders, and forbear from judgments about the
latter.
 &HT;    The new rules have not taken hold everywhere yet. Much of the
press has yet to assimilate the concept that most of the public no
longer considers intrusive reporting about private lives relevant
to democratic decision-making. Nonetheless, a president with a rare
ability to compartmentalize his psyche has ratified a new attitude
toward the private lives of public figures.
 &HT;    You can go further than that and say that the Lewinsky scandal
says something not just about the development of American political
morality, but also about American morality in general. A quick
survey might leave one with the impression that the 199os were the
decade that Puritanism died.
 &HT;    Since Clinton has been president, homosexuality has gained
public acceptance; legal gambling has swept the country;
pornography has become ubiquitous; and vice has been redefined as
disease. Meanwhile, the public has become unshockable about sex and
unconcerned about presidential adultery. These changes imply that
traditional morality has receded.
 &HT;    But something more complicated is going on. The same public that
has forgiven Clinton his trespasses holds to a strict personal
morality and has endorsed Clinton's emphasis on ``values'' in
government programs - what Prof. Michael Sandel of Harvard calls
Clinton's repudiation of ``moral neutrality'' in public policy.
 &HT;    The harmonization of these seeming contradictions may be arising
from the increasingly subtle distinction Americans are making
between the public and private realms. One striking thing the
sociologist Alan Wolfe shows in his book ``One Nation, After All''
is that while American suburbanites are far from relativistic in
their own moral views, they shrink from judging the private
behavior of others, and dislike moralizing when they see it
practiced. At the same time, they want government policy to support
their values.
 &HT;    The Lewinsky scandal writes these distinctions large. Few
approve of Clinton's behavior. Yet the vast majority object even
more to casting stones at the president for mistakes in an area
where he is answerable to his family and his God, not to voters or
the media. Though these mistakes may make it impossible for Clinton
to talk about values any longer, voters care more about how he
applied his views in public - welfare reform, for example - than
how he violated them in private.
 &HT;    Clinton didn't devise this ethic, but his election and survival
encapsulate it. He leaves behind an electorate that wants its
values embedded in public policy, but that no longer moralizes
about private behavior.

 &HT;    
 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The most common explanation for the animosity against President
Bill Clinton is that it is an expression of ``a culture war.''
 &HT;    In their strenuous dislike of the president, the idea goes,
conservatives are fighting a battle over the 1960s and its legacy.
Clinton is the first baby-boomer president, the first who dodged
the Vietnam draft and admitted to smoking marijuana.
 &HT;    His conservative opponents, including many members of the same
generation, see such a figure as a threat to the moral order.
During the impeachment fight, Tom DeLay, the House Republican whip,
described it as ``a debate about relativism vs. absolute truth.''
 &HT;    But the culture-war argument doesn't do justice to an antipathy
that goes back to Clinton's candidacy. I think there are three
separate psychological profiles of Clinton-hating, which have
blurred together at times.
 &HT;    _ The first type of Clinton-hater is liberal, and he does derive
his hatred from the 60s.
 &HT;    His is the view that Clinton is a fundamentally disingenuous and
inauthentic person who uses public interest as a cover for private
ambition. This opinion, which is manifest in much of Clinton's
press coverage, does not draw a line between the personal and the
political. The problem isn't that Clinton committed adultery or
that he lied about adultery.
 &HT;    Indeed, these lapses have inclined liberal critics to support
him. What they object to is that Clinton cares about winning more
than he cares about principles; that he has thrown overboard such
worthy causes as civil liberties, intervention in Bosnia, human
rights in China and campaign finance reform.
 &HT;    _ A second kind of hostility to Clinton is neither liberal nor
conservative but comes from the Washington establishment. Sally
Quinn, the journalist and Washington hostess, has written that the
Clintons ``dissed'' Georgetown society by neglecting its advice and
avoiding its company.
 &HT;    This is true, but the falling out goes well beyond a mere social
snub. By downsizing the presidency and ushering in an era of a less
ambitious federal government, Clinton has made Washington and its
establishment less important. By turning away from both foreign
affairs and big-ticket domestic programs, Clinton has made
Washington less central to the concerns of the nation than it was
in the days of SALT treaties.
 &HT;    Turning the presidency into the country's biggest governor's job
is contrary to the political establishment's sense of the office
and their relation to it. By allowing the Lewinsky scandal to
happen, Clinton has turned the American presidency (and by
extension those who feed off it) into an international
laughingstock.
 &HT;    ``Clinton acted ... as if he does not recognize what it means to
be president of the United States,'' wrote David Broder, a
Washington Post columnist, after Clinton's first nationally
televised mea culpa.
 &HT;    _ The third and most potent kind of Clinton-hating is
conservative, but is related to the liberal kind in its aversion to
a Democrat who plays politics to win. Instead of being pleased that
Clinton has enacted parts of their agenda, Republicans are furious
at him for co-opting the best bits of it.
 &HT;    With the end of their monopoly on such issues as crime, welfare
and balancing the budget, Republicans are forced to contend with
Democrats over issues where their positions are distinctly less
popular: education, the environment, Social Security and social
issues like abortion and homosexuality.
 &HT;    Clinton's seizure of the center has driven the GOP to the right,
empowering the radicals who want either to legislate on the basis
of a narrow moral code or drastically curtail the federal
government's role, or both. To conservatives, Clinton didn't win
the center legitimately. He stole it from them.
 &HT;    But the question of Clinton-hating finally transcends
conventional political analysis. It's personal and aggravated.
Detestation of the president is worsened by the phenomenon of
sustained public support for Clinton, which his opponents find
baffling. Why does this man's approval rating rise in the teeth of
humiliation?
 &HT;    At one level, Clinton's supporters have made a pragmatic
judgment that he governs in their interest. But at another level,
he draws on a reservoir not of love, not of respect even, but of
identification.
 &HT;    This identification works in two directions. It is partly the
public's identification with Clinton, the perpetual underdog who
refuses to ever quit fighting. To a public that consumes quantities
of confessional entertainment and self-help advice, Clinton's
turmoil seems not bizarre, but familiar.
 &HT;    His cyclical progress through stages of sin, denial, contrition
and forgiveness has humanized him like no previous president. To a
public that had already accepted Clinton with his faults, the Starr
report arrived not as a shocking indictment, but as a juicy soap
opera with footnotes. As with other celebrities, Clinton's
screw-ups are a comforting reminder that he isn't any better than
the rest of us and doesn't think that he is.
 &HT;    But possibly more important is the way Clinton himself
identifies with regular people. No one who has ever seen him work a
rope line or entertain questions at a town meeting can fail to be
impressed by the way that he engages with ordinary people.
 &HT;    In public forums, Clinton is not just indefatigable, requiring
his aides to forcibly pull him away from people who want to shake
his hand at the end of an evening. He is, unlike any other
politician of this generation, in his element with a crowd _ black,
white, religious, academic _ it almost doesn't matter.
 &HT;    Clinton moves an audience by empathizing with its feelings and
concerns. The way he draws sustenance by relating to strangers is
part and parcel of his political talent.
 &HT;    Clinton-haters of all kinds often describe the president's
caring about the problems of regular folk in terms of fakery. They
think his ``I feel your pain'' act is exactly that, a fraud, rather
than an expression of natural sympathy. There is in their anger at
him something of the mystification with which the liberal
intelligentsia beheld Reagan's popularity with the rest of the
country.
 &HT;    It's as if Clinton's bond with the public was based on some kind
of black art. In Reagan's case, this was chalked up to the mesmeric
power of his acting (a power never attributed to him during his
screen career). With no ready explanation of how Clinton does it,
conservatives like William Bennett have often taken the route of
becoming infuriated with the public for falling for such a
charlatan.
 &HT;    In both the popular defense of Clinton and the elite attacks
upon him, one hears the echoes of the passions evoked by two former
presidents: Andrew Jackson and Franklin Roosevelt. Jackson, like
Clinton, was twice elected president on the basis of a powerful
mutual identification with the public.
 &HT;    Conservatives suspected and feared Jackson's popularity, because
it represented a different version of democracy from the one the
founders had envisioned, a kind they saw as close to mob rule. FDR
had a similar bond with ordinary people, which opened up a well of
class resentment.
 &HT;    People who called Roosevelt ``that man'' felt that as a
patrician populist he was a phony and an opportunist. Many of
Clinton's critics see him likewise as a beneficiary of meritocratic
privilege who has seduced the heartland. They fear him, as they
feared Jackson and FDR, as a demagogue.
 &HT;    Clinton's bond with the public is based less on economic
unfairness than was Jackson's or Roosevelt's and more on a kind of
post-ideological pragmatism. He has devised an idiosyncratic
populism, based on the sense of him as a personally flawed but
public-spirited and highly intelligent leader ready to fight to his
last breath for the people who elected him.
 &HT;    Redefining government's role will never make Clinton beloved in
the way FDR is beloved. But he may well be remembered as a
president who squarely faced the big problem presented to him with
the resources at his command.
 &HT;    Someday, the loathing that Clinton provokes may be understood in
the context of his role in creating a post-Cold War presidency.
Americans may recognize that liberals objected to a narrower role
for government, that the Washington establishment resisted his
diminishing its stature and that conservatives objected to his
substituting prudent downsizing for radical deconstruction.
 &HT;    Knowing Clinton as it has known no other incumbent president,
the public has nonetheless refrained from judging him _ or at least
has been willing to judge him in his complexity, separating his
private behavior from his record.
 &HT;    Clinton is likely to remain an equivocal figure, a man of
significant accomplishments and flawed character, who created
gratuitous troubles but defined a social transformation in
surviving them. He may come to be remembered as the most
paradoxical president: an undisciplined man who restored trust in
government, while inspiring almost none in himself.

REWRITE A CLASSIC MUSICAL? WHATEVER WORKS GOES. 
</HEADLINE>
   (Budgeted earlier as ANNIE-GET-YOUR-GUN)  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 24)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With all the usual madcap agony of making theater,
they are trying to fix another big-budget musical out of town.
Songs that fall flat are rejected. Characters that don't click are
re-thought. The running order of numbers is rejiggered, the bad
jokes are rewritten, the ethnic stereotypes that crept in are
removed, the bumps in the plot repaved.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-town notices, especially in The Washington Post, add
to the jittery sense of work to be done: while kind to the star,
they are less than enthusiastic about the $6 million production.
``We can't afford this kind of review when we get to New York,''
says one concerned participant.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of a new musical: it's all so ``Act One,'' all so
invigorating. Hey, hold on a sec. Did I say new?
</P>
<P>
   The show in question is ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' and while the
frantic pre-Broadway preparations, with Bernadette Peters as
pistol-packin' Annie Oakley, are indeed occurring in 1999, the date
on the musical's copyright is 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a critical and popular success in the '40s,
running on Broadway for 1,147 performances, the show, with music
and lyrics by Irving Berlin and book by Herbert and Dorothy Fields,
has long been considered unrevivable, in large part because of its
outdated portrayal of Indians, starting with a deadpan chief who
utters things like, ``Sitting Bull go to see Great White Father
about Indian Territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution that the show's producers, Fran and Barry Weissler,
came up with for ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' which begins previews Feb.
2 at the Marquis Theater on Broadway, is one that has become
increasingly common in musical theater: wholesale renovation;
treating the original as a shabby apartment with unnecessary
clutter and a lot of potential.
</P>
<P>
   Annie, get your makeover. A museum curator might be drawn and
quartered for suggesting the application to a Jackson Pollock of a
few more squiggly lines. An architect might have his drafting board
confiscated for trying to replace the smoky windows of the Seagram
Building with mirrored glass. Even the practice of bowdlerizing
Shakespeare and other writers of classic plays and operas, so
prevalent in the 18th and 19th centuries, seems positively quaint
these days.
</P>
<P>
   But in musical theater, tinkering with _ even shouting over _
the voices of the originators is not only acceptable, it's
expected. In the name of what ``works,'' whether that refers to a
musical's structural logic, believability of character, duration of
performance or sensitivity to the feelings of audience members of
every persuasion, producers and directors, writers and
orchestrators are blue-penciling old scripts and scores as never
before.
</P>
<P>
   The days of the revival-as-museum piece, thankfully, have
receded; one has only to compare the gigantic yawn that greeted
Harold Prince's stultifying 1987 remounting of his original
production of ``Cabaret,'' with the euphoria surrounding Sam
Mendes' current down-and-dirty ``Cabaret'' at Studio 54, to
understand that an immense shift has occurred in what the public
responds to.
</P>
<P>
   The era of nostalgia, ushered in nearly 30 years ago by the
Broadway revival of ``No, No Nanette'' and productions by the
Goodspeed Opera House like ``Very Good Eddie,'' reigns no more.
When today's audiences pay to gaze at the past, they want a lot
more than golden memories; they want to feel as if a tried-and-true
form speaks to the contemporary world.
</P>
<P>
   The musical theater, though, has never responded particularly
well to the sort of radical updating popularized in stagings of
operas by directors like Peter Sellars, who leave the classic texts
untouched but add modernist commentary by modifying time and place
and adding pop-cultural flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   Musicals _ perhaps because they are essentially period pieces
tied more closely to the pop music and cultural and commercial
trends of a given moment _ usually do not prove as elastic.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Chapin, president of the Rodgers and Hammerstein
Organization, which strictly monitors every new production it
sanctions, had an epiphany earlier in his tenure, when he attended
a production of ``South Pacific'' at New York University, staged by
the experimental director Anne Bogart.
</P>
<P>
   ``She set it in a rehabilitation ward,'' Chapin said; the show
was performed by actors playing emotionally disturbed war veterans,
as a kind of therapy. He recalls being told that the text was not
altered, and while he found it interesting, he thought it a lot
less resonant than what the work's original creators had put
onstage. ``It was weird, it was wrongheaded, it was fascinating,''
Chapin said. ``What it told me was how strong this material truly
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's clear that talented theater artists can bring out
new colors in works previously seen as bland and worn-out: witness
the glowing reviews for Trevor Nunn's darker (and not rewritten)
``Oklahoma!'' for the Royal National Theater.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue is the validity of overtly invasive
procedures on the actual texts, verbal or musical, that remold
certain aspects of old musicals to contemporary taste. How much can
you alter ``Annie Get Your Gun'' before it is no longer ``Annie Get
Your Gun''? Does a politically corrected Indian character make it a
better musical, or simply more palatable to a wider audience? Is
the process of reconfiguration a refinement or a whitewash?
</P>
<P>
   The books of many older musicals are clunky and cliched _ which
sometimes is their charm. But the process of revising them most
commonly means fiddling with those texts, which in the early days
of the modern musical were often little more than primitive devices
to fill the space between songs.
</P>
<P>
   As theater historian and critic Ethan Mordden notes in his
multi-volume study of 20th-century musical theater, sophisticated
musical plays like ``My Fair Lady'' and ``Gypsy,'' with fully
integrated books, did not come into their own until the 1950s. (To
this day, creating a strong book remains one of the musical
theater's most persistent problems.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This season, four major musical revivals on Broadway _ ``Little
Me,'' ``Peter Pan,'' ``Annie Get Your Gun'' and ``You're a Good
Man, Charlie Brown'' _ were or are being reworked to some
considerable degree, ranging from the new material Neil Simon
handed in for his own original book for the 1962 ``Little Me,'' to
the overhaul the director Michael Mayer has engineered for ``You're
a Good Man, Charlie Brown.'' The sweetly episodic 1967 musical
based on the ``Peanuts'' comic strip by Charles Schulz opens at the
Ambassador Theater on Feb. 4. (The fifth, ``On the Town,'' which
closed last Sunday, left the period book more or less intact, but
could never overcome another fundamental problem, integrating the
choreography with Leonard Bernstein's lush score in a meaningful
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's a new book,'' Peter Stone said of ``Annie Get
Your Gun.'' The veteran librettist, with credits stretching from
``1776'' to ``Titanic,'' was hired to bring the structure and
sensibility of the musical into line with shows of the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The score has changed, too. Not only have numbers been added and
others reshuffled _ ``There's No Business Like Show Business'' now
opens the show _ but some Berlin standards deemed unsuitable, like
``I'm an Indian, Too'' (``Just like Battle-Ax/ Hatchet-Face,
Eagle-Nose/ Like those Indians/ I'm an Indian, too''), have been
subtracted entirely. And now it's a deliberate put-on when Sitting
Bull sound 'em like this.
</P>
<P>
   Changes can be as cosmetic as those in the current revival of
``The Sound of Music,'' in which songs from the movie adaptation
have been added to the stage production. Other shows are
compilations of a musical's previous incarnations, like Prince's
well-received ``Show Boat,'' or are reconstituted songbooks
(``Crazy for You''), or a patchwork interpolation from assorted
projects by a songwriting team (Rodgers and Hammerstein's ``State
Fair'').
</P>
<P>
   Not every revival involves rewrites: in the hands of a good
director, a sublime classic like ``Guys and Dolls'' or ``Carousel''
almost seems to reinvent itself, with nary a change in punctuation.
But revising has become so commonplace that the books of lesser
musicals, even those by established writers, have come to be
treated as if they were rough drafts.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer, whose production of ``A View From the Bridge'' by Arthur
Miller won the Tony Award for best play revival last June, said
that a show like ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' originally
produced in the more intimate surroundings of off-Broadway, needed
pumping up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went back and listened to it and read it again, I
realized pretty quickly I would have to make changes,'' he said.
``I wanted a fresh, contemporary feel. Otherwise, it would have
been hard for me to do. This way, incorporating a new kind of
texture, a whole new physical production, injects the audience into
that world freshly.'' As a result, there is a new opening, two new
songs (by a new songwriter, Andrew Lippa) and even a major new
character (Charlie Brown's little sister, Sally).
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, first-rank theater people like Mayer might
have looked on revival duty as mop-up work. But with recent
successes, like Nicholas Hytner's beautiful and brooding
``Carousel'' for Lincoln Center Theater and Jerry Zaks'
effervescent ``Guys and Dolls,'' the theater elite is flocking to
the archives. Nunn's new ``Oklahoma!'' is a runaway smash in London
and due on Broadway next season. The playwright David Henry Hwang
(``M. Butterfly'') is working on a new version of Rodgers and
Hammerstein's ``Flower Drum Song''; Terrence McNally (who wrote the
libretto for the musical ``Ragtime'') has a new book for ``Pal
Joey'' in the works, and Christopher Durang (``Sister Mary Ignatius
Explains It All for You'') has written a new adaptation of the 1937
``Babes in Arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The race to yesterday by these major playwrights is a signal,
perhaps, of a mature genre with more glory in its past than in its
future. It would be foolish to pronounce the talent and energy
involved in what amount to second-generation creations not worth
the trouble. Still, how much license to alter history makes sense?
And what gets lost in the process?
</P>
<P>
   One of the more predictable by-products of the revision craze is
a kind of purging of material involving racial and sexual
stereotypes, an ethnic cleansing, if you will, of an earlier era's
biases. As with ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' for example, the director
of the recent ``Peter Pan,'' Glenn Casale, found the nonsensical
Indian dialogue objectionable in the ``Ugg-a-Wugg'' number and
excised most of it.
</P>
<P>
   Casale, in an interview, also said he was put off by the idea of
Tiger Lily and her followers traversing Neverland in search of Lost
Boys' scalps. Instead, he decided to emphasize the agrarian culture
of the Indians; in his production, they could be seen traveling
this way and that on the stage, bearing fruits of the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   This type of political correction is not rare in revivals these
days. In ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' Mayer said, he cut a
number of ``dated'' remarks, including one by Lucy about becoming a
housewife. ``I couldn't live with that,'' he explained. Even
long-running shows that are holdovers from earlier eras are
susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent performance of ``The Fantasticks,'' which has been
playing on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village since 1960, I was
surprised to find that the words to one of the numbers had been
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The song, ``It Depends on What You Pay,'' is a list song
detailing the many different styles in which the musical's romantic
narrator, El Gallo, will, for a price, stage the kidnaping of the
young heroine. The word he uses over and over to describe his
efforts is ``rape,'' which is no longer taken to mean anything but
a violent crime. The lyric, as a result, has been modified:
wherever possible, ``abduction'' has been shoehorned into the
number.
</P>
<P>
   The good news here is that as more first-string talent becomes
intrigued by what can be reshaped, musicals once considered too
much trouble are coming off the shelves. Producer Rodger Hess hopes
to bring the 1947 ``Finian's Rainbow,'' to Broadway in early 2000.
The tricky plot device in the musical, by Burton Lane, E.Y. Harburg
and Fred Saidy, involves a commentary on prejudice: a racist
Southern senator magically is transformed into a black man. In an
effort to determine what in the show might offend black audiences
today, Hess said, he retained actor Ossie Davis as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing on stage is as perishable as topicality, and what one
generation views as cutting edge becomes the next generation's
tired convention. That is why many of these retooled productions
will probably end up being revised, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Richard Rodgers commissioned a revised version of
``Babes in Arms,'' the 1937 musical he had written with Lorenz
Hart; today, the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization catalog
offers both versions to potential producers. (The Encores musical
concert series at City Center begins its new season next month with
the original ``Babes.'')
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to say that the creators of many of these old shows
would probably chafe at some of the tinkering with their work. Just
run the idea by Stone, who gets the credit, ``as revised by'' in
the ads for the new ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' and who won a Tony for
his book for the current Broadway musical ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   When the possibility was raised with him that some producer in
the year 2050 might ask a writer to massage portions of
``Titanic,'' he expressed skepticism. ``It's not just a setup for
songs,'' he said of his handiwork. ``I like to think it's a play.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As a 10-year-old glued to the TV through the summer of
Watergate, I remember the air of gravity that hung over the
proceedings, the sense that it was a dreadful necessity to put a
president on trial.
 &HT;    I don't recall authority figures having to explain that it was a
national crisis _ even to a kid, that was pretty obvious.
 &HT;    And yet, one of the oddest things about the impeachment weekend
just before Christmas was the constant stream of reminders that
America again was again experiencing such a crisis. Legislators and
commentators kept trying to find more dramatic ways to frame the
events taking place.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton, they intoned, was about to become only the SECOND
president ever impeached. He would be our FIRST ELECTED president
ever impeached. All through the holidays and on into January the
tone remained the same: We were having the first Senate trial of a
president in 130 YEARS.
 &HT;    Watching TV was like having someone grab you by the lapels and
shout, Don't you understand this is supposed to be historic!
 &HT;    Clinton's impeachment is historic in the sense of it being an
event historians will puzzle over in decades to come. But what
those historians will have to ponder is not how it shook the
country, but why it didn't. They will have to explain how the
country experienced the form of a constitutional crisis without the
content of one, how an impeachment could drive a president's
approval rating up instead of down.
 &HT;    They may be better disposed than contemporary observers of the
Clinton scandal to look beyond the Dow Jones industrial average for
an explanation. For Clinton's weathering of the Lewinsky scandal
represents something that is truly historic _ a break in the way
the American presidency functions.
 &HT;    For the 60 years or so that preceded Clinton's election in 1992,
the nation lived through what might be described as the heroic
phase of the American presidency. Not that all modern presidents
have been heroes, of course. But beginning in the late 1920s, the
country was enveloped in a succession of crises _ the Great
Depression, World War II and the Cold War. We measured our
presidents against their roles in these great events.
 &HT;    Thankfully, we're now living in different times. The nation is
at peace and growing more prosperous, not merely or even mostly as
a consequence of executive decision-making, but as a backdrop to
it. This places a different and in some ways more difficult burden
on the leader of the free world.
 &HT;    An American president now has a more diffuse and bewildering
job. He must focus on a series of comparatively minor problems at
home, make sense of international confusion and compete for the
public's attention with more captivating forms of entertainment.
 &HT;    Clinton has not failed to keep his public entertained. To some
it has seemed like a tragedy, to others a sitcom. Following the
pattern of his career in Arkansas and of his accident-prone 1992
campaign, Clinton as president has repeatedly toyed with ruin,
practically digging his own grave, only to pop back up,
Houdini-like, after everyone thought he could no longer be
breathing.
 &HT;    With his impeachment on charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice, his dialogue with disaster has reached what is likely to
be its final phase (though another eruption is always possible).
 &HT;    The debate is no longer over Clinton's continued viability as a
politician, because he faces no more elections. The stain of
impeachment cannot be washed away by what he does in his remaining
time in the White House, because part of what his impeachment means
is that the House of Representatives is no longer much interested
in doing business with him.
 &HT;    A conviction in a Senate trial would make Clinton history sooner
rather than later, but whether he is convicted, acquitted or
censured as a result of some Senate-White House deal, it does not
seem too soon to try to characterize his presidency. Clinton is the
president who, for better and worse, turned the White House into a
governor's mansion.
 &HT;    Clinton was worried about his legacy long before he learned, a
year ago, that the world was about to learn about Monica Lewinsky.
In his book, ``Behind the Oval Office,'' Dick Morris described a
Sunday-morning phone conversation in August 1996 on the topic of
how Clinton would rate in the history books.
 &HT;    Clinton agreed he wasn't a top-tier president, but wondered what
he could do to make it into the ranks of Morris' second tier, with
Harry Truman, Theodore Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson and Ronald Reagan.
(Morris said he'd have to do three big things: make welfare reform
work, balance the federal budget and smash international terrorism,
on top of some littler things.)
 &HT;    Though the word ``legacy'' has a positive cast, presidential
historians often use it to convey a more neutral meaning. A legacy
is properly understood as a mark left on the country for good or
for ill. Popular democracy is Andrew Jackson's legacy. The national
park system is part of Theodore Roosevelt's. The New Deal, which
molded the modern federal government, is FDR's. Watergate is
Nixon's.
 &HT;    There are legacies of neglect, such as Ronald Reagan's bequest
to his successors of a vast federal budget deficit (offset by his
affirmative legacy of drawing the cold war to a surprising and
successful close). Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush, to
name three of our last five presidents, arguably left no major
legacy at all. The same is true of the late-19th-century presidents
who populate the murk between Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt.
 &HT;    We know something else about presidential legacies. Matters that
loom large now will diminish in retrospect. Clinton's popularity,
and by extension his survival as president, do rely heavily on the
extraordinary strength of the economy, now in the eighth year of
what will soon become our longest known peacetime expansion. But
over time, even that impressive statistic is likely to fade in
importance.
 &HT;    A lousy economy can define a presidency, as it did for Herbert
Hoover. But the simple fact of a good economy tends not to make a
legacy. If it did, Eisenhower, Johnson and Nixon would be
considered greater presidents than FDR and Truman.
 &HT;    There is already a rough consensus among historians that Clinton
is a significant president. He stands to be remembered, most
obviously, for causing a big scandal and getting impeached, but
also for getting re-elected, something no Democrat since FDR had
done.
 &HT;    But Clinton, I think, will also be remembered for reforming the
federal government and for reshaping his party. Most strikingly,
Clinton, like Andrew Jackson and FDR, has changed the very nature
of the American presidency. Where those two presidents expanded the
role and importance of the presidency, Clinton has downsized the
office, both in the negative sense of stripping away some of its
dignity and in the positive one of making adjustments demanded by
the historical moment.
 &HT;    Coming to the White House from the governor's mansion in Little
Rock, Clinton has recast the presidency on the more modest model of
his previous job. Unlike presidents, governors have few
opportunities to be visionaries. Instead, they do what Clinton has
done _ a job of crisis management, political accommodation and
governmental reform.
 &HT;    In one way, the public doesn't expect much from a governor; in
another way it expects a great deal. A governor is expected to
address whatever issues arise, from upgrading the skills of his
state's work force to reducing traffic congestion on its highways.
 &HT;    Financial constraints deny governors the possibility of grander
schemes. Within the confines of balanced and limited budgets,
however, they can distinguish themselves with creative
social-policy ideas. In smaller states, the governor is a familiar
figure whose blunders and foibles are as well known as his cartoon
caricature.
 &HT;    If the governor proves himself intelligent and capable, people
tend to be willing to indulge a fair amount of rascality on his
part. As flawed as he may be, he's all that protects them from a
Legislature that's inevitably far worse than he is.
 &HT;    Governors, of course, don't shape foreign policy. There's no
doubt Clinton will be remembered as primarily a domestic president
and perhaps the first in a line of domestic presidents who followed
the Cold War.
 &HT;    Clinton ran on domestic and economic issues in 1992, in answer
to George Bush's international focus. His platform, ``Putting
People First,'' the most detailed policy statement ever issued by a
candidate, elaborated a series of ideas about how to make
government more effective.
 &HT;    Clinton has improved a range of federal agencies and programs.
But what may stand as most significant is not just that he mended
broken policies, but that in fact he managed to restore the feeling
among Americans that domestic government works.

 &HT;    
 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    From his first presidential campaign, Bill Clinton was guided by
a revised philosophy of government's role.
 &HT;    Perhaps one of the most underappreciated things Clinton did
during his first year in office was expanding the Earned Income Tax
Credit, a program by which the federal government supplements the
income of low-wage workers.
 &HT;    Clinton's notion was that if you work full time, you shouldn't
have an income below the poverty line. A government commitment to
this principle exemplified his reform liberalism. As a successor to
the New Deal-Great Society archetype of ever-expanding social
benefits, Clinton proposed a more modest, reciprocal model, one
based on what he has described as an exchange of opportunity for
responsibility, and hence a model based on more limited
expectations of what the federal government can do.
 &HT;    During his 1992 campaign, Clinton characterized this notion, in
a phrase coined by Will Marshall of the Progressive Policy
Institute, as the ``New Covenant.'' Clinton's subsequent successes,
such as national service and welfare reform, have come from
applying this notion of a limited social contract.
 &HT;    His early failures occurred when he strayed from it, relapsing
into the older pattern of delivering new federal benefits from on
high. Most notable was his failure in health care.
 &HT;    It's possible that a better-designed and more politically astute
plan could have placed his presidency on stronger footing. But
Clinton botched the design and marketing of his plan, setting
himself at odds with moderates in both parties whose support he
needed.
 &HT;    Considering himself a centrist reformer, Clinton didn't see the
potential for his ``managed competition'' scheme to be portrayed as
an oldfangled liberal spending program.
 &HT;    What Clinton didn't yet get was the depth of the discontent with
the way government was working. When he took office, trust in
government had been steadily eroding for a quarter century. In
1964, 76 percent of Americans told pollsters they thought they
could trust government to do the right thing all or most of the
time. In 1994, the year Clinton's plan for health-care reform
fizzled, the number who said they trusted government bottomed out
at 15 percent.
 &HT;    The nature of this disillusion is a debate of its own, but it
was based at least in part on the failures of government in welfare
and public housing, in worsening crime and deteriorating public
education.
 &HT;    This loss of confidence easily attached itself to Clinton's
attempt to award the federal government another vast
responsibility. Clinton was regarded as someone who had promised
change and failed to deliver. This frustration came to fruition in
1994.
 &HT;    Not until the ascendancy of the Gingrich Congress did Clinton
fully grasp the depth of disenchantment with Washington. But from
that point on, Clinton began to understand that he had to grapple
with this corrosive skepticism.
 &HT;    Michael Waldman, Clinton's chief speech writer, remembers
sitting with him in the White House residence working on last
year's State of the Union address. At one point, according to
Waldman, Clinton paused and remarked that ``FDR's mission was to
save capitalism from its excesses. Our mission has been to save
government from its own excesses so it can again be a progressive
force.''
 &HT;    The idea of Clinton as the savior of liberal government will
strike many as perverse. Following the 1994 election, Clinton faced
tremendous criticism, not just from Republicans but also from
Democrats who felt he was trying to jettison, inan effort at
conciliation, the party's bedrock beliefs.
 &HT;    The lightning rod for this anger became his nefarious political
consultant Dick Morris, whom Democratic traditionalists saw as
pulling Clinton not in the direction of reform, but toward a dead
centrism derived from opinion polls. Clinton was much ridiculed for
proposing microinterventions like free walkie-talkies for
neighborhood watch groups.
 &HT;    But what Clinton was beginning to understand was that
government's failures weren't arcane managerial issues; they were
questions of public trust. While devising gubernatorial-scale
programs that encapsulated his New Covenant approach, he proceeded
to address the two biggest causes of that mistrust.
 &HT;    First, Clinton agreed to the Republican goal of a balanced
budget. But where the GOP long supported a balanced budget as a
means of downsizing government, Clinton saw it as a way to
reinvigorate government. From his first economic plan in 1993,
Clinton regarded the deficit as a problem serious enough to warrant
putting many of his pet projects on hold.
 &HT;    What he subsequently discovered was that by operating within the
context of a balanced budget, he could argue for expanding spending
in certain areas, like school construction or national service,
without being accused of fiscal irresponsibility. The federal
budget had become like a state budget. Only if government was
convincingly limited in size could it hope to get away with
activism.
 &HT;    His second and arguably more important decision was following
through on his campaign promise to end welfare ``as we know it.''
Many liberals mistook Clinton's interest in the subject as
political; they saw the subtext as race baiting. In fact, Clinton
saw welfare as disruptive of the proper relationship between
government and its citizens. The system's unpopularity was not just
because of its being counterproductive or a waste of resources, but
because it offered something for nothing.
 &HT;    Members of Clinton's cabinet objected strenuously to his
decision to accept a modified Republican bill based on the idea of
block grants, and a few of his own policy makers resigned in
protest over the issue. The smoke of battle obscured the fact that
Clinton was following through on his New Covenant notion of welfare
reform and not merely acceding to a punitive rollback.
 &HT;    Clinton could also see that the country's governors, already
embarked on a variety of welfare-reform experiments, were in the
best position to know how the system might be fixed. Only in the
last year has it become evident that Clinton did reform welfare
largely in the way he said he would with pretty much the results he
anticipated.
 &HT;    Welfare rolls have declined from 5 million families in 1995 to 3
million in June 1998. A downturn in the economy could curtail this
progress by making it harder to place people in jobs, but at the
moment the national picture is one of drastically declining levels
of dependency with scant evidence of increased misery.
 &HT;    These promising signs have been accompanied by progress in other
areas in which government has failed. Under Henry Cisneros, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development actually began breaking
up pockets of concentrated poverty by tearing down parts of the
worst urban housing projects and moving to voucher-based subsidies.
 &HT;    Cities have also benefited from two changes that may have been
largely incidental to Clinton's agenda _ a big drop in crime and
the end of a long-term increase in out-of-wedlock births. Together
these developments have begun to have a tipping-point effect for
America's urban centers.
 &HT;    It's too early to say that these improvements have restored the
30-year slide in faith in government. But from its low in 1994,
confidence in government had recovered more than 20 points by early
1998. Impeachment has driven it down a bit _ but to nowhere near
its lowest level.

 &HT;    
 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Before Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, conventional wisdom
held that the Democrats faced a crisis. After 12 years of GOP White
House rule and defeat in five of the previous six presidential
elections, the party had seemingly ceased to become competitive at
the presidential level.
 &HT;    Peter Brown's 1991 book, ``Minority Party: Why Democrats Face
Defeat in 1992 and Beyond,'' was one of several arguing the thesis.
White working-class and suburban middle-class voters, according to
the conventional wisdom, were abandoning the party in droves
because of its excessively liberal positions on crime, welfare,
foreign policy and ``values'' issues.
 &HT;    How could the Democrats become politically competitive again in
an era when what the party once stood for _ an expanding federal
role _ was proving less and less popular? The party itself was
deeply divided over how and whether it should evolve.
 &HT;    On one side was a group of centrist reformers clustered around
the Democratic Leadership Council. On the other was a rump of
liberal traditionalists, including labor unions and minority groups
who viewed DLC positions as treasonable to their basic beliefs.
 &HT;    Clinton has faced the problems of his party _ at least at the
presidential level _ methodically, systematically and effectively.
To a remarkable degree, he has succeeded in making once seemingly
incurable ailments vanish, while giving back to the Democrats the
kind of well-oiled national political machine they had before 1968.
 &HT;    His first task was pulling thorns from the party paw. Asked
which party did a better job handling crime, voters chose the GOP
by a margin of 18 points in 1991.
 &HT;    Clinton reversed this pattern by jettisoning Dukakis-era
positions such as opposition to the death penalty while exploiting
the one aspect of the issue where public opinion diverges from the
dictates of GOP interest-group politics: gun control.
 &HT;    Clinton doesn't have much of a basis for claiming that it's his
policies that have reduced crime rates over the past several years,
but he has put away the charge that Democrats don't like punishing
criminals. Recent surveys show the parties polling essentially even
on the issue.
 &HT;    What's most remarkable is not that Clinton has taken crime and
other reliable wedge issues away from Republicans. It's that he has
done so while unifying a party that was itself divided over these
issues. In 1992, both the New Democrats and the traditionalists
supported Clinton in the belief that he was, at heart, one of them.
 &HT;    Perhaps inevitably, both sides were disappointed in the way he
governed. For much of his first term Clinton was out of favor with
the center or the left of his party, or both at the same time.
 &HT;    In his first two years, the DLC saw Clinton as swinging left
with his health-care plan and tax increase. In his second two
years, liberals griped over Clinton's accession to a balanced
budget and welfare reform. But by the time of the 1996 election,
Clinton had again forged an alliance.
 &HT;    Many people are puzzled about how Clinton has been able to
appease liberal constituencies while flouting their principles _
confronting unions with Nafta, poor blacks with welfare reform,
teachers with charter schools and feminists with Paula Jones.
 &HT;    The simplest explanation is that he has restored a model last
seen among Democrats during the presidency of Lyndon Johnson, when
those joining his coalition got to experience victory and taste
power. Clinton has created a sense of partisan pride powerful
enough to quell the narcissism of small differences.
 &HT;    This thrill of putting up a good fight against a common enemy _
something presidents as different as Ronald Reagan and Franklin
Roosevelt once created and used _ has overcome ideological and
sometimes moral scruples. Democratic activists have taken the
advice Clinton gave a group of them in 1981: ``When someone is
beating you over the head with a hammer ... take out a meat cleaver
and cut off their hand.''
 &HT;    It hasn't always been pretty, or even, perhaps, ethical. Since
1992, Clinton's style has been to dispense with qualms and play
politics in as ruthless and relentless a way as the GOP. In the
1980s, Reagan and George Bush were charged with relying on polling
to an unprecedented degree. Clinton has gone them one better,
market-testing his rhetoric, then deploying it with a numbing
repetitive precision.
 &HT;    He answered the slick fabrications of Michael Deaver with the
more subtle and compelling mythography of Harry Thomason and Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason. He dug deeper for dirt on his opponents,
devised more effective 30-second attack ads and showed great
ingenuity in exploiting loopholes in the campaign finance law.
 &HT;    The biggest change is financial. In the 1980s, the GOP advantage
in fund-raising was as high as 5 to 1. In the 1992 election cycle,
Clinton and Ron Brown, then chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, whittled it down to 3 to 2. In 1996, Clinton and Harold
Ickes nearly caught up in the chief corporate category, so-called
soft money, bringing in $123 million to the GOP's $138 million.
 &HT;    They did this with willful blindness about the sources of these
funds. Clinton's attitude is that because the rules aren't enforced
and Republicans are preventing him from creating a level playing
field, he is free to fight as dirty as they do.
 &HT;    Since the Lewinsky scandal, various sectors of the ideologically
disgruntled Democratic ``base'' _ those who might be thought to be
less than keen about Clinton's small-bore, poll-driven,
corporate-friendly centrism _ have been the president's staunchest
supporters.
 &HT;    Black leaders disappointed with Clinton over matters ranging
from the balanced budget to welfare reform have flocked to his
defense. Among blacks, Clinton's approval rating remains as high as
Ronald Reagan's rating was among conservative Republicans.
 &HT;    This is a testament in part to the real feeling Clinton evinces
over racial issues, as well as to black sensitivity to
prosecutorial unfairness and sympathy for victims of persecution.
But it also speaks to a different kind of party, one in which
members are willing to settle for half a loaf.
 &HT;    Republicans, on the other hand, now face the problem of a
radical base that has lost its willingness to postpone
gratification. The adage that Democrats look for heretics while
Republicans seek converts has ceased to apply.
 &HT;    To a remarkable degree, the parties have switched places.
Clinton's political formula is now almost universally regarded as a
winning one for Democrats. All of the serious contenders for the
2000 Democratic nomination have indicated their desire to continue
in the same basic direction.
 &HT;    Al Gore, Bill Bradley and John Kerry have all positioned
themselves as Clinton Democrats. The potential contenders who do
not fit this profile _ Paul Wellstone and Jesse Jackson _ are
running as protest candidates. Clinton's ``Third Way'' formula has
an international following as well. From a historical viewpoint,
the question is whether a Democratic successor will be able to
carry off Clinton's balancing act within the party.
 &HT;    There is a worrisome analogy in the GOP, where Reagan became a
successful two-term president by appeasing the religious right
while reaching out to moderate voters. Bush's efforts to sustain
this equilibrium made the Republican right truculent to the point
of self-destructiveness. Today the GOP remains badly divided,
looking back to the Reagan years as an irretrievable golden age.
 &HT;    Clinton's successor, almost certain to lack his political gifts
and perhaps his ruthlessness, faces an enormous challenge in
maintaining the Clinton coalition.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even if President Bill Clinton is not convicted by the U.S.
Senate and does finish his second term, impeachment will still be
in the first paragraph of his obituary.
 &HT;    At some level, Clinton can't escape becoming a historical joke.
 &HT;    He is now and forever our priapic president, who takes his place
alongside our drunken president, Ulysses S. Grant, our napping
president, Calvin Coolidge, and our treacherous president, Richard
Nixon.
 &HT;    Whatever else he does in office, Clinton will not be able to
keep this out of his capsule biography: He's the one who had oral
sex with a 21-year-old intern in the Oval Office, got caught, lied,
caused a national spectacle and saw it undermine his second term.
This story line may be tempered with sympathy.
 &HT;    In a longer view, Clinton's libido may not differentiate him
from Franklin Roosevelt (who died with his mistress, not his wife)
or John Kennedy (who arranged orgies in the White House swimming
pool). But it will be hard to avoid the view that there was
something more reckless about Clinton, because he had no basis for
thinking the press would protect him, as it did his predecessors.
 &HT;    Nor can Clinton escape his reputation for being slippery. He is
not the first president to lie, or lie under oath. But he will
surely be remembered as someone who habitually played games with
the truth.
 &HT;    Clinton is the president who said he never inhaled, who told a
national audience, ``I did not have sexual relations with that
woman'' _ and considered it true because his definition of sexual
relations did not include receiving oral sex.
 &HT;    The most evasive of these lines, such as ``It depends on what
the meaning of the word 'is' is,'' are destined for inclusion in
Bartlett's. Clinton is to hairsplitting legalisms what Yogi Berra
is to tautological absurdities; he seems nearly to have invented
the form.
 &HT;    It will also be recalled that he was disloyal to friends and
took advantage of people who worked for him. Early in his
presidency, Clinton failed to stand by nominees in trouble, even
when they were old friends like Zoe Baird. He has taken advantage
of faithful aides, using and disposing of them when convenient, as
with Harold Ickes, whom Clinton threw overboard after Ickes
finished the dirty work involved in getting him re-elected.
 &HT;    His sexual incontinence was itself a betrayal of people who
spent years working for him, some of whom faced their own legal
problems because they helped protect him. He led subordinates like
his former press secretary Michael McCurry to damage their own
professional reputations by amplifying his lies. Clinton will be
remembered as, among other things, a cad.
 &HT;    But more significant than what the impeachment episode says
about Clinton's character may be what it tells us about national
mores at century's end. Contrary to the prediction of many
reporters, myself included, the scandal not only did not end his
presidency; it actually made a president re-elected on a ``values''
agenda more popular.
 &HT;    When the scandal first broke a year ago, Washington reporters
were still dealing with the issue of whether to protect the public
from information they assumed it was too unsophisticated to handle.
Few suspected how much the rest of the country had changed in the
previous decade. The America of today is no longer the America of
1987, the year that Gary Hart was driven from a presidential race
by the Donna Rice scandal and that Clinton decided not to go for
the nomination after his aide Betsey Wright presented him with a
list of ex-lovers capable of sabotaging his candidacy.
 &HT;    Clinton is not simply the beneficiary of the arrival of a more
tolerant moral standard; he is personally responsible for its
application to politics. He was the first presidential candidate to
publicly acknowledge that he had committed adultery. Some have
argued that, based on the famous ``60 Minutes'' appearance, in
which he acknowledged causing pain in his marriage, there was an
implicit bargain between Clinton and the voters. If we elected him,
he promised to sin no more.
 &HT;    But the real proposition was direct and explicit: Clinton stood
for office on the basis of what he could do rather than who he
would be. Unlike previous presidents, he proposed to be hired on
the basis of his abilities and his approach to government, not his
qualities as a moral exemplar. He was promising to be a good
governor.
 &HT;    Such a promise is built into Clinton's own view of government.
His notion of a ``New Covenant'' implies a transformation in
expectations. Washington no longer delivers solutions to our
problems; it merely helps us to solve them. Not looking to
government as an all-purpose savior implies no longer putting
politicians on a pedestal.
 &HT;    To perform their new role, leaders don't have to be ideal human
beings, superior projections of ourselves. They merely need to
understand our problems and help us grapple with them. If they hold
up their end of the bargain, by governing well, we won't go beyond
ours by judging them harshly for inevitable human failings. While
he has surely tested our commitment to this pact, Clinton has held
up his end of it.
 &HT;    The compact that Clinton embodies has emerged as our country's
de facto standard of political morality. We are still less
dismissive of marital infidelity than, say, the French. But like
the Europeans and Canadians, we now distinguish public from private
in the lives of our leaders, and forbear from judgments about the
latter.
 &HT;    The new rules have not taken hold everywhere yet. Much of the
press has yet to assimilate the concept that most of the public no
longer considers intrusive reporting about private lives relevant
to democratic decision-making. Nonetheless, a president with a rare
ability to compartmentalize his psyche has ratified a new attitude
toward the private lives of public figures.
 &HT;    You can go further than that and say that the Lewinsky scandal
says something not just about the development of American political
morality, but also about American morality in general. A quick
survey might leave one with the impression that the 199os were the
decade that Puritanism died.
 &HT;    Since Clinton has been president, homosexuality has gained
public acceptance; legal gambling has swept the country;
pornography has become ubiquitous; and vice has been redefined as
disease. Meanwhile, the public has become unshockable about sex and
unconcerned about presidential adultery. These changes imply that
traditional morality has receded.
 &HT;    But something more complicated is going on. The same public that
has forgiven Clinton his trespasses holds to a strict personal
morality and has endorsed Clinton's emphasis on ``values'' in
government programs - what Prof. Michael Sandel of Harvard calls
Clinton's repudiation of ``moral neutrality'' in public policy.
 &HT;    The harmonization of these seeming contradictions may be arising
from the increasingly subtle distinction Americans are making
between the public and private realms. One striking thing the
sociologist Alan Wolfe shows in his book ``One Nation, After All''
is that while American suburbanites are far from relativistic in
their own moral views, they shrink from judging the private
behavior of others, and dislike moralizing when they see it
practiced. At the same time, they want government policy to support
their values.
 &HT;    The Lewinsky scandal writes these distinctions large. Few
approve of Clinton's behavior. Yet the vast majority object even
more to casting stones at the president for mistakes in an area
where he is answerable to his family and his God, not to voters or
the media. Though these mistakes may make it impossible for Clinton
to talk about values any longer, voters care more about how he
applied his views in public - welfare reform, for example - than
how he violated them in private.
 &HT;    Clinton didn't devise this ethic, but his election and survival
encapsulate it. He leaves behind an electorate that wants its
values embedded in public policy, but that no longer moralizes
about private behavior.

 &HT;    
 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The most common explanation for the animosity against President
Bill Clinton is that it is an expression of ``a culture war.''
 &HT;    In their strenuous dislike of the president, the idea goes,
conservatives are fighting a battle over the 1960s and its legacy.
Clinton is the first baby-boomer president, the first who dodged
the Vietnam draft and admitted to smoking marijuana.
 &HT;    His conservative opponents, including many members of the same
generation, see such a figure as a threat to the moral order.
During the impeachment fight, Tom DeLay, the House Republican whip,
described it as ``a debate about relativism vs. absolute truth.''
 &HT;    But the culture-war argument doesn't do justice to an antipathy
that goes back to Clinton's candidacy. I think there are three
separate psychological profiles of Clinton-hating, which have
blurred together at times.
 &HT;    _ The first type of Clinton-hater is liberal, and he does derive
his hatred from the 60s.
 &HT;    His is the view that Clinton is a fundamentally disingenuous and
inauthentic person who uses public interest as a cover for private
ambition. This opinion, which is manifest in much of Clinton's
press coverage, does not draw a line between the personal and the
political. The problem isn't that Clinton committed adultery or
that he lied about adultery.
 &HT;    Indeed, these lapses have inclined liberal critics to support
him. What they object to is that Clinton cares about winning more
than he cares about principles; that he has thrown overboard such
worthy causes as civil liberties, intervention in Bosnia, human
rights in China and campaign finance reform.
 &HT;    _ A second kind of hostility to Clinton is neither liberal nor
conservative but comes from the Washington establishment. Sally
Quinn, the journalist and Washington hostess, has written that the
Clintons ``dissed'' Georgetown society by neglecting its advice and
avoiding its company.
 &HT;    This is true, but the falling out goes well beyond a mere social
snub. By downsizing the presidency and ushering in an era of a less
ambitious federal government, Clinton has made Washington and its
establishment less important. By turning away from both foreign
affairs and big-ticket domestic programs, Clinton has made
Washington less central to the concerns of the nation than it was
in the days of SALT treaties.
 &HT;    Turning the presidency into the country's biggest governor's job
is contrary to the political establishment's sense of the office
and their relation to it. By allowing the Lewinsky scandal to
happen, Clinton has turned the American presidency (and by
extension those who feed off it) into an international
laughingstock.
 &HT;    ``Clinton acted ... as if he does not recognize what it means to
be president of the United States,'' wrote David Broder, a
Washington Post columnist, after Clinton's first nationally
televised mea culpa.
 &HT;    _ The third and most potent kind of Clinton-hating is
conservative, but is related to the liberal kind in its aversion to
a Democrat who plays politics to win. Instead of being pleased that
Clinton has enacted parts of their agenda, Republicans are furious
at him for co-opting the best bits of it.
 &HT;    With the end of their monopoly on such issues as crime, welfare
and balancing the budget, Republicans are forced to contend with
Democrats over issues where their positions are distinctly less
popular: education, the environment, Social Security and social
issues like abortion and homosexuality.
 &HT;    Clinton's seizure of the center has driven the GOP to the right,
empowering the radicals who want either to legislate on the basis
of a narrow moral code or drastically curtail the federal
government's role, or both. To conservatives, Clinton didn't win
the center legitimately. He stole it from them.
 &HT;    But the question of Clinton-hating finally transcends
conventional political analysis. It's personal and aggravated.
Detestation of the president is worsened by the phenomenon of
sustained public support for Clinton, which his opponents find
baffling. Why does this man's approval rating rise in the teeth of
humiliation?
 &HT;    At one level, Clinton's supporters have made a pragmatic
judgment that he governs in their interest. But at another level,
he draws on a reservoir not of love, not of respect even, but of
identification.
 &HT;    This identification works in two directions. It is partly the
public's identification with Clinton, the perpetual underdog who
refuses to ever quit fighting. To a public that consumes quantities
of confessional entertainment and self-help advice, Clinton's
turmoil seems not bizarre, but familiar.
 &HT;    His cyclical progress through stages of sin, denial, contrition
and forgiveness has humanized him like no previous president. To a
public that had already accepted Clinton with his faults, the Starr
report arrived not as a shocking indictment, but as a juicy soap
opera with footnotes. As with other celebrities, Clinton's
screw-ups are a comforting reminder that he isn't any better than
the rest of us and doesn't think that he is.
 &HT;    But possibly more important is the way Clinton himself
identifies with regular people. No one who has ever seen him work a
rope line or entertain questions at a town meeting can fail to be
impressed by the way that he engages with ordinary people.
 &HT;    In public forums, Clinton is not just indefatigable, requiring
his aides to forcibly pull him away from people who want to shake
his hand at the end of an evening. He is, unlike any other
politician of this generation, in his element with a crowd _ black,
white, religious, academic _ it almost doesn't matter.
 &HT;    Clinton moves an audience by empathizing with its feelings and
concerns. The way he draws sustenance by relating to strangers is
part and parcel of his political talent.
 &HT;    Clinton-haters of all kinds often describe the president's
caring about the problems of regular folk in terms of fakery. They
think his ``I feel your pain'' act is exactly that, a fraud, rather
than an expression of natural sympathy. There is in their anger at
him something of the mystification with which the liberal
intelligentsia beheld Reagan's popularity with the rest of the
country.
 &HT;    It's as if Clinton's bond with the public was based on some kind
of black art. In Reagan's case, this was chalked up to the mesmeric
power of his acting (a power never attributed to him during his
screen career). With no ready explanation of how Clinton does it,
conservatives like William Bennett have often taken the route of
becoming infuriated with the public for falling for such a
charlatan.
 &HT;    In both the popular defense of Clinton and the elite attacks
upon him, one hears the echoes of the passions evoked by two former
presidents: Andrew Jackson and Franklin Roosevelt. Jackson, like
Clinton, was twice elected president on the basis of a powerful
mutual identification with the public.
 &HT;    Conservatives suspected and feared Jackson's popularity, because
it represented a different version of democracy from the one the
founders had envisioned, a kind they saw as close to mob rule. FDR
had a similar bond with ordinary people, which opened up a well of
class resentment.
 &HT;    People who called Roosevelt ``that man'' felt that as a
patrician populist he was a phony and an opportunist. Many of
Clinton's critics see him likewise as a beneficiary of meritocratic
privilege who has seduced the heartland. They fear him, as they
feared Jackson and FDR, as a demagogue.
 &HT;    Clinton's bond with the public is based less on economic
unfairness than was Jackson's or Roosevelt's and more on a kind of
post-ideological pragmatism. He has devised an idiosyncratic
populism, based on the sense of him as a personally flawed but
public-spirited and highly intelligent leader ready to fight to his
last breath for the people who elected him.
 &HT;    Redefining government's role will never make Clinton beloved in
the way FDR is beloved. But he may well be remembered as a
president who squarely faced the big problem presented to him with
the resources at his command.
 &HT;    Someday, the loathing that Clinton provokes may be understood in
the context of his role in creating a post-Cold War presidency.
Americans may recognize that liberals objected to a narrower role
for government, that the Washington establishment resisted his
diminishing its stature and that conservatives objected to his
substituting prudent downsizing for radical deconstruction.
 &HT;    Knowing Clinton as it has known no other incumbent president,
the public has nonetheless refrained from judging him _ or at least
has been willing to judge him in his complexity, separating his
private behavior from his record.
 &HT;    Clinton is likely to remain an equivocal figure, a man of
significant accomplishments and flawed character, who created
gratuitous troubles but defined a social transformation in
surviving them. He may come to be remembered as the most
paradoxical president: an undisciplined man who restored trust in
government, while inspiring almost none in himself.

A CEREBRAL MODERNIST WHOSE REVOLUTION ROLLS ON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Nancy Hass, who teaches journalism at New York University, is a
frequent contributor to Arts and Leisure.  
 By NANCY HASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent frigid afternoon in Manhattan,
Agamemnon's hand was bothering the director JoAnne Akalaitis. To be
more precise, what concerned her was the obscene gesture that the
actor Jack Willis had been using, at her instruction, to punctuate
a line from ``Iphigenia at Aulis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I want to lose that,'' she said softly, rising from
her folding chair in the Chelsea rehearsal space. The play, the
first half of ``The Iphigenia Cycle,'' an evening of two Euripides
tragedies she is directing for Theater for a New Audience, opens
Sunday night at the American Place Theater on West 46th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This?'' Willis asked in amazement, stopping to repeat the
motion. ``I thought you liked it.'' Eddy Saad, who plays Menelaus,
reminded her that Willis had used the gesture in the original
production she mounted at the Court Theater in Chicago. ``Afraid
it'll offend the New York audiences?'' he teased, as the cast
tittered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Akalaitis paused as the actors waited for a typically
cerebral response from a director known for weighing the
significance of the smallest movement on stage. ``Actually,'' she
said slowly, ruffling her cropped red hair with her hand, ``it just
seems, well, dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast members laughed, shaking their heads, but Ms. Akalaitis
seemed not to notice. A salient feature of her more than 30-year
career is that she has rarely seemed to care much what most people
think of her. Which is a good thing, considering that her
idiosyncratic vision has been known to ignite her audience as well
as inflame her critics.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Akalaitis, 60, has been called a theater radical whose work
grows increasingly distilled, profound and challenging, as well as
a bloodless modernist who disrespects Shakespeare, debases the
Greeks and shamelessly distorts Jean Genet and Tennessee Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolist gestures she favors _ sometimes her actors move in
a kind of slow-motion Kabuki style or fall to the ground as if
pulled by a demonic force _ have been celebrated as inspired and
decried as gimmicky. Fans say her penchant for updating classics
makes them see the works anew; critics complain that she has a
narrow academic vision and that her changes are gratuitous and
distracting.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``The Iphigenia Cycle'' is pretty straightforward for
Ms. Akalaitis. The plays are marginally set in and around ancient
Greece, though the six women of the Chorus do wear retro-swimwear
in ``Iphigenia in Tauris''; for ``Iphigenia at Aulis,'' they don
little black cocktail dresses and swing colorful umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   The plays recount the story of the Greek King Agamemnon, who
cannot invade Troy because his ships are becalmed. His daughter
Iphigenia must be sacrificed, but as she is about to be killed, she
is spirited away to the land of the Taurians, where the second play
takes place, after the Trojan War ends.
</P>
<P>
   The double-bill, which has no major stars, uses a new
translation by Nicholas Rudall, the founding director of the Court
Theater, which is in residence at the University of Chicago, Ms.
Akalaitis's alma mater. The Chicago Tribune called the production
one of the 10 best of the season when it was done there in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Among the terms often used to describe Ms. Akalaitis is
deconstructivist, which she repudiates: ``I have never
deconstructed a line of text in my life. There is this dopey,
old-fashioned concept that if you have a cigarette or a piece of
pizza onstage, you are deconstructing the text.''
</P>
<P>
   The gestures that are her trademark, she said, are ``mostly
unconscious'' choices, but among her influences, she noted, are the
works of the neurologist Oliver Sacks, whose book ``Awakenings''
describes the otherworldly movements of encephalitis patients.
</P>
<P>
   Spalding Gray, the monologist, who has known Ms. Akalaitis since
the 1970s, when they were both stars of the burgeoning experimental
theater scene in New York, compares her work to the novels of Susan
Sontag. ``They both take a very intellectual approach to art, and
that is inherently challenging,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The composer Philip Glass, Ms. Akalaitis's former husband,
frequent collaborator and unabashed fan, said of her: ``She is a
truly original thinker, and that's very threatening to some people.
When you bring real energy, skill and intuition to the work and you
are unwilling to compromise, people get very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism has not been limited to the director's individual
productions. From 1991 to 1993, Ms. Akalaitis was at the center of
a painful transition in American theater: the death of Joseph Papp,
founder of the New York Shakespeare Festival and Public Theater,
and the search for his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Akalaitis, who had frequently staged work at the Public, was
nominally dubbed by the notoriously hands-on Papp as his successor,
but not formally appointed artistic director until three months
before he died of cancer in 1991. Twenty months later, the
theater's board ousted her.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Kandel, a management consultant in the arts, whose
company had been retained by the Public in 1991 to help the board
address the organization's future, was not surprised by Ms.
Akalaitis's departure. Her fate was sealed, he said in an interview
at the time, when it was decided to consolidate the twin leadership
at the Public _ a producing director shared responsibility with the
artistic director _ into a single job.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, the theater has been run since by George C. Wolfe,
whose title, as was Papp's, is producer. But in addition, what was
perceived as Ms. Akalaitis's somewhat esoteric approach was faulted
by those who said the theater needed a leader with a wider range.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, her supporters charged that the board was
overly influenced by critics who frequently criticized her
productions, among others, a ``Cymbeline'' she had presented at the
Public in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ms. Akalaitis has continued to direct in regional
theater. (She is one of a group known for reinterpreting classic
works, which includes Anne Bogart and Robert Falls.) Several months
after she was deposed at the Public, she directed the rarely
produced play ``In the Summer House'' by Jane Bowles at Lincoln
Center Theater; in 1994 her production of ``Suddenly Last Summer''
was seen at Hartford Stage, and her adaptation of Jack Kerouac's
``Ti-Jean's Blues,'' was presented last season at the Actors
Theater of Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   She also shares control of the directors program at the
Juilliard School, and has recently tried her hand at opera. In
September, she will become the head of Bard College's new drama
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped reacting to the things that people write about me a
long time ago; that can really drive you crazy,'' said Ms.
Akalaitis recently, during a conversation in her modest, airy co-op
on the ground floor of a tidy East Village apartment building. A
small fake fire glowed in the nonworking fireplace, exuding
coziness and irony at the same time. ``What drives me is that I am
fundamentally convinced of the potential of theater. With every
project you get born again and that is indescribably wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Brought up in a working-class Lithuanian family in Cicero, Ill.,
a suburb of Chicago, Ms. Akalaitis has been involved in
experimental theater ever since she got a degree in philosophy at
the University of Chicago. After working briefly with Jerzy
Grotowski, the influential Polish director who died this month, she
became a co-founder of the theater collective Mabou Mines in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when the performance-art scene was
exploding, she produced such imagistic work as the dreamlike,
impressionistic ``Dressed Like an Egg'' (1977), suggested by the
writings of Colette.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, some of her contemporaries in experimental
theater had decided to move closer to the mainstream. Gray, for
example, focused on solo work driven by narrative. Others began to
commute to Hollywood, like Willem Dafoe and the late Ron Vawter,
between appearances in avant-garde productions by the Wooster
Group.
</P>
<P>
   A few, like the surrealist director Richard Foreman and
Elizabeth LeCompte, head of the Wooster Group, continued to present
their own idiosyncratic productions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Akalaitis took a different route: bringing techniques of
experimental theater to bear on classic works, setting Beckett's
``Endgame'' in a post-apocalyptic subway car (the production was
denounced by the playwright), and ``The Balcony'' by Genet in Latin
America, complete with a Ruben Blades soundtrack. A champion of the
German writer Franz Xaver Kroetz, she has directed a number of his
plays, and worked abroad, as well, in Germany, Italy and France.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, with the experimental designer George Tsypin, she
presented ``The Screens'' by Genet at the Guthrie Theater in
Minneapolis. Critics were dazzled by the visual effects of the more
than five-hour epic, involving the Algerian struggle for
independence, and praised the direction, while questioning the
performability of the unwieldy text. The same year, Ms. Akalaitis
presented ``Cymbeline'' at the Public Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Although in the past she has declined to talk much on the record
about her departure from the Public, she recalled it as ``an awful
time, maybe the most powerful moment in my life.'' She said she
rarely thinks of it now, though she still will not walk past the
building on Lafayette Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very angry at first, but I have no bitterness now,'' she
said. ``That's the way I've always looked at the world. I never saw
the job as the only thing in my life. I'm not saying it wasn't
shocking, and inappropriate the way it ended, but there were a lot
of great things about being at the Public, about knowing Joe, about
being given the chance to make an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   She took the job, she said, out of a genuine belief she could
contribute to theater in New York, ``and because Joe asked me.''
Papp had approached several others about the job, including Meryl
Streep and Mike Nichols, but they declined.
</P>
<P>
   Walking into the Public as the artistic director was ``like
descending into the basement of a Romanian castle,'' Ms. Akalaitis
said. She had always found acting and directing plays remarkably
free of politics and sexism, she added, but being an administrator
was different. It required savvy people-handling as well as the
schmoozing that is part of backroom negotiation and fund-raising _
skills that did not mesh well with Ms. Akalaitis's tendency to say
what she thinks.
</P>
<P>
   The firing, she said, came as a total surprise. Which,
considering that virtually everyone around her saw it coming, is a
mark of two of Ms. Akalaitis's most unexpected qualities: she is,
she admits, both naive and optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   If she were asked to do it all over again, she said, ``I would
take the job in a minute; how could you turn down a chance like
that?''

<P>
   A tall woman with the bearing of a dancer, she avoids the florid
emotionalism of many theater people, but with a little coaxing
talks with obvious pride about her two grown children. Her
forbidden vice is ``Another World,'' the daytime television soap.
``Drama in its crudest form,'' she said. ``If I weren't so confused
by my VCR, I would tape it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she has been called a humorless feminist by some of her
critics, she said she often finds herself at odds with doctrinaire
women's studies types. ``They have asked me if I think Euripides
was a feminist and I have to say, `A feminist? We're talking about
ancient Greece here. Euripides was a guy in a towel, for crying out
loud.' ''

   LOS ANGELES _ One of the things Seth MacFarlane liked about
animation when he was growing up was the way it elasticized
reality. Anvils dropped without consequence and skunks sang in
French, creating a sort of pluperfect pliability through which he
could retreat from a world where people treated him, shockingly,
like a child and enter one where he was in complete control. There,
in the manner of a visiting deity, he spoke for everyone, he had
all the money in the world, and a thought never entered anyone's
head that he didn't put there.
</P>
<P>
   This was, of course, perfect training for Hollywood, where
MacFarlane _ now 25, but still growing _ remains in almost complete
control of the new world he has created: an animated half-hour
comedy called ``Family Guy,'' which will have its premiere on Fox
next Sunday following the Super Bowl. He does the voices for almost
all of the show's principal characters, including a talking dog and
a murderous baby named Stewie. A thought almost never enters one of
the characters' heads that he didn't put there. And because it is
Hollywood, he now has almost all the money in the world: a
three-year deal with Fox guaranteeing him a minimum of $2 million
to $2.5 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   And yet MacFarlane is, inescapably, a family man himself. His
22-year-old sister, Rachel, an aspiring musician, has moved out of
the MacFarlane family home in Kent, Conn., and descended upon his
modest apartment here. ``His sister is living in his place, and I
know he's frustrated by that,'' says David Zuckerman, the
36-year-old executive producer whom Fox moved from ``King of the
Hill'' to mentor its freshly minted boy genius. ``I keep saying,
`Just buy her a condo.'''
</P>
<P>
   That MacFarlane has not yet tumbled to this more plasticized
gold-card form of reality says a great deal about his innocence,
still unsurrendered and always just beneath the surface of his
characters' skin. He must still parse his problems in a family-guy
way. Following a rewriting session that lasted until 3 o'clock one
morning before his recent 25th birthday, Zuckerman came upon his
exhausted young charge slumped over in a chair. ``I said, `What are
you sitting here for? Go home!' '' Zuckerman recalls. MacFarlane
replied glumly that his sister was using his car. Again Zuckerman
exhorted him to plasticize. ``Rent a car, for God's sake!'' he
bellowed. Sadly, MacFarlane explained that he was not yet old
enough to rent a car. ``He's making all this money,'' says
Zuckerman, ``but he's still waiting for his sister to pick him up
at work.''
</P>
<P>
   MacFarlane describes his parents as ex-hippies who were ``just
coming out of it'' when he was born in 1973. ``My father was the
dictionary definition of a hippie,'' he says. ``He had cops staking
out his house because of his sideburns, and he was at Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   This left MacFarlane hardly anything against which to rebel.
Even now, with his dark hair cropped into something resembling a
skullcap, it is a struggle for him to find his own equivalent of
the hated sideburn police of Litchfield County, so instead he
resists the accepted conventions of good taste. ``The style of
humor that you'll see in the show is the same kind of tasteless
humor that you'd find around my house when I was growing up,''
MacFarlane says. ``Some of the foulest jokes that I ever heard came
from my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   He was already paying careful attention, taking baby steps in
the general direction of prime time. ``My parents have Woody
Woodpeckers and Fred Flintstones I drew when I was 2, so I knew
pretty early what I wanted to do,'' he says. ``It was something
that always came easily to me. When I was 4, my father worked at a
grocery store, and I would sit on the counter and draw on the
grocery bags.''
</P>
<P>
   He started a cartoon strip called ``Walter Crouton'' for his
local newspaper, The Kent Good Times Dispatch, when he was 8, but
thought animation was the province of small armies engaged in cel
division until he was a venerable seventh grader and saw a show on
Nickelodeon about a college student who had made an animated film.
``I started experimenting with animation after that,'' says
MacFarlane.
</P>
<P>
   Like many prodigies, he was a classicist, intent on becoming an
artist for Disney's animation factory when he enrolled at the Rhode
Island School of Design. ``It was Disney or nothing then,''
MacFarlane says. ``Like a lot of animators, I felt like Disney is
God. Now it's become Disney is Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   At the vanguard of a generation of animation artists whose frame
of reference is almost entirely formed by television, MacFarlane
says his early influences were the serial gaffs of Homer Simpson.
One of the few liberal arts classes MacFarlane took in college was
``The Philosophy of Star Trek,'' and when he started performing
stand-up comedy, one of his most popular vocal impressions was Bill
Clinton having a conversation with Scooby Doo.
</P>
<P>
   It says something about MacFarlane's elastic view of reality
that it did not occur to him  &UR; not &LR;  to write a half-hour pilot for
an animated series while he was still in college. Several of the
television parodies from that short, ``The Life of Larry,'' have
already turned up in ``Family Guy,'' and MacFarlane's use of those
free-floating digressions has quickly become the show's hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought of a gag that was too hilarious not to do,'' he
says, ``I would try to force it into the script. It was this
meandering train-of-thought sort of thing. But it got a lot of
laughs.'' It also got him a job directing a short for an animated
anthology series at Hanna-Barbera, the Hollywood cartoon factory
responsible for ``The Flintstones.'' MacFarlane's life had come
full circle, back to the characters he had drawn on grocery bags.
He was 21.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing left for him to do but write a pilot, pitch it
to a network, then single-handedly _ and in his spare time, mind
you _ create a presentation reel on which he did all the animation
and the voices himself. His homemade demo tape galvanized
executives at Fox, not least of all in the merchandising
department. ``That the network ordered a series off of eight
minutes of film is just testimony to how powerful those eight
minutes were,'' says Sandy Grushow, president of 20th Century Fox
Television. ``There are very few people in their early 20's who
have ever created a television series.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems quite likely that MacFarlane may be the youngest ever.
Matt Stone and Trey Parker _ 25 and 26, respectively, when they
signed with Comedy Central to do ``South Park'' _ came close.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show came out of nowhere,'' Zuckerman says. ``Well,
actually it came out of Seth's head, but who was Seth MacFarlane?
``The fact that the show has gotten to where it is,'' Zuckerman
says, ``is a minor miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been other miracles, not least of all the amount of
material in appallingly dubious taste being allowed on a broadcast
network series. (Fox executives have cheerfully taken to referring
to this as the show's ``subversive humor.'') In a coming episode,
1-year-old Stewie is in such pain from teething that he begs his
mother to ``shake me like a British nanny'' to end his misery.
</P>
<P>
   And there are jokes that have made it into the series that
cannot be repeated here. ``Sometimes we go a bit over the line,''
Zuckerman concedes, ``but I think we'd still rather be compared to
`The Simpsons' than `South Park.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman, for one, did not believe the network would permit
humor that raw on a weekly basis. ``But they assured me that was
their intention,'' he says. Fox had already become the home of
adult animation, and in ``Family Guy'' the network recognized an
opportunity to appeal to a hipper, more conspicuously consuming
audience of 12-year-old boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real beauty of animation is that there are no boundaries
to the types of stories you can tell or rules on how you can tell
them,'' says Grushow, citing Stewie, the sinister child hellbent on
matricide, as an example of the way MacFarlane has reshaped the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``That simply wouldn't play in live action,'' Grushow says. ``If
you don't go there, then really you're not taking advantage of the
opportunities that are presented to you by the medium itself.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the baby sounds suspiciously like Rex Harrison, an idol
of MacFarlane's, then so much the better. ``We try to play Stewie
as something out of George Bernard Shaw when we can,'' MacFarlane
says. Indeed, one episode in which the baby's mother is off
campaigning for a seat on the school board features Stewie as Henry
Higgins. At first the baby is delighted to have her out of the
house, Zuckerman says. But then he realizes he misses her, and he
sings ``I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face.''
</P>
<P>
   MacFarlane, who does Stewie's singing and thinking for him, has
chosen to have his bad seed warble this tune while looking through
a scrapbook of pictures. They show him trying to kill his mother.

AN ACCOMPANIST STEPS TO THE FORE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a lecture before a recent lieder recital in Los Angeles,
Graham Johnson made a case for balkanizing Schubert, after a
fashion. Johnson, a piano accompanist, scholar and teacher based in
London, suggested that the six songs Schubert wrote to texts by
Heine included in the posthumous song cycle ``Schwanengesang'' be
split off and viewed as a free-standing work. The idea is vintage
Johnson, unconventional yet compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, during a talk to students at the University of
California, Irvine, Johnson suggested that Heine be seen in an
altogether new light, as a 19th-century Jackie Mason. He cited the
poet's quick wit, persecution complex and pent-up anger. It was an
iconoclastic but thought-provoking perspective, in a way
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, at the Juilliard School, Johnson begins a series of five
master classes for singers and accompanists focusing on German
song. It is unfortunate that the classes are not open to the
public, for Johnson, 48, has an engaging teaching method, which
marries wit with erudition.
</P>
<P>
   His attractive, intelligent pianism is another strength, and his
knowledge of song literature is vast. In any given program he is
likely to be more familiar with the songs than the singer is. His
discography as an accompanist is huge. (He has never recorded solo
repertory.) He made his first studio album in 1978, and he reckons
that his catalogue numbers between 75 and 80 disks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson has accompanied such outstanding vocalists as
Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Peter Pears, Victoria de los Angeles and
Jessye Norman, his most celebrated musical relationship is with
Hyperion, a small, critically acclaimed English record label. He
made his first Hyperion disk, ``Voices of the Night,'' an album of
Schumann and Brahms lieder, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known project is Hyperion's vaunted Schubert Edition,
which began in 1987 and is expected to be completed next year. It
will comprise 37 CDs and include every known song of Schubert, some
700 items in all. About 40 singers are attached to the endeavor,
all accompanied by Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for the project came abruptly, according to Ted
Perry, the founder and managing director of Hyperion. ``It was a
bold idea mooted by Graham over dinner in a Japanese restaurant and
sealed with a drink,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   What could not have been foreseen then, or even in the early
years of the venture, was its future value as a comprehensive
resource of late-20th-century Schubert interpretation. Intended to
feature only English vocalists, the project expanded to embrace
artists from the Continent and America as well.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, three generations of singers have left their mark
on Johnson's vast opus, including Janet Baker, Elly Ameling, Peter
Schreier, Brigitte Fassbaender, Lucia Popp, Thomas Allen, Felicity
Lott, Thomas Hampson, Christine Schafer, Ian Bostridge and Matthias
Goerne. Even the great baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau has been
peripherally involved, as a reader on Bostridge's ``Schone
Mullerin'' CD: a nice linkage, for Fischer-Dieskau recorded nearly
all of Schubert's songs three decades ago with the esteemed
accompanist Gerald Moore, one of Johnson's teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson likes to think of Schubert as a Shakespearean character,
meaning that the composer's works embrace a broad spectrum of
emotions and invite a wide variety of interpretations. ``Schubert
doesn't belong to any one person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to a father who played piano and
saxophone, Johnson received early training in music. ``My dad was
highly musical and my mother highly neurotic, so I'm both musical
and neurotic,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   He became an avid record collector as a young man and developed
a love for song. He was obsessed by poetry and literature and had
an interest in acting, he said, but his parents, fearing that he
would meet ``undesirable people,'' put a stop to his budding stage
career.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, at 17, he journeyed to the Royal Academy of Music in
London for serious study. He wasn't cut out for a solo career, he
said, ``because that requires a narcissistic level of
self-absorption I don't have.'' Instead, he gravitated toward
chamber music and the song literature, which he found ``much more
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, the complexity of vocal music proved irresistible.
``Songs don't have one creator,'' he explained. ``They have two.
You have a melding of biographical contexts, and it's the
combination of experience that makes a song.''
</P>
<P>
   The great song composers of the 19th and 20th centuries, he
notes, were all pianists and often accompanists. Except for Carl
Loewe and Samuel Barber, none of them sang. ``When I saw Britten
play Schubert, he became Schubert,'' Johnson said. ``It was an act
of transubstantiation. The greatest thing that can be said to me
is, `You play like the composer.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also happens to like singers. ``They're more lively and
controversial than violinists,'' he said, even though he considers
singers often less skilled as absolute musicians. ``They're selling
themselves, not an instrument.'' Of the singers he has actually
heard perform, his favorite remains Pears, whom he calls ``the
greatest artist I've ever heard live, and the greatest musical
influence of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to be an accompanist, Johnson has faced his share of
prejudice, often encountering the canard that only failed soloists
play for singers. He has a quick retort: ``There has never been a
Wunderkind accompanist in the history of music. Why do you think
that is? Well, how are you going to trust them? The art of the
accompanist is a mature one and takes a whole range of
people-skills that aren't apparent in someone who is 16 or 17. We
develop late.''
</P>
<P>
   Those people-skills are something Johnson has in abundance, and
as a public speaker, he is immediately appealing and often funny.
In 1978, he narrated a 13-part radio program on Poulenc for the
BBC, and he has since been the host for a television series on the
songs of Liszt and given innumerable lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Hyler, a vocal coach and pianist on the faculty of the
University of California, Irvine, recalls that Johnson instantly
accepted her spontaneous invitation to address a class in 1981.
``He came in and gave this off-the-cuff talk,'' she said, ``but it
was so eloquent that it sounded as if he'd been giving it all his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hyler and the accompanist she calls ``a real Renaissance
man'' became friends, and Johnson has returned twice to Irvine. In
July, he is to make his fourth visit to the campus, giving lectures
on Goethe, English song and recital programming.
</P>
<P>
   The role of teacher is one Johnson relishes, and his frequent
travels have taken him to such diverse centers of musical learning
as the Guildhall School in London and the Eastman School in
Rochester. He considers all accompanists ``repositories of
knowledge'' with a sacred duty to pass down accumulated wisdom, he
said, and regards lecturing as ``almost indivisible'' from his
concert work.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is also active as a writer. His book ``The Spanish Song
Companion'' is a basic text, and this year Oxford University Press
will publish ``A French Song Companion,'' including 160 composer
portraits by Johnson as well as 700 song translations by Richard
Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   An even greater achievement may be Johnson's booklet notes for
Hyperion. On page after page, he brings a performer's insight, a
scholar's meticulousness and a connoisseur's enthusiasm to songs by
both German and French composers. So exhaustive are his efforts
that Hyperion had to design a new jewel box just to accommodate the
bulging booklets.
</P>
<P>
   Having an affection for something and making it a mission are
not necessarily the same thing. But life and art seem fused for a
true believer like Johnson, who contends that things of value
emerge only when high standards are maintained. ``If you perceive
that the public won't want something, then they won't,'' he said of
his efforts. ``It's really a question of the idea of uplift versus
downgrading people's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has faith in what he does and what he is training others
to do, but he considers singers and accompanists mere conduits in
the grand scheme. Their job is to put before the public the best
work of others, he said. ``The composers are the important ones.
The singers may seem more significant for a brief moment, but they
go. It's the music that remains.''

 Paula Deitz is the editor of the Hudson Review  
 By PAULA DEITZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few months ago, Ward and Co., New York dealers of
ancient and medieval art, sent out a lavish, fold-out booklet of
photographs to display some of the rare objects from its
collection. Most of the objects were from prehistoric or classical
times, but an arresting one was from the medieval world: an arcade,
or arch, from a 12th-century Romanesque choir screen from the
church of the Abbey of Cluny in Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   This architectural fragment was enticing because it conjured up
an entire structure yet stood on its own as a piece of sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom in New York holds that when something
noteworthy comes on the market, you had better go see it
immediately before it disappears. The arcade was no exception: it
was soon back in private hands. Fortunately, its new owners,
Charles and Alexandra van Horne, allowed a visitor to examine the
arcade, which now resides in the dining room of their Manhattan
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The 40{-inch-high arcade is in good company: it is flanked by a
pair of stone capitals, originally owned by William Randolph
Hearst, and an assortment of medieval heads, from church gargoyles
to manor-house sculptural reliefs, on pedestals. The van Hornes
call the collection their ``ghosts and orphans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I began buying architectural fragments 20 years ago, when I
lived in England,'' said van Horne, an investment manager. He was
soon joined in this endeavor by his French-born wife-to-be. ``We
were attracted by carvings with a pagan influence, and each
purchase drew us into a new time period from around the eighth to
the 15th centuries,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring the arcade, the van Hornes have become caught up in
a kind of archeological jigsaw puzzle: scholars are working from
the scattered ruins of the abbey to determine its original
appearance. The church, completed in 1130, was the largest
ecclesiastical building in Europe until St. Peter's Basilica in
Rome was finished five centuries later. Under the dominion of the
powerful Benedictine order, the construction and decoration of the
church influenced the spread of Romanesque architecture throughout
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Singing was at the core of monastic life at Cluny. A choir of
200 chanted plainsong in the church behind the decorated choir
screen, which separated the monks from the congregation. The screen
was a free-standing architectural element that reflected the
exuberant carvings of the nearby capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, the architect had probably been trained as a
musician, and music, like mathematics, was the controlling idea
behind the elegant proportions of the church's interior.
</P>
<P>
   The church remained in use until the 18th century. ``At an early
stage of the French Revolution, the whole abbey site was divided
into four parts and auctioned off for its valuable building
stone,'' said Neil Stratford, the chief curator emeritus of
Medieval and Later Antiquities at the British Museum, who is the
general editor of the ``Corpus of the Sculpture of Cluny, Vol. 1,''
to be published in France in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The church itself was demolished over a period of 30 years, he
said, with only two sections remaining, including the great
transept and its tower. Stratford asserted that the nearly 100
fragments of the choir screen that have been accounted for made it
the largest ensemble of church furniture in Europe to survive from
the Romanesque period.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fragments were used as building material in local
houses, which had similar Romanesque arcades decorating their
facades. The van Horne arcade was found in the courtyard garden of
an antiques shop in Burgundy. With its pilaster, capital and
cornice intact, it is one of the better preserved pieces from the
screen. Some pieces of the choir screen have been reassembled and
are on view at the Ochier Museum in Cluny.
</P>
<P>
   The Cluny sculptors were inspired by classical motifs like those
found on the Roman gates of nearby towns. Among the arches there
was a great variety of patterns. The rosette on the van Horne
arcade has five petals, while one on another fragment from the
screen on display at the Cloisters, the medieval branch of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in Fort Tryon Park in Manhattan, has
seven.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, David A. Walsh, an archaeological historian at the
University of Rochester who is collaborating with Stratford, has
solved the longstanding mystery of the appearance and location of
the choir screen in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the system of holes and the rudimentary markings on
the backs, we realized that the roughly 100 bays of arcades were
connected to architectural piers and attached to an elevated wall
in a U-shaped configuration that opened to the high altar at the
apse end,'' Walsh explained. The monks sat in rows facing each
other surrounded by the choir screen, which rose 10 to 12 feet
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, in the 15th century, sumptuous tapestries depicting
the coat of arms of the abbot's family or a series of religious
scenes were hung in tiers from iron hooks _ the van Hornes's has
one _ on the decorated side seen by the monks,'' he said. Suddenly,
the scene comes alive with the echo of plainsong.

   The Russian-language television and radio station, WMNB,
broadcasts two locally produced comedy shows. Transplanted Russian
comics work the private-party circuit, while the most successful of
the New York City immigrant troupes, Kanotiye, fills the 600-seat
National restaurant in Brooklyn every time the group opens a new
variety show.
</P>
<P>
   But just because the Russians are laughing a lot, it doesn't
mean they think life is so good here. What would be funny in that?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nature of Russians to take everything with a little
bitterness and a little humor,'' said Valentin Polyakov, a member
of Kanotiye. ``There's comedy in that.''
</P>
<P>
   The line between laughter and tears was always paper-thin in
Russia. Tragedy flavored comedy and gave it its sting. Humor
survived Soviet censors and even thrived on adversity, shaped into
something subtle and delicious in the hands of comedians who
disguised their punchlines in a double entendre or a judicious
pause.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to transplant that kind of underground humor to a
country where anything and everything goes in comedy. What's the
point of subtlety, many of the older immigrant comics complain,
when everyone is free to complain out loud?
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbidden fruit is always sweet,'' said Albert Levin, a
well-known Soviet-era comedy writer who immigrated to Brooklyn two
years ago to join his son. ``When we had censors and it was
forbidden to joke, it was easier to find things to joke about.''
</P>
<P>
   But Levin, 63, is making the best of a good situation. He has
begun to revel in the Jewish jokes and the Yiddish intonations that
he was forbidden to use for most of his career (the majority of the
400,000 or so Soviet immigrants in New York City are Jewish or have
Jewish spouses).
</P>
<P>
   He does his stand-up routines at bar mitzvahs, Jewish centers
and private gatherings of Russian-speakers _ ``to keep in sporting
shape,'' he said _ and he writes a humor column for several local
Russian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Levin has also thrown himself into the task of learning English,
but he can't find anyone to practice with. This is not a joke: in
Brighton Beach, there are signs in store windows that advertise:
``English spoken here.'' Everyone speaks Russian, Levin complained
with a smile, including the Chinese merchants.
</P>
<P>
   In one of Levin's humor columns, he even talks of writing to
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to ask for political asylum in Manhattan.
Not only do his Russian Jewish neighbors refuse to speak English,
he continued, they kvetch all the time. One fellow has written to
city hall. ``Mayor, why can't you give the Statue of Liberty a
second torch _ something big for a change,'' the man complains. ``I
don't see so good anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Old age and grouch jokes aside, Russian comics are finding their
richest material in that unfathomable region where the immigrant
collides with American bureaucracy. Medicaid, welfare, traffic
rules, the tyranny of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
officer who administers the citizenship test _ these are the new
surreal aspects of many immigrants' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Comedians have managed to spin endless variations on the theme.
One of the favorites pokes fun at elderly immigrants who want
American citizenship but don't want to learn English and civics for
the INS test. Jokes about their search for a doctor to attest that
they are incapable of learning were funny enough. Then came Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, it's either-or,'' laments Simon Simarov, one of
the stars of the Kanotiye comedy troupe, in a routine he performed
recently on stage. ``I just got a paper from the doctor that I'm
not capable, and now all of the sudden they have Viagra!''
</P>
<P>
   Simarov can pull this off better than most. He started out as a
tap-dancer in Odessa at the age of 14. He is now a spry 82 and
plays the role of a slightly befuddled immigrant grandfather to the
hilt. His eyebrows ascend in wonder. His voice becomes querulous.
To be ``capable,'' he debates with himself and the audience, or not
to be?
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife,'' continues Simarov, ``tells me, either take the
Viagra and let's go to bed right away or take your sleeping pill,
which doesn't work anyway, and study English all night long.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanotiye, which is Russian for the straw hat, or boater, that
the performers wear in their revues, is the only local Russian
immigrant comedy troupe with a regular paying gig. The writers are
Edward Kamenetsky, a former Moscow producer who is also Simarov's
son-in-law, and Yuri Sychev, who worked with Kamenetsky in
prize-winning Soviet comedy shows.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They also fill the principal roles in each of Kanotiye's
ever-changing revues. The other lead players are Simarov and Yelena
Khanga, a former journalist who still flies back to Moscow every
few months to host a sex talk show on Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   Kanotiye takes over the National restaurant for one Thursday
night every three and a half months to introduce a new revue. The
performers, who mix dance, music, skits and stand-up routines in
the style of Soviet variety shows, have developed a loyal following
of Russian-speaking fans who can afford the $40 cost of a meal and
cover charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that Russian people don't go to American comedy
clubs, even though their English might be good enough,'' said the
round-faced Kamenetsky, who works by day as an advertising
executive in Manhattan. ``We saw that the humor of Russian people
has its own social and historical roots and doesn't relate to
American humor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Kanotiye repertory, the humor is indeed particular and
would be hard to translate.
</P>
<P>
   Kamenetsky and Sychev write what is often a universal style of
satire about Russian immigrants, but they carry the joke further
for their audiences by putting the satire to the music of classic
Soviet films, the Russian Civil War and the Young Pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Russian comedians, the Kanotiye performers
deliberately avoid swear words. Nor do they overtly mention sex,
even in their Viagra routines. It is only broadly suggested,
through a play on Russian words and in Simarov's expressive eyebrow
movements.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Kanotiye can sometimes appear just as raw as
its American counterparts, as in a skit that skewers people who
suddenly rediscover their Jewish roots when they want refugee
status in the United States. The scene ends with the performers
doing a jig dressed as Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Russian comedy being broadcast and performed now
would be recognizable, in translation, to anyone familiar with
Borscht Belt humor, which itself was inspired by the brand of
self-deprecating and family-centered humor brought over by Russian
Jewish immigrants early in the century.
</P>
<P>
   The mother-in-law jokes, the vaudeville-style one-liners and the
wry treatment of anti-Semitism _ all hallmarks of Odessa, the port
city still considered by Russians the font of all real humor _
sound familiar, edited only for context.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when the hosts of the television show ``Prosto
Anekdote'' (``Just Joking'') intercepted a Russian strolling on the
Brighton Beach boardwalk, he told the old chestnut about three men
on an airplane. In his joke, they are a Communist, a Fascist and a
Russian Jew. God tells them he will grant each one a wish. The
Communist wishes that all Fascists would disappear from the earth.
The Fascist wishes the same for all Communists. The Jew says, ``If
you are going to grant their wishes, I'll just take a cup of
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-known immigrant comic to jump to English-language
comedy is Yakov Smirnoff, who arrived from the Soviet Union in
1978. Smirnoff had the advantage of building his American career
during the Cold War, when just imitating the sclerotic Russian
leaders could bring a laugh. He now travels the circuit of regional
comedy clubs and corporate conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Smirnoff's commercial success, Russian comedians trying
to make it locally say they don't want to emulate him. Mark
Troubetski, who left a career as a popular master of ceremonies for
Soviet variety shows to immigrate to Brooklyn, echoed the opinion
of many when he dismissed Smirnoff's cocky stand-up style as ``not
cultured.''
</P>
<P>
   Troubetski prefers the old standards. He is the host of a Sunday
Russian-language radio show featuring interviews, music and many of
his familiar jokes from the old days about love and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   There will never be days for Russian comics like the old days,
maintained Troubetski, who is 57. Comedy then sprang from real
adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans never had problems procuring toilet paper, for
example, so they can't really appreciate it,'' he said. ``Russians
are used to big problems that would unite the whole audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kanotiye performers, who are younger, are confident that
they will find a bridge to cross over into American comedy clubs
and bring with them the heart and soul of their routines. Life can
never be so good that there's nothing to laugh about. ``You only
have to live here,'' explained Kamenetsky, ``and every breath you
take will be funny.''

   Bill Clinton's optimistic State of the Union address and his
promise of a New Dawn for America are stirring new debate over the
likelihood of his continued presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Pegged to this debate, The New York Times Syndicate is offering
``Bill Clinton's Legacy (The First Draft),'' a five-part series
adapted from Jacob Weisberg's prescient article in The New York
Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART I: BILL CLINTON'S LEGACY: THE FIRST DRAFT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's weathering of the Lewinsky scandal represents
something that is truly historic _ a break in the way the American
presidency functions. He has changed the nature of the presidency,
removed its heroic mandate and downsized the office as demanded by
the historical moment.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART II: BILL CLINTON: THE GOVERNOR-PRESIDENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his concern with Social Security, welfare, health insurance,
the minimum wage and other issues generally thought of in
connection with state government, President Clinton has made the
Oval Office into a kind of extended governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART III: HOW BILL CLINTON CREATED A DEMOCRATIC COALITION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the Democratic Party, Clinton has made ``incurable''
ailments vanish, jettisoning Dukakis-era positions such as
opposition to the death penalty, putting away the idea that
Democrats are fuzzy liberals who are ``soft on crime.'' He has
created a sense of partisan pride and given party members a new
taste of power.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART IV: BILL CLINTON'S PERSONALLY FLAWED POPULISM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton will be remembered as one who played games with the
truth, but whose claim to government was based on what he could do,
not his qualities as a moral exemplar.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART V: IS A `CULTURE WAR' TO BLAME FOR CLINTON'S
DETRACTORS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives such as Bill Bennett often take the route of
becoming infuriated with the public for falling for Bill Clinton, a
man some say is a charlatan. There are three profiles of
Clinton-hating, actually; what's behind them?

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Q: Who will be the half-dozen most important people in the year
2010? What will be the half-dozen most important products in the
year 2010?
 &HT;    ___ Amy Bruhnheil, Brussels
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A: If importance is defined by global political impact, the most
important people in the year 2010 will be those leaders whose
constituency is truly the world at large. In the digital era,
separate nation-states, with isolating boundaries, are less
important than leadership or governance that is both more local and
more global.
 &HT;    Today we know how to be more local. In many countries, more and
more decisionmaking is being pushed into the community. But we are
almost clueless about working at the global level because 1) there
is no clear constituency of people to please and 2) our current
global organizations exist as bureaucracies in favor of consensus,
not leadership. Yet those leaders who can rise above the confines
of the nation-state will be the most important.
 &HT;    Addendum: It goes without saying that humanity is faced with a
handful of scientific challenges, which, if met, would position the
inventor as heroic. The list of ``most important people'' would
surely include anybody who cured AIDS, invented teleportation or
discovered an organism that ate air and sea pollution and excreted
pure oxygen.
 &HT;    As to important products, these are in the eye of the beholder.
Some people might consider a toaster that won't burn bread to be
vital. On a world level, we probably all agree that non-polluting
cars; low-cost, low-earth-orbiting satellites; and perfectly safe
airplanes would be major new products.
 &HT;    My more idiosyncratic list would include batteries (1/100th the
size and 100 times the capacity), ubiquitous wireless
communications and computers with common sense.
 &HT;    We underestimate the need for products to improve power
management. Just look at the spaghetti of cords and AC adapters you
have, witness the enormous proportion of weight and size of
batteries in cellphones and electric cars, and consider the
potential impact of wireless power distribution (if we could invent
it). We are doing better and better at consuming less power in the
digital world, but the physical world is far less flexible.
 &HT;    The field of wireless communication today is compartmentalized,
inconsistent and unreliable. Think of a scale that goes from the
handy remote-control unit of your television (i.e., near-field
wireless communications) to global satellite systems. The challenge
is to make our wireless world seamless. In so doing, we will have
to have far more compatible systems that can talk to each other
regardless of where we are in the world or how far away on the
scale.
 &HT;    Digital common sense is the highest on my list. If computers in
2010 could have the common sense of an 8-year-old child, the world
would be a better place. The human interface with computers is in
part driven by the quality of the computer's sensory means, those
for both expression and recognition.
 &HT;    But in much greater part, the quality of the interface is driven
by the computer's intelligence. No more dumb error messages, no
more standstill because of typos, no more mistakes because the
computer ``did what I said vs. what I meant.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Not long ago, malls devastated downtown shopping areas;; is
it possible the expected surge in e-commerce might make malls
obsolete?
 &HT;    ___ Eduardo Salazar, Madrid
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A: Without question. Malls as we know them will become obsolete
as a means to sell the products that people know they want. Malls
will become the means to browse, the places to meet people and the
centers for location-based entertainment. Mall owners and tenants
need to reinvent their own magnetism, which in the future will be
more like the attraction of theme parks than street shops. If mall
owners and tenants are complacent, they will become little more
than indoor advertising: a place where people go to browse and take
notes _ while they buy later over the Net.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What approach would you take to getting a technophobe to sit
down at a computer screen?
 &HT;    ___ P. Vance, New York City
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A: Keep in mind that technophobia is not unjustified _ computers
have become far too complex and using them far too humiliating. In
almost all cases, the worst path to enlightenment is to go to a
school. The classroom is just the wrong setting for a technophobe,
who needs to feel first and foremost that this new skill is about
life, not computers.
 &HT;    After a certain age, people are either too busy to learn or they
feel ``why bother; after all, I've lived without computers so
far.'' The key to changing this attitude is to show the value of
cyber-skill.
 &HT;    Examples include the value gained by authors from word
processing, parents from e-mail to kids and researchers from the
Web. Increasingly, consumers and businesses alike are learning that
the Internet provides huge conveniences and cost savings over faxes
and telephoning.
 &HT;    Once clear reasons have been established as to why it's a good
idea to ``bother,'' the next step is to provide a soft landing on
the otherwise hostile terrain of the digital world. In some cases,
this is best done through the charisma of children as teachers _
especially when the students are grandparents. In some cases, it is
best done by peer groups.
 &HT;    History will look back upon our era as a cruel period, one that
forced people into a sense of ignominy through no fault of their
own. Keep reminding the technophobe of this.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Someone's knocking at my door. I have a feeling it's
Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, I liked Jerry when he came to my house several weeks
ago and pulled out a semi-dead orange tree from my front yard,
using nothing but his bare hands and a whole lot of angst. I was
amazed as he rocked the tree out of its earthen bed with his
homeless little man-child body, exposing the tree roots and leaving
a crater big enough to barbecue a hog in.
</P>
<P>
   I liked him as he unabashedly gave me a tour of his battle
scars, showing me a 6-inch former wound on his head that he
sustained while wrestling with the private parts of a particularly
mean queen palm, telling me how he could flip his arm around like a
rag doll after he dislocated his shoulder after a 40-foot tumble,
and demonstrating the way he had to close one eye in order to make
the right cut on a tree.
</P>
<P>
   He was proud of his work and pointed to various palm trees in
the neighborhood, claiming that the bulbous, circular necks under
the fronds were his ``signature,'' though, in my opinion, they
looked a little more like goiters than a trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how many times I've fallen out of a tree,'' he
boasted, ``I've never sued anybody. I'll sign anything you got.''
</P>
<P>
   He must have told the same thing to my next-door neighbor. After
he finished killing my orange tree, he scurried up a 50-year-old
palm in her back yard like a squirrel in the dead of night and left
his signature with a saw and only the stars to guide him.
</P>
<P>
   My husband, however, was not as impressed with Jerry as I was.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not allowed to answer the door again,'' he said simply
and firmly. ``Danger wears many different masks!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' I said. ``The man weighs 80 pounds and can only see
straight if he covers one eye! I could knock him over with a fart.
Besides, I assessed the situation and decided that he was harmless.
He won't sue us, he said he'd sign anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aha! A serial killer will always try to gain your trust!'' he
replied. ``What good is a lawsuit after he's eaten your brain like
it was a big bowl of chili?''
</P>
<P>
   I was getting my morning coffee the next day when I looked up
and gasped. From my kitchen window I saw Jerry, again 40 feet up in
the air, hugging my other neighbor's palm tree with one hand while
he waved to me with the other. It was a very friendly gesture,
although you're never really ready for a homeless tree trimmer to
extend a greeting from the sky when you're not wearing a bra or
pants yet.
</P>
<P>
   For about a week after that, Jerry came by every day to see if I
needed any more work done. I kept saying no, mostly because I felt
I was lucky that Jerry hadn't already dismembered himself or
accidentally fallen on some electrical wires on my property. His
physical disfigurements didn't bother me as much as my suspicion
that he had a hankering for hooch and was tanked a fair amount of
the time. The last thing I really needed was a television news crew
parked in my back yard, filming a fireman relentlessly poking at
Jerry's hot, pickled body with a stick until he fell headfirst into
the waiting compost bin.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, however, Jerry wore me down, especially when he began
showing up at nighttime, wanting to cut something up. To get rid of
him, I agreed that he could cut the shortest tree _ one that really
wouldn't have presented much of a challenge to a 3-year-old armed
with a dull butter knife _ on one condition. He had to start work
early in the morning so he would be somewhat sober, thus
significantly reducing the risk of death, injury or loss of
electrical power to my house, because I really hate resetting
clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry went to work, scampering up the tree in someone's old golf
shoes and a harness made out of a retired motorcycle chain and a
bunch of frayed rope. I spent the next hour searching my
homeowner's policy for a homeless, drunk tree trimmer clause until
Jerry knocked on the door and said that his signature was done.
</P>
<P>
   With a sigh of relief, I paid him more than the tree was worth
and said goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, I was Jerry's gold mine, and though he eventually
stopped asking for work, he just started asking me for outright
cash. When he popped up on my porch at 10 o'clock on a Sunday
night, I had had it. I solely bore the responsibility of creating
my own Otis Campbell, only this version carried a saw and wore
shoes with spikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need 20 dollars,'' Jerry said as I opened the door.
``Consider it a loan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry,'' I said harshly, ``I'm a writer. We eat ramen four
nights a week and ramen pot pie the other three!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen!''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten! I'll take 10!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry!'' I yelled as loud as I could, ``take your hands off my
udders because this cow is dry!''
</P>
<P>
   As I closed the door, I felt really bad for him. I kept on
feeling really bad about it until my husband did the math, figured
out that in the two days that Jerry had done work for us and our
neighbors, he had made more than we both did in a week. In fact, it
turned out, Jerry was making himself a pretty healthy salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``TAX FREE,'' my husband said, adding insult to injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I think about it,'' I said, turning things over in my
mind, ``he always wore clean clothes. And I've never seen him wear
the same thing twice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think it's a scam?'' my husband asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``A profitable one,'' I answered. ``If I glued some thumbtacks
to the bottom of your shoes, how fast do you think you could climb
a tree?'' &QL;

 &HT;    A feast fit for a poet
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Toted in to the sound of bagpipes, praised in the
immortal words of Scottish poet Robert Burns, and then slashed with
knives slipped out of socks on kilted legs, the haggis offers up
its mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared in the traditional way, they include chopped sheep's
heart, liver and lungs, mixed with oatmeal, suet and onion, stuffed
into a sheep's stomach and boiled. Modernized versions may
substitute lamb or calf liver, perhaps with sausage, for much of
the organ meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recipe's disgusting,'' says Ginger McMillan Kozlosky, a
native of Dundee, Scotland, who lives in Dunwoody (Ga.). ``I can
take about one teaspoon a year.''
</P>
<P>
   A man's a man for a' that, but it takes a man revered like
Rabbie Burns to launch thousands of teaspoons of the ``Great
Chieftain o' the Puddin-Race.'' The well-loved bard, a plowman,
satirist, sentimentalist and lover of lassies and whiskey, is the
author of ``Auld Lang Syne,'' ``A Red Red Rose'' and considerable
national pride.
</P>
<P>
   So on Monday, Scots and their descendants will gather for a
Burns Night Supper and an evening of remembrance, revelry and
feasting.
</P>
<P>
   Almost since Burns' death, in 1796 at age 37, Scots have set
aside his birthday, Jan. 25, to celebrate the ``immortal memory.''
There's a ritual to the remembrance, observed from Burns' native
land to wherever Scots have settled. In Atlanta, groups like the
Burns Club, a literary and social club, and the St. Andrew's
Society, a heritage organization, will put on their finest _ Prince
Charlies and kilts for men, dresses for women _ and celebrate in
the time-honored way. The Burns Club holds its feast in a granite
cottage on Alloway Place in East Atlanta, a replica of Burns'
birthplace in Alloway, Scotland, that the group built in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   First comes Burns' ``Selkirk Grace'':
</P>
<P>
   Some hae meat and canna eat,
</P>
<P>
   And some wad eat that want it;
</P>
<P>
   But we hae meat, and we can eat,
</P>
<P>
   And sae the Lord be thanket.
</P>
<P>
   Then bagpipes herald the arrival of the haggis, borne in with
great ceremony on a big tray, guarded with swords and greeted with
Burns' ``Address to a Haggis.'' The Scotch comes out, the toasts
begin and the real feasting starts. There are toasts to the
lassies, to queen, country and president, and to the immortal
memory of Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists dine on cock-a-leekie soup, bashed neeps and
tatties (mashed turnips and potatoes), haggis, beef or lamb and
trifle or clootie dumpling, a raisin-studded pudding. Many who
celebrate modernize the menu. The Burns Club, which celebrates
Saturday, will have roast beef, spinach, kale, potatoes and trifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a haggis, of course,'' says Grant Crate, a member
from Lawrenceville (Ga.). ``We don't really have a traditional
Scottish dinner much anymore. People are getting a little too fancy
for just a little basic bashed neeps, that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``hamely fare'' of Scotland won praise from Burns, who
ragged those preferring French ragouts and fricassees to haggis.
But it's still looking for respect.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlosky works at Taste of Britain, a food and gift store in
Norcross (Ga.) that sells haggis, bridies (meat pastries) and other
English and Scottish fare. She sticks up for the food of her native
land, especially the salmon, strawberries and raspberries.
</P>
<P>
   But even she admits that ``most people turn up their noses at
Scottish cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the kind of backbreaking farm work that weakened
Burns' heart and led to his early death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people that emigrated to this country truly
are from Scottish peasant stock, where the food had to be very
substantial and very heavy,'' says Jacqueline Stewart of Pinehurst,
N.C., managing director of Scottish Heritage USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food was more a utilitarian thing than a culinary aesthetic
thing. The upper crust of Scotland were very much influenced in
their daily lives by France, so there is this dichotomy between the
very plain and the very elegant food.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the rest of Britain, there's a cooking renaissance going
on in Scotland, with chefs like George Mckay of Balbirnie House
turning out smoked salmon salad with brown butter vinaigrette and
Tony Pierce of Knockinaan Lodge crafting hot sticky toffee pudding
souffle with honey and single-malt ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of preparing a Burns Night Supper, there's no
need to choose between plain or fancy. We've put together a menu
with the best of both.
</P>
<P>
   Let other poets raise a fracas
</P>
<P>
   Bout vines, and wines, an drucken Bacchus,
</P>
<P>
   An crabbit names an stories wrack us,
</P>
<P>
   An grate our lug:
</P>
<P>

</P>

<P>
   Scottish heritage groups stage many of the Burns Night suppers
in the United States. Yet there's no reason you can't put together
a home celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up a book of Robert Burns' poetry, some Scotch and, if
you're going all the way with the ritual, some bagpipe music.
Prepare a few toasts, too, and brush up on the lyrics of ``Auld
Lang Syne,'' which traditionally concludes a Burns supper.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Web sites give ideas for toasts and contain
selections of Burns' poetry; try starting out at the Bard, at
http://www.rabbie-burns.com, or Burns Country,
http://www.robertburns.org.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find a haggis recipe here _ we tried an Americanized
version, and still couldn't, er, stomach it. But if you're set on
upholding tradition, you can buy haggis at specialty food stores
like Taste of Britain in Norcross. It's a good idea to call ahead
to make sure it's in stock.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the most important ingredient for a successful
Burns celebration: good companions. Or, as Burns wrote, ``But a
club of good fellows, like those that are here, And a bottle like
this, are my glory and care.''

   This side dish, better know to most of us as mashed turnips and
potatoes, is a hearty standard accompaniment on the Scottish table
and makes a nice presentation when served with their respective
garnishes. If you plan to serve the lamb recipe with roasted
potatoes, you may want to go with just turnips _ but for a buffet
few would object to potatoes in two guises.
</P>
<P>
   1 pound small turnips, quartered
</P>
<P>
   1 pound small boiling potatoes, quartered

<P>
   3 tablespoons warm heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Parsley
</P>
<P>
   Nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Boil the turnips in a saucepan of water for 2 minutes. Drain and
refresh under cold running water.
</P>
<P>
   In separate saucepans, boil the turnips and potatoes in water
just to cover until tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Mash each in separate
bowls with a little warm milk and butter. Season with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heap the turnips and potatoes separately on plates. With the
back of a serving spoon, make a small indentation in each heap.
Into each, pour a little warm heavy cream and a pat of butter.
Garnish with chopped parsley on the tatties (potatoes) and a
sprinkle of nutmeg on the neeps (turnips). _ ``Piping Hot: The

</P>
<P>
   For the lamb: Trim excess fat and membrane off the lamb. Wash
under running water, pat dry and place in a large roaster. Rub salt
on lamb; pour water in the bottom of the roaster. Roast with lid on
for about 45 minutes. Remove lid and continue roasting, basting
frequently, for another 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Put potatoes and carrots around lamb and roast until they are
done and the pan is sticky brown. Baste meat, potatoes and carrots
frequently. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees for last
15 to 20 minutes. Allow 2 1/2 to 3 hours total roasting time.
</P>
<P>
   For the gravy: Place lamb on a cutting board and put the
well-done, crispy brown potatoes and carrots into a large bowl.
Pour off any excess grease from the pan. Add the water mixed with a
little flour to the pan and stir to make the gravy. Accompany the
lamb with gravy and mint sauce. _ From ``Piping Hot: The Scottish

<P>
   In Scotland, oatcakes are traditionally buttered and served with
herring or cheese; alternately, they may be served with honey or
jam.
</P>
<P>
   1 3/4 cups regular oatmeal
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   5 to 9 teaspoons hot water
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Pulverize 1 cup of the oatmeal in a food processor. With the
motor running, add baking powder and salt and pulse, then add
melted butter. When all the butter has been absorbed, add the hot
water, a teaspoonful at a time, stirring constantly, to make a
smooth, firm paste.
</P>
<P>
   Gather the mixture into a ball and place it on a board or table
lightly sprinkled with 1/4 cup of the remaining oatmeal. Roll the
ball into the oatmeal until it is completely covered with flakes.
Spread another 1/4 cup oatmeal evenly over the board and, with a
rolling pin, roll the ball out into an 8-inch circle about 1/8 inch
thick. With pastry wheel or sharp knife, cut the circle into 8
pie-shaped wedges. Scatter the remaining oatmeal on a baking sheet
and, with a large metal spatula, carefully transfer the wedges to
the sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the cakes in the middle of the oven for about 15 minutes.
When the wedges are light brown, turn off the heat and open the
door of the oven. Leave the oatcakes in the oven for 4 or 5
minutes, or until they become firm and crisp. Serve at once. _ From

   There's one must for shortbread, says Ginger McMillan Kozlosky
of Dunwoody (Ga.): ``It should melt in your mouth when you eat
it.'' Kozlosky, a native of Dundee, Scotland, has been preparing
the Scottish favorite for more than 45 years. This is her aunt's
recipe. Rice flour gives a lighter texture to the shortbread, but
all-purpose flour can be substituted if you can't find rice flour.
</P>
<P>
   1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup rice flour (available in Asian grocery stores, some
larger
</P>
<P>
   supermarkets and health food stores)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup plus 2 teaspoons caster sugar or superfine sugar (found
in the sugar section of larger supermarkets; or make your own by
pulsing granulated sugar a few times in the food processor)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   Confectioners' sugar, for dusting pan
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a medium bowl, mix flour, rice
flour and 1/2 cup caster sugar. Cut butter into small pieces and
drop into flour. Rub into flour with fingertips or use a pastry
cutter. Knead mixture together until it forms a soft dough. Dust a
9-by-9-inch pan with confectioners' sugar. Press the dough into the
pan, about 1/2 inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Score lightly into 12 pieces. Prick dough all over with a fork.
Sprinkle 1 to 2 teaspoons caster sugar over top. Bake about 45
minutes until a creamy color, not brown, although there might be
some touches of brown on the edges or raised parts. It should feel
soft. Cut through the scored pieces and let cool and harden in the
pan. _ From Ginger McMillan Kozlosky of Dunwoody

   HAVANA _ At a farmers' market here, overrun with as many flies
as customers, vendor Ramon Vega quietly criticizes the Cuban
government for raising his taxes from $4 to $6 a day (in U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the gaunt entrepreneur says he ekes out a decent living
by hawking tomatoes no bigger than plums, as well as other
products.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has recently heard rumors that the government may
shut down the farmers' markets, but he's praying that they're not
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``By raising taxes, the government is making it harder for us to
do business, but certainly the farmers need these markets to make
ends meet,'' he laments.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers' markets surfaced here in 1994 as a way to ease the
massive food shortages that followed the collapse of the Soviet
Union, Cuba's prime benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   They are well-stocked with everything from chicken to cucumbers,
all sold at prices established by simple supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   The goods are supplied by farmers permitted to sell their
surplus after meeting production quotas set by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Similar markets were allowed in 1981, but were closed in 1986 by
government officials concerned the farmers had grown too rich.
</P>
<P>
   Now experts warn they might be closed again, or seriously
curtailed due to onerous restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years after his Jan. 1, 1959 revolution, President Fidel
Castro appears to be putting the brakes on economic reforms that
marked the first years of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is due, in part, to the financial meltdowns in Asia
and elsewhere, which Castro points to as proof that Cuba's
socialism remains the best model after all.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, ``the Cuban regime has been frozen in its
economic course,'' said Damian Fernandez, an expert on Cuba at
Florida International University in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches, Castro, now 72, has made a point of
reconfirming his adherence to communist ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic order which dominates the planet will inevitably
fall,'' he predicted earlier this month, adding that globalization
has turned the planet into one giant casino.
</P>
<P>
   For certain, the die-hard Marxist, whose welfare state still
boasts free education and health care, never wanted to flirt with
capitalism in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But he was forced to adopt limited free-market reforms in the
early 1990s in the face of economic ruin following the loss of $4
billion in annual Soviet subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1993, Cubans could be imprisoned for possessing American
dollars, whereas today they are the country's most sought-after
currency. As a result, the Cuban peso has been so weakened that
hotel busboys now earn more in daily tips than brain surgeons earn
in monthly salaries.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, once-lambasted private enterprises have been
allowed to flourish -- at least in small doses.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past year or so, the government has imposed a
series of crackdowns on private-sector activity.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses are now illegal, and those that are legal aren't
allowed to employ anyone other than relatives. For example, neither
the private selling of fish nor private retail stores are allowed.
In addition, sellers must remain mobile, easily pushed from place
to place.
</P>
<P>
   The moves have discouraged foreign companies, so much so that
even investment in Cuba's new free zones -- tax-free areas where
companies are encouraged to locate -- has fallen flat.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban government officials agree that the number of
self-employed people has decreased, from 250,000 in 1994 to 200,000
today.
</P>
<P>
   But they insist foreign investment continues to mushroom, citing
340 joint ventures between Cuba and foreign investors today,
compared with 50 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no backtrack policy,'' said government spokesman
Roberto de Armas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see now in the private sector is going to stay and
develop,'' he added. ``But we are never going to give up our
socialist achievements either.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the reason the number of self-employed people has
dropped is because some businesses simply weren't efficient enough
to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first allowed self-employment, everyone wanted to be
self-employed, but obviously some are not going to make it, and
that's the way a real market is supposed to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Increased investment is clear on the streets of this fading
beauty of a city, where vintage Fords and Chevrolets from the 1950s
roam beside gaudy new hotels, U.S.-style malls, and even 24-hour
service stations.
</P>
<P>
   American businesses, too, increasingly have their eyes on the
Cuban market. The number of U.S. executives traveling to Cuba
jumped last year to 2,500, from 500 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not reforms have stalled, free enterprise already has
established a modest beachhead on this communist island 90 miles
south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   More artisans are selling their paintings. More Cubans are
renting spare rooms in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Limited reforms ``have created a market-based sector where
Cubans learn capitalism, earn more and in some cases have tangible
economic freedom,'' said Philip Peters, a senior fellow at the
Alexis de Tocqueville Institution in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say the Cuban economy still has a long way to go,
and that more economic adjustments are needed to boost
private-sector activity.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister of economy and
planning, Cuba's economy grew by a paltry 1.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The poor showing can be blamed partly on a sugar harvest that
was the smallest in 50 years due to weather-related disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban government officials also point a finger at the stifling
U.S. economic embargo against Cuba that was imposed in 1961 and
prohibits American investment and spending there.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial Helms-Burton law, enacted in 1996 after Cuba
shot down pilots from an anti-Castro group, tightened that embargo
even more by punishing foreign companies that do business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Cuban economy rests largely on two pillars: tourism
and remittances.
</P>
<P>
   Money sent by Cuban exiles to relatives in Cuba is now estimated
to bring in more than $800 million a year. Tourism attracts more
than $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say a real economic boom may be years away, especially
if the government moves toward a socialist system that's more
tightly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, they say Cuba's nearly 12 million people can expect
little change this year.
</P>
<P>
   As Castro defiantly proclaimed in a speech earlier this month:
``The revolution has just begun.''

CHINA: FRIEND, ENEMY OR SCAPEGOAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Pundits in the pre-Lewinsky days seemed
obsessed over ``the China connection,'' a label covering a
fund-raising scandal within the Democratic Party. Although that
controversy never gripped the public's attention, it hasn't gone
away.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it could step to center stage once the Clinton
impeachment mess is concluded. Journalistic muckrakers and
Republican pooh-bahs have alleged the Chinese government illegally
contributed funds to President Clinton's 1996 campaign to influence
U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing, it was said, used a few Chinese-American fund-raisers
as go-betweens, hoping they would sway the Clinton administration
to loosen restrictions on passing along sensitive technology. Along
with continuing criticisms of China's human rights record, the
spotlight on the technology exchange issue paints China as an
amoral, manipulative nation interested only in stealing our
precious technology to enhance its nuclear weapons capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Mine is not a knee-jerk defense of Chinese government actions,
for I have no inside knowledge of China's motivations _ or
Washington's. A simplistic good-vs.-evil plot line works well in
comic books and sci-fi thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, geopolitical relationships are almost aways
murkier, if not downright confusing. Before we assume a new Evil
Empire is looming in East Asia to supplant the old Soviet Union's
threat to world peace, it is instructive to consider the actions of
American companies and the government, now and a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   If China was eager to acquire U.S. technology at almost any
cost, legally or illegally, then who on our side was equally
willing to sell it? Hughes Electronics, a unit of General Motors,
and Loral Space and Communications, that's who.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the American companies have sold technology to China
is to save money. Both Hughes and Loral build satellites for
various commercial and military operations. It is an expensive
proposition to launch them into space. The Chinese can do it more
cheaply than American companies. So, to save a few million dollars,
Hughes and Loral have hooked up with Chinese rocket-launching
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   It is obviously in Hughes' and Loral's best interests that
Chinese companies have capable technology to get their satellites
into space. When some Chinese launches haven't worked, Hughes and
Loral have helped the Chinese fix the problem. In so doing,
according to Pentagon and House investigators, the two American
companies improperly passed along technology that could be used to
enhance China's military capabilities _ altering, some feel, the
strategic military balance between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   If some American leaders are wary of China now, they weren't a
generation ago, when Washington leaders like former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger regarded China as a strategic partner against
the then-dreaded Soviet Union, whose nuclear arsenal more than
matched ours.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kissinger documents assembled by the National
Security Archive, an independent research center, and as reported
earlier this month by the Washington Post, the United States worked
with China in the early 1970s on what the Post called ``a
broadening security relationship that has included providing the
Chinese sophisticated computer technology, setting up electronic
listening posts along the Chinese-Russian border and using Chinese
rockets to launch U.S. satellites.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it was OK for us to share advanced technology
with China when we wanted to use China for our own purposes. But
today we don't need China to offset a bigger threat. China, in the
imagination of some American leaders, is now the potential threat,
so technology relationships begun by us more than 25 years ago are
now highly suspect, if not potentially treasonous.
</P>
<P>
   Friendship is a fickle concept on the world stage.

AN IMPEACHMENT CLAUSE FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Count me among the 30 percent of Americans who,
according to the polls, are closely following the Senate's
impeachment trial of President Clinton. It has been suggested to me
that I should get a life and just ignore the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I should, too. Following the democratic process seems
painfully unfashionable these days _ like smoking cigarettes or
actually opening a book now and then. Interest in politics, even an
interest that pays the bills, seems clear and convincing evidence
that you're just not with it.
</P>
<P>
   But I've learned something by watching all this. I've learned
that we once again need to amend the Constitution of the United
States. We need, specifically, to alter the impeachment clause.
</P>
<P>
   It now reads, ``The president, vice president and all civil
officers of the United States shall be removed from office on
impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that perjury or obstruction of justice is a
serious crime _ a ``high crime,'' if you will. There's also no
question that most people, for a variety of reasons, don't want
this president removed for committing this particular high crime.
The problem is that the Constitution, the supreme law of the land,
was written by a bunch of dead, slaveholding white males, and it
seems to mandate removing a president who commits a serious crime,
even though many people pretend that it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's my suggestion as to how to fix this outdated
document. The impeachment clause should be rewritten to read as
follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, vice president and all civil officers of the
United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for and
conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and
misdemeanors _ except in the following cases:
</P>
<P>
   ``1. If the high crime in question is in any way, shape or form
connected, however remotely, with private, consensual sexual
activity with any mammal or other life form;
</P>

FROM ITALY WITH LOVE: PANINI BECOME AN AMERICAN CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If a hero is but a sandwich, panini are but a
snack.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Don't be. Panini have simply been Americanized.
</P>
<P>
   Translated literally from Italian, panini means ``rolls'' or
``little breads.'' In Italy, the word is synonymous with appetizer
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   There, they are designed to be eaten between meals, on-the-run
or standing at a chest-high counter, to be chased down with a quick
shot of intoxicating espresso. Sometimes they are served with
drinks before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Panini (singular is panino) became popular in the United States
a decade or so ago. It is believed they first appeared in
California, notably at the Angeli Caffe in Los Angeles. By the time
they started showing up in New York, panini were being made with a
special grill that resembles a waffle iron.
</P>
<P>
   The key to first-rate panini, however, is not the grill but the
quality of bread used to prepare the sandwich. Panini can be served
hot or cold. However, artisanal breads, freshly baked and
preferably on a stone hearth, are a must for proper panini.
</P>
<P>
   As for the filling, there is no limit to what goes in the
panini. Simplicity and freshness are paramount, but there is no
right or wrong way to combine ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PANINI CAPRESE
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 2 panini)
</P>
<P>
   1 large ball fresh mozzarella, about 1/2 pound
</P>
<P>
   2 large rolls, round or baguette-shaped
</P>
<P>
   Extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 medium tomatoes, ripe but firm, cored and sliced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Dried Mediterranean oregano, such as Greek oregano
</P>
<P>
   8 basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   Cut the mozzarella in slices and place on folded clean tea
towels. Meanwhile, slice the rolls in half horizontally. Place
bread cut-side-down on a grill or cut-side-up under a hot broiler,
until lightly toasted. Drizzle both sides of the bread with olive
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange tomatoes on bottom halves of rolls. Season with salt and
pepper, a sprinkling of oregano, and a drizzle of olive oil.
Arrange the mozzarella on top of the tomatoes. Season again with
salt, pepper, oregano and olive oil. Top with the whole basil
leaves. Cover the top halves of the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GOAT CHEESE AND ROASTED PEPPER PANINI
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 4 panini)
</P>
<P>
   5 1/2 ounces goat cheese, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   3 green onions, trimmed of half of the green tops, finely
chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped basil
</P>
<P>
   1 small garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 red bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons capers
</P>
<P>
   Small pinch hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   4 michette, or round rolls, about 5 inches in diameter
</P>
<P>
   Place the goat cheese in a bowl and combine with the green
onions, herbs and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
You can prepare cheese mixture several hours in advance.
Refrigerate, then bring to room temperature before using.
</P>
<P>
   Roast the peppers. Remove the blackened skin, core, seeds and
membranes. Cut into thick strips. Place on a plate and toss in
olive oil, lemon juice, capers and hot red pepper flakes. Season
with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Split the rolls in half. Spread the goat cheese on the bottom
half of the rolls. Top with strips of roasted peppers and capers.
Drizzle the remaining juices over the inside of the top half of the
rolls. Cover panini with the top halves.

</P>
<P>
   PANINO RUSTICO
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 4 panini)
</P>
<P>
   4 boneless chicken breasts, skin on
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon raisins, plumped in hot water for 10 minutes, then
drained, optional
</P>
<P>
   Rolls of your choice
</P>
<P>
   Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   Small bunch or arugula, stems trimmed, washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400.
</P>
<P>
   Place the chicken on a baking sheet, skin-side-up. Bake for
about 15 minutes, or until cooked through. Remove from the oven and
let cool.
</P>
<P>
   When the chicken has cooled, remove and discard the skin. Shred
the meat and place in a medium stainless or glass bowl. Add salt
and pepper to taste. Use a citrus zester to zest the lemon directly
over the shredded chicken. Cut the zested lemon in half and squeeze
the juice from one half over the chicken. Add the olive oil,
balsamic vinegar, pine nuts and the raisins if desired. Stir gently
to mix.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble the panini, slather the bottom of a roll with Dijon
mustard. Spoon the chicken salad and some of the juices onto the
rolls and top with the arugula and the tops of the rolls. Cut in
half and serve.

   &UR; WELCOMES AND WORRIES: KING HUSSEIN RETURNS TO JORDAN &LR;  &QL;

<P>

</P>
<P>
   AMMAN _ Piloting his own plane, King Hussein returned to Jordan
today following six months of chemotherapy treatment for cancer in
the U.S. While Jordanians publicly celebrated his reported cure
from lymphoma, they privately speculated about who will succeed to
the throne the king has held for 45 years _ and about the future of
their country after his reign.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of succession from King Hussein's point of view is
that Jordan cannot afford a weak ruler because it is less poweful
than all of its neighbors. He knows his dynasty cannot afford to
make too many mistakes. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Egregious and criminal conduct; repeated lying;
adultery, obstruction of justice and perjury. In great detail,
these are the charges that have been lobbed against the President
of the United States in the past few days. Is it any wonder that
Americans have such a low opinion of their politicians?
</P>
<P>
   Except, it seems, they don't. Most of the evidence shows that
Americans have, over the last few years, recovered some of their
trust in politics and government, and calling someone a politician
is no longer the worst insult you can level. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The president is threatened with impeachment. His
enemies believe he is guilty of high crimes (not to mention
misdemeanors), and want him thrown out of office. They regard him
with a venom that at times defies explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, he is not Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   These days all eyes are on Washington and the president's
impeachment trial. But, for the past six months, a 15-member
Russian parliamentary commission has been busy investigating
whether there are grounds to impeach Boris Yeltsin. &QL;

   Serbian forces may have cleared the bodies from the mosque. They
may have succeeded in hiding some of the evidence from
international observers. But the implications of the massacre in
the Kosovo town of Racak cannot be cleaned up so easily, for the
anger felt around the world has been both heartfelt and genuine.
</P>
<P>
   If we do not wish to see more innocent people die in vain, the
only solution is to intervene in force to secure the separation of
the combatants in Kosovo and to hope that negotiation is forced by
the stalemate. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The familiar yellow, red and green logo of Denny's
restaurants has added a new color: black.
</P>
<P>
   Since paying out a stinging $54 million settlement a few years
ago to two groups of aggrieved customers who claimed they had been
refused tables or service for no reason other than their skin
color, Denny's has embarked on an ambitious image makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of its employees are now black or Hispanic, and
one-third of its supervisory staff are minorities. It has minority
representatives on its board and puts all staff through
``diversity'' training.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Denny's franchises held by black Americans has
gone from one to 123 in six years. &QL;

   A tiny part of the country, at least, is extremely wealthy, with

CRITICISM MAKES MEXICAN SOLDIER A WANTED MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For most of the 24 years that he served as an Army
surgeon, Hildegardo Bacilio Gomez performed as most other soldiers
do: respectfully, obediently, and quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is Mexico's most wanted military fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Bacilio Gomez, a 43-year-old lieutenant colonel, has
been accused of desertion for failing to show up for work three
days last month.
</P>
<P>
   But he is more widely known for doing something rarely seen in
modern Mexican history: leading an internal rebellion in the armed
forces and openly criticizing his superiors and the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bacilio Gomez led about 50 fellow officers on an unprecedented
march late last month down Paseo de la Reforma, the capital city's
main boulevard, to protest what they say are deteriorating
conditions for Mexico's armed forces. Last week, in another
protest, he and five others attempted to deliver a letter outlining
their demands to President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Although the insurgency consists of only a fraction of Mexico's
175,000 soldiers and officers, it is unusual. In the 80 years that
the governing party, known as the PRI, has been in charge, the
country's military has been a mostly silent and loyal ally. In
exchange, presidents for decades have given military brass plenty
of autonomy to manage their own internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The group's protests have also brought new attention here to the
role of the military in a society that is discovering more openness
in its civil and political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is highly unusual but not unprecedented,'' said Donald
Schulz, a professor at the US Army War College who has written
extensively on the Mexican military. ``A number of officers have
voiced similar complaints to me.''
</P>
<P>
   To show their unwillingness to tolerate such open rebellion,
military authorities arrested five of the protesters Jan. 11 and
charged them with sedition and insubordination. Top officials have
also warned that others who join the protests will be severely
punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must put before our own interests those of the sovereignty
of the nation, loyalty to institutions and the honor of the Army,''
Rafael Macedo de la Concha, the military's top prosecutor, wrote in
a statement issued after the march.
</P>
<P>
   Bacilio Gomez remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that military police will kill him, he has left Mexico
for Venezuela, his colleagues said last week, adding that he would
seek asylum there from that country's president-elect, Hugo Chavez
_ a former lieutenant colonel who was once jailed for leading a
bloody coup attempt in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities, however, believe that Bacilio Gomez is
still in the country and they are searching for him.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the dissident movement, which calls itself the
``Patriotic Command to Raise the Consciousness of the People,'' is
a demand that armed forces personnel receive the same rights as
ordinary citizens and that the military court system be reformed
along the lines of civilian courts to stop corruption and the
imprisonment of innocent soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Bacilio Gomez was sent to medical school by the military. His
career as a prenatal specialist proceeded normally until he was
jailed in September 1996 for abandoning his post at an Army
hospital, an accusation he denies. He temporarily left his
assignment, he said, to treat a pregnant woman in a private clinic
he and his wife, a physician, have been allowed to operate for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon, the father of six children, was sent to jail for
three days and his monthly pay was slashed from $1,500 to less than
$200.
</P>
<P>
   After that incident, according to interviews he has given to
Mexican reporters, he started meeting other officers who said they
had been through similar experiences. The group of officers started
regularly holding secret gatherings early last year.
</P>
<P>
   At first, they tried direct appeals to General Enrique
Cervantes, the Mexican defense secretary. They sent him letters
arguing that most of the soldiers in military prisons had been
falsely or unfairly convicted and requested a meeting with him.
Cervantes never responded, so the officers chose their march down
Mexico City's main boulevard in protest.
</P>
<P>
   In statements released to the press and on the Internet during
the last few weeks, Bacilio Gomez also has criticized the country's
move toward a free-market society and expresses admiration for
Subcommander Marcos, the masked leader of a rebellion by indigenous
people in the southern state of Chiapas, and for Northern Ireland
political leader Gerry Adams, head of the Sinn Fein party. Bacilio
Gomez also admires Venezuela's Chavez, who decried massive
corruption in the military and in political parties as he moved
from coup leader to vote-getter.
</P>
<P>
   In writings, Bacilio Gomez has borrowed from that theme.
``Mexico is in flames, living in a Dantesque inferno,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Many within the military have ridiculed Bacilio Gomez and his
fellow protesters, calling them ``arrogant,'' ``clowns,'' and
``traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   One Army brigadier general, Alvaro Vallarta Cecena, wrote last
week in the Mexico City newspaper Reforma that ``when some soldiers
publicly and collectively raise their complaints against a superior
or make demands of any nature, they are flagrantly violating
military laws and the corresponding authorities should act.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican military's job has changed significantly over the
last 20 years. In addition to traditional tasks of protecting
borders and maintaining order when a natural disaster hits, more
units are being assigned to battle heavily armed drug cartels and,
more recently, to fight indigenous _ and often popular _ guerrilla
movements in the southern states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   Though the missions may be more dangerous, the soldiers' pay
remains among the lowest among government workers _ about $200 a
month _ less than half the salary of a judicial police officer in
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many who don't like these new roles because they
feel they can be either corrupted or killed,'' said Jorge Chabat, a
professor specializing in security issues at the Center for
Research and Economic Science in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a military officer spoke up against his superiors
was in 1993. General Jose Francisco Gallardo Rodriguez openly
criticized the military for committing human rights abuses. The
general, who had also called for the appointment of a human rights
ombudsman, was charged with embezzling funds and sent to prison,
where he remains, despite protests from rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts say the marches may foreshadow broader, deeper
discontent within the armed forces and an end to its tight-lipped
acceptance of a corrupt society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military has always been a hermetically sealed
institution, especially when it comes to internal problems,'' said
Schulz, the US Army War College professor. ``But now there's more
criticism coming out. It's quite an extraordinary change we've seen
in the last few years.''

FEDERAL LAWSUIT TO SEEK COSTS OF SMOKING-RELATED ILLNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking the government's antitobacco fight to new
ground, President Clinton announced that the Justice Department is
drafting a lawsuit against tobacco companies to recover the
``hundreds of billions of dollars'' that federal agencies have
spent on smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Similar lawsuits led to a series of settlements last year
between state governments and the nation's largest tobacco
companies. In the biggest deal, the industry agreed to pay roughly
$206 billion to 46 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars
under Medicare and other programs,'' Clinton said in a surprise
announcement during his State of the Union address. ``The states
have been right about this: Taxpayers shouldn't pay for the costs
of lung cancer, emphysema, and other smoking-related illnesses. The
tobacco companies should.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Justice Department lawyers are ``preparing a
litigation plan to take the tobacco companies to court, and with
the funds we recover, to strengthen Medicare.'' He did not say when
the suit would be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Tobacco Institute, which represents the
industry, did not return calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has been considering a lawsuit against
tobacco companies ever since the first state case was filed about
four years ago, said Kathryn Kahler Vose, spokeswoman for the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We frankly have wondered why the Justice Department has not
moved more quickly against the tobacco companies, and we are
encouraged to hear that they are moving now,'' she said. ``The
tobacco companies are adding kids every day'' as customers, ``and
for the federal government not to hold them responsible is a real
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Antitobacco activists failed last year to push legislation
through Congress that would have forced the industry to pay $516
billion to the federal government and states over 25 years. The
bill also would have imposed advertising restrictions on tobacco
companies, forced them to reveal research documents, and levied
fines if the number of new teen-age smokers did not decline.
</P>
<P>
   Though contents of the Justice Department lawsuit were not
disclosed, the suit could seek some of those remedies. In its
settlement with the states, the tobacco industry agreed to new
restrictions on marketing to minors, though they were less
restrictive than envisioned in the federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, White House aides have said Clinton will push to
raise the cigarette tax this year by 55 cents pack. Antitobacco
activists say raising the cost of cigarettes is an effective way to
discourage teens from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also pushed to expand the Food and Drug
Administration's ability to regulate tobacco. In his address,
Clinton called on Congress ``to reaffirm the FDA's authority to
protect children from tobacco'' and said that ``our children are
targets of a massive media campaign to hook them on cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government spends money to treat tobacco-related
disease through several programs, including Medicare.

PRICES FOR CHIC SAN FRANCISCO ADDRESSES GO SKY-HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CORRIE M. ANDERS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A little more than a year ago, art patron Ji'ing
Soong quietly let it be known among a select group of society real
estate brokers that she would be willing to sell her Pacific
Heights penthouse for $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The price for the co-op apartment was considered outlandishly
high by San Francisco standards and the Soong family eventually
took the property off the market.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is laughing these days. In November, real estate
agents Malin Giddings and Richard Weil collaborated on a deal that
will likely alter what future buyers will pay for exclusive
addresses in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The two agents sold oil scion Billy Getty's two-bedroom Russian
Hill penthouse to radio station entrepreneur Charlton Buckley for
$15 million. The price made it the most expensive home ever sold in
San Francisco and was double the previous high of $7.5 million
fetched in 1997 for a Pacific Heights showcase mansion.
</P>
<P>
   In a year that saw singer Linda Ronstadt sell her Pacific
Heights mansion for $5 million and leave town and Hollywood actress
Sharon Stone purchase a $6 million water's-edge manse in Sea Cliff,
Getty's deal caused gasps from Beverly Hills to Europe _ and left
locals pondering if San Francisco prices could rise even higher in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 11 residential properties in the city sold for $5
million or more. But only Getty's reached the lofty eight-figure
level _ and that for a 4,000-square-foot apartment on the 24th
floor of a contemporary 1960s building.
</P>
<P>
   Weil, an agent with Hill &AMP; Co., said $15 million price tags for
platinum homes could become relatively commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some houses on Outer Broadway and on the Gold Coast
where the owners probably have $15 to $20 million in improvements
in them,'' Weil said. ``So, I'm sure that if anyone of those ever
came on the market, it would be up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, two separate buyers closed escrow for several
residential lots on the largest undeveloped tract of land left in
tony Pacific Heights. Real estate sources said the buyers each paid
approximately $8 million for three-lot parcels where they plan to
build estate homes.
</P>
<P>
   The penthouse deal helped Giddings rack up real estate
transactions totaling $72 million last year _ more than any other
sales agent in San Francisco. But she said she wasn't convinced
that the deal set new ``comps'' _ a technique appraisers use to
establish value _ because the renovated penthouse was unique.
</P>
<P>
   The penthouse, in which two apartments were remodeled into a
single unit, has dramatic 360 degree views of San Francisco and the
Bay. Private elevators go directly into the living quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the owner had renovated in such exquisite, unusual taste _
down to the last minute detail,'' said Giddings, a TRI-Coldwell
Banker agent.
</P>
<P>
   One of Getty's distinct touches was a Biosphere-style terrarium
containing more than a dozen rare Brazilian frogs. The
half-inch-long frogs, poisonous in their natural habitat, lived
harmlessly in a climate-controlled terrarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the penthouse sale will affect prices in the future,''
Giddings said. ``But I think this high will be hard to surpass.''
</P>
<P>
   The Getty sale was not the most expensive home sold in the San
Francisco Bay area last year, however.
</P>
<P>
   That record was set in Silicon Valley. The completely-renovated,
Tudor-style home in suburban Woodside included several acres of
land, a helicopter pad, home theater, swimming pool and tennis
court, and ``top-of-the-line everything,'' said Carole Rodoni,
president of Alain Pinel whose brokerage handled the transaction.
The asking price was $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three offers on this home _ and it sold for almost
$17 million,'' Rodoni said. That means two other buyers still are
looking for homes to purchase in that price range.
</P>
<P>
   ``For (buyers), it's never about money,'' she said, ``it's about
location, security, privacy and something unique. And if they can't
have it, they want to be able to take a piece of property and build
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely the route the new San Francisco owners of a
1919 Georgia-Revival manor have taken to transform their Pacific
Heights home into a palace. At $7.3 million, the home was the
second most expensive home sold in the city last year.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford University professor Myron Scholes, who won the 1997
Nobel prize for economics, purchased the third most expensive home
in the city last year. The $6.5 million home on Russian Hill, just
across from the former Getty co-op, was in beautiful condition and
needed little improvement, according to several real estate agents.

STILL SHAKESPEARE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- When the lords, ladies, and groundlings of the
Modern Language Association wandered the halls of the San Francisco
Hilton last month, one thing they agreed upon is the status of
William Shakespeare. He's doing well, considering that he has been,
for some 382 years, a dead, white male.
</P>
<P>
   The MLA began to pursue politically incorrect corpses in the
1960s, but the posse was stymied when Shakespeare's reputation
experienced one of its many revivals. On Broadway, Franco
Zeffirelli made ``Romeo and Juliet'' into a dazzling spectacle of
hot-stuff love. In 1969, ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead''
opened at London's National Theatre when the playwright, Tom
Stoppard, was 29.
</P>
<P>
   With Marc Norman, Stoppard is the co-screenwriter of
``Shakespeare in Love,'' adorning the box-office top 10 roster
despite the absence of special effects. The movie demonstrates that
Shakespeare's heart and art were based in showbiz, with all its
anxieties and backstage melodrama. ``Shakespeare in Love'' is ``A
Chorus Line'' of the 1590s, a ``42nd Street'' in doublet and
pantaloon.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Czechoslovakia, Stoppard's fondness for the English
language simmers with the zeal of a convert. Shakespeare is the
Rome and Canterbury of his word-based religion. His experience
demonstrates the timelessness of the Elizabethan era's hottest
young playwright.
</P>
<P>
   After every campus revolution, academe opens the gates to
welcome forgotten or downtrodden cultures. But scholars still swarm
to Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when Georgetown University announced that Shakespeare
would not be mandatory for English majors, conservatives feared
that Will was an endangered species, but Phyllis Franklin,
executive director of the MLA, argued that the canon was safe.
``Shakespeare is so well-established as a major writer in our
society that serious students of literature choose to study
Shakespeare,'' she said. ``They don't have to be forced into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, cursed with an itch to censor, are not to be
trusted with Shakespeare. In the early 19th century, Thomas
Bowdler, a forerunner of Jesse Helms, produced an expurgated, i.e.,
bowdlerized, edition of the collective works, banishing bawdy humor
to appease Victorian tastes. Shakespeare survived. Age cannot
wither nor custom stale his infinite variety.
</P>
<P>
   Fads pass, even in the 20th century. Laurence Olivier's screen
adaptations, which electrified audiences in the 1940s, seem like
tenantless graves compared to Kenneth Branagh's Cagneyesque
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier once owned the celluloid copyright on ``Henry V'' and
``Hamlet,'' but no more. In Branagh's version of the former, one
can smell the horses sweating at Agincourt. In the latter, Elsinore
is home to an all-star cast: Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, Jack
Lemmon, Charlton Heston, Robin Williams. Alas, poor Larry. I knew
him, Horatio. (Zeffirelli's Hamlet failed not because of the cast
but solely because Mel Gibson looked lost in the title role. Danny
Glover, call thy precinct.)
</P>
<P>
   Continuity flourishes in ``Shakespeare in Love.'' Ben Affleck is
as mordant a Mercutio as John Barrymore was in the 1936 MGM
production. Theatrical families are ably represented by Gwyneth
Paltrow, daughter of Blythe Danner, and Joseph Fiennes, brother of
Ralph. (Is there a Zeppo or Gummo around the house?)
</P>
<P>
   The next Shakespearean in Hollywood will be Calista Flockhart,
who portrays on television a Boston lawyer, Ally McBeal. She
presumably will not be miniskirted as Helena in ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream'' in May. But she will prosper, as all Shakespeareans
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' is an affirmation of Falstaff in ``Henry
IV, Part 1,'' who said, ``Play out the play.'' For 400 years,
millions have, because he is a guide to what he called ``life's
uncertain voyage.'' Rosencrantz and Guildenstern may be dead, but
Shakespeare is not.

GATES &AMP; GATES BRING DREAM OF DU BOIS TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On Monday, Martin Luther King Day, Microsoft released
Encarta Africana, its highly publicized CD-ROM encyclopedia devoted
to African culture throughout the world. This fall, Perseus Books
will publish a print version.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time anyone has been able to put the African
world in a jewel case _ or between two covers,'' Harvard University
professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. said Tuesday at a meeting with
Globe editors and reporters. ``To chart the contours of the African
world, that's what we were able to do,'' added Gates's fellow
Harvard professor Kwame Anthony Appiah.
</P>
<P>
   Gates and Appiah, who supervised the project, a joint
undertaking by Microsoft and Afropaedia LLC, were at the Globe to
demonstrate the CD-ROM. It contains 3,361 articles, totaling 2.5
million words, and includes hundreds of audio and video clips. The
cost is $49.95. The project drew on some 400 contributors,
including UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, musician Quincy Jones,
and actress Whoopi Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Encarta Africana is an idea 90 years in the making. It was in
1909 that W. E. B. Du Bois, America's leading black intellectual
during the first two-thirds of this century, conceived the idea of
an Encyclopedia Africana to foster understanding, and thus
tolerance, of African people throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   He solicited 100 leading academic figures to serve on his
editorial board, among them the philosopher Henry James and
anthropologist Franz Boas. The only one to turn him down was
Harvard's president, Charles Eliot (Du Bois was the first black
Harvard PhD). Eliot offered what would prove to be an
all-too-pertinent piece of advice: ``Be sure to secure the funding
before you begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Du Bois intermittently worked at the project for the next
half-century. By the time of his death, in 1963, he had moved to
Ghana and revamped the encyclopedia as a purely African venture.
</P>
<P>
   It was as a Yale undergraduate that Gates first heard of Du
Bois's cultural grail. ``Like every other black intellectual then,
I was a Du Bois junkie,'' he recalled. A few years later, on a
fellowship at Cambridge University, he met Appiah, also a graduate
student there, and the Nigerian novelist Wole Soyinka, a future
Nobel laureate in literature. The three of them made ``a pact,'' as
Gates described it, to see Du Bois's encyclopedia into print.
Twenty-five years later, Gates noted with satisfaction, the dream
has become reality.
</P>
<P>
   Such prominent black Americans as Jesse Jackson, Julian Bond,
and Michael Jordan have already endorsed Encarta Africana, and The
Wall Street Journal's computer columnist, Walter S. Mossberg, has
called it ``a piece of software that demonstrates convincingly the
power of the computer to change society for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Du Bois's son, David, was shown the CD-ROM last month and gave
his blessing. ``Of all the reviews we would get,'' Gates said,
``none would be better than that.'' But the response to Encarta
Africana has not been universally favorable. Critics see Encarta
Africana drawing attention _ and financial backing _ away from Du
Bois's original Encyclopedia Africana project, which remains
headquartered in Ghana and has so far published three volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Others see the CD-ROM as the latest venture in what one might
call Skip Gates Inc. Gates, 48, has few peers, white or black, as
an intellectual entrepreneur. He's edited or written 16 books. His
articles regularly appear in such influential publications as The
New York Times and The New Yorker. He has climbed the academic
ladder with speed and dexterity: going in 12 years from Yale to
Cornell to Duke to Harvard. He has almost single-handedly turned
Harvard into a powerhouse in African-American studies, bringing to
the faculty such luminaries in the field as University of Chicago
sociologist William Julius Wilson, the late University of
Pennsylvania jurist A. Leon Higginbotham, and Princeton philosopher
Cornel West.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints have been heard about Gates creating a ``Cambridge
Mafia'' in Afro-American studies, and some critics see it as only
fitting that on Encarta Africana he has joined forces with his
namesake, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it Gates &AMP; Gates _ or Gates squared,'' says Ray
Winbush, director of the Race Relations Institute at Fisk
University, in Nashville. ``Microsoft has good marketing. It's the
same thing with Gates &AMP; Gates. The Encarta Africana has the richest
man in the world working together with one of the most prominent
black academics in the world, and that's a seductive combination.
But I am convinced that it's not, by any means, a fulfillment of
the vision Du Bois had for his Encyclopedia Africana.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who amusingly recounted the disappointment of people
who'd take his telephone calls thinking he was the other Gates,
shrugged off such criticism. ``We went everywhere, hat in hand,''
he said. ``What we liked about Microsoft was they were willing to
do it.'' Among firms who turned down the project were Encyclopedia
Britannica, Prodigy, Voyager, Random House, Macmillan, and Simon &AMP;
Schuster. ``I threw a Hail Mary pass to Redmond, Wash.,'' Gates
noted, ``and they said, `Fly out here and talk to us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Added Appiah, ``There's a funny logic to that criticism. If the
argument is about quality, then the fact is Encarta (Microsoft's
flagship CD-ROM) is a terrific encyclopedia. You want to do the
best you can, and both in terms of quality and marketing Microsoft
allows us to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has announced it will donate 8,000 copies of the
CD-ROM to schools and libraries, and Perseus intends to donate a
comparable number of books. In addition, Gates and Appiah hope to
initiate a series of trial programs whereby Sunday schools in
predominantly black churches will receive the appropriate computer
technology and copies of Encarta Africana _ ``wiring the Sunday
schools,'' as Gates put it, ``and use this as bait to get history
in the congregation.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what was the single most important thing about Encarta
Africana, Gates said, ``That it exists.''

ABE GETS A REFUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I feel much better knowing that smart people like famed
dealmaker Abe Gosman and his family do dumb things, too. The
difference between Gosman and the rest of us: He can call his pal,
the chief executive of Smith Barney Inc., and get his millions
back.
</P>
<P>
   Even after recovering his losses, the episode won't do anything
to help Gosman's image as a savvy investor _ a reputation recently
tarnished by an ill-fated ``Wheel of Fortune'' acquisition strategy
that cost him his job running Meditrust Cos., a Needham real estate
investment company, and cost shareholders a bundle.
</P>
<P>
   At this point Gosman and almost everyone involved in this sorry
mess would like it to just go away. But don't bet on it. The Gosman
affair has raised too many questions Downtown about a handful of
small-capitalization stocks, and who might have been doing what
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in short, is the story:
</P>
<P>
   The Gosmans charged they were victimized by a broker who sold
them stock in two small technology companies, Palomar Medical
Technologies Inc. of Lexington and NUKO Information Systems Inc. of
San Jose, Calif. Gosman's son, Andrew made the first investments,
and over a two-year period ending in March 1997 the family poured
$4 million into the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   What a disaster. The stocks tanked, and the Gosman's say they
eventually lost more than $2 million on Palomar; Andrew Gosman lost
another $360,000 on NUKO. Both stocks now sell for less than a buck
a share.
</P>
<P>
   The Gosmans cried foul.
</P>
<P>
   They say the Smith Barney broker who recommended the stocks,
David Smith of Santa Fe, had significant conflicts of interest he
never disclosed. Among them: Smith's wife, Carol,received low-cost
warrants in Palomar potentially worth $1 million or more, which
were in fact no more than disguised commissions paid to Smith for
bringing investors to Palomar. In addition, they also cite
documents that show Smith got NUKO stock on extremely favorable
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Gosmans say they would have never invested had they known
Smith was being paid to bring investors to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Gosman, whose companies have paid Smith Barney millions
as a securities underwriter in many deals over the years,
complained directly to Jamie Dimon, then chief executive of the big
investment house. Smith and his firm denied wrongdoing, but after
months of negotiations Smith Barney last year coughed up $2 million
to the Gosmans, according to a filing with the National Association
of Securities Dealers. Smith, 45, was discharged in November for
not disclosing to Smith Barney that his wife received the warrants,
the documents show.
</P>
<P>
   None of the players would comment.
</P>
<P>
   Is this just another rich guy burned by a broker?
</P>
<P>
   Careful readers of the Globe's business pages will remember the
name Palomar. The company played a starring role in the long
investigation of H.J. Meyers, the high-pressure brokerage house
that was run out of town by the Massachusetts Securities Division
in 1997. In a civil complaint, the division charged that Meyers
sold vast quantities of Palomar stock to investors without
disclosing the risks or Meyers' financial ties to the company.
Investors lost more than $1 million on Palomar, the division said
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Gosmans dug just deep enough and pushed just hard enough to
get their dough back. That's what they cared about. But the affair
may well provide a roadmap not only on Palomar but other stocks
that could go beyond what regulators dug out on Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Gosmans and several other investors who got burned believe
what happened at Palomar and NUKO were not isolated incidents, but
instead a pattern of illegal ``finder-fee'' payments in the form of
advantageously priced securities for delivering investors to
companies.
</P>
<P>
   This raises all kinds of questions. If, for instance, Gosman is
right and Smith was being paid a fee to push the stock, who was
paying it? And was he the only broker being paid?
</P>
<P>
   Were other stocks manipulated? The Gosmans and others think so,
and they have named names of companies to Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The state securities division is investigating, but won't
comment. No, this is not going away.

DENVER HOLDS THE HIGHER GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the afterglow of Sunday's stunning performance in stopping
the New York Jets' running game, Denver Broncos defensive
coordinator Greg Robinson had history to back him up when he made
this observation:
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time of the year, the teams that win run the ball and
stop the run. It is very difficult for a quarterback to try to win
a game all by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been 32 Super Bowls, and in 28 of them, the team that
prevailed in the ground game was victorious on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Only three times has the team that gained more yardage on the
ground lost. (I'm calling Super Bowl II even, as the victorious
Jets had just 1 more yard rushing than the Baltimore Colts.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in 13 of the first 14 Super Bowls (excluding Jets-Colts
in III), the winning team had more yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 of the last 17, the team with more rushing yards won the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh has been an exception. In Super Bowls XIII and XIV,
the Steelers were outrushed by Dallas and Los Angeles but still
won, as quarterback Terry Bradshaw had big passing games.
</P>
<P>
   In Super Bowl XXX, the Cowboys ran for just 56 yards against the
Steelers but got a gift-wrapped victory when Neil O'Donnell threw
three interceptions that crippled his team. Pittsburgh outplayed
Dallas that day but lost because of its own errors.
</P>
<P>
   This Super Bowl pattern is what makes the the Denver-Atlanta
matchup so interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Denver was second in the league running the ball, and third in
stopping the run.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was sixth in in rushing, second against the run.
</P>
<P>
   But lately Denver has been sensational on rushing defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four games, Denver is giving up approximately 1 yard
per rush. Atlanta is giving up 3 yards per rush.
</P>
<P>
   On the offensive side of the ball, Denver has the best football
player on the planet, Terrell Davis, and the better line. Jamal
Anderson of the Falcons is a terrific running back, one of the best
in the game, but he is not Davis. No one is.
</P>
<P>
   Davis gives Denver their edge. He is the best rusher in recent
playoff history.
</P>
<P>
   In seven games, Davis has carried 179 times for 1,038 yards,
setting NFL playoff records with 148 yards per game and 5.8 yards
per carry. Those are numers that no one can touch.
</P>
<P>
   Davis dominated last year's Super Bowl, a game in which his team
was a 14-point underdog and won. Despite having a migraine headache
that forced him to the bench in the second quarter (he forgot to
take his medicine before the game), Davis collected himself at
halftime and carried his team to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has been in only two playoff games in his career (the
last two weeks). Against San Francisco, he picked up 133 yards on
29 carries, but in Minnesota, he had only 67 yards on 23 carries.
The Vikings were focused on him, though.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, Davis rolled for 199 yards on 21 carries
against Miami, and 167 yards on 32 carries against the Jets. That's
an average of 7 yards per carry, which means he is on top of his
game.
</P>
<P>
   What will make this Super Bowl different from the 32 that came
before it is that, for the first time, the running backs _ not the
quarterbacks _ go into the game as the most important players on
their teams.
</P>

KELLOGG'S EATS ITS SPECIAL K AD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By IRENE SEGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ooops!
</P>
<P>
   That's Kellogg's response to its new TV ad featuring a Diet
Debbie doll who ``crash diets'' and ``works out after every meal''
and proclaims, ``Only celery for me.'' Then the camera fades to the
written message ``Why do we do this to ourselves every January?
Let's just eat sensibly all year'' and an image of Special K
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was too many consumers didn't catch the spoof. They
wondered if a yearning-to-be-thin Debbie really was parking her
treadmill beside Barbie's little pink coupe on toy store shelves.
They wondered who was pushing dieting to young girls.
</P>
<P>
   So on Jan. 8, just 11 days after the first Diet Debbie ad aired,
Kellogg's yanked the 30-second spot and expects it to be completely
off the air by the end of the month. The folks at the
Illinois-based National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and
Associated Disorders, who once influenced milk producers to change
a ``milk mustache'' ad that had Ivana Trump saying, ``You can never
be too rich or too thin,'' didn't even have a chance to whimper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will admit we still don't always get it right,'' says
Kellogg's spokeswoman Karen Kafer. ``The execution was confusing to
consumers. We listened to consumers and we pulled it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled,'' says Beth Jacobsen of the anorexia
associationa, which had fielded a number of complaints about the
ad. ``I'm glad to hear they've pulled it.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie may have met a speedy demise, but still alive is
Kellogg's year-old effort to reshape its attitude about Special K
with a ``Reshape your attitude'' campaign that aims to sell cereal
by stressing positive body image and self-worth and sensible
eating. It's all part of a broader trend toward more realistic
portrayals of women in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the Special K commercials with the gorgeous, young,
impossibly thin model slipping into a pair of skintight jeans or a
little black dress only she can wear. Gone are the TV ads with the
camera surveying the long, svelte body of a model in a white
swimsuit before fading into an image of the ``K'' of Special K.
</P>
<P>
   Back again, in place of Diet Debbie, is Kellogg's ``bar guys''
ad, first aired during last year's Super Bowl. One man in a bar
promises to ``not freak out if I gain two pounds'' and another
glances at his pants and asks, ``Do these make my butt look big?''
This time the written message on screen is ``Men don't obsess about
these things. Why do we?''
</P>
<P>
   Another TV spot features blurred images and questions about role
models that allow for the possibility of a role model with hips.
New print ads include one with a photo of a baby girl who asks,
``Do I look fat?'' and another with a picture of a little black
dress (ah, the little black dress) that extols a perfect size 10
``and 12 and 14 and 16.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the aging of the baby boomers, consumers want images that
are more realistic,'' says Kafer. ``Women are speaking up and
saying we want images we can relate to at this point of our lives.
This is what our consumers told us. Beauty is not built around a
number on a scale or a dress size. That's why we reshaped our
campaign around looking good on your own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg's is not alone in trying to change its image by changing
its images of women. There are more ads these days featuring older
women or women with more than skin and bones. Anne Klein's recent
campaign featured such prominent women as former Texas governor Ann
Richards and basketball phenom Lisa Leslie wearing the company's
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pick out a few people who are trying to do a better
job of this,'' says Deborah Warner, executive director of the
Harvard Eating Disorders Center, which has invited representatives
of Kellogg's and Anne Klein to a forum in Cambridge next month.
``It may seem subtle, but it's important. There is still a long way
to go, but this is improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Babson College marketing professor Kathleen Seiders sees
it, ``there are so many more women with power and education in the
forefront of consumerism saying that's not real'' to standards of
beauty that accept only the young and the thin. ``We're the most
sophisticated generation of consumers ever.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Diet Debbie, speculates Seiders, ``it sounds like it was
too ironic.''

STRONG MILITARY, ANTITERROR GOALS LISTED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While lauding US efforts to forge peace around the
world, President Clinton emphasized his top foreign-policy goals of
rebuilding the military and reducing terrorist and nuclear threats
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nation in history has had the opportunity and the
responsibility we now have: to shape a world that is more peaceful,
more secure, more free,'' Clinton said in his State of the Union
address, noting US leadership roles in Northern Ireland, Bosnia,
and Middle East peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we work for peace, we must also meet threats to our
nation's security, including increased dangers from outlaw nations
and terrorism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing concern over Russia's crumbling nuclear weapons
infrastructure at a time of heightened political and economic
uncertainty, Clinton called for a major boost in spending to reduce
the threat of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is proposing $4.2 billion for the effort over the next
five years, an increase of almost 70 percent over current spending.
He also, for the first time since 1985, proposed an increase in
defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   Calling his strategy ``cooperative threat reduction,'' the
president said it is in the nation's interest to work with Russia
and other members of the former Soviet Union to halt the export of
technology, nuclear material, and expertise to ``rogue nations''
such as Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The new funds will be used to expand efforts to reduce
stockpiles of nuclear materials and disarm existing nuclear
weapons. These initiatives include programs to tighten export
controls, destroy chemical and biological weapons facilities,
dismantle stored nuclear warheads, and find civilian jobs for
thousands of weapons scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The president also called on the Senate to ``end nuclear testing
forever'' by ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and on
both houses of Congress to pay the nation's United Nations dues.
</P>
<P>
   Responding agressively to new threats against American security
does not just mean confronting Iraq's Saddam Hussein, he said. It
also means reversing the decline in military spending for the first
time in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in ``troop readiness'' will be part of the proposed
$110 billion increase in spending to modernize the military over
six years, according to National Security Adviser Samuel R.
``Sandy'' Berger.
</P>
<P>
   That includes a 4.4 percent pay raise and enhanced benefits for
military personnel, as well as money to rebuild US embassies around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget also calls for a doubling of money for
antiterrorism efforts so the United States can defend itself
against biological and chemical weapons.

   The trivialization of welfare hit a new apogee last week.
Wisconsin, one of the most aggressive states in driving the poor
off the rolls, released data that found that 62 percent of
recipients who left welfare in early 1998 still had jobs by last
fall. This prompted welfare guru Larry Mead of New York University
to say: ``These work levels represent the greatest achievement in
antipoverty policy since the Great Society.''
</P>
<P>
   That must be easy for him to say, since Mead is obviously not
one of the 38 percent of former welfare recipients who is
unemployed. It is amazing in an America that is supposedly in the
midst of a boom, that 4 out of 10 people in a given group are
unemployed and this is hailed as a major social victory.
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1933, at the height of the Great Depression, the
unemployment level was 24.9 percent. When a quarter of the entire
nation was unemployed, no one, not even the president of the United
States could trivialize the meanness. Life was mean.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune magazine called President Herbert Hoover a liar for
soft-pedaling the Depression by proclaiming, ``Nobody is actually
starving. The hoboes, for example, are better fed than they have
ever been.'' When thousands of poverty-stricken war veterans came
to Washington to seek relief. Hoover ordered General Douglas
MacArthur to disperse them with tear gas, torches and bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover kept smoking 20 cigars a day and kept to his
seven-course, black-tie dinners, even as Fortune wrote: ``Men who
lost their jobs dropped out of sight. They were quiet and you had
to know just when and where to find them: at night, for instance,
on the edge of town huddling for warmth around a bonfire, or even
the municipal incinerator; at dawn, picking over the garbage dump
for scraps of food or salvageable clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990s, the wealthy are once again lighting up cigars.
Fortunate Americans fill grocery carts in supermarkets so big that
we now call them super-supermarkets. We have convinced ourselves
that any claims of hunger are hollow and joblessness is a
self-inflicted wound. There is no doubt that forcing some former
welfare recipients into jobs has transformed their lives. But the
total picture reveals that welfare reform has a very hollow side
and is inflicting very real wounds.
</P>
<P>
   In a 75-page report issued last month, the Children's Defense
Fund and the National Coalition for the Homeless said that based on
federal and state data and local surveys, welfare reform has made
life significantly more difficult for former recipients. Life is so
much more difficult that it is hard to see how they are being put
on the road to self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   It is undeniably positive that 32.4 percent of welfare
recipients who were on welfare in 1997 had a job by March of 1998.
Ten years earlier, only 20.7 percent of welfare recipients in 1989
found work by March of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But the jobs that the former recpients are finding are extremely
uneven. The CDF and the NCFTH found that only 28.8 percent had
wages above the poverty level, while 51 percent had wages that did
not even reach 75 percent of the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   In metropolitan Cleveland, only about 25 percent of former
welfare recipients earned poverty-level wages in the final four
months of 1996, while about 50 percent earned nothing at all. In
Maryland, the average salary of a former welfare recipient was only
76 percent of the poverty level for a family of three.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, only 27 percent had incomes above the poverty line
and in Milwaukee, only 16 percent had jobs that paid above the
poverty line for a family of four. Statewide, 62 percent of people
might have jobs. But in Milwaukee, according to the CDF and the
NCFTH, three out of four former welfare recipients were no longer
with the same employer nine months later.
</P>
<P>
   While welfare reform was fueled by Hooveresque stereotypes of
well-fed recipients using food stamps for sirloin steaks,
recipients who have been forced into work say they now have less
money than ever before. According to the data of the CDF and the
NCFTH, only 35 percent of former recipients in Wisconsin say they
had more money.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state's own data published last week, only 47
percent said they had more money off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, 49 percent of families reported a loss of income
compared to 40 percent who reported an increase. Welfare recipients
in several states report more families doubling up in apartments,
and significantly more families finding it difficult to pay for
rent or child care.
</P>
<P>
   No one would have a problem with welfare reform if we really
were undergoing the greatest achievement in antipoverty policy
since the Great Society. But without a movement to generate
sustaining jobs, particularly in tattered urban cores, no one can
even come close to calling this antipoverty policy.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, one could argue that thus far, welfare reform
is doing as much, if not more, to cement poverty than to crack it.
</P>
<P>
   Without evidence of a mass escape from poverty, welfare reform
is as mean as calling in MacArthur to drive the penniless out of
sight.

IN THIS CITY, THAT BORING HOUSE WILL BE ILLEGAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLIET, Ill. _ Marilyn Treasure loves her new house. She smiles
up at the soaring ceilings, revels in its open floor plan, adds
grandmotherly touches to its cozy rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials call it an eyesore, a crime against good
taste they intend to outlaw. Its chief offense: It's too boring.
</P>
<P>
   After months of debate and over protests from developers and
some homeowners who call it Big Brother at work and a hidden tax on
lower-income housebuyers, the Joliet City Council is joining a wave
of communities striking a blow for originality.
</P>
<P>
   Joliet next week intends to enact an antimonotony ordinance, a
local law that will require builders to vary the look of houses
built near to each other by alternating colors, roof heights,
windows, and other aesthetic features.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in short, Levittown backlash. After a half-century of
explosive growth of suburban subdivisions _ many built quickly and
cheaply with an emphasis on easy-to-replicate plans _ a growing
number of cities and towns have enacted laws to prevent any more of
what they call cookie-cutter atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   As Exhibit A in support of the Joliet ordinance, the law's chief
backer cites the three-year-old development on River Glen Drive
that Treasure and her husband, Francis, call home. Forty houses
along the curving street are identical: the same beige brick, beige
vinyl siding, white garage doors, chocolate roofs. They even have
the same view: a barren corn field with foot-high stalks peeking
through the snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a drinking man? Well, you go home drunk, and you'd
never know which house was yours,'' said City Councilor Joseph
Shetina, chairman of the council's land-use committee and the prime
mover behind the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think developments like that are just a slap in the face to
the public,'' said Shetina, who runs a house appraisal company. ``I
understand that in the postwar era we needed to house people, and
these kinds of developments got built. I'm no moralist, I just
don't think we need that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   No one keeps track of how many antimonotony ordinances are in
place nationwide, but at least a dozen Chicago-area suburbs have
enacted them, as well as communities in Texas, Arizona, and
California. Planners say they are far less common in the Northeast,
and municipal and development groups say they know of no such laws
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But such laws have sprouted with increasing frequency in the
past decade around the nation's fastest-growing regions,
particularly those appealing to budget-conscious, middle-income,
and lower-income housebuyers. Joliet, for instance, has seen its
population grow from 77,000 to 90,000 in the past five years, owing
to its healthy stock of houses costing under $150,000 and its
proximity to Chicago, an hour's drive to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, the idea was to make affordable housing available
to the middle classes in the suburbs,'' said Jim Schwab, researcher
with the American Planning Association in Chicago. ``The fact that
a lot of what was built was ticky-tacky or repetitive was
irrelevant. But after seeing those kinds of subdivisions over and
over, some communities have gotten a bad taste in their mouths
about it and want it stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The Joliet ordinance, approved unanimously by the city's Plan
Commission and expected to be enacted by the City Council
Wednesday, would require that no dwellings next to each other have
a ``substantially similar front elevation or facade'' and that no
more than 25 percent of the houses on a street look the same.
</P>
<P>
   Judgments about what makes houses similar would be based on
factors including the basic building style, the color and type of
siding, roof heights, the location and size of front windows, and
the location and size of garage doors.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance would not force changes to houses already built,
so it would have no practical effect on the Treasures and their
neighbors, a broad mix of young families, middle-aged couples, and
senior citizens. Still, the Treasures are offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see why it bothers anybody. If you don't know which
house is yours, you're pretty far gone,'' said Francis Treasure, a
retired chemist.
</P>
<P>
   Before buying their house, the Treasures lived for more than two
decades in a huge five-bedroom house they had designed themselves.
But after retiring, they were looking for a low-maintenance,
affordable house _ theirs cost about $100,000 _ in a nice
neighborhood. They saw plans for the three-bedroom house, and were
sold on it immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy here. If somebody doesn't like it, don't buy
it. But to pass a law against it?'' said Marilyn Treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is bigger for local developers, who fiercely opposed
the ordinance until they realized its passage was inevitable. Then
they fought to ease some of its provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're infringing on my freedom as a builder,'' said Larry
Capista, president of Phoenix Developers, which he said has built
1,400 houses in Joliet in the past decade. Signs for his next
developments, with names like Sunset East and Sunset Ridge, have
sprung up in the cornfields near the Treasures' house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the council members say they don't like driving down
the streets seeing the same house over and over. I drive a white
Lexus, and I don't like seeing other white Lexuses, but I can't
tell other people what cars to buy or not to buy,'' said Capista,
who owns a custom $750,000 house in Joliet's toniest neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Capista intends to build more than 200 new houses in Joliet this
year, and he said the ordinance might add several thousand dollars
to the roughly $150,000 price of each house. ``When you get to
$220,000 to $260,000, you can make them all different. In our price
range, we have to work on volume, because the margins just aren't
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents of River Glen Drive seem to agree with Capista,
but at least some wish there was more variety in their
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right price at the right place, but I do not think
that a builder should build like this,'' said Clara Petruska, who
lives down the street from the Treasures. ``I think a home should
look like the individual, and these don't.''
</P>
<P>
   While Joliet is just launching its fight against monotony, other
Chicago-area communities have been living with such laws for more
than a decade. One of the first was the village of Carol Stream, a
suburb with 38,000 residents about 20 miles west of Chicago that
enacted one of the strictest codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real success,'' said the village planner, Tony
Budzikowski. ``We still have trouble with developers, because
they'll have a hot seller, and they want to put it straight down
the block. But that's not what the village wants.''
</P>
<P>
   As proof that every action has an equal and opposite reaction,
the rise of antimonotony ordinances comes at the same time private
homeowner associations are going in the opposite direction by
requiring conformity in things such as landscaping, additions, and
paint color.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably more with architectural controls than
anticodes,'' said Schwab, the planning researcher. But whether that
shows ``that suppressing wackiness is more important to Americans
than suppressing monotony, I just don't know,'' he said.

US'S ENEMIES ARE ENJOYING THE SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three men outside of Washington who may have the most to
gain from the dragged-out impeachment soap opera are foreign
leaders who individually chose this opportunity to escalate their
beefs with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Our old friend Saddam Hussein, our new enemy Osama Bin Laden,
and the infamous Slobodan Milosevic, have, coincidentally or not,
picked this time to raise the stakes. Clinton's hands are more or
less tied, they figure.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he ordered the four-day air campaign against Iraq as the
House of Representatives voted impeachment. But that retaliation
for the ousting of the UN weapons inspectors was too short to do
much but punctuate the disagreement between the Iraqi dictator and
the US, which with Britain provides the teeth in the now-bankrupt
weapons inspection scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, the rich Muslim who finances a string of terrorist
training depots, is the man who supposedly masterminded the US
embassy bombings in Africa. NBC News says he's supposedly planning
a fresh outrage to underscore his hatred of the American
government's foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
   And Milosevic, the closest thing to Hitler Europe has confronted
in the last half-century, has taken the audacious steps of
countenancing the massacre of Albanian civilians in Kosovo,
refusing access to the UN's war crimes prosecutor, and expelled an
American diplomat who blamed the massacre on Serb authorities.
</P>
<P>
   If they spend any time at all watching CNN, America's top three
enemies of the moment _ on any given day the trio may shuffle in
the rankings, but all three are consistently up there in the Bad
Guy Department _ have to be happy at the way Clinton is writhing to
get off the impeachment hook.
</P>
<P>
   The point has been made in this space previously that the world
does not go on hold while we sort out this Republican coup attempt
in D.C. The Japanese bankers, the Brazilian government, the
midwives of the already successful and potentially awesome Euro
experiment, the Asian currency speculators, the Chinese economic
planners, none of these people are backing off while the American
Congress sorts out its feelings about the president's dalliance
with a female intern.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do the world's Bad Guys, the men who most hate America,
take the week off just because Henry Hyde and Bob Barr and Trent
Lott are having a hissy fit. It does not work that way. So Boris
Yeltsin is in a hospital with a bleeding ulcer, and shadowy
ex-Soviet weapons makers are hiring out to anyone who'll write the
check? Sorry, we're doing impeachment in this country.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton's personal architect of the Dayton peace accords is
awaiting Senate confirmation to be UN ambassador? Hey, too bad that
Clinton can't employ Richard Holbrooke's skills at the UN; the
Senate is holding up his confirmation over some financial
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is shaky? Canada is peeved about trade issues? The
Europeans are leaping into the future with their Euro currency
consolidation? Millions of Central American poor people are
scheming how to penetrate our borders for desperately needed work?
The Hurricane Mitch victims whose livelihoods were obliterated are
now headed this way? And we have no humane way of either preventing
them, or receiving them, or dealing with them once they sneak in?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but the Congress is tied up with Monica. Like the cable
networks and the evening news, Congress has gone All Monica, All
The Time.
</P>
<P>
   It is small consolation to the people and the governments that
desperately need stability, strength, and leadership from the US.
</P>
<P>
   Let the word go forth, as JFK put it in his inaugural, that
Uncle Sam is having a midlife crisis. The most powerful government
on earth is dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is going to happen in D.C. until the Republicans have
wrung every last pathetic ounce of bathos from this dumb show. Now,
we're told, there will be witnesses deposed by the Senate. Drag it
out more, senators; go right ahead. That's your right as the
majority party. You can't dig up the 67 votes to oust him, but you
can easily round up the 51 votes to call witnesses, depose
different people, create more opportunities to screw up the
process, and hopefully smear Clinton some more.
</P>
<P>
   As a strategy, it's a classic short-term gain, long-term loss
for the GOP. The country is a rock-solid 2-1 in favor of letting
Clinton serve out his term as long as he's censured for what he got
up to with Lady Monica.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans get to conduct impeachment the way they want
because they have six more seats than the Democrats in the
435-member House, and 10 more seat-holders than the Dems in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Because the GOP holds a margin of a total of 16 seats out of 535
(one is an independent) _ a margin of control of less than three
percent _ the Congress is tied up in knots. And no one is happier
over this state of affairs than the three desperados who are
emboldened by our self-inflicted paralysis.

<P>
   We can forgive the photo op in Carol Carreer's ice-encrusted
backyard, but who's idea was 1-800-JOE-4-OIL?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't the nuns ever teach you, Congressman, that an act of
charity only counts in Heaven if you don't attach your name to it?
</P>
<P>
   It has been hard to miss the fact that Joseph P. Kennedy II is
back in Massachusetts. If you haven't seen him in the blitz of
television commercials for Citizens Energy Corp., surely you caught
a glimpse of him on the local news Monday, in his polished black
wingtips, pumping heating oil into Ms. Carreer's empty fuel tank in
Jamaica Plain.
</P>
<P>
   No one is disputing that Kennedy is sincere in his efforts to
bring low-cost heating fuel to the poor and the elderly. He founded
Citizens Energy 18 years ago for just that purpose. And he used the
occasion of his final speech on the floor of the US House in
December to make an impassioned appeal to his colleagues to
remember the dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think that the only moral standard in America ought
to be about sex. . .'' he said in what may rank as the most
heartfelt speech of his 12-year tenure in the House. ``The truth is
that there are too many people in poverty; there are too many kids
that do not have access to health care; there are too many families
that do not have enough food in their stomachs. These issues do not
receive even close to the amount of time and effort and energy that
we are now putting into trying to impeach the president.''
</P>
<P>
   No, insincerity is not Joe Kennedy's problem; overexposure is.
</P>
<P>
   After long and thoughtful consideration, the congressman chose
to surrender a secure House seat in the wake of the accidental
death of his brother Michael last winter. Both his large extended
family and Citizens Energy, which Michael had been running, needed
him back at the helm, a grieving and reflective Kennedy concluded
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Good reasons, then and now, to have exited the public stage, to
have set aside personal political ambition to focus instead on
life's larger questions. How refreshing it was to see such a public
man re-embrace private life.
</P>
<P>
   But old habits die hard. Since casting his final House vote
against the impeachment of President Bill Clinton last month, the
telegenic former congressman has not been out of our sight.
</P>
<P>
   There he is presiding at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   There he is delivering fuel oil to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   There he is distributing blankets to the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   We so admired Congressman Kennedy's plea for privacy. Why, oh
why, won't he claim it?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Joe Kennedy is not the only Massachusetts politician
manifesting painful symptoms of withdrawal from the permanent
campaign. Former Boston mayor and US ambassador to the Vatican
Raymond L. Flynn and Congressman Martin T. Meehan come immediately
to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The man who, as mayor, routinely commandeered snowplows and fire
trucks to ensure a 30-second spot on the evening news opted to
undertake a doomed run to replace Kennedy in the 8th District last
fall rather than retire quietly to private life. Failing that,
Flynn has fashioned a public persona as host of a radio call-in
show on Saturday mornings, when most of his would-be
constituents/audience are at the supermarket or the dry cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Meehan, for his part, is so gripped by Potomac fever
that he is ready to forsake his pledge to serve no more than four
terms in the US House in order to remain in Washington. Never mind
that ``Eight is Enough'' was his campaign mantra when he defeated
Congressman Chester Atkins in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That was then, when voters in the 5th District were calling for
term limits; this is now, when producers for the Sunday morning TV
talk shows are calling for Marty Meehan.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new in all of this, of course. The political
limelight has always been blinding. The relentless attention has
always been as seductive as it is intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kennedy never claimed that he was retiring permanently from
politics in Massachusetts. It was understood that his return to
Brighton and Citizens Energy Corp. represented a much-needed
timeout. We knew that this was a political hiatus, that he would be
back in public life, presumably as a candidate for governor or the
US Senate. There would be time, with the private man out of the
public spotlight, for both him and us to think about the future.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, Joe, we can't miss you until you go.

LYCOS LOOKS TO BOOST PROFILE, NOT PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things happen fast on the Internet. At Lycos Inc., they happen
even faster.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Lycos was one of the Internet's coulda-beens. The
firm had been one of the first to offer an in-depth index of Web
sites. Yet as millions of new users came on line, relatively few of
them paid a visit to Lycos. According to the market research firm
MediaMetrix, only about 20 percent of Web users passed through
Lycos each month, while half of them were visiting the top spots
like Yahoo and the America Online site. The company's stock price
was hovering at around 17 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward 12 months, and the change is dramatic. MediaMetrix
now figures that 45 percent of Web users visited Lycos in November,
just a few percentage points behind Yahoo. According to Lycos chief
executive Bob Davis, about 50,000 people sign up for various Lycos
Internet services every day, compared with a few hundred a day last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a remarkably short period of time, the audience shifts have
been significant,'' said Davis.
</P>
<P>
   So has the industry's view of Lycos. ``I think the perception in
the marketplace is that they're now a close number two to Yahoo,''
said analyst Sherri Wolf of Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The positive vibes have also helped run up the stock price of
the Waltham, Mass. company. Even after last week's slump in
Internet stocks, Lycos shares closed Friday at 87 7/8, giving it a
total stock market value of $3.8 billion. Not bad for a company
whose fiscal 1998 sales were just $56 million.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, many people believe that Lycos shares _ and other
Internet stocks _ are still wildly overvalued. It faces the tough
job of staying ahead in a fast-changing business where differences
among rivals can often be hard to discern. And some of those
rivals, notably America Online Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Netscape
Communications Corp., have deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Lycos has something that many other pure Net
stocks don't: a history of making profits. The firm was in the
black in the first two quarters of its 1998 fiscal year, which
ended July 31. Lycos has run up $112 million in losses since then,
but then, eyeballs are expensive, and Davis has been buying them by
the millions.
</P>
<P>
   Since last February, Lycos has expanded its audience by buying
up an attractive stable of Internet properties. The shopping spree
began with a deal that nearly didn't get made.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bo Peabody, a political philosophy student at Williams
College in Williamstown, Mass. launched an Internet site called
Tripod. Peabody and Williams economics professor Richard Sabot
wanted to create an Internet community for people his age:
twentysomethings in college, or those recently embarked upon their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of traffic because we were one of the only good
sites out there,'' Peabody recalls. Traffic built even faster when
Tripod added a feature that for its time was quite radical. Anybody
who joined Tripod could set up a personal Web site at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1997, Tripod had a million users and was being
courted by a variety of Internet companies, including Lycos. On the
verge of an acquisition deal with Lycos, Tripod announced it was
backing out and selling itself to AOL instead. But the deal fell
through, and Lycos was still interested. In marathon talks that
began on New Year's Eve of 1997 and ended late the next day, Lycos
and Tripod cut a deal worth $61 million. Sabot joined the Lycos
board and Peabody became a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Tripod deal set the tone for 1998, and the transformation of
Lycos. As the year wore on, Lycos acquired two more major Web
properties. The company paid $133 million for WhoWhere, a Internet
``white pages'' service for looking up the addresses and phone
numbers of people throughout the country. WhoWhere also gave Lycos
another free Web site service, Angelfire _ which targets
middle-of-the-road users rather than Tripod's Generation-X emphasis
_ and MailCity, a site that offers free e-mail services to anybody
with a Web browser. Between them, these sites brought at least 11
million more users into Lycos' orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible coup came in October, when Lycos plunked down
$83 million for one of the Internet's best-known brand names: the
on-line assets of Wired magazine. Included were the popular HotBot
search engine, the Wired magazine Web site, a technology news site,
and the satirical Web magazine Suck.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Lycos had thrown off its reputation as an on-line
weakling, a search service that people visited just long enough to
look up the location of a really interesting Internet site. Davis
had turned Lycos into a diversified network of Web communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole essence of Tripod is about belonging and
participating,'' says Davis. ``That is why we have been so
successful in growth this year. We've given people a reason to
stay, not a reason to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Sites like Yahoo and Netscape's Netcenter offer most of the same
features as Lycos, but in the form of a single large site. Davis
wasn't interested in that model. Instead, he's taken his cues from
the television industry. Consider the Walt Disney Co. It operates
the ESPN cable sports network, the cable Disney Channel for kids,
and ABC for viewers of traditional broadcast television. Each
channel aims at a different market segment, but Disney owns them
all.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, Lycos is now positioning itself as the Lycos
Network _ a system of distinct yet interrelated Internet services,
each with its own style and content. Some visitors will enjoy the
corrosive humor of Suck, while others will prefer the high-tech
savvy of Wired. The HotBot search engine specializes in brute-force
Internet searching for experienced surfers, while the original
Lycos site has a more Yahoo-like, user-friendly feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided the best way to catch Yahoo was to pursue a network
of branded sites, rather than one megasite,'' says Peabody.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the Lycos properties has links to the others woven into
its fabric. Visit any Lycos site and at the top of the page,
there's a window that lets the visitor search the Lycos index. At
the bottom of the search page, there's a ``second opinion'' link
that'll run the same search in HotBot. Pages are lined with
enticements to look up phone numbers, sign up for free e-mail, or
do a bit of on-line shopping. Each of these offerings will whisk
you off to some other Lycos-owned site.
</P>
<P>
   Davis credits the cross-linking between Lycos sites for most of
his network's booming growth rate. People come for the Internet
searching and stay for the free Web pages. ``This is the whole
point about multiple brands,'' says Peabody. ``We don't care if we
lose the user if they come to someplace we own.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rappaport, an Internet analyst at Zona Research Inc. in
Redwood City, Calif., says the Lycos model is a clever way to keep
users on the reservation, by constantly giving them reasons to go
to a Lycos destination, instead of wandering off elsewhere.
``They're capturing what could be customer attrition within their
network.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach is also capturing the attention of businesses who
want to sell their wares on line. The on-line bookseller
BarnesandNoble.com, for instance, has a strategic relationship with
Lycos that links its on-line bookstore to the company's sites. Run
a search on any topic, and BarnesandNoble will offer to sell you a
book on that subject. The bookseller also plasters its ads across
the other Lycos sites.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Rosendorf, a vice president of marketing at
BarnesandNoble.com, has nothing but praise for the Lycos strategy.
``Lycos is more than an Internet play,'' said Rosendorf. ``Lycos is
a savvy media company...I think they're some of the smartest people
on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart enough to challenge dominant sites like Yahoo and AOL?
Peabody certainly believes so. ``I think that we will likely
surpass Yahoo in reach, probably in three months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL is a bigger challenge. Not only does AOL make a big
profit, but its core on-line service charges its customers, and 15
million people are happy to pay up. That gives AOL a cash flow that
other Internet companies only dream about. No surprise that Barry
Schuler, president of AOL Interactive Services, is losing no sleep
over the Lycos challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our growth is stronger than ever,'' Schuler says. In addition,
Schuler argues, visitors to portal sites like Lycos don't stick
around for long, but soon wander off to other locations on the
Internet. ``They haven't demonstrated any particular loyalty yet to
any brand,'' he said. On the other hand, Schuler estimated that
typical average AOL user stays on line for 50 minutes a day. That
gives AOL plenty of time to bombard visitors with ads and sell them
merchandise. Until Lycos and other portals can match this level of
brand loyalty, Schuler thinks he has little to fear from them.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis sees plenty of growth ahead for Lycos. In fact, he
worries that the Bay State may not be big enough for him.
``Massachusetts doesn't have the base that Silicon Valley does in
Web companies,'' Davis frets. ``As a result, we have a smaller
talent pool.'' His biggest worry is finding enough talented workers
for the next growth spurt.
</P>
<P>
   And where will the growth come from? Advertising revenue, of
course, and exclusive deals with partners like BarnesandNoble.com.
Lycos is also planning a much stronger focus on generating revenue
from selling goods through its own on-line store. Peabody says the
ultimate goal is to have on-line retailing generate half of Lycos'
revenue, up from the present 15 percent. Then there's the highly
visible Lycos Chevrolet racing on the NASCAR circuit, and a
nationwide ad campaign keyed to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, says Davis, there are so many deals still to be made.
``Any day of the week, there are scores of companies presenting
partnership offers to us,'' he says. Davis spends much of his time
weeding through them, looking for deals that will give Lycos one
more burst of speed.

GIGA'S GIDEON GARTNER EXPLAINS HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As exits go, this wasn't the kind any chief executive would
relish.
</P>
<P>
   Gideon Gartner, a legend in his industry and certifiable Big
Thinker, stepped down as CEO of Giga Information Group Inc. earlier
this month. It was just seven months since he stumped for the
Cambridge, Mass. company on an investment road show, pushing its
initial public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Giga, which had lost a breathtaking $54 million building its
technology information and consulting business before the IPO,
announced financial results that came up short in its first quarter
as a public company. The stock, which sold for 12 1/2 in the July
IPO, crashed to 2 3/4 in October and has since only recovered to 6
5/8. Giga will announce its fourth-quarter results Feb. 18., when
more red ink is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gartner is stepping back to serve only as chairman of the
young company, and a money man, chief financial officer Dan Clarke,
is running day-to-day operations until a new CEO is found.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of e-mail messages and a subsequent phone
conversation, Gartner, 62, insisted his departure was part of a
plan, that he jumped and wasn't pushed from the top job at the
company he named after himself (Giga represents the first two
letters of his first and last name).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll acknowledge the timing looks suspect given our third
quarter, and that the pressures of public ownership were
significant,'' he wrote. ``But the fact is that I cut back for
other reasons, following my original plan to do so, and I cannot be
a part-time CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Gartner, a talented classical pianist as a young man, started
his business career at International Business Machines Corp. and
later became a star analyst on Wall Street with E.F. Hutton and
Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Giga is Gartner's second venture in the technology information
business _ part think tank and part consulting operation _ that has
generated public competitors with billions of dollars in stock
market value. The granddaddy of them all is the Gartner Group,
which he himself started and left years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner is widely seen as a gifted conceptual thinker and many
people call him a visionary. But chances are they will also tell
you he has a hard time getting day-to-day operations to run
smoothly and the people he hires for that have a habit of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Giga has had at least four CEO heir apparents in its brief
corporate life. Other top jobs have been filled several times as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``His strengths are his vision, ability to think through new
business models, and raise money,'' said Ken Marshall, one of
Giga's former chief operating officers. ``His ability to attract
very smart people is really up there. It's in the operational area
where he's had some challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Gartner says he's heard it before.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you think we built a $50 million (company) in less than
three years?'' he said. ``It's never happened before and I was the
executor. I'm constantly cited as a visionary but at Gartner Group,
I was the CEO, the chief operating officer, the president, and the
chairman for 12 years. I ran the company and I built the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Operations are an issue at Giga because it has lost so much
money. The mistake, some believe, was a failure to trim expenses
when overly optimistic sales projections did not come true. Giga
increased the bet.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner said there was no mistake, that the expenses were
necessary to build the business he envisioned and will turn out to
be money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   Giga attempted to offer corporate clients access to all types of
technology information at once, not pidgeon-holing them into
categories of expertise that could be built slowly. That meant Giga
needed to have lots of analysts on board from Day One and a big,
expensive sales force to sell them everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our model required the (spending) ramp. It was not a matter of
prudence, it was a matter of necessity,'' he said. ``In fact, I
believe we should grow even faster than we did. . . . Growing more
slowly would have led nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the attack was against his old firm, the Gartner
Group. He believed the Giga way of doing business could attract
customers away from Gartner, but speed was of the essence.
</P>
<P>
   What the results at Giga prove is a matter of interpretation.
Losses continue but revenues and the number of clients continue to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has proven the model is right,'' said Clarke, the
company's interim chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Anderson, president of the competing Yankee Group and a
Gideon Gartner critic, doesn't see how.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gideon's model is fatally flawed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gartner, he says he stepped aside as chief executive to
pursue personal interests and will continue to split his time
between homes in Aspen and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not wish to be CEO from Day One,'' he said in one
message. In another: ``My business card has always said, simply,
`Chairman.' I had plenty of good reasons to disclose my plans to
the board at year-end.''

IN 1868, NO NEWS SOURCE WAS UNIMPEACHABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A swarming pack of Washington media bigfeet seemed considerably
more interested in impeachment than the rest of a benumbed nation.
Journalists freely displayed their ideological bias and news became
indistinguishable from opinion. Leaks and rumors ended up in the
public domain. An embattled president went to unusual lengths to
put his spin on events. And one famous social critic, surveying the
impeachment mess, dismissed Washington as ``the place to get a poor
opinion of everybody in.''
</P>
<P>
   While this sounds eerily like the current White House scandal,
the media feeding frenzy described above took place 131 years ago
during the impeachment trial in which Andrew Johnson was acquitted
by one vote. True, there were no all-news cable stations and no
instantaneous Internet communication back then. The Globe did not
exist and The New York Times was a mere teenager. Many newspapers
were partisan political organs, the largest of them had
circulations around 100,000, and front pages were festooned with
ads.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, the lessons of the Johnson trial _ as gleaned
through research materials and books _ offer the mildly soothing
consolation that such modern media bugaboos as the rumor, news
scavengers like Matt Drudge, and the inexhaustible supply of
pontificating pundits can trace their ancestry to the last great
political trial of the century. Perhaps the modern media can even
be accused of restraint, seeing as how they have refrained from
tracking the shifting odds on conviction, as a Washington paper did
in Johnson's time.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the term ``disconnect'' denotes the chasm between a
Beltway press corps absorbed with Monicagate and the majority of
the citizenry that wants the episode to end. In March 1868, the
influential Harper's Weekly described it thus: ``The excitement in
regard to the Impeachment in Washington appears, indeed, to be
confined almost entirely to the newspaper men.''
</P>
<P>
   And that social critic sitting in the press gallery who declared
a pox on everyone's house in Washington was a common-sensical
fellow named Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While no one knows whether Monicagate will eventually modify
media behavior, observers say the decades after the Johnson
impeachment trial marked a significant evolution in the newspaper
industry. Advertisers rather than political parties began
underwriting publishing, leading to a greater editorial
independence. Journalists began abandoning their dual careers as
politicians. And having chronicled the trauma of civil war and
impeachment, reporters and editors began seeing themselves as more
than just captives of the political powers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the 1868 impeachment trial, the American press
was in an early stage of that lengthy transition. The advent of the
independent, newsier ``penny press'' was beginning to break the
grip of the dominant partisan outlets. ``But even as late as
Reconstruction,'' said Donald Ritchie, author of ``Press Gallery''
and associate historian in the Senate Historical Office, ``you read
the first sentence and you immediately knew whether this was a
Republican or Democratic paper.''
</P>
<P>
   The powerful journalists of the day included Horace Greeley of
the New York Tribune, Joseph Medill of the Chicago Tribune, Henry
J. Raymond of The New York Times, and John Forney, who started both
the Philadelphia Press and the Washington Sunday Morning Chronicle.
And instead of a line between politics and journalism, there was a
very active revolving door.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond was a member of Congress who brought disrepute upon the
Times by snuggling up to Southern sympathizers. Greeley ran for
president in 1872 and was crushed. Forney served as secretary of
the Senate. New York Daily News editor Benjamin Wood was in
Congress. The Providence Journal was owned by Senator Henry
Anthony. And congressman James G. Blaine was the editor of the
Portland Advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rigid divide (between journalist and politician) that we
have now just wasn't part of the story,'' said Michael Schudson,
communications professor at the University of California at San
Diego. And when they weren't actually functioning as polticians,
reporters fraternized with them. ``They used to live in the same
boardinghouses,'' said Ritchie. ``They drank in the same bar.''
Several decades earlier, Charles Dickens had complained that the
American press ``has its evil eye in every house, and its black
hand in every appointment in the state, from a president to a
postman.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to the impeachment trial, a majority of Northern
papers _ led by the Chicago Tribune, New York Tribune, and
Springfield Republican _ were anti-Johnson. At one point, when
Johnson ally Forney turned against him, the combative president
responded with the great press-bashing line: ``I do not waste my
ammunition upon dead ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   The embattled Johnson did manage one stunning feat of media
spin, stirring up the press by giving the first formal presidential
interview to Associated Press reporter Joseph McCullagh. That
interview ``helped Johnson, in some ways, because it made him seem
reasonable,'' said Ritchie.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Johnson complained that ``the damn newspapers are as bad
as the politicians in misrepresenting me.'' And papers like
Harper's Weekly returned the affection. With a circulation of over
100,000 and featuring the editorials of George William Curtis and
the scathing cartoons of Thomas Nast, the weekly was positioned
``where the mainstream Republican media were,'' said John Adler,
publisher of HarpWeek, which compiled the Harper's Weekly stories.
``Curtis was the single most important editorial writer in the
country, bar none.'' And on April 11, 1868, he wrote that ``the
pretense that President Johnson is a martyr to his defense of the
Constitution is intended only for the inexperienced. We maintain,
on the contrary, that his present position before the country is
due to his manifest and bold usurpation of power.''
</P>
<P>
   As the trial dragged on, however, journalists' enthusiasm began
waning. ``It was a stressful time for the press,'' Ritchie said.
``At least during the war, there were lulls in the battle.'' The
Baltimore Gazette observed that ``the greatest act known to the
Constitution'' was inspiring ``less interest in the public mind
than the report of a prize fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The ink-stained wretches did manage to find their amusements.
The Washington Star tracked daily fluctuations in the betting
action on the Senate trial. On April Fools' Day, bored reporters
wrote flirtatious notes to legislators, purportedly from attractive
women in the gallery, and then chuckled at the replies.
</P>
<P>
   And the thrill of competition can always inspire Washington
journalists. At one point, New York Tribune correspondent James
Rankin Young boasted of obtaining closed-door testimony. And
``simultaneous with the confession of failure on the part of the
other correspondents,'' he gloated, ``we published two and a half
columns of testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even in a rabidly partisan era, both sides commanded some
journalists who were loyal beyond reason. According to Ritchie's
``Press Gallery,'' correspondent William Warden _ who worked for
papers like The New York Times and the Boston Post _ ``served as
the president's private secretary and as a conduit between the
White House and Capitol Hill.'' (Warden even went so far as to sell
Johnson's ``annual message'' to newspapers.) Conversely, Uriah Hunt
Painter _ closely allied with Senator Ben Wade, who would have
succeeded Johnson _ was so fiercely in favor of Johnson's removal
that The New York Sun objected to running his dispatches.
</P>
<P>
   But if Painter and Warden went too far, coverage of Johnson's
trial was rife with personalized, opinionated writing. In his
coverage of the vote, the Boston Herald's correspondent spent
considerable time explaining how events affected him: ``Leaving the
Senate Chamber at the very moment the taking of the vote was
concluded, I made my way through a crowded jostling aggressive
multitude at imminent danger of life and raiment.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York Tribune dispatch took eight paragraphs before
reporting Johnson's one-vote margin. But there was no mystery about
the correspondent's impressions. ``Early in the morning when I saw
the blue sky and the bright sun, it seemed as if all whirl of
excitement was but a feverish dream,'' he wrote. ``But upon the
verge of this great vote, when looking around, I saw the intent
look of thousands and could even hear the intense stillness of the
vast Senate Chamber as if suddenly, every heart had stopped
beating.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-impeachment New York Times kept the reporting tighter.
``The great impeachment drama is practically at an end, and the
President stands acquitted of the principal charge,'' the reporter
declared before boasting: ``My calculations since Tuesday are fully
verified.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years earlier, the Times had publicly stated its intention
to ``publish facts, in such a form and temper as to lead men of all
parties to rely upon'' them. But that ideal was largely unrealized
at the time of the Johnson trial. Many journalists behaved more
like the biased talking heads who today populate ``Crossfire'' and
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would shock people to pick up a paper (from that era) and
see it so blatantly partisan,'' said Ritchie. ``Today, it's more
subtle, I suppose.''

KELLOGG'S EATS ITS SPECIAL K AD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By IRENE SEGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ooops!
</P>
<P>
   That's Kellogg's response to its new TV ad featuring a Diet
Debbie doll who ``crash diets'' and ``works out after every meal''
and proclaims, ``Only celery for me.'' Then the camera fades to the
written message ``Why do we do this to ourselves every January?
Let's just eat sensibly all year'' and an image of Special K
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was too many consumers didn't catch the spoof. They
wondered if a yearning-to-be-thin Debbie really was parking her
treadmill beside Barbie's little pink coupe on toy store shelves.
They wondered who was pushing dieting to young girls.
</P>
<P>
   So on Jan. 8, just 11 days after the first Diet Debbie ad aired,
Kellogg's yanked the 30-second spot and expects it to be completely
off the air by the end of the month. The folks at the
Illinois-based National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and
Associated Disorders, who once influenced milk producers to change
a ``milk mustache'' ad that had Ivana Trump saying, ``You can never
be too rich or too thin,'' didn't even have a chance to whimper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will admit we still don't always get it right,'' says
Kellogg's spokeswoman Karen Kafer. ``The execution was confusing to
consumers. We listened to consumers and we pulled it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled,'' says Beth Jacobsen of the anorexia
associationa, which had fielded a number of complaints about the
ad. ``I'm glad to hear they've pulled it.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie may have met a speedy demise, but still alive is
Kellogg's year-old effort to reshape its attitude about Special K
with a ``Reshape your attitude'' campaign that aims to sell cereal
by stressing positive body image and self-worth and sensible
eating. It's all part of a broader trend toward more realistic
portrayals of women in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the Special K commercials with the gorgeous, young,
impossibly thin model slipping into a pair of skintight jeans or a
little black dress only she can wear. Gone are the TV ads with the
camera surveying the long, svelte body of a model in a white
swimsuit before fading into an image of the ``K'' of Special K.
</P>
<P>
   Back again, in place of Diet Debbie, is Kellogg's ``bar guys''
ad, first aired during last year's Super Bowl. One man in a bar
promises to ``not freak out if I gain two pounds'' and another
glances at his pants and asks, ``Do these make my butt look big?''
This time the written message on screen is ``Men don't obsess about
these things. Why do we?''
</P>
<P>
   Another TV spot features blurred images and questions about role
models that allow for the possibility of a role model with hips.
New print ads include one with a photo of a baby girl who asks,
``Do I look fat?'' and another with a picture of a little black
dress (ah, the little black dress) that extols a perfect size 10
``and 12 and 14 and 16.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the aging of the baby boomers, consumers want images that
are more realistic,'' says Kafer. ``Women are speaking up and
saying we want images we can relate to at this point of our lives.
This is what our consumers told us. Beauty is not built around a
number on a scale or a dress size. That's why we reshaped our
campaign around looking good on your own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg's is not alone in trying to change its image by changing
its images of women. There are more ads these days featuring older
women or women with more than skin and bones. Anne Klein's recent
campaign featured such prominent women as former Texas governor Ann
Richards and basketball phenom Lisa Leslie wearing the company's
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pick out a few people who are trying to do a better
job of this,'' says Deborah Warner, executive director of the
Harvard Eating Disorders Center, which has invited representatives
of Kellogg's and Anne Klein to a forum in Cambridge next month.
``It may seem subtle, but it's important. There is still a long way
to go, but this is improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Babson College marketing professor Kathleen Seiders sees
it, ``there are so many more women with power and education in the
forefront of consumerism saying that's not real'' to standards of
beauty that accept only the young and the thin. ``We're the most
sophisticated generation of consumers ever.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Diet Debbie, speculates Seiders, ``it sounds like it was
too ironic.''

WHERE WILL BUSH WATCH THE SUN RISE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The national media keep saying that it's a done deal: The
governor of Texas is a candidate for president of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from me to argue with the national media. After all,
they're only wrong about 100 percent of the time, aren't they? Who
could forget those predictions a year ago that President Clinton's
tenure in the Oval Office could be measured in days, not weeks?
</P>
<P>
   Or was it hours, not days?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. The big-time pundits always claim to know what will
happen before it happens. And the current wisdom is that George W.
Bush will go after his dad's old job in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Bush has plenty to do at the moment, having just
taken the oath of office to begin his second four-year term as
governor. Never mind that he insists he hasn't made a decision
about a presidential campaign. Never mind that he has serious
concerns about the effect on his family of a run for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind all that, because the media say Bush is running _ and
that's all there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of media representatives who flooded into Austin
for Bush's swearing-in on Tuesday clearly weren't on hand to tell
the world what the governor said in his inaugural address _ unless,
of course, he'd decided to use the speech to officially declare his
candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that all this attention is being focused on a
noncandidate when there are other Republicans who have announced or
all but announced their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   Is it because Bush has been the runaway front-runner in the
early presidential preference polls? Is it because he's the son of
a former president? Is it because the media are always more
intrigued by a candidate who seems reluctant than by one who's
beating down their doors in search of support?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is all of the above, and more. The media also have
targeted Bush because he's been a remarkably successful governor in
an enormous, complex state and because his landslide re-election as
governor confirmed his appeal to a vast cross section of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and there's one other thing. As any fool can see _ which is
to say that even the oblivious-to-reality experts in the media can
see it _ Bush is the sort of person whom voters could count on to
restore integrity and decency to a White House where such qualities
have been sorely lacking in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Having said all that, you wonder: How can I possibly doubt that
Bush intends to seek the presidency?
</P>
<P>
   Well, one reason is that I asked him one day last fall if I was
making a fool out of myself by suggesting that his universally
expected presidential candidacy might be something less than a
foregone conclusion. He told me that I was not _ that he truly
hadn't made up his mind and wouldn't make up his mind until the
spring of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I believed him. I still believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand, folks. I'm not saying that Bush won't run
for president. I'm just saying that he hasn't made a final decision
and that all these media geniuses who say that he has don't know
any more about it than you and I do.
</P>
<P>
   Here's something to keep in mind about all this. The governor
spoke from the heart when he delivered that inaugural address
focusing on his hopes and dreams for the future of Texas and its
people.
</P>
<P>
   As he often did during the campaign, Bush closed his speech
Tuesday by quoting a friend who lives on ``the sunrise side'' of a
mountain _ ``the side to see the day that is coming, not the side
to see the day that is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we head into a new century,'' Bush said, ``Texas lives on
the sunrise side of the mountain, and I see a very good day
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   No one should be surprised if the governor runs for president;
the pressure on him to make the race will only increase in the
coming weeks and months.
</P>
<P>
   But count me among those who won't be shocked in the least if
Bush decides to stay home and watch that very good day arrive in
Texas.

STRONG MILITARY, ANTITERROR GOALS LISTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While lauding US efforts to forge peace around the
world, President Clinton emphasized his top foreign-policy goals of
rebuilding the military and reducing terrorist and nuclear threats
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nation in history has had the opportunity and the
responsibility we now have: to shape a world that is more peaceful,
more secure, more free,'' Clinton said in his State of the Union
address, noting US leadership roles in Northern Ireland, Bosnia,
and Middle East peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we work for peace, we must also meet threats to our
nation's security, including increased dangers from outlaw nations
and terrorism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing concern over Russia's crumbling nuclear weapons
infrastructure at a time of heightened political and economic
uncertainty, Clinton called for a major boost in spending to reduce
the threat of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is proposing $4.2 billion for the effort over the next
five years, an increase of almost 70 percent over current spending.
He also, for the first time since 1985, proposed an increase in
defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   Calling his strategy ``cooperative threat reduction,'' the
president said it is in the nation's interest to work with Russia
and other members of the former Soviet Union to halt the export of
technology, nuclear material, and expertise to ``rogue nations''
such as Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The new funds will be used to expand efforts to reduce
stockpiles of nuclear materials and disarm existing nuclear
weapons. These initiatives include programs to tighten export
controls, destroy chemical and biological weapons facilities,
dismantle stored nuclear warheads, and find civilian jobs for
thousands of weapons scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The president also called on the Senate to ``end nuclear testing
forever'' by ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and on
both houses of Congress to pay the nation's United Nations dues.
</P>
<P>
   Responding agressively to new threats against American security
does not just mean confronting Iraq's Saddam Hussein, he said. It
also means reversing the decline in military spending for the first
time in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in ``troop readiness'' will be part of the proposed
$110 billion increase in spending to modernize the military over
six years, according to National Security Adviser Samuel R.
``Sandy'' Berger.
</P>
<P>
   That includes a 4.4 percent pay raise and enhanced benefits for
military personnel, as well as money to rebuild US embassies around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget also calls for a doubling of money for
antiterrorism efforts so the United States can defend itself
against biological and chemical weapons.

DISABILITY DEBATE TURNS TO COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the Americans with Disabilities Act went into effect
more than eight years ago, lawyers and workplace specialists have
debated the meaning of the word disability.
</P>
<P>
   At issue: Whether workers with high blood pressure,
nearsightedness, and other correctable conditions are disabled and
deserve the same legal protections under the law as blind or
wheelchair-bound employees with disabilities they cannot change.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress passed the act in 1990, it noted that employers
were barred from discriminating against ``qualified individuals
with a disability.'' Trouble is, some US courts aren't sure what
``qualified'' really means.
</P>
<P>
   But two nearsighted pilots, a mechanic with high blood pressure,
and a truck driver who is almost blind in one eye could put an end
to the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the US Supreme Court said it would consider
their lower court cases _ a move that could determine whether
millions of Americans with correctable disabilities are protected
under the law. Currently, the law protects 43 million Americans
with physical and mental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, employers and disabled employees are watching
the cases closely and becoming caught up in the debate, with
reason: Not only would a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs expand
the number of people offered protection, it could also increase the
number of bias complaints and lawsuits filed against employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of how many Americans wear contact lenses, or eye
glasses, or have high blood pressure,'' Christopher Bell, a partner
in the national employment law firm Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler &AMP;
Krupman, said. ``Virtually half of America would qualify as
disabled under the ADA if courts insist that correctable conditions
like nearsightedness and high blood pressure deserve protection,
and that was never the intent of Congress when it enacted the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   But one former Massachusetts advocate for the disabled believes
expanding the number of people guaranteed protection under the act
would strengthen the law and provide even more clout to a
long-ignored group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it expands the coverage, all the more power,'' said John
Winske, 36, owner of Access First Travel of Malden, a travel agency
and meeting planning firm that serves people with disabilities. ``I
welcome whatever anyone can do to empower the ADA and people with
disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the three cases now scheduled for review by the
Supreme Court, a federal Appeals Court in Denver agreed with United
Airlines' decision not to hire twin sisters Karen Sutton and
Kimberly Hinton as pilots. The sisters, who currently fly for
commuter airlines, argued that their eyesight is corrected to 20-20
by glasses, and they say each has federally certified medical
certificates.
</P>
<P>
   But the lower court ruled against them, saying they are not
considered disabled because their poor sight can be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   A separate suit involving United Parcel Service was brought by
mechanic Vaughn Murphy after he was fired because of high blood
pressure. Although Murphy had passed a medical exam and had
received permission to drive, he was fired after a nurse at UPS
learned he had high blood pressure. The third lawsuit was brought
by a trucker who was fired by an Oregon firm because of poor vision
in one eye.
</P>
<P>
   Those cases are hardly the first that could clarify the scope of
the disabilities act. Last month, the court said it would decide
this year if some mentally disabled people should be given a chance
to live in group homes or other community-based programs, rather
than institutions. Lower courts had already ruled that the state of
Georgia had to provide group homes, a requirement 22 other states
say would deplete their treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the US Supreme Court ruled a Maine woman who had
contracted the virus that causes AIDS is protected from bias under
the act. In that case, a Bangor, Maine, dentist had refused to fill
a cavity in the woman's mouth after learning she was HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts say the cases involving the mechanic, the twin
pilots, and the trucker are likely to have widespread impact on
employees and US firms, which currently spend an estimated $1
billion to $2 billion on workplace accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that requiring airline pilots to have 20-20
corrected vision is not unreasonable, given the severity of the
potential harm to passengers,'' said Don Baldini, vice president
for legislative policy at Associated Industries of Massachusetts,
which represents 4,500 companies throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also feel that any time you push the boundaries of the ADA
to cover more rather than fewer people you increase the potential
for litigation and more claims and that, from an employer's
persective, is troublesome,'' Baldini added.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Add this to hoaxes, practical jokes, erotica, and office gossip
entering US workplaces via cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at State Street Global Advisors weren't laughing last
month when an e-mail hoax written under a senior executive's name
accidentally reached 500 people at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the employee who used the Internet to transmit
the missive, which falsely announced that a SSGA executive was
planning to pursue a career as a ``transvestite cocktail
waitress,'' was dismissed. Promptly.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more workplaces go on line, such hoaxes are becoming
more commonplace. In New York, for example, two top employees at
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. lost their jobs last year after sending
pornographic material to other workers via company e-mail.

 &HT;    Lost words of Atlanta Jewish housewife create stunning portrait
of a modern woman
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ She saw Halley's Comet, crawling out of bed at 3 a.m.
May 16, 1910, worried about ``what will happen to us when we pass
through its tail.''
</P>
<P>
   She was living in Atlanta when Leo Frank, her cousin's husband,
was lynched in 1915 by an anti-Semitic mob.
</P>
<P>
   She was shocked when the Titanic went down in 1912, but
heartened by doomed men ``standing bravely, calmly, even gaily'' as
they helped women and children into lifeboats.
</P>
<P>
   She was Helen Jacobus Apte, who was born in Hawkinsville (Ga.),
south of Warner Robins, in 1886 and moved to Atlanta at age 12. She
was an ``ordinary'' housewife with an extraordinary gift for
writing who faithfully recorded the history of the city, the South
and the world _ and documented the stiff-collared moral codes of
her times _ in a diary she kept from her marriage here in 1909
until her death in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Found by relatives in a closet in 1995, written longhand in
cracked leather volumes, it's just been published under the name
she gave it _ ``Heart of a Wife.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to giving the history of the era, the diary paints a
vivid picture of a well-off, post-Victorian woman who felt
frustrated and bored at the role society dictated for her as wife
and mother and sexually repressed in an era when the topic was
taboo.
</P>
<P>
   But she wasn't shy in her diary, even hinting at playful
dalliances with former beaus while her husband, Day Apte, a grocery
broker, was away on business.
</P>
<P>
   Sex, she wrote with a tinge of disgust eight months after her
nuptials, is the ``chief thought in life'' of men. They become
``wild with passion, which seems to spoil it all for me _ gives me
a little shock. It is hard for a woman to become accustomed to it
and look upon it as something right and natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet she adds: ``A still stranger thing is that a woman is
ashamed to show passion. She is afraid she will fall in her
husband's estimation, or in her own, that it makes her less pure.
Of course, that's absurd, but I guess it's because of long years of
training and the ideas that are instilled into girls' minds _ a
maidenly austerity, which is hard to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heart of a Wife: The Diary of a Southern Jewish Woman''
(Scholarly Resources, $55 cloth or $17.95 paperback) was edited by
one of her grandsons, Marcus Rosenbaum, 50, special projects editor
for National Public Radio in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum left Apte's words largely untouched, adding some
punctuation and some of his own essays to flesh out the diary's
prevailing themes _ morality, religion, history and the role of
women in those days.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum says Apte mentions the Frank lynching only once, in
passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother and other Atlantans didn't talk about it,
because they wanted to consider it as an anomaly,'' says Rosenbaum,
recalling recollections of his deceased parents and others who knew
Apte. ``And it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, a young manager at the National Pencil Co., was convicted
of murdering Mary Phagan, a 14-year-old employee, mostly on the
testimony of a janitor, and sentenced to death. But after Gov. John
M. Slaton commuted the sentence to life, 25 men abducted Frank and
lynched him from an oak tree in Marietta (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   After that incident, Rosenbaum says, Atlanta's Jews ``did not
protest or shout their concerns. Instead, they tried even harder to
assimilate, to be just like their neighbors. And they tried even
harder to be inconspicuous. The entire incident was too disturbing,
because it went against their unending desire to be like their
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Apte wrote with passion over the years about anti-Semitism,
bemoaning the fact that once she and her husband were called
``stinking Jews,'' fretting that ``it is still considered a term of
opprobrium to be called a Jew'' and suggesting that too many Jews
tried to hide their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad, proud to be called `Jew,' '' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Helen was also proud to be a Southerner.
</P>
<P>
   In a passage written in St. Louis, she declares: ``How different
the people are here than in the South. There is no class in them.
I'll never get used to their manners and customs, and how much more
refined we are than they.''
</P>
<P>
   After passing the wreckage of the battleship Maine during a
cruise to Havana in 1910, she writes: ``How my heart thrilled and
every man's hat came off as we sang `America' and `Dixie.' '' But
later she wonders whether ``the Spanish-American War was brought on
by politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there are time gaps in the diary, it records dozens of
historical events. In one case, Rosenbaum reaches back several
years before Apte's diary begins, quoting from a letter to her
husband about the Atlanta race riots of 1906.
</P>
<P>
   Angry mobs of whites had been stirred up by newspapers, which
insinuated blacks had been raping white women. Apte's family gave
refuge to a half-dozen or so ``pitiful'' African-Americans. ``I
really feel sorry for them,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in 1918, she worried that her three brothers _ one
nicknamed Bubba _ were heading off to fight in World War I.
``Yesterday our soldier boys went away,'' she says, ``brave and
gallant and gay and all with smiles on their lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Apte was something of a philosopher, writing about politics and
scientific wonders, such as ``a great dirigible balloon'' she saw
one day. ``My, my, what will be invented next,'' she wonders.
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, she wrote that ``everyone expects great things'' of
Woodrow Wilson, who had taken office the week before. On Nov. 29,
1917, she commented on the state of the world: ``The (Atlanta)
Journal had a cartoon of another planet, and the inhabitants looked
down on this one and said, `I'm thankful because I don't have to
live down there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She recorded conventional wisdom too, though in apparent whimsy.
She noted that many people wondered whether Halley's Comet was
causing strange weather. ``One thing sure, it is most unusual to
have such a cool May, and snow is falling in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that Apte, though she had to quit Girl's High at 16
due to illness, was intelligent, well-read, socially and
politically liberal, sensitive to racial discrimination and
injustice _ and in love with Atlanta, though she also lived in
Tampa, Tallahassee, Miami, Richmond and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My beautiful spring is here,'' she wrote in 1924. ``Atlanta is
really beautiful in the spring with the peach trees in bloom and
the dogwood trees a mass of white blossoms. The surrounding country
is rolling and lovely. The good old red clay hills of Georgia
always give me a thrill when I return from a trip _ they mean
'home.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She also fell into funks, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did we accomplish?'' she wrote after World War I. ``Is
the world now safe for democracy? Alas, we seem further than ever
from universal peace.''
</P>
<P>
   And occasionally she wrote with a forlorn hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, she quotes H.L. Mencken, then adds her own words, on
the human condition: `` `God, if he exists at all, is neither good
nor bad but simply indifferent _ an infinite force carrying on the
operation of unintelligible processes without the slightest regard
either one way or the other for the comfort, safety and happiness
of man.' . . . I still believe in some great, irresistible force,
some mysterious universal plan, some Power above, but what are we
in it all _ grains of sand, struggling ants, less than the dust.
Here today, gone tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum, who will be in Atlanta to discuss his book Feb. 28 at
the Bremen Jewish Heritage Museum, says his grandmother still has
``probably hundreds'' of relatives in Atlanta, including members of
the prominent Selig family, associated with Selig Enterprises, a
real estate development firm.
</P>
<P>
   The diary came to light in 1995 when Rosenbaum; his brother
David, a reporter for The New York Times; and their families were
cleaning out ``decades of stuff'' from their father's Tampa house
after his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately, we all realized that this was something special.
For one thing, it was so well-written. But it also seemed . . . my
grandmother had something to say.''
</P>
<P>
   He edited out ``a few boring passages,'' but he says his
grandmother left out more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't she write about the fact that my grandfather and
his brother Bill sponsored literally hundreds of Jews trying to
escape the Nazis in the 1930s, allowing them to immigrate to
America? Or why didn't she write more about her husband's business
_ the failures and the successes? I just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   What he found most interesting was that ``everything was so
natural to her. It was natural to be from Atlanta. It was natural
to be a Jew. It was natural to be a Southerner and an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she sometimes felt the sting of anti-Semitism, ``she
apparently didn't feel she faced it personally,'' even though there
were organizations in Atlanta, such as the Piedmont Driving Club,
that excluded Jews, he says. Atlanta's Jews simply started their
own version, the Standard Club, and went to hotels where they
weren't excluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess she felt sort of like my father, who always said, 'If
they don't want me, I don't want to belong.' ``
</P>
<P>
   By her own account, Helen Jacobus Apte felt she did belong, not
in every club, but in the city, region and country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I live in Dixie, I am, I am,'' she wrote at one
point. ``In Dixie Land I take my stand to live and die in Dixie _ I
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The diary ends soon before her death in 1946. In Miami _ Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   EXCERPT
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, Saturday, Oct. 4, 1924. It is Yom Kippur, and Apte
still grieves for her mother, Alice Selig Jacobus, who died in May:
</P>
<P>
   Today is said to be the holiest Sabbath of the year and the Day
of Atonement. I didn't go to temple because I wanted to stay home
and relax. Besides, it tears me to pieces to say the Kaddish prayer
(of mourning) with all eyes upon me. I can't control my grief, and
I'm one of those who, when they grieve, want to crawl into a dark
place alone. These holidays have been very sad, of course, for all
of us, with our dear one gone. I'll be glad when they are over, and
yet these solemn days are beautiful. Though we modern reformed Jews
have drifted away from the rites and ceremonies of our faith,
``There is a mystic tie that binds the children of the martyr
race.'' The sound of the shofar thrills me more than any aria from
grand opera. It touches something way down deep in me, something
fundamental. It reaches the soul _ our own heritage. How some Jews
can be ashamed of being Jews has always seemed to me inexplicable.
In me burns the ancient pride of race. I am glad, proud to be
called ``Jew.'' It holds no opprobrium for me even though it is
meant that way. It is a terrible thing that anti-Semitism is
growing in this country. It will hurt worst those Jews who are
ashamed of their religion. Me, it cannot touch.

 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton promised to take us into the
21st century and he almost did before his speech ended Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 80 minutes of Clintonian visions for the future
beyond the impeachment vote, I'm tired of the 21st century and want
to move on to the 22nd.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said our generation has to live up to its historic
responsibility to the 21st century. That made me a bit queasy. This
was a guy who weaseled out of some of his historic responsibilities
in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Serve or refuse the draft. Honor promises to reform health care
and expand gay rights. Don't mess around with interns while a
special prosecutor is looking through keyholes.
</P>
<P>
   I call those historic responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton wants us to construct global financial systems for
the 21st century, a Social Security system for the 21st century and
name towns as ``nationally recognized Millennium Communities.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a cult that wears Nikes.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Clinton's State of the Union Address was
designed to really get the Republicans' goats. It was his proposal
to put most of the budget surplus for the next 15 years into Social
Security rather than giving Americans a tax cut, which tends to
favor the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security is a program in which the rich help the poor,
and they don't like that idea,'' said my father, when I called to
ask him about Social Security, which he receives and I pay for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have tried to get back (at Democrats) over
Nixon,'' he said. ``Now they're trying to get back over
Roosevelt.''
</P>
<P>
   I had called my folks to get a little more perspective on the
20th century. My mom and dad were in junior high school in 1935
when Franklin Roosevelt's Social Security Act was passed, and it
was controversial then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your grandfather Morse was a great Republican and didn't like
Franklin Roosevelt,'' my mother said. ``But when he retired he
changed his mind. He said, `This Social Security isn't a bad
idea.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``His business didn't do much for his retirement,'' my dad said.
</P>
<P>
   My father is a hard-core Massachusetts Democrat but he's
bipartisan in his worries about Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed putting one-seventh of Social Security funds
into the stock market. Republicans have proposed giving money
earmarked for Social Security directly to workers to invest.
</P>
<P>
   My dad hates both ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish they'd leave Social Security alone,'' he said.
``They're going to let little old ladies be robbed by Wall Street.
There's going to be a stockbroker on every corner.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a point. We who are getting older will be getting a lot
of cold calls from sleazy brokers trying to sell us a lot of lousy
investments. It's bad enough now.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security system will be solvent until the third
decade of the 21st century. The stock market bubble will burst
before that. It seems like a bad time to buy.
</P>
<P>
   My Democrat dad, who lately has spent most of his time ripping
Republicans, was particularly tough on Clinton. ``First he threw
people off welfare. Now he's going to throw their money in the
stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a bitterly divided Congress ensures that Social
Security isn't changing for a while _ at least until Internet
stocks prove themselves.
</P>
<P>
   My dad began ranting about Amazon.com, which hasn't made money,
but whose stock is astronomically high.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are they going to make money selling books?'' said this
former professor, whose friends could only sell books by assigning
them to students.
</P>
<P>
   Rants run in the family.
</P>
<P>
   People forget a lot of things about Social Security. It isn't
meant to be a way to finance a retirement home in Tahoe. It's meant
to be insurance, and it's vitally important for those who are poor
or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of brokers putting Social Security into some hot
Internet stock is more than a little frightening. The idea of the
government becoming majority owners of companies is very
frightening to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security isn't a savings account, where you get out of it
what you put into it with interest. Each generation pays for the
generation that precedes it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, my mom is the person in the family who really supports
everyone. ``I'm still paying into Social Security because I'm still
working,'' she said, ``but I'm collecting it at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   My parents own stocks, but they try not to think of them as real
money. They're terrified by the idea of Social Security on the big
board.
</P>
<P>
   They remember what happened to the stock market when Hoover was
president. They remember why there was a need for Social Security.
They remember the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   My mom's dad had to move from town to town for jobs and live off
deer shot out of season. My father's dad, the Republican, tried to
find jobs in his warehouse for young men coming out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, my Republican grandmother, fed all the hobos, bums and
unemployed who came by the back door.
</P>
<P>
   All because of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   To fulfill our responsibility to the 21st century, we must
remember the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   But I hope I get mine, even if I can't live on it.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, what do you expect from our generation?
</P>

RAYTHEON UNION LEADER A MAN IN THE MIDDLE

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some might say Michael Zagami holds an unenviable position.
</P>
<P>
   As head of Raytheon Co.'s 3,500-member technical union, he is
both man in the hot seat and man of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk around the plants all the time,'' said the 43-year-old
business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers Local 1505. ``I go out and see people, and the majority of
them know I've stood up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But nearly three years after his election, Zagami and other
elected union officials are being challenged by a handful of vocal
workers who have watched the union's membership plummet from almost
6,000 in 1994. As the leader of one of the most visible unions in
the state, his travails illustrate the difficulties of running a
union in an era of mergers, reorganizations, and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders like Zagami must live up to labor's mission of
challenging company management and keeping union members happy
while also being realistic about job protections in an era of
manufacturing cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   At Raytheon, the first wave of layoffs under Zagami stemmed from
concessions the union agreed to before his election in 1996, but in
an election year, that doesn't matter much to Zagami's detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, the $20 billion Lexington, Mass. military contractor,
last year announced plans to eliminate 14,000 jobs, or 16 percent
of its defense work force, by the end of 1999. The cuts will come
through layoffs and attrition, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest reductions, as well as the recall of some workers at
a lower pay scale, were bitter pills for union members to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see that 50 people have been laid off, I see 50 faces
of people I know and I know they're suffering,'' said Bill Guthrie,
an electrical technician who joined the company 24 years ago.
``That bothers me. It makes me feel like Mike is not pursuing the
company as vigorously as he should.''
</P>
<P>
   In some unions, the business manager emerges as the union's
leader, more so than the president. At Local 1505, for example,
Zagami is the chief negotiating officer, spokesman, and union
representative.
</P>
<P>
   But for every man or woman who questions Zagami's leadership,
others point to a 1995 contract negotiated by a prior union team
and the concessions it accepted in order to keep one of the state's
biggest private employers from moving jobs out of state. It was
those concessions, Zagami's supporters say, that stripped some
workers of jobs and recalled others at lower pay, resulting in a
two-tiered pay scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Zagami got slammed,'' said Jacqueline Taylor, a 37-year
Raytheon veteran. ``He got brought into something he really didn't
expect. He's not responsible for what happened in '95. He's done
well by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Nancy Cruickshanks, a 45-year-old microelectronics
assembler at the company's Quincy, Mass. plant: ``The layoffs and
bringing people back at a lower rate of pay was a done deal. It was
part of the old, 1995 contract and it has nothing to do with
Michael Zagami. But the new contract is under Zagami, and it got us
a raise. Plus, the benefits are great.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, 41-year-old George Noel, a former union steward who
works as a radar tester, is one of Zagami's most strident critics.
Noel plans to challenge Zagami for the business manager's post this
summer. Noel's supporters say Zagami shuns those who were part of
the old union regime, seems disinterested in new ideas, and is
rarely available at the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his job to enforce the contract on a daily basis, but
there's no enforcement of the contract, and they (Zagami's regime)
have people who don't understand the language of the contract,''
Noel said. ``That's my main problem, there's no fight with the
company on anything that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagami's supporters, by contrast, describe him as a hardworking
union leader who has been wrongly blamed for the cutbacks and
changes that have ravaged the technical union in recent years. The
past decade has seen a string of Raytheon buyouts, layoffs, and
plant closings around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, the criticism comes several months before what
will likely be a hotly contested June election.
</P>
<P>
   Noel argued that he had reason to be angry. In August 1997, he
was ordered to appear before the union's trial board to answer to a
charge that he violated union rules when he spoke to the Lawrence
(Mass.) Eagle Tribune about the union's financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbled by debt, the union was facing an $86,000 bill for back
taxes and interest owed to the city of Waltham, Mass. for a
building it owned that had served as union headquarters. In a push
to increase the union's depleted treasury and pay off debts
inherited from the past regime, Zagami had announced a plan to cut
union leaders' salaries to save money.
</P>
<P>
   In the May 1997 article, Noel claimed the average Raytheon
employee was against the plan. He added that such a cut would send
the wrong message to the company. Days later, Noel was slapped with
an internal complaint for speaking out. The complaint was brought
by a union member.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a strident letter to members, Zagami warned: ``The
place to discuss our business is in the halls of labor, our halls
of labor.''
</P>
<P>
   A reserved man who is reluctant to talk to the press, Zagami
said he declined to give interviews during contract negotiations
last year because of what he described as a longstanding policy not
to debate contract issues in the media. ``There is a history of
this local not talking to the press about union affairs,'' Zagami
said. ``It is a pledge to the union membership, but George Noel
broke the pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagami had never held a union title before 1996, when he was
swept into office by a wave of discontent. He said he decided to
run for business manager because he wanted to help workers get
their due.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Watertown, just outside Boston, Zagami attended
Northeastern University, where he studied criminal justice. He was
a plumber at Raytheon for 14 years before he became a union
official. And he was raised by a union family: His father, who also
worked as a Raytheon plumber, belonged to the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the business manager who had no experience,'' Zagami
said, ``but all the experience that the 1995 negotiating team had
brought us a pay freeze for four years. . . I've done more for this
union than the previous officials ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, he has. Last year, he was instrumental in
developing a provision that prohibits union members from retaining
union protected status after switching from a union post to
management. The change came several months before Arthur Osborn,
president of the union, moved to a managerial job earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Once overburdened by debt, the union is now operating in the
black for the first time in years. In August, Zagami and his
officers paid off the union's real estate tax debt and sold the
former headquarters. Now, located in an industrial park in Bedford,
Mass., the union is looking for property to buy that will provide
adequate space for office staff and membership meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Also in August, about 2,700 Raytheon workers overwhelmingly
ratified a new two-year contract negotiated on Zagami's watch. The
pact increases wages by 9 percent over the two years and guarantees
that all work on four major contracts will be done by union
members. The agreement covers 3,500 Massachusetts workers at
Raytheon facilities in Andover, Quincy, Burlington, Bedford,
Sudbury, Tewksbury, Marlborough, and Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   But that victory was overshadowed last fall when the company
announced plans to pare its work force even further by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Recent news that new pay grades would be implemented at the
Advanced Device Center, which manufactures computer wafers for
commercial clients, led to some bad feelings among some workers
employed at the Andover site. Even though many will receive
upgrades and increases in pay, workers have said they were more
concerned about seniority than a raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new plan gives away our seniority,'' said a worker at the
Andover site who asked that his name not be used. ``It's upsetting
to people. They feel like they were sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Zagami, company officials gave the union an
ultimatum: accept the plan or Raytheon would either close the unit
or move it to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, which was negotiated last year, a minimum of
131 people classified as level ``C'' have been moved to a higher B
classification. As Bs, they now have the chance to move from a B-1
grade to the highest category, B-3. Additionally, people in the
highest grade, including those with less seniority, or fewer years
of service, would be allowed to bump those in a lower category in
the event of layoffs, even if those being bumped had seniority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone starts at B-1, with an automatic $2 raise,'' said
Zagami. ``But a person at a lower scale can progress to B-3. . . If
we did not give Raytheon this flexibility, the company would have
sold the center or moved it to Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing, Zagami noted that heavy politicking by union members
during an election year has placed him in the spotlight _ and the
hot seat. ``No matter what I do right now, there will always be
someone who will say it's wrong,'' he said. ``In fact, prior to
this last contract, a lot of people would come up to me and say, `I
wouldn't want to be in your shoes.' ''

 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was 10, maybe 11, when her folks started driving her down to
Storrs. Brianne Stepherson was agog, stunned by the throngs of
deafeningly devoted fans with Husky paws painted on their cheeks
and the glint of success lighting their eyes. The University of
Connecticut women's basketball team was just hitting a national
stride that culminated with a glittering 35-0 season in 1994-95 and
continues to this day, and young Breezy Stepherson, the hardcourt
phenom from Middleton, Mass., was there to see it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Brianne was caught up when we first took her down
there,'' recalled her mother, Kathie, of that first frenzied game.
``The tears ran down her face, she was so excited. This is the
place she wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the fall of 1996, while still a junior at Masconomet
Regional High School in Topsfield, Mass., Stepherson announced her
commitment to play for her beloved Huskies _ immediately before
UConn trounced Boston College, 76-38, in the annual Reebok Classic
at the FleetCenter in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The timing would prove ironic, because when UConn (15-2) meets
Boston College (13-3) Saturday afternoon in a key Big East matchup
at Conte Forum, the Huskies will find Stepherson starting at point
guard for those same Eagles. Averaging 9.3 points a game and still
growing into her role as a team leader, Stepherson also averages
plenty of sleep at night over her ultimate choice, the precise
circumstances of which are likely to remain a private matter among
the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   One thing does seem apparent: Stepherson's change of heart
appears to hinge on a young girl's growing realization that things
aren't always what they seem at first glance; that a girl's first
love isn't necessarily the right one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all water under the bridge now,'' said Kathie Stepherson
of the months in which her daughter slowly discovered that UConn
coach Geno Auriemma was recruiting Keirsten Walters at point guard
despite her early commitment; in which she struggled through a Nike
camp while nursing a hip flexor injury and bladder infection and
was dismayed that Auriemma didn't ask if there was anything wrong;
in which she began to wonder if a powerhouse like UConn was the
best place for her after all. ``She's happy where she is. I think
what happened is the best thing that could have happened. I think
it's safe to say there are some things in her life more important
than playing basketball, and I don't think that necessarily takes
away from her talent.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the player herself: ``I don't even think about it, except
when people ask me,'' she said last week of the decision in August
1997 to rescind her verbal commitment to UConn. ``I know I made the
best decision for me. I'm just so happy here; I don't think it
could be any better.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a representative of the UConn sports information
office, Auriemma had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite back-to-back defeats last week, BC is having its best
year ever. Cracking the Top 25 for the first time in their history,
the Eagles were at No. 21 last week before dipping out of this
week's poll after the losses. Much of the credit goes to coach
Cathy Inglese, a respected and popular coach who took the
University of Vermont to two NCAA tournament appearances on records
of 29-1 and 28-1 in the early '90s before taking over a BC team
that was 10-17 in 1992-93, the season before she arrived. Last year
the Eagles were 17-11; if they right themselves after their recent
setbacks to Syracuse and Miami, they will be back in the hunt for
their first NCAA berth.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of program, it turns out, that appeals to
Stepherson: growing, rising, still focused on the journey rather
than the destination, still negotiating a gradual and hopeful
course toward the top echelons of women's college basketball
instead of plotting its strategy on how to stay there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had offered that to her way back,'' said Mark Trent, who
coached Stepherson for two years on the Massachusetts Magic AAU
team. ``I told her, `You can go to a program that is Top 10 every
year, Final Four, or you can go to a program you can help to the
next step and take some pride in that.' I think it was a great
choice for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, so did she. ``It was almost like a change of heart
in what I wanted,'' Stepherson explained last week regarding what
steered her away from UConn, a perennial contender for the national
title. ``I wanted to be part of that `first.' The first Top 25, to
be part of that is a big thing. I know we have a lot more to
achieve and that we haven't even tapped into what we're capable of
doing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she thinks she has yet tapped into what she is capable
of doing, Stepherson _ an All-American who was rated one of the
nation's top 50 players coming out of high school, the starting
point guard for Masconomet since seventh grade who averaged 22
points, 8 assists, and 7.5 rebounds a game in her senior year
despite warming the bench every time the score got out of hand,
which it usually did _ is quick with a no.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult being a freshman,'' she said. ``You have to
find what your role is, what you can do, what you can't do, and
what they want you to do and not to do. At the point, I'm a little
bit tentative right now; in high school, I wasn't because I was the
leader of my team and I'd take the ball to the hole if I thought I
was open or I'd take a shot if I wanted to take that shot. When I
come in here, it's like, should I drive? Or I'm afraid to do this,
or afraid to do that. I have to develop my game so I have a lot
more weapons than just a driver and a passer.''
</P>
<P>
   Inglese doesn't mind being patient while Stepherson gets
comfortable with running the team and playing more aggressively,
although she also acknowledges it's a case of the sooner, the
better with backcourt mate Cal Bouchard out with a torn anterior
cruciate ligament. For one thing, less heralded fellow freshmen
Becky Gottstein and Nicole Conway have taken off some of the
pressure, with Gottstein (averaging 8.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, three
times named Big East Player of the Week) in the midst of an
outstanding season. For another, Stepherson missed three games with
a virus so nasty that a battery of tests, including two MRIs, were
performed at Massachusetts General Hospital to rule out anything
more serious; getting her back for 40 minutes in Saturday's loss to
Miami was an unexpected bonus. For a third, ``She is extremely easy
to coach,'' said Inglese. ``A lot of times, stars of their high
school teams aren't used to being told what to do, that they've
made a mistake. She is like a sponge; she's very eager to get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   And just as eager to put the UConn controversy behind her,
especially any notion that she was reluctant to compete with the
likes of Walters _ who signed with UConn just days after Stepherson
withdrew _ and Sue Bird, two guards ahead of her in the respected
Blue Star rankings. ``It was kind of confusing to me,'' she
acknowledged of learning that other point guards were still on
UConn's drawing board. ``Then I started thinking, you know, `He
probably is doing that because it's a business and he's going to do
whatever it takes to keep his team the top in the country.' A lot
of people said, `You took back your verbal commitment because you
were afraid or wouldn't get enough playing time.' That had nothing
to do with it. If they were my teammates, I wouldn't resent them or
anything. I'd just work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent agrees. ``My feeling is she would have earned her spot on
that team and they would have seen, day in and day out, that she is
a player to be reckoned with. Would she be the starting point
guard? I don't know that. Would she have had an impact on the team?
Absolutely. She would have an impact on any team in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Stepherson, she insists there are no hard feelings. None
whatsoever. Saturday's game will be special to her ``not for
anything that happened,'' but only because her Eagles will be
playing one of the best teams in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't try to play above what I can do,'' she vowed.
``Nothing held against them. I just think it would be great if we
could give them a good game.''

26.2-MILE COMEBACK FOR STRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tidbits gathered from here and there:
</P>
<P>
   --There it is, right there in the results of Sunday's Houston
Marathon: Kerri Strug, No. 1107, age 19, 4 hours, 12 minutes, 6
seconds. And yes, it is the Kerri Strug, of Olympic gold medal
gymnastics, vault-on-a-bad-ankle fame. Now a student at Stanford,
Strug told the Houston Chronicle last week that she still works out
on the gymnastics equipment there but is spending most of her time
having fun: playing on the bowling team, taking up golf,
rollerblading. She started running to strengthen the bad ankle; she
has family in Houston and thought it would be a low-key place to
try her first marathon after a couple of 10Ks and and two 18-mile
runs. ``I'm sick of doing serious stuff,'' she told the Chronicle.
``I want to do cool stuff.'' Her goal was to finish in under five
hours.
</P>
<P>
   --Laila Ali, 21-year-old daughter of none other than Muhammad
Ali and herself a boxer, has announced that she will turn
professional this year. ``It's in my blood,'' she said. ``My father
is cool with it. He's given me his blessing to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   --In a CNN/SI poll, 59 percent of the 1,311 responding said
that, even with the demise of the ABL, the WBNA should stick to its
summer schedule, while 41 percent said the league should switch to
playing in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   --Plans for Wsports, a new women's sports magazine that was to
launch in April, have been put on hold indefinitely, after
publisher and editor-in-chief Nancy Levin, who once captained the
Harvard women's soccer team and now lives in the San Francisco Bay
area, was unable to raise the capital needed to start the magazine
this spring by her Jan. 1 deadline. ``I am keeping the door open
for new possibilities,'' she said, adding that if investors
materialize, she would be eager to pick up right where she left
off.
</P>
<P>
   --Meanwhile, Amy Love's Real Sports magazine hit the stands in
December with an inaugural issue that was uneven but promising,
ranging from an article on the ABL that was outdated even before
the league folded to an insightful piece on Pat Summitt and
Tennessee basketball (overlooking for a moment an unfortunate
reference to Monica Lewinsky) and a comprehensive college softball
preview that has the University of Massachusetts Minutewomen at No.
6 in the country. The reception by both readers and advertisers,
Love said Tuesday, has been so good that the publication date of
the next issue has been stepped up from June to March, with the
magazine scheduled to go bimonthly in June. For subscription
information, call 1-800-650-0122.
</P>
<P>
   --Mimi Murray, professor of physical education and former
gymnastics coach at Springfield (Mass.) College, will be given the
Luther Halsey Gulick Award on April 22 in Boston. The honor is the
highest awarded by the American Alliance of Health, Physical
Education, Recreation, and Dance (AAHPERD). Murray, a specialist in
sports psychology who has been a consultant to several Olympic
teams, has been on the Springfield faculty since 1968.

BABY BRUINS PERFORMING MINOR MIRACLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ The picture Peter Laviolette held in his
hands Tuesday was from Causeway Street, but its roots traced all
the way down Route 95, right here to Laviolette's office inside the
Civic Center. Andre Savage scored his first NHL goal with Boston
Monday at the FleetCenter, and a day later, Laviolette couldn't
take his eyes off the newspaper photo of the jubilant rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what makes me smile,'' said Laviolette, the
34-year-old head coach of the Providence Bruins, who only recently
put Savage on the shuttle to Boston. ``This is what makes me smile
_ a lot. What a great thing for Savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years removed from wearing a Baby B's uniform,
Laviolette now is the man in charge of channeling goalies,
defensemen, forwards, and dreams from Providence to Boston. That's
job No. 1. Job No. 2 is making hay down on the farm, and right now
Laviolette and top aide Bill Armstrong have the crop running deep,
rich, and beyond anyone's wildest expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what I think's got us where we are,'' said
Laviolette, whose team ranks first overall in the AHL with 60
points in 42 games, an eye-popping .714 winning percentage. ``It's
been everyone who has pulled on a uniform. It has been everybody
every night. Be it Shawn Bates, be it Terry Virtue . . . Brandon
Smith . . . Andre Savage . . . I mean everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the key now is, they don't want to lose. Sometimes Bill
and I stand back there behind the bench, watch 'em, and we can't
believe how hard they're playing.''
</P>
<P>
   For 13 straight games, dating back to a 4-1 win at Springfield
Dec. 23, these Bruins have worked on deleting defeat from their
memory banks. A 2-2 tie at Worcester Saturday snuffed out an
11-game winning streak, but a 6-2 win over Lowell Monday pushed
their undefeated stretch to 12-0-1. The AHL mark is 27 games
(21-0-6), set by Cleveland in the 1947-48 season.
</P>
<P>
   Savage and fellow forward Randy Robitaille will represent
Providence in this weekend's AHL All-Star Game at Philadelphia,
along with winger Landon Wilson and goalie Jim Carey. Robitaille is
the club's top scorer (15-35_50), and Carey, the former Vezina
Trophy winner who is trying to find his way back to the NHL, has a
13-6-2 record and a 2.43 goals-against mark. He shares the
Providence net with John Grahame, whose numbers (15-6-0, 2.80) and
effectiveness have nearly matched Carey's.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year Providence finished dead last in the AHL, collecting
only 50 points in 80 games. Head coach Tom McVie and assistant Rod
Langway were moved off the job in June, and within 72 hours,
Laviolette was offered the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Anderson (Providence chairman-CEO) has to take much of the
credit for hiring Peter,'' said Bruins assistant general manager
Mike O'Connell. ``But I think everyone felt we needed to go with a
younger coach, someone who could identify better with what players
go through today _ someone who understood the process and speaks
the lingo. So much has changed through the years, almost
everything, to the point where a charley horse is a thigh contusion
and we've got terms like `doubling down' and `weak-side lock.'
Players identify with all that better than just telling 'em, `OK,
go out there and skate your lane.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Mann, the Bruins' fifth pick in the 1995 draft, spent
virtually all of last season here, laboring in the frustration of a
dismal season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to explain what happened last year,'' said Mann,
the club's No. 2 scorer this season with 42 points in 38 games. ``I
don't know, things just didn't jell together. What's clear this
year is, to be on a winning team, you have to be like brothers on
the ice. The guys here this year, they'll work their asses off
every game to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that credit, said Mann, has to go to Laviolette.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preparation he gives us before every game, it's just
phenomenal,'' said Mann. ``He's just really smart. Before every
game, he tells us what the other team is going to do, and he'll let
us know exactly how we should play against them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Laviolette playbook says to play to the
strength of one's own team. He has a fast bunch of forwards, which
allows him to implement a strong forechecking game. The dreaded,
mind-numbing trap is there if need be _ and it has its place, says
Laviolette _ but most nights the Bruins press the puck forcefully
through the neutral zone and beyond their offensive blue line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go. We try to fly,'' said Laviolette, who spent 11 years
patrolling blue lines in the minors, called to the NHL for only a
dozen games with the New York Rangers in the '88-89 season.
``Defense is still a priority for us _ it has to be _ but our
strength is the forecheck, and we play to that strength. With our
speed, we can get in there, so my feeling is, `Let's go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And who can argue with the results? The wins keep coming and the
crowds are growing. Providence is averaging 6,544 per game, fourth
best in the league, and Friday's game against Fredericton
(Montreal's affiliate) looks as if it will be a sellout. From dead
last in 1997-98, the Bruins are now dead certain to return to the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be easy to get a big head when you've gone 13 without
a loss,'' said Grahame. ``But the big thing with (Laviolette) is
that he doesn't let anyone become complacent. He finds ways to keep
us motivated, so every guy in here wants to keep the streak
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the undefeated string, the Baby B's lost three
straight, the only really rough spot they've encountered this
season. The first practice after the last loss _ a 3-2 setback to
Hamilton with one second left in overtime _ had Laviolette
employing the old-school hammer, skating his club into the ice in
what he calls a torture practice.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way back from the dungeon. The
coach woke up the next morning with a feeling that the old way
wasn't the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, `This just isn't the answer,' '' recalled
Laviolette. ``I'd read Rick Pitino's book _ I'm always looking to
pick things up wherever I can _ and he'd made the point that when
the guys are down, you have to give 'em a hug. Instead of beating
the bejeezus out of 'em, it's time to lay off. When they've gone 13
without a loss, that's when you go at 'em a little harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the next day, we made it a fun day. We had an East-West
scrimmage _ guys born in Canada on one team, everyone else on the
other _ and then Bill and I met with guys one-on-one. I don't know,
seems like it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's refreshing, that's what it is,'' said Grahame, who also
spent the miserable 1997-98 season here. ``You show up the second
day, expecting another hard practice, and instead, you're right
back having fun _ it's just a very refreshing approach.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Step-by-step process
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half ago, after deciding his playing days were
done, Laviolettte packed up and moved to Wheeling, W.Va., to become
coach and director of hockey operations of the Wheeling Nailers in
the East Coast Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only show in town there,'' said Laviolette, who
played in two Olympics, '88 and '94, for the US, acting as the
captain in Lillehammer. ``If the Nailers did anything, it was on
the front page of the paper _ not just the front page of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Franklin, Laviolette now has the hottest team in the
AHL, less than a half-hour from where he grew up. As a player, he
was a little too slow afoot to think seriously about holding down a
long-term NHL job. As a coach, he may be on the fast track to the
big leagues. Worst-to-first reversals, no matter what the league,
cause people to inquire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love what I do,'' said Laviolette, sounding interested but
cautious about what could be ahead of him. ``And like anybody, I
guess, if you don't set your sights on getting to the top, you
probably never will.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not my main goal. My main goal is to win a
championship here, and having said that, I know that usually one
leads to the next. I tell that to Savage, to Bates, to Virtue, all
the guys who want to get to the NHL. All I say is, `Work hard,
because it's like anything else: One thing leads to the next.' ''

`EVENT' SHOWS THE AFTEREFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're never the same. Whenever an outstanding horse sustains
an injury, especially if it involves an operation on the knee, he
seems to lose just enough to take away that special quality.
Unfortunately, Event of the Year is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   A son of Seattle Slew, out of Classic Event, a Mr. Prospector
mare, Event of the Year was a juggernaut heading for the Kentucky
Derby last year until he fractured his knee while winning the Jim
Beam Stakes at Turfway Park in March. With the 5-length win in the
Jim Beam, he had won all four of his races, by a combined 20
lengths. There is little question that he would have been favored
in the Derby had he made it to Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Event of the Year, who is owned by the Golden Eagle Farm of John
and Betty Mabee, started his career at Bay Meadows and was trained
by Jerry Hollendorfer and ridden by Russell Baze, the top tandem in
Northern California. But his owners shipped him to high-profile
Southern California trainer Richard Mandella for what they hoped
would be a stellar comeback campaign.
</P>
<P>
   However, Event of the Year has lost both of his starts since his
return Dec. 26, and, while he has been in the money in both tries,
he hasn't come close to winning. That's not the Event of the Year
who looked like the real deal last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella picked the Malibu at Santa Anita for Event of the
Year's first start since the layoff. Off as the 7-5 favorite under
Corey Nakatani, Event of the Year dropped back, then came on, but
he could do no better than third, beaten a total of 3 1/2 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   He can be forgiven that one, but Event of the Year was defeated
again last Saturday in the San Fernando. He rallied from fifth to
easily gain second as the 6-5 choice, but he was 4 1/2 lengths
behind winner Dixie Dot Com, who was 5-1 under David Flores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our horse developed more this year than Event of the
Year did,'' said Bill Morey, trainer of Dixie Dot Come, who was
coming off a second-place finish in a turf stake.
</P>

   Event of the Year will get another chance against Dixie Dot Com
in the $500,000 Strub Stakes Feb. 6. Mandella feels that
inexperience has caused Event of the Year's problems.

   ``It's not that he's not good enough,'' said Mandella. ``It just
looks like he's got to get a little seasoning.''

   But if history is any guide, Event of the Year has lost a step
or two because of the knee, and that's a shame.

   Brian's Dancer, who is nicely bred for the mud, took advantage
of the sloppy going at Suffolk Downs Monday to score a hard-fought
neck victory in the $25,000 Collegian Stakes for 3-year-olds, the
feature race on the holiday card. Ridden by Harry Vega, Brian's
Dancer sat just off a speed duel between Abundant Deeds and Rapping
With Robb. Abundant Deeds, ridden by Freddy Castillo, shook off
Rapping With Robb and edged away in the stretch. But Brian's Dancer
came flying on the outside to get the nod at 3-1 ($8.20 to win).
Chance Spender, the 5-2 favorite with Henry Ma, charged up the rail
but could not gain on the top two and finished third, another 1 1/2
lengths behind. The time for the 6 furlongs was an honest 1:13.
Owned by John Tombarello and Kevin Joy, and trained by Joy, Brian's
Dancer was making just his third career start.

   Manistique, an impressive 4-year-old filly who is 17 hands high,
captured her 1999 debut last Sunday, overcoming a bad break to win
the $150,000 El Encino at Santa Anita. Ridden by Gary Stevens,
Manistique stumbled out of the gate but grabbed the lead anyway in
the mile-and-one-16th affair. She held on gamely through a
stretch-long duel to win by a head over Gourmet Girl and Kent
Desormeaux, tallying at 2-5 in 1:43. A daughter of Unbridled,
Manistique has won five of six career starts. Her only loss came in
the Alabama at Saratoga Aug. 22 when she finished third after
displacing her palate. She was on the shelf until Dec. 6, when she
returned to win the Bayakoa Handicap at Hollywood Park. ``She broke
so hard, the ground just broke out from under her,'' said Stevens,
who still managed to control the race, which had only three
starters. ``I was a liitle concerned in the stretch because
Manistique is not the kind of horse that has a big closing
charge,'' said trainer John Shirreffs. ``They really made her dig
in.'' Next for Manistique will be the $200,000 La Canada at Sant
Anita Feb. 7 . . . The Groom Is Red, owned by Rick Pitino's Celtics
Pride Stable, continues to work forwardly at Gulfstream Park for
trainer Nick Zito. The late-striding son of Runaway Groom went 5
furlongs in 1:00 2/5 Sunday as Zito continues to get him ready for
the first major goal of his sophomore season, the Florida Derby
March 13 . . . Real Quiet, hero of last year's Kentucky Derby and
Preakness, zipped 5 furlongs in :58 4/5 at Santa Anita Saturday as
trainer Bob Baffert aims him toward the New Orleans Handicap at
Fair Grounds Feb. 7. General Challenge, an undefeated
California-bred in Baffert's hands, went 1 1/8 miles in 1:51 3/5 as
he readies for the Santa Catalina Jan. 31 . . . Baffert unveiled
another outstanding 3-year-old as Finder's Gold captured a $47,000
allowance race at Santa Anita Sunday. A son of Seeking the Gold,
Finder's Gold made a steady gain to overtake the front-runners and
score by 2 1/2 lengths at 4-5 under Stevens. The time for the mile
and one-16th was 1:43 3/5. Owned by the Golden Eagle Farm, Finder's
Gold had finished third in his Dec. 26 debut, behind the highly
regarded Cape Canaveral, and appears to be one of Baffert's most
promising young horses.

TYSON SHOW WAS NO KNOCKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a lot of hand-wringing over Mike Tyson these days. His
crude, often violent spasms demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt
that civility is an unattainable goal.
</P>
<P>
   He will never be reasonable, much less classy, but Tyson
defenders are quick to bring up his difficult background to explain
away his curious displays of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   His cursing at reporters, most notably WFAN's Russ Salzberg,
during a satellite feed designed to promote last Saturday's fight
against Francois Botha was not the worst thing in the world.
Aggressiveness is good in the world of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   No, the worst thing for Tyson would be to become boring. He
still has a punch; he proved that by knocking out Botha in the
fifth round with one strong right hand. And Tyson is still crazy.
He exploded at the end of the first round, trying to break Botha's
arms after the bell. The lunacy required police intervention.
</P>
<P>
   But his boxing skills, always dubious, are now glaringly
lacking. By all accounts, he looked aged and rusty. Botha had Tyson
beaten in the first four rounds before, by his own admission, Botha
got cocky and careless. A better fighter would have brought out the
worst in Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's ability to attract middle-of-the-road fight fans also
has diminished. When compared with some other Tyson fights, the
pay-per-view take for Tyson-Botha was off by more than 50 percent.
The first Tyson-Evander Holyfield fight attracted 1.6 million
pay-per-view buys; the second generated a staggering 1.99 million
buys. Tyson-Botha managed only 750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drop, Showtime vice president Jay Larkin said he was
happy with the numbers, saying this was still the most-watched
fight in the last 20 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I be happier with 800,000 or a million or 1.5 million?
Sure, I would be ecstatic,'' Larkin said. ``But no other fighter
can get 750,000, and we are very comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin said promotion for the fight suffered because of the
timing. The holiday season tapped out some potential viewers, and
the swirl of NBA news _ a settlement in the lockout, the retirement
of Michael Jordan _ knocked the fight off the front pages.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Tyson, in all his raw glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyson is who he is,'' Larkin said. ``Nobody goes to him for
Bible class or Miss Manners. He is the first one to tell you
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The sad part is that no one is really interested anymore. With
no one else to fight _ does anyone really want to see Andrew Golota
and Tyson kill each other in the ring, with a subsequent riot more
than likely? _ Tyson has become a textbook example of what not to
do in life.

   National overnight numbers from 44 markets showed CBS and Fox

earned a 26.6 rating and 48 share for Broncos-Jets, a 6 percent
jump from last year's AFC game, which was televised by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Fox wasn't able to sustain such momentum from its coverage of
Vikings-Falcons. The NFC game received a 26.1 rating and 52 share
in the national overnights.
</P>
<P>
   The drop-off at the end of the game was staggering; viewers
switched to CBS almost immediately to watch Billy and the Jets.

A DOUBLE COUP BY THE KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can almost hear them chuckling at Madison Square Garden. Not
only do the Knicks have Latrell Sprewell. Even better, Pat Riley
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   There is unrelenting hatred between the Knicks and Heat,
personified by Riley and spreading from boardroom to benches. We
saw that last spring when Alonzo Mourning and Larry Johnson squared
off in the playoffs, Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy swung from
Mourning's leg like a Skip-It, and players took turns delivering
throat-cutting signals.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Knicks are adding the talented if volcanic Sprewell to
an already-interesting mix. And Riley, the man who stiffed the
Knicks to head south to Florida leaving a trail of faxes and broken
promises, the man who vigorously pursued Sprewell and spent more
effort and time on the matter than anyone else, ends up with
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   As they say in hockey, this was a 4-pointer for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think Warriors general manager Garry St. Jean will get a
little something in the mail from the Knicks? He should. St. Jean
has been a veritable juggler the last six months, tossing about
various offers for his coach-strangler. He could have sent him
almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But he couldn't get what he wanted from Miami, Indiana, or San
Antonio. Salary-cap rules or differences of opinion got in the way.
The Knicks agreed to part with two players, small forward Chris
Mills and shooting guard John Starks, neither of whom was starting
at the end of last year. They'll survive. And smirk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Riley really wanted him,'' said Celtics GM Chris
Wallace. ``He put the most work into this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Division just got a little tougher. Sprewell and
Allan Houston will form a dynamic 1-2 punch to balance the inside
game of LJ and Patrick Ewing. We may see New York go to a
three-guard spread the way it did much of last year. The Knicks
also have added underachiever Marcus Camby, who, we all know, has
talent there somewhere. They still need to address their point
guard situation, but they will be a better team than they were last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' window may be closing, but Sprewell's arrival will
keep it open for another year or two or maybe even raise it. Yes,
he's a handful. Yes, he's volatile. Yes, he's playing in Tabloid
Country, where there will be unbelievable scrutiny. Yes, the folks
at Page 6 are salivating. Yes, he hasn't played in more than a
year, having served a suspension for a choking P.J. Carlesimo, his
coach at Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has been one of the game's top shooting guards this
decade, maybe even second to You Know Who. (He was a first-team
All-NBA selection at the spot in 1993-94, the full year Jordan
played baseball.) He's only 28.
</P>
<P>
   He has averaged 20.1 points over his six-year career, including
a career-high 24.2 in 1996-97. He's an excellent defender. He gives
the Knicks some of the toughness they lost when Charles Oakley was
traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He adds some oomph to them,'' Wallace said. ``The thing they
lacked was a guy who could get off his own shot, and he can do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And in New York, he'll also be just one of many stars in the
Knicks' firmament, not merely the most notorious. This is a team,
after all, that had Anthony Mason and now has Johnson, neither one
a choir boy. This is just a hunch, but you may see Sprewell turn
into George Sanders before your eyes, given the unprecedented
attention he'll get. He can afford little else.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of interest in Sprewell showed conclusively that the
NBA is a league in which people forgive and forget, moreso if the
individual is a 20-point scorer who can get you closer to a
championship. Sprewell had no shortage of suitors. Larry Bird would
love to have him; what does that tell you?
</P>
<P>
   It tells you that however repulsive and sickening the events of
15 months ago were _ and there were two within a half-hour _ a team
such as New York will take a chance and take the inevitable heat.
It tells you that for every coach who decried Sprewell's despicable
behavior, there was another willing to rehabilitate the recidivist.
</P>
<P>
   It tells you that there's a whole new Jordan-free landscape out
there and New York, already a contender, immediately becomes a more
viable one with Sprewell. And it tells you that revenge is still
very much alive in the NBA, in the boardrooms as well as on the
court.

TV COP DRAWS ON HIS ROOTS IN `TURKS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARC McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ William Devane has based roles on the Kennedys
and suburban slime and other assorted guys good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Now for inspiration he can turn to his family roots. In his
latest turn on television, ``Turks,'' Devane plays a Chicago police
sergeant, but in reality he is playing his uncle, a police officer
for more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Francis E. Devane died in August 1997 at the age of 88. He
started out as a patrolman in the Albany Police Department in 1941,
did a stint in the Navy during World War II and was a captain when
he retired in 1972. He was Bucky to friends, and, for some reason,
Uncle Bob to the other side of the Devane clan.
</P>
<P>
   As for incorporating real life experience into acting roles,
it's more of the little things, attitude mostly. ``You just draw it
out of yourself,'' Devane said.
</P>
<P>
   You may see snippets of Uncle Bob, or Bucky, Devane in his
nephew in ``Turks,'' a midseason CBS drama that premieres at 9 p.m.
EST Thursday (check local listings). As Sgt. Joseph Turk, Devane
plays the level-headed, good-hearted leader of a squad room and
family, both of which can descend into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   This is not new ground. Devane, whose name is the one in
Hollywood most often linked with ``straight-shooter,'' will tell
you himself we've seen a lot of this before. There is the
close-knit Irish Catholic family, the patriarch cop, his
religiously devout wife, his two cop sons and a third who may or
may not go bad. The guys even play hoops before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But television doesn't have to cover new territory, although it
would be nice once in a while. What it does have to do is cover old
territory well, which ``Turks'' does.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know it's good? Because if it wasn't, Devane would
say so. He's that kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   In this season of the Irish we've seen ``Trinity'' (NBC) and
``To Have &AMP; to Hold,'' both Irish cop shows that debuted and sank.
In its pilot episode, ``Turks'' was able to cover a lot of ground
in both the characters' personal and professional arenas, and,
unlike ``Trinity,'' did not leave viewers spinning and confused.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Devane, the sister of the actor, said that she saw a little
bit of Uncle Bob/Bucky Devane in the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see his definite love and caring for his fellow human
beings,'' she said. ``He was a great guy. He was one who was loved
by his fellow members on the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``He watched out for all of us; not just his kids _ he had four
_ but the other Devanes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Bob was the one who helped oversee the four generations of
Devanes. He couldn't be there all the time to stop ``Willie'' from
getting into trouble, so much trouble, Pat Devane said, that two
neighborhood matrons told his mother that ``he will be the first
one executed in the electric chair.''
</P>
<P>
   Devane's Sgt. Joseph Turk is loved but troubled. He is in a
marriage that clings to comfort after passion has long left the
station. Two of his kids followed their father's path onto the
force, but one could be facing serious charges for sticking to his
values. The third brother is the brain at a fancy college, but even
though he's not patrolling the streets, he may be in the greatest
danger of all.
</P>
<P>
   Mom has retreated to the church, and dad to the local tavern
(don't miss a very funny opening scene in which two stickup men
could not have picked a worse bar to hit). Joe may or may not enter
into a relationship with Ginny the waitress. He warns her that even
if he does, he would never leave his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Seen all this before? Sure you have. But with ``Turks,'' it is
comfortable and good, and like a good CD, worth enjoying again.

BOLDLY GO WHERE NO CHEF HAS GONE BEFORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Recipe included) 
 
By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is the Emeril of TV outer space.
</P>
<P>
   Each week on ``Star Trek: Voyager,'' chief cook Neelix prepares
meals for his fellow lost-in-space crew members _ Heart of Targ for
Lt. Torres, Borg Tricorder Pie for Seven of Nine, Welsh rarebit for
Capt. Janeway.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny Talaxian also serves as the ship's morale officer,
kickin' up a notch the moods of those on board the USS Voyager.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time before he, like Emeril, got a book
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek Cookbook'' (Pocket Books, $20), published this
month, was written in the persona of Neelix by Ethan Phillips _ the
actor behind the epicurean alien _ and William J. Birnes.
</P>
<P>
   In this 317-page paperback, Neelix shares recipes for the
Voyager crew's favorite dishes and offers trivia on the culinary
likes and dislikes of characters from the original ``Star Trek''
series, ``Star Trek: Next Generation'' and ``Star Trek: Deep Space
Nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Recipes for their much-loved meals are included, too.
</P>
<P>
   Learn how to make Capt. Kirk's Plomeek Soup, his version of the
Vulcan delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   And Azna, a dish frequently eaten by ``Deep Space Nine's''
Jadzia Dax.
</P>
<P>
   For a behind-the-scenes look at the ``Star Trek'' realm's
cuisine, Neelix turns to Alan Sims, property master for ``Voyager''
and ``Next Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims tells all about food props, revealing that the Klingon food
``gagh,'' which is supposed to look like live worms, is actually
udon noodles dyed with soy sauce. He also offers tips on how to
re-create Quark's Bar, the popular watering hole on ``Deep Space
Nine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek Cookbook'' will surely be a hit with die-hard
Trekkers. While a few of the recipes are pure sci-fi fantasy, like
the one for Tricorder Pie, most are earthly adaptations of dishes
found in the ``Star Trek'' realm.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at Helena Rozhenko's Rokeg Blood Pie. Rozhenko, who
adopted Worf and raised him on Earth, learned how to make blood pie
the old-fashioned way for her Klingon son. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HELENA ROZHENKO'S ROKEG BLOOD PIE &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 pound veal kidneys &QL; 
2 pounds top round or sirloin beef roast &QL; 
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) salted butter, melted &QL; 
4 garlic cloves, minced &QL; 
2 cups flour &QL; 
1/8 teaspoon garlic salt &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon celery seed &QL; 
2 cups beef gravy or 2 cups beef stew with veggies removed &QL; 
1 pie crust &QL; 
Hot pepper sauce, cayenne pepper or paprika to taste &QL; 
1 12-ounce bottle dark beer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Skin, then wash kidneys. Slice very thin and set aside. Slice
beef very thin. Save any blood. Saut kidneys briefly in a skillet
with melted butter and garlic until kidneys just begin to turn
color, about 2 minutes. Set aside. Roll beef in flour seasoned with
garlic salt and celery seed.
</P>
<P>
   In a greased deep baking pan, arrange meat and kidney slices,
making sure to mix them so flavors blend. Cover with gravy or stew
and any reserved blood. Add hot pepper sauce. Pour in beer.
</P>

THE LIFE OF A MESOAMERICAN GOD: STORY OF QUETZALCOATL TOLD IN
DETAIL

By DAVID D. MEDINA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writing a biography of a mere mortal is hard enough. Imagine
piecing together the life of a god whose staying power has lasted
5,000 years and whose images continue to animate art in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Author Neil Baldwin completed this daunting task after reading
300 books in 10 years, and his effort has paid off. He has produced
an elegant and poetic account of the most important mythological
figure in Mexico and Central America _ Plumed Serpent
(Quetzalcoatl).
</P>
<P>
   The legend of Plumed Serpent began several thousand years before
the birth of Christ and evolved through time as different cultures
adopted the myth to meet their needs. ``This book is the mosaic
mural depicting that vast myth,'' writes Baldwin. And indeed, his
coffee-table-size book is a handsome display of illustrations,
maps, poems and personal observations as well as a concise history
of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Aztecs, it was Plumed Serpent who set the wheel
of history in motion, thus starting a long series of repetitious
cycles. Plumed Serpent was also the namer of all things and gave
humans a new life, blessing them with music, art, science, crafts
and time. ``Plumed Serpent was the performer of miracles, the
supreme magician, the ruler of sorcerers, holding the secret of all
enchantments,'' explains Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   But like many heroes, Plumed Serpent experienced a fall from
grace. In his incarnation as prince of the Toltecs, Plumed Serpent
was tricked by his evil twin into getting drunk and sleeping with
his own sister. Feeling guilty for his transgressions, he began his
``pilgrimage of purification,'' leaving Tula in Central Mexico and
moving east to Cholula and as far as Chichen Itza in the Yucatan
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally reached the sea, Plumed Serpent set sail on a
raft made of snakes that burst into flames and became the planet
Venus. But before he left, Plumed Serpent promised to return in the
year named One Reed, which happened to coincide with 1519, the same
year Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortez arrived in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking Cortez was their beloved god returning, the Aztecs
embraced the invaders, who destroyed the Aztec world within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin deftly takes us on this odyssey, showing us how Plumed
Serpent influenced the civilizations of Mesoamerica: Olmec, Toltec,
Zapotec, Mayan and Aztec. The author examines, through works of art
(some engraved on pyramids and holy relics), how the image of the
protean Plumed Serpent changed. Sometimes he appeared as a snake
and eagle, at other times as a jaguar and monkey.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Quetzalcoatl did not end with the Spanish conquest,
despite the Catholic Church's effort to eliminate all
manifestations of Indian belief. ``The next incarnation of the
Quetzalcoatl story was refracted through a Catholic prism,''
Baldwin writes.
</P>
<P>
   Some colonial friars considered Plumed Serpent a devil; to
others he was a mere mortal and a false god. Dominican priest Diego
Duran theorized that Quetzalcoatl was really the apostle St.
Thomas, who had been sent to spread the gospel to all nations.
Duran asserted that St. Thomas and Plumed Serpent had lived similar
lives as holy men, performers of miracles, artists and leaders of
disciples.
</P>
<P>
   Like the phoenix, Plumed Serpent has risen again and again in
the course of Mexico's history. During the Mexican Revolution of
1910, indigenous peoples viewed rebel leader Emiliano Zapata as a
reincarnation of Quetzalcoatl, their symbol of hope and renewal.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s Mexico sought to find a national identity by
glorifying its ancient past. The government employed three great
muralists, Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro
Siqueiros, to paint Mexico's history on public buildings. Each of
the artists rendered his version of the Plumed Serpent myth.
</P>
<P>
   The legend took on an international appeal in 1925 when English
writer D.H. Lawrence published his novel ``The Plumed Serpent.''
Lawrence became so enthralled with the myth that he declared
himself to be Quetzalcoatl.
</P>
<P>
   As Mexico progresses through the modern world, the vision of
Plumed Serpent persists. New artists continue to explore the
meaning of Quetzalcoatl, and the Maya in southern Mexico still
perform ancient rituals celebrating him. Every tribute can be
likened to a snake shedding its skin in continual acts of renewal.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his book, Baldwin confesses that the many twists
and turns of the legend confused him. But he kept the faith, he
says, and managed to find a way. Readers should be thankful that he
persevered; through his engaging book he brings us closer than ever
to the fantastic legend of Plumed Serpent.

ARMY TO TAKE OVER BAY AREA'S LAST NAVAL FACILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Calif. _ The Navy, once the dominant military presence
in the San Francisco Bay area, will fold its sails here later this
year, turning its last base in the region over to the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of the 13,000-acre Concord Naval Weapons Station,
already downgraded to a detachment of a another base, is scheduled
for Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the move would cost more
jobs. The base's civilian work force was halved last year when it
lost its independent base status and was made a detachment of the
Naval weapons station at Seal Beach in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Some 250 military personnel are stationed at Concord and a much
smaller number of civilians work there.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the base would continue to be a transfer point
for spent nuclear fuel rods from research reactors in Asia. The
transit of the spent radioactive fuel to storage dumps in Idaho has
sparked protests here.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Defense Department said Concord is not now on any
list of bases to be closed, the inter-service transfer increases
the likelihood of its eventual demise as a military post.
</P>
<P>
   Local government officials have long eyed the site for
recreational and commercial development. With its deep-water port
and three rail lines, the site is ideal as a regional
transportation hub.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Flood, a Defense Department spokesman, said such transfers
between services have been relatively common following the
military's last rounds of base closures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually it's done with smaller activities. If a service has a
mission that can be done by another service, then between them they
come up with solutions,'' Flood said. ``It's not out of the
ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen approved the transfer for
financial reasons, according to Pentagon officials. Since
ammunition shipments have declined, Pentagon planners say the Seal
Beach ordnance depot meets the Navy's needs.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Concord site _ supplying ammunition _ will
remain the same under the Army. Base officials said the majority of
the work currently done there is for the Army and Air Force rather
than the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy will retain ownership of the land and port on Suisun
Bay. The Army, already a tenant, will have a long-term lease on the
base, which will be renamed the Military Ocean Terminal Concord.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's 834th Transportation Battalion was relocated to
Concord last year from the closed Oakland Army Base.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Navy personnel will remain at Concord, the October
transfer essentially eliminates the Navy's once-mighty presence in
the San Francisco area. Mare Island closed in 1996, and Alameda
Naval Air Station and Treasure Island Naval Station shut in May
1997.

   MEXICO-POPE _ MEXICO CITY _ With all due respect, John Paul II

many faithful, corporate sponsors of the Pope's trip to Mexico have
used images of the pope and the Virgin Mary in big advertising
campaigns anticipating his arrival. Sabritas, a Pepsi-owned potato
chip maker has wrapped its bags in yellow ribbons promoting the
pope's fourth visit. Those who purchase the chips produced by the
``official collaborator'' are treated to a card inside each bag
that bears the image of the pope or another religious figure. Pepsi
has erected huge billboards declaring ``Mexico. Always Faithful.''
And a television station that will air the pope's visit is running
commercials featuring fictional people -- a man with a flat tire, a
soccer player -- remembering to keep the faith. The church has
defended the use of corporate sponsors and the mass media, saying
it needs to use modern means to raise money and reach its flock.

Some, including the Sierra Club, say the Army Corps of Engineers

disinterested scientists _ even if that means missing the July 1
deadline that Congress set for finishing the plan. Others, such as
the Florida and National Audubon societies, say they trust the
corps to fix the problems. The divide will come into play this week
at a national Everglades conference in Miami, where Sierra will ask
more than 40 other enviro groups to join its call for a scientific
review. The National Park Service isn't supporting Sierra's plea,
even though park scientists had some harsh words for the corps plan
in a recent review. (King, Palm Beach Post).

PUTTING REAL MEAT BACK ONTO THE TABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Remember when you could cut into a
succulent, well-marbled slab of meat _ we're thinking 2-pound
porterhouse _ without any guilt feelings?
</P>
<P>
   Saddled up to the side was a baked potato the size of a
newborn's head, only this baby was loaded with enough real butter
and high-fat sour cream to gag a goat. Next to this was a salad
with full-fat dressing and sprinkled with a fistful of rich cheese
and a half pound of crumbled bacon, the real kind.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's still not exactly OK unless you're on Death Row
already, but sausage maker/cookbook author Bruce Aidells is doing
what he can to put real red meat back on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Just when we were feeling that life itself had gone ``lite,''
Aidells has come through with ``The Complete Meat Cookbook''
(Houghton Mifflin, $35), a handsome, 600-page, user-friendly volume
with color photos good enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
   It's got it all, from the meat-grading system to information on
how to select, buy, store, prepare and eat beef, veal, pork and
lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book focuses primarily on American cuts of meat and
contains many all-American favorites, Aidells also features ethnic
dishes from Mexico, Islamic countries, the Caribbean, South
America, Africa, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Each meat type is paired with a ``master recipe,'' from which
spring many recipe variations.
</P>
<P>
   But even more than a manual of all things meat, this is a meaty
manifesto that aims to dispel the myths, to help us shun the guilt
and to help us again enjoy what we've really wanted all along.
</P>
<P>
   In some quarters, meat is the big bugaboo. High in fat and
cholesterol, some see meat as death on a plate. If that isn't
enough, some also have been programed to believe that simply
craving a big ol' steak is socially incorrect. Let us not even get
into the whole veal thing.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, a chunk of juicy red meat is one of the tastiest,
most satisfying things you can eat.
</P>
<P>
   And meat producers have kowtowed to these feelings and
perceptions, producing a leaner meat, which itself produces
preparation problems.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps red meat is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude is it never went away,'' said Aidells, who started
making sausage in his kitchen 20 years ago. He now has a company in
California that churns out 100,000 pounds of gourmet sausage a
week. (Locally, his sausage is available at Sam's stores.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Meat eaters are a huge group. I've got some numbers from the
Beef Board. About a quarter-billion Americans (that's pretty much
America's population) eat some beef at least every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you're talking about is the fashionable crowd
getting back to the pleasures of a porterhouse,'' said Aidells, now
on a nationwide tour promoting ``The Complete Meat Cookbook.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the book are many.
</P>
<P>
   Many people never learned how to select and prepare meat. Some
knew how, but forgot.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in about the past 20 years, the grading of meat has
changed. It's generally leaner (remember the ``lite'' thing?). And
with less fat, meat is less forgiving for the sloppy cook or for
the good cook who makes a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Good meat cookery today requires more science.
</P>
<P>
   Aidells trained as a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life doesn't always follow a straight path,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   He has a Ph.D. in endocrinology, which very, very basically is
the study of glands that secrete hormones.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 years ago, Aidells found himself doing cancer research
in London, where high cuisine is ``bangers and mash,'' a repast of
mashed potatoes with sausages that taste like sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   ``So one night, I thought it would be nice to make a batch of
sausage. I already was an inspired amateur cook. In England it was
a survival technique,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not much later, back home in Oakland, Calif., the cancer
research money was drying up and Aidells started moonlighting
making sausage for a friend who had just opened a charcuterie.
</P>
<P>
   From there he became chef at an all-chicken restaurant in
Berkeley, a place called Poulet (what else?).
</P>
<P>
   He continued to make sausage for a few friends and small
restaurants. It grew, and his company now makes more than two dozen
varieties of gourmet sausage sold nationwide. Generally, it goes
for about $5 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Aidells, 52, grew up in Los Angeles. He said the food he was
reared on was just like the stuff most baby-boomers endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom was a convenience cook,'' he said. ``Dad was just
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me what kind of smells we had in the kitchen when I
was a kid,'' he said. ``The smell I remember from life as a kid was
dry onion soup mix. It went into everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with that, boxed macaroni and cheese dinner was one of the
basic food groups, and pork chops were cooked to the consistency
and the taste of hockey pucks, lest anyone get the dreaded
trichinosis.
</P>
<P>
   Aidells said that overcooking meat continues to be the most
common mistake of home cooks. Most recipes cook by time, but there
are too many variables: the type and size of pan, the stove, the
thickness of the meat and the temperature of the meat before
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that no meat cook should be without an instant-read
digital thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's indespensable,'' Aidells said. They are widely available
for $10 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   Aidells has written or collaborated on nine books, primarily
about meat, including ``Flying Sausages,'' ``Real Beer and Good
Eats'' and ``Hot Links and Country Flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a contributing writer/editor for the meat and chicken
sections in a recent update of the ``Joy of Cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Major sections of his latest book detail the history of meat in
the human diet, meat grading, how to shop, the differences in meat
today and how to cook various cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Helpful tips include: overlooked but delicious cuts; a lexicon
of meat lingo; how to read meat labels; and salting, also known as
koshering, which makes many meats more flavorful and juicy. The
book also contains recipes for more than 30 meat rubs and 30 meat
marinades.
</P>
<P>
   There are extensive cooking charts and diagrams detailing
cooking techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes are clear and well-detailed.
</P>
<P>
   Each recipe includes tells you how many it serves. It also tells
you if this recipe is good if you're on a budget, in a hurry,
looking for something low fat, something fit for company, or to
serve a crowd, if it rewarms well, or is comfort food, makes for
great leftovers or is a ``two for one'' recipe, which is something
designed to be turned into something else the next day.

PAXTON'S AN ACTOR WITH `A SIMPLE PLAN' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The day after ``A Simple Plan'' screened for critics
at the Toronto Film Festival, Bill Paxton was hopeful but concerned
about how the movie was being received by critics.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unwritten law that actors and film makers don't directly
ask interviewers how they liked a picture. It avoids awkward
situations. But there is obviously plenty of plain-spoken Texan
left in Fort Worth-born-and-raised Paxton, so he just up and asked
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The positive response pleased him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie's got a lot of great themes in it,'' said an
enthusiastic Paxton, who was wearing oval, rose-colored sunglasses,
even though we were in his hotel room. ``It's definitely a
cautionary tale. I feel like we really milked the root about as
much as we could. The movie is almost as much Eugene O'Neill as it
is `Deliverance.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all exaggeration. ``A Simple Plan`` has the body of a
thriller and the mind of a deeply introspective morality tale.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton plays Hank Mitchell, a respected, responsible family man
in a classic small town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of George Bailey-esque,'' Paxton said, referring to
the hero of `It's a Wonderful Life.'``
</P>
<P>
   Out in the woods with his ne'er-do-well brother, Jacob (Billy
Bob Thornton), and Jacob's low-life alcoholic pal Lou (Brent
Briscoe), Hank stumbles across a crashed plane with a dead pilot
and a bag of money. A big bag.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming they will turn the money in, Hank is surprised when
Jacob and Lou insist on keeping the boodle. Hank ultimately relents
_ a decision that leads him, his wife (Bridget Fonda) and Jacob
into an ever-deepening whirlpool of danger and moral compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood doesn't trust thrillers that make people think, and
Paramount has been concerned about the potential of ``A Simple
Plan'' from the beginning. The movie went through several actors,
directors and budget cuts before it got made.
</P>
<P>
   After the well-received Toronto screenings in September,
Paramount played hide-and-seek in releasing the movie. It came out
in a few cities in mid-December and did well, reaching box office
top-20 status even though it was in just 80 theaters nationwide.
After weeks of waffling, the studio is finally releasing it to the
rest of the country Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the fuss over what was once considered a hot property?
After all, the book, a dark thriller by Scott B. Smith, became a
fast best seller in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio wanted to keep the budget way down on this picture
because it's a high-risk movie for them,'' Paxton said. ``They
wanted to make just a taut thriller but got kind of more out of it.
But I think now they feel they have what could be a real commercial
movie.``
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the studio was smart to hold back. ``A Simple
Plan'' appeared on many critics' 1998 top 10 lists and has been
nominated for a number of awards _ most for Thornton's supporting
role.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadcast Film Critics named it Best Picture of the Year,
and it has a good chance of picking up some Oscar nominations Feb.
9. Because of its late release, it's likely that ``A Simple Plan''
still will be in theaters then, able to benefit if those
nominations come through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Billy and Brent are both Academy Award performances,''
Paxton said of his co-stars.
</P>
<P>
   But because his role is less showy _ an ordinary man _ it is
really Paxton who has the tougher part that carries the film. He
has to play a smart guy making some, in retrospect, dumb
mistakes.Yet they can't seem so dumb at the time. The character
does some terrible things, but he must remain sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very hard part,'' he acknowledged. ``He gets in this
congress with these confederates who are `Oh my God.' He thinks he
can control them, and he can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon Hank finds his whole life out of control, and he feels like
fate, or at least the law, is sure to close in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one point where I think my character almost wants to
go, `I did it, I did it,'' Paxton said, raising his voice. ``
`Please, God, help me, take me away, I don't want to go through
this anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   He grinned over his impromptu performance.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton seems as unpretentious and laid-back as movie stars come.
On this day it was partly the blue jeans, work shirt and brown
boots. But it has more to do with his easygoing attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is just incredible,'' Charlize Theron said in an
interview last month. She co-stars with Paxton in ``Mighty Joe
Young.'' ``He's probably the nicest guy you'll ever meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from being extremely talented and creatively bringing so
much to table, he's a regular guy. And yet he's kind of this
prince. He's like the cowboy on the white horse. He's just a
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   (Paxton was also impressed with Theron's talent and sex appeal.
``She'll make you do the monkey dance, that's for sure,'' he said
in apparent awe.)
</P>
<P>
   Paxton, 43, has been a long time coming to stardom. He was still
in his teens _ during which he was known as Wild Bill Paxton
despite often being sickly and bedridden _ when he left Texas for
New York and then Hollywood, trying to break into acting.
</P>
<P>
   He got his film start 25 years ago, working as a set dresser on
such Roger Corman films as ``Big Bad Mama.'' As late as 1981 he was
a set decorator on a movie.
</P>
<P>
   He became an increasingly familiar supporting player, slowly
getting better roles in better films. A breakthrough role came in
``Aliens'' (1986), in which his borderline-hysterical performance
as a trooper feeling doomed by yuckie aliens made the line,
``That's it, man, game over'' part of cult-film lore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was almost another decade before he was getting star
billing in big films.
</P>
<P>
   Although he enjoys doing the big flashy films like ``Twister,''
small, thoughtful films like ``A Simple Plan'' are much closer to
Paxton's heart. As an actor, he finds the characters much more
interesting, and feels such films have something to say. Among his
favorite movies are the 1992 character-study thriller, ``One False
Move'' (in which he starred with Thornton), and 1997's
``Traveler,'' a portrait of backwoods con men that he also
produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like making entertaining movies,'' he said of the big-budget
films. He quickly added, ```A Simple Plan' is a very entertaining
movie. Pound for pound, you get a lot of bang for your buck.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio didn't want to include some of the dark events from
the ending of the book in the film. But Paxton believed sticking to
the story was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the point,'' he said. ``You have to take an idea to
its conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxton read the book five years ago when his dad, John Paxton,
who has a bit part in the movie as a confused farmer, told him he
should play the role of Hank. At that time, before his starring
role in ``Twister'' and major supporting roles in ``The Evening
Star,'' ``Apollo 13'' and ``Titanic'' finally gave him star
recognition, Paxton figured there was no way he would ever get the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed I would get to play this part,'' he said.
``Only in my wildest dreams. I knew it was a perfect part but I'd
never get to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``A Simple Plan'' had gone through the familiar
Hollywood pre-production hell, including other directors and
actors, years had passed and Paxton was a star. Still, after he was
signed to do it (with director John Boorman), the film was canceled
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, the cruelness of fate. I got set to do it, and now
they are not going to make the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paxton pushed, and with a greatly cut budget ($16 million)
and new director, Sam Raimi, the film was finally made.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton hopes ``A Simple Plan'' will add to the respect audiences
have for his abilities. ``Twister,'' ``Titanic'' and ``Mighty Joe
Young'' are not the films for which he wants to be remembered, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell ya, for me, when I got to do `A Simple Plan,' I said,
I've finally got my boxed set now. I'd like to one day put out a
box of `A Simple Plan,' `One False Move' and `Traveler.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have three. Three means it wasn't a fluke; you
had enough in you to go the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   After a quarter-century and 40-plus films, maybe Paxton can stop
worrying about that.

SOME RECIPES FROM THE `COMPLETE MEAT COOKBOOK'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some sausage recipes from Aidell's ``Complete Meat
Cookbook.'' People intimidated by the idea of making sausage should
remember that sausage is nothing but chopped-up meat and spices.
</P>
<P>
   Also it should be noted that there is no hard and fast recipe
for sausage. Anything and everything goes. It is a personal thing.
Be daring. Experiment. Have fun. It's unlikely that you will fail,
but if you do, you can always give it to the dog or an ex-spouse.
</P>
<P>
   SAGE AND PEPPER PORK SAUSAGE (MASTER RECIPE)
</P>
<P>
   Yields 3-4 pounds
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 pounds lean pork butt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound fat trimmed from pork butt and/or pork back fat, which
the butcher probably has in the back
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried sage
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon light or dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely chopped onions, blanched for five minutes and
drained
</P>
<P>
   1 cup drained and cooled cooked wild rice (optional filler)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cold water
</P>
<P>
   Using a food processor: Cut the meat and fat into 3/4-inch to
1-inch cubes, spread out on a tray or roasting pan and place it in
the freezer for about 10 minutes to firm it up and make it easier
to chop. Put the food processor bowl and blade in the freezer as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Set up the processor and add about one pound, or about
one-third, of the meat. Pulse to form a coarse grind, about
3/8-inch or about the size of a garbanzo bean. Refrigerate each
batch after processing.
</P>
<P>
   Process the fat the same way, only smaller, about 1/4-inch, or
about the size of petit pois peas.
</P>
<P>
   Toss everything into a large bowl and mix with your hands. The
idea is to get all the spices distributed, but do not overmix to
the point that the fat begins to melt.
</P>
<P>
   Make a small patty and fry it over medium heat. Taste and make
necessary adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Sausage can be stuffed into casings or formed into breakfast
patties.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor will mellow and improve if tightly wrapped and
allowed to rest in the refrigerator for a day. It will keep for 2
to 3 days and freezes well for up to three months.
</P>
<P>
   Using a meat grinder: The process is basically the same,
although it's sometimes easier if the meat is cut into finger-size
strips to feed it into the grinder.
</P>
<P>
   A grinder is particulary helpful if you plan to stuff your
sausage into casings.
</P>
<P>
   Casings should be soaked, rinsed, soaked and rinsed again to
remove the brine in which they are packed.
</P>
<P>
   Sausage horns, a funnellike device that fits over the grinder
plates, are available at most kitchen ware outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Simply slide several feet of casings over the horn. For 3 pounds
of sausage you will need about 8 feet of casings. Tie the end. It's
good to have some help, to have one person feed the mixture into
the grinder while the other catches and twists the sausage as it is
pushed into the casing.

   Finding equipment
</P>
<P>
   Sausage casings are available in Fort Worth at Klein Meat Co.,
2525 Cullen St. 817-332-4155. Klein sells 60 feet, or enough to
make 20 to 25 pounds of sausage, for $3.75. All-natural hog casings
are packed in a brine and must be washed thoroughly before using.
Kept refrigerated in the brine they will keep for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Hog casings also can be purchased mail-order via the Internet.
Do a search for ``hog casing'' or ``sausage making'' and several
companies will come up.

<P>
   Meat cooking tips
</P>
<P>
   Salt meat before cooking. It will be much more flavorful and
juicy.
</P>
<P>
   Pork should be slightly pink, not white. It is not necessary to
overcook pork to prevent trichinosis. Trichinae are killed at 137
degrees, or medium rare.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to tenderize a tough cut of meat is to braise it to
stew it slowly. Do not use chemical meat tenderizers or buy
``tenderized steaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Do not baste a roast. It doesn't keep the meat moist and it
washes away the seasoning. The trick is not to overcook the roast.
</P>
<P>
   USDA is the only federal grading system for meat. Terms like
``Butcher's Prime,'' ``Market Choice'' are misleading fantasy meat
grades invented by retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Don't buy precut meat for stew. It is more expensive and you
never know what kind of cut it was. Buy a piece of chuck and cut it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Do no parboil spareribs. Parboiling toughens the meat and drains
it of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring lamb'' is available year round.
</P>
<P>
   Pan-broiled lamb chops are better than those broiled in the
oven. Home broilers don't get hot enough and cause the meat to
steam.

 &HT;    Feminist ideal breeds unhappiness, author says
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've gone too far, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Women who bought into the feminist ideal _ that they could have
sex with whoever they wanted, pursue any career they wanted and put
childbearing on hold as long as they wanted _ were sold a bill of
goods, says author Danielle Crittenden.
</P>
<P>
   In her new book, ``What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us: Why
Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23),
Crittenden says women should be seeking happiness in the family,
not just equality in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are freer and more equal than any women in history,
you still see a lot of unhappiness,'' Crittenden argues. ``Women
want work, children and family, but have no idea as to how to make
it fit together.''
</P>
<P>
   Crittenden, 35, is part of a generation that's grappling with
women's place in a world that was partly shaped by their feminist
mothers. She's founding editor of the Women's Quarterly, a
conservative newsletter published by the Independent Women's Forum
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Her post-feminist ideas, though conservative, may not be that
far right _ considering that even feminist-aligned President
Clinton, in his State of the Union address Tuesday, advocated tax
subsidies for families when one parent stays home with the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton's tax break never becomes reality, women should
swap their briefcases for baby bottles if they want to lead
fulfilling lives as wife and mother, Crittenden thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Women's troubles began when they bought into the feminist notion
that they could do anything a man could, she says. With that belief
came liberal attitudes about sex, which enabled men to sow their
oats without the commitment of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few men who want to take on the responsibility when
there are so many women who are giving it away,'' Crittenden says.
</P>
<P>
   But if women would adopt more traditional attitudes about
premarital sex, like their grandmothers did, it would give couples
a greater incentive to get married.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men can be corralled into marriage. They are guided in this by
women,'' the author says.
</P>
<P>
   Once the knot is tied, Crittenden thinks starting a family, not
a career, should be the priority. For one thing, that avoids the
fertility problems some women experience when they try to have
children after 35.
</P>
<P>
   More than 61 percent of married women with children younger than
3 worked outside the home in 1997, compared with 33 percent in
1975, according to the Census Bureau. But many of those working
mothers feel guilty and would stay at home if they could,
Crittenden asserts.
</P>
<P>
   But they're afraid to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from the devaluation we've done of women who stay home
and take care of their kids, marriage today is so insecure. Women
feel it's very dangerous to quit your job if you cannot count on
your husband to stay with you,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   They should stay home anyway, the author argues, for the sake of
the kids. At least until the youngest child enters school.
</P>
<P>
   Crittenden admits she would never discourage her 7-year-old
daughter from pursuing her dreams. But she would give her some
heartfelt advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a woman wants an enormous career like a surgeon, maybe you
shouldn't have kids. Right now, we're not taught to think in those
terms,'' she says. Decisions lead to consequences.
</P>
<P>
   As for her 5-year-old son, Crittenden says she will raise him to
understand that he must support his family on his income, like her
husband, journalist David Frum, does, so his wife won't have to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Crittenden says she lives the life she is espousing. She married
Frum when she was 25. They had their first child three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Although her newsletter has gained public attention during its
four years in publication, causing Crittenden to appear as guest
and commentator on television and radio programs, she says she
maintains a part-time work schedule, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. five days a
week.
</P>
<P>
   She also cooks dinner every night and doesn't seek an
egalitarian relationship with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sitting there with pen and paper taking note of what
he does,'' Crittenden said. ``He does take out the garbage _ with
some nagging.''

 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The world is not going to end on January 1, 2000 AD.
 &HT;    If God planned to end the world on the 2,000th anniversary of
the birth of Jesus, you would not be reading this column. Luke's
Gospel says Jesus was born ''in the time of Herod, king of Judea,''
who died in 4 BC. Experts think Jesus' life began in 6 or 7 BC and
that we are really in the year AD 2006.
 &HT;    However, assume the world will end in less than a year. What
would you do differently? How would you use this brief time that is
left?
 &HT;    Last year I faced two life-threatening illnesses and literally
had my life saved twice by surgery. I felt the brush of eternity's
wing on my cheek. So I find myself thinking more about how to best
use the limited time I have left, whether months or years.
 &HT;    My mind goes back to 1983 when my father died of lung cancer at
age 66. He was not a religious man. He never went to church. For
years he had fought verbal battles with each of his three adult
children over matters that seem trivial as I look back.
 &HT;    Yet he wanted to make peace with each of us. Before he died, he
gave each of us part of our inheritance. He had never been more
loving as he was in those last months. His deteriorating body led
him to return to a kind of pure love for each of us.
 &HT;    I traveled across the country to spend some days with him, and
tried to lead him to make a reconciliation with God, as well. But
he resisted: ''It's too late, Mike,'' he said to me in a hoarse
whisper the last time I saw him.
 &HT;    We hugged and I left with a joy about our personal
reconciliation, but with sadness over his attitude toward his
maker.
 &HT;    How can one who is now lost to God, become found?
 &HT;    It's not enough to return to churchianty. There is something
superficial about most religious services. They reach only a layer
or two down, particularly to a troubled soul.
 &HT;    What I recommend is an extraordinary workbook and course that
has now been taken by 2.5 million people: ''Experiencing God:
Knowing and Doing the Will of God'' written by Henry Blackaby and
Claude King. Here is how it begins:
 &HT;    ''Jesus said, `This is eternal life: that they may know you, the
only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent' (John 17:3).
The heart of eternal life and the heart of this study is for you to
KNOW GOD and to KNOW JESUS CHRIST whom He has sent. Knowing God
does not come through a program or a method. It is a relationship
with a Person. It is an intimate love relationship with God.
 &HT;    ``Through this relationship, God reveals His will and invites
you to join Him where He is already at work. When you obey, God
accomplishes through you something only He can do. Then you come to
KNOW GOD in a more intimate way by EXPERIENCING GOD at work through
you.''
 &HT;    This is an immensely encouraging concept -- that it is possible
to actually know the creator and what his plan is for our life.
 &HT;    ''Experiencing God'' is a course that has had a catalytic force
in the lives of millions. It is laced with Scriptural quotes and
practical, step-by-step exercises that lead one into a deeper
relationship with God. It says, ''The Bible is God's Word for you.
Scriptures will be your source of authority for faith and
practice.''
 &HT;    It is broken up into 30 to 60 minutes of study each day and
participants are encouraged to join a small group of 6-10 people
who take the 13-week course together. The workbook has space to
write answers to draw out one's reflections on Scripture.
 &HT;    For example, we read Jesus saying to Peter and other disciples,
''Follow me.'' He gave no detailed map, but asks people to trust
him. Read John 5:17 and 5:19-20, and write answers to these
questions: Who is always at work? How much can the Son do by
himself? What does the Son do?
 &HT;    To order ''Experiencing God'' for $11.95 call 800 458-2772.

 MR. DARWIN'S SHOOTER

 &UR; UNNATURAL SELECTION
</P>
<P>
   BY EMILY BARTON
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IN his engaging novel ``Mr. Darwin's Shooter,'' the Australian
writer Roger McDonald imagines the life of Charles Darwin's
assistant, Syms Covington, an ordinary sailor who provided the
scientist with much of the evidence on which he based his work.
Through Covington's view of Darwin, McDonald examines the
ramifications of the theory of evolution, thus allowing the reader
to reconsider how much Darwinism has influenced the modern
worldview.
</P>
<P>
   When the novel begins, in 1828, Covington is the 12-year-old son
of a Bedford horse butcher. His primary religious text has been
``The Pilgrim's Progress,'' which the young Covington takes ``with
the seriousness of a promise and a passion of loyalty in his
bones.'' The boy soon falls in with a charismatic sailor and
preacher, John Phipps, who persuades him to explore the seas in a
kind of Victorian imitation of Bunyan's Pilgrim. When Phipps's band
of boy sailors boards their third ship, the Beagle, Covington
recognizes that the best position would be to work for the ship's
``gentleman,'' Mr. Darwin. Covington takes on his responsibilities
as Darwin's servant without comprehending the nature of Darwin's
work, and over the next five years makes copies of the notes that
will become ``The Origin of Species.'' More important, he prepares
many of Darwin's specimens, a task McDonald describes in all its
complexity: ``With every specimen he ever packed away in its bed of
cotton he hung over it this moment of saying farewell; he dressed
the feathers that were well dressed before; perfected every curve;
finished caressingly and put his bird tenderly down, as he hoped to
be shriven himself when his time came.'' It is no small irony that
a man of faith should be ``after a year the match of his master in
this regard -- a meticulous plunderer.''
</P>
<P>
   As a counterpoint to the journey to the Galapagos, McDonald
interweaves chapters in the late 1850's and early 1860's, when
``The Origin of Species'' was first published and when Covington,
gone deaf from proximity to his bird gun, has settled in Australia.
Mirroring his own apprenticeship to the gentlemanly Darwin, the
gruff, middle-aged Covington takes a delicate young doctor, David
MacCracken, under his wing. Like Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, he
forces MacCracken to listen to his tale of betrayal -- of Darwin's
failure to recognize Covington's contribution to his work, and of
Covington's concern that Darwin's project has been, all along, to
disprove the existence of God.
</P>
<P>
   These chapters yield some of the novel's strongest philosophical
moments. Covington, too nervous to approach the book himself, asks
MacCracken to read the first copy of ``The Origin of Species.'' The
reader experiences an almost visceral thrill in MacCracken's
anticipation: ``His finger went to the tip of his tongue. Wetted,
</P>
<P>
   it returned to the corner of a page. Gripped the paper. Raised
the page to a small curve. Rustle of the page turning, scraping
over. A feeling of sinking through time as the next raft of words
rose up. He felt part of time with a deep contentment and
understanding -- all times past and future as well as this very
particular moment of his lying in this room . . . given the poetry
of existence in such a form.'' Darwin's words appear to the
contemporary audience with the full weight of revelation they must
have held for their first readers.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's prose is uniformly well turned, and even his minor
characters are observed with accuracy and humor. (``Standing in his
blood-brown boots,'' he writes of Covington's father, ``he rocked
back and forth as if hammered to the ground and twanging slightly
with the force of his opinions.'') The ending, in which Covington
makes peace with the differences between his life's project and his
master's, is somewhat pat; but the novel as a whole is so fully
imagined and imbued with intellectual curiosity that one forgives
the momentary oversimplification in its final pages.

 THE MUSIC LESSON

 &UR; STEAL THIS PAINTING
</P>
<P>
   BY SYLVIA BROWNRIGG
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN John Hume and David Trimble won the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize,
some expressed concern that the award had been given prematurely,
that this peace might not stick. On both sides of the divide in
Northern Ireland, there will always be those for whom ``peace at
any price is no peace at all.'' Such, at least, is the view of the
members of the I.R.A. splinter group in Katharine Weber's affecting
and elegant new novel about the dangerous subterfuges of politics
and the healing truths of art.
</P>
<P>
   Set during one of the region's many fragile cease-fires, ``The
Music Lesson'' brings together two incongruous worlds: the rarefied
environment of art-historical scholarship and the extremities of
terrorist politics. Selected -- unknowingly -- as the link between
the two is 41-year-old Patricia Dolan, a specialist in Dutch
painting at the Frick Art Reference Library in New York. Since the
tragic accidental death of her young daughter and her subsequent
divorce, Patricia has been living ``in a permanent state of
anesthesia, a highly functional but sealed-over kind of
detachment.'' Her only remaining emotional tie is to her aging
father, Pete, a retired Boston policeman who raised her on
anti-British sentiment and pride in her Irish roots.
</P>
<P>
   We learn these facts gradually, as Patricia narrates her story
in a series of journal entries written during a stay in a remote
cottage on Ireland's West Cork coast. ``She's beautiful'' is the
novel's arresting opening line, and it turns out that the woman
into whose face Patricia stares with such fascination -- ``Her gaze
catches me, pins me down, pulls me in'' -- is in a painting by
Vermeer called ``The Music Lesson.'' Patricia has been recruited by
an Irish cousin, Mickey O'Driscoll, to take part in an elaborate
plot to ``kidnap'' the painting, which is owned by the Queen, and
hold it for ransom. The law-abiding Patricia has been led into this
adventure by two simultaneous awakenings: of her political ideals
and of a deep passion for fiery young Mickey.
</P>
<P>
   Once the group has seized the painting, Patricia's task is to
guard it in the cottage and await Mickey's further instructions.
Though she has been told to keep to herself, she must have a few
friendly encounters with the neighbors in order not to arouse
suspicion. Weber has a nice touch with these passages, depicting
American-Irish misunderstandings with wry, subtle humor and
portraying the eccentric locals without making them seem overly
cute or quirky. Above all, Weber offers sparely sensual
descriptions of the land itself, and of Patricia's deep response to
it.
</P>
<P>
   As in her highly praised first novel, ``Objects in Mirror Are
Closer Than They Appear,'' whose central character was a
photographer, Weber astutely explores the gap between perception
and reality, both in relationships and in works of art. Patricia
offers reflections on authenticity and reproduction (quoting
liberally from Walter Benjamin) and on the glories of Vermeer,
about whose realism she is rapturously eloquent. Yet Weber's
admirable ambition -- to integrate these complex ideas about art,
politics and love -- is not fully realized, partly because the
political-thriller element sits uneasily with the delicate tone of
the rest. Patricia's account of her passion for Mickey also remains
somewhat sketchy, so that her falling for this rebel 16 years her
junior, although plausible, seems self-consciously naive. When
Patricia finally realizes that ``Mickey was someone I had invented
for my own needs,'' this does not come as a revelation to the
reader.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the transformation Patricia goes through seems
real -- and moving. She may gain and lose Mickey, along with her
brief belief in the rightness of a violent solution to the
Troubles, but she acquires something much more important in the
process. And, in a satisfying twist, it is the Vermeer that guides
her through these changes. Initially, Patricia feels pale in
comparison with the woman of ``The Music Lesson'': ``I look at my
face in the mirror and it seems far away, indistinct, less real
than hers.'' By the novel's suspenseful, adroitly constructed
close, Patricia is making her own choice of art over politics. ``I
am grateful for her lesson, for what she has taught me about
integrity, and constancy. Through her, I have come to know myself,
and I have begun to understand the world a little better, too.''

CRIME

   Jonathan Kellerman's singular touch with wounded children pays
off royally in BILLY STRAIGHT (Random House, $25.95), a brisk
suspense thriller unburdened by his smug shrink hero, Alex Delaware
(who makes the briefest of cameo appearances here). By comparison,
Kellerman's new protagonist, a Hollywood homicide detective named
Petra Connor, might seem bland, but she is blessedly free of
affectation. She is also warmhearted enough to identify with, as
she frantically scours the city in search of a runaway 12-year-old
boy who witnessed the vicious stabbing of a woman in Griffith Park.
This case quickly draws the media carrion crows when it comes out
that the victim was recently divorced from the popular star of a
television series.
</P>
<P>
   Like Connor, the investigation is competent but strictly by the
book -- and not the reason you're turning the pages so fast. That
distinction goes to the winsome title character and frequent
narrator, a self-taught street kid with an artless affection for
books. Despite having been used and abused most of his life (``Why
do I keep meeting evil, gross, sick people?'' he wants to know),
Billy has developed a sharp intellect and a keen code of ethics,
along with the survival skills that are keeping him one short step
ahead of the press, the murderer and the other creeps on his trail.
The kid is irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   You like hot? The homicide case in Michael Connelly's police
procedural ANGELS FLIGHT (Little, Brown, $25) is so incendiary, the
city of Los Angeles has to call in the F.B.I., Internal Affairs,
the riot squad and the Fire Department to put out the racial flames
when an opportunistic black lawyer who makes a career out of suing
the police is murdered on the eve of a controversial trial. Harry
Bosch, the Hollywood detective in charge of the case, wouldn't wish
it on his worst enemy -- which is O.K., because the guy is already
on his team, assigned by the big brass who would like to see Bosch
go up in smoke himself.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone keeps telling Bosch he's being paranoid; but that,
indeed, is what makes him such a terrific hero. Unlike the
self-promoters on both sides of the racial divide, he has no time
for pretense and no stomach for covering up the realities of race
hatred, whatever the source. ``Deep down, you know it was the
truth,'' he says in a standoff with a black colleague. ``How come
the moment the truth might be uncomfortable people raise the race
card?'' Granted, the case doesn't have to be quite as convoluted as
Connelly makes it. But as the conscience of a city that has not got
over (and how could it?) the naked rage of the 1992 riots and the
O. J. Simpson trial, Bosch is a wonderful old-fashioned hero who
isn't afraid to walk through the flames -- and suffer the pain for
the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a blue moon, a new writer speaks up in a voice that gets
your attention like a rifle shot. Jenny Siler, the 27-year-old
author of EASY MONEY (John Macrae/Holt, $24), has that kind of
voice: clean, direct and a little dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Kerry, the unconventional heroine of this lethal
thriller, is a drug courier schooled in the trade by her father, an
alcoholic social dropout who runs dope out of Key West. (``In the
Keys smuggling has always been a kind of family business, like
farming in the Midwest.'') Allie is making a routine pickup in
Seattle when she gets word of her father's death; but before she
can drive home for the funeral, things start going very wrong. Her
contact is murdered after passing her a computer disk in a sailors'
bar, and Allie, who has no idea that the disk contains secret
information about Vietnam War crimes, finds herself set up for the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   In an intensely vivid piece of writing, Siler sends Allie on a
mad dash in which the visceral thrills of a cross-country manhunt
dissolve into painful reveries about a father's death and a lover's
betrayal. Mind and body racing through scenes of Colorado
mountains, Montana pit stops and Texas bars, Allie looks out on
this alien landscape and sees the sword swallower in a sideshow on
the Coney Island boardwalk, the luminous underwater creatures of a
night dive off Key West. Prodded by the author's seductive voice,
we see it all, too.
</P>
<P>
   Connoisseurs of serial killers will appreciate the gorgeous
imagery of the playwright Gardner McKay's macabre first novel,
TOYER (Little, Brown, $24), in which an ``unimaginable'' lunatic
performs the gruesome surgical procedure of spinal cordotomy on his
victims, cutting off their higher brain functions and leaving them
neurologically drained. The comatose women are arranged like living
corpses, their ruined bodies described as glass figurines, as pale
and broken flowers; one, eerily, as ``a sloop at anchor on a still
night, none of her riding lights lit, swinging slightly on the
tide.'' Unfortunately, McKay is so carried away with the bizarre
beauty of his own writing that he dispenses with the customary
trappings of a logical plot and a believable protagonist. Like the
vacant victims, this one is stunning at first glance but hollow at
the core.
</P>
<P>
   James Sallis is an acquired taste, and, at that, more of an
appetizer than a main course. So long as you read his idiosyncratic
novels about a black private eye from New Orleans named Lew Griffin
as ruminations on an interesting life well lived, you're getting
good value. In BLUEBOTTLE (Walker, $22.95), for instance, Griffin
suffers a temporary loss of sight and memory from the trauma of a
gunshot wound; so, besides the poetic scenery of the city, with its
throbbing music bars and vibrant local characters, there are
thoughtful passages (by way of Malraux, Bob Dylan et al.) on the
ambiguity of time and the lonely terror of being disconnected from
one's identity. Just don't go expecting anything like a coherent
plot, because Sallis's novels aren't really about anything except
themselves.

 &UR; ON THE ROAD, AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   BY ANN DOUGLAS
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Biography at its best involves a love affair, even a marriage,
between author and subject, an arduous, lengthy collaboration in
which the biographer both discovers and receives meaning. As
practiced by Barry Miles in ``Jack Kerouac, King of the Beats,''
however, biography is more like a one-night stand, an act of
exploitation in which the subject loses much of the value that
presumably made the book worthwhile in the first place. Miles, who
has written a good biography of Allen Ginsberg, acknowledges
Kerouac's gift for ``word portraits'' and for capturing the
American experience in prose, crediting him as well with starting
the back-to-nature ``rucksack revolution'' of the 1960's. But the
highest praise a biographer can offer his subject is extensive
research, a commodity in short supply here. Nor does Miles display
much understanding of the life or the work he is examining.
Instead, he frequently trivializes the risks Kerouac took with his
vagrant life style and his writing. ``King of the Beats,'' as the
book's title has it, was an epithet bestowed on Kerouac by a
hostile press, one Kerouac loathed and used only ironically.
Indeed, it is hard to see what motive Miles may have had for this
undertaking, beyond cashing in on the Kerouac revival now under
way. (All of Kerouac's books are back in print; The Atlantic
Monthly and The New Yorker recently featured long excerpts from his
unpublished journals and correspondence.)
</P>
<P>
   Kerouac's life is an intensely American story. Born in 1922 in
Lowell, Mass., to working-class, immigrant French Canadian parents,
he grew up speaking joual, a dialect often unintelligible to
natives of France. He didn't feel altogether comfortable with
English until his late teens, and he spoke joual with his mother
until the end of his life; his later audacious experiments with
language depended on his constant awareness of a different, yet
parallel linguistic universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ti Jean,'' as he was called at home, excelled in school and in
sports, winning a football scholarship to Columbia and arriving
there in 1940, though he dropped out in 1942. In New York in 1944,
he met the other members of the earliest Beat circle -- Ginsberg,
William S. Burroughs, Lucien Carr and Herbert Huncke. Even as he
joined their explorations of the Times Square underworld of
hustlers and junkies, Kerouac remained close to his mother,
Gabrielle, then living in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the publication of his little-remarked debut
novel, ``The Town and the City'' (1950), Kerouac discovered what he
called spontaneous prose, a technique requiring exhaustive,
interminable practice in journal writing and on-the-spot
``sketching'' in words to ready himself for the climactic act of
writing a final draft. ``On the Road'' (1957), written in 1951, was
the first of his experimental works to find a publisher after years
of rejection. Taking bebop as his model, Kerouac labored to perfect
a voice, a style, rather than a particular work; once unleashed,
the style produced its own narrative forms. He felt little more
free to revise his writing than a musician would to replay a gig,
except by way of future performances. Like Charlie Parker, Jackson
Pollock and Marlon Brando in their respective media, in his ``true
story novels'' Kerouac attempted to create an explosively lyrical,
charismatic style, to capture all that the reigning cold war
pieties censured or distorted -- ``the speed and tension and
ecstatic tomfoolery of the age.'' Uncomprehending reviewers
dismissed him, one calling him ``a slob running a temperature.''
</P>
<P>
   Painfully shy, helpless before the media onslaught ``On the
Road'' precipitated and seldom sober, Kerouac tried in vain to
explain that he was ``an artist, old-fashioned, devoted.'' He wrote
out of an abiding romantic identification with America itself,
expressed first as a consuming ambition to explore and record it,
and finally, in the last years before his death of alcoholism in
1969, as a determination to rage, deteriorate and die in its
shelter. He stayed on the job, as Robert Creeley remarked, long
after anyone seemed to be listening.
</P>
<P>
   Kerouac's tragedy is of little interest to Miles, who offers a
fairly perfunctory account of the writer's life and no real
explication of the spontaneous prose ethos, which to Miles means
simply ``not correcting'' one's work. The book also includes
several errors and interpretive misreadings. Pollock and Kerouac
did not hang out at the Cedar Tavern together in 1958, since
Pollock died in 1956. Miles writes that Kerouac's scattings
(``google giggle'' is the example) were typographical errors that
he childishly refused to erase, though, in fact, Kerouac
deliberately expanded vowel sounds, a homage to his native joual.
Nor is it a ``strange switch'' on Kerouac's part to turn to the
third person at the close of ``Maggie Cassady'' (1959); the first
three chapters are in the third person, too.
</P>
<P>
   For Miles, the most important fact about Kerouac is his moral
turpitude. He holds Kerouac directly responsible for the troubled
life of his only child, Jan, who was raised by her mother, Joan
Haverty. By initially denying his paternity, Kerouac ``allowed Jan
to become a junkie at 13.'' When Neal Cassady leaves his wife and
child to go on the road with Kerouac, it is Kerouac's fault as much
as Cassady's. ``The Subterraneans,'' Kerouac's still shockingly
honest novel about his love affair with Aileen Lee, an
African-American, falls short, according to Miles, because Kerouac
did not mention ``the fact that 10 million black people were living
under segregation in the South,'' a sociological point, however
important, utterly at odds with the subjective mood of the
narrative.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; UNDATED: of the narrative.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, unlike Ellis Amburn, another recent, still more
irresponsible biographer, Miles does not treat Kerouac as a
closeted homosexual, despite the obvious conflicts and confusion of
his love life. Miles is right that Kerouac sustained few
relationships and failed many obligations, though he seems unaware
that this failure, revealed in its harshest light, forms a
dominant, agonized theme in all of Kerouac's work. In his own words
a ``strange solitary crazy Catholic mystic,'' Kerouac was a member
of the spiritual underground that formed the counterpoint to the
official religious revivalism of the churchgoing 1950's. Coupledom
was not part of his mission. Like Genet, a writer he admired, he
undertook his adventures the way someone else might enter a
convent.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Kerouac did, as Miles charges, revert to the
ugly anti-Semitic prejudices of his parents, but there is no sense
in this book of how extreme, chronic alcoholism brings out the
worst, but not necessarily the truest, aspects of the drinker's
personality, a fact Kerouac repeatedly acknowledged, describing
himself in the mid-1960's as ``a maniacal drunkard,'' a ``scared .
. . dumbhead loudmouth.'' Nor can Miles explain why so many of
Kerouac's friends and lovers remained loyal to him despite the
abuse they sometimes suffered at his hands. Although a number of
Kerouac's intimates are still very much alive, Miles didn't
interview any of them, relying instead on the interviews he did for
the Ginsberg biography a decade ago. He has never interviewed the
musician David Amram or the writer Joyce Johnson, both Jewish, who
have stated that they experienced no hint of anti-Semitism in their
relationships with Kerouac. Ginsberg saw Kerouac's anti-Semitism at
first hand, yet until his own death in 1997, he held to his
earliest, excited realization about Kerouac: ``If I actually
confessed the secret tenderness of my soul, he would understand
nakedly who I was.'' Kerouac seldom judged; by all accounts,
deliberate malice was foreign to him. In middle age, bitterly
disappointed and drunk, he spewed prejudices the way some people
use profanity. The one pledge he kept was, as he wrote in a letter
of 1961, to be ``free of hypocrisy,'' to tell his readers, in a
language as expressive and fresh as he could make it, everything
about himself and his times.
</P>
<P>
   In his last years, Kerouac realized that his kind of
confessional, all-defenses-dropped, sacrificial romanticism had
been decisively eclipsed by a new mood of skepticism, mockery and
facetiousness, what we today call the post-modern style. Yet in
1965 he predicted that ``some great catastrophe is going to make
people wake up again''; his ethos, based on a love of the
``suffering heart,'' would outlast the ``sneerers'' and
``divisionists.'' It is ironic and unfortunate that his most recent
biographer belongs to the sneerers' party, but Kerouac speaks with
increasing power to all those who read, as he said he wrote, for
``companionship,'' who search for ``the key /

</P>
<P>

   True Tales of Faintly Repulsive Wildlife.

 &UR; WHY GRIZZLIES LOVE TWINKIES
</P>
<P>
   BY ANN FINKBEINER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   My stepdaughter, when she was younger, wept bitterly over the
horrid bulldozer in the city park -- ripping up the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Bunny, in her words. With the years and a doctorate in
entomology, her rhetoric and outlook have changed. Last time she
expressed her views on wildlife, she was focusing a high-powered
microscope on an aphid eating a plant while itself being eaten from
the inside out by a tiny parasitic wasp. Through the aphid's
greenly transparent body, we could see the wasp's buggy little
eyes. I remembered Stephen Jay Gould writing that 19th-century
theologians regarded parasitic wasps as ``the greatest challenge to
the concept of a benevolent deity,'' which I thought put it mildly.
My stepdaughter shrugged: ``The aphids just go right on eating.
They're awfully dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   My stepdaughter will like ``Every Creeping Thing.'' Richard
Conniff, a nature writer, begins by saying that Bunny-izing is
possible only when people are at a remove from nature and don't
know much about it. Nature up close evokes more complicated
feelings. ``Despite the efforts of many earnest and life-affirming
people to persuade me that the vampire bat is our friend . . . I
have never quite overcome the gut feeling that fear of nature is
normal,'' he writes. Then he qualifies that sentiment, ``or perhaps
I should say that fear and love are thoroughly tangled together.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is a series of case studies of the fear/love tangles
between various creatures -- bats, cormorants, porcupines, moles --
and people who, for commercial or academic or personal reasons,
live closely with them. The best case studies are small
self-contained stories. One is about a couple, Steve and Marilynn
French, who observe, from a distance, grizzly bears in Yellowstone
National Park. About 30 years ago, the park closed its garbage
dumps, from which the grizzlies fed, and then shot the grizzlies
that wouldn't stop raiding tourists' Twinkies. Ever since,
naturalists have argued over whether Twinkie-independent (Conniff's
phrase) grizzlies will survive and return to more natural habits,
and the Frenches say they have. Not only did the grizzlies become
better hunters, but the local elk got better at outsmarting them.
Conniff describes a hunt: ``In hot pursuit, the grizzly's mouth was
also open, with a look of pure joy. He flew up the slope and
hurtled in among them, spinning one way and then the other. . . .
The cows were all around him, confusing him, and the calves danced
away just out of reach.'' Steve French says, ``One of those dump
bears woulda had a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Another story is about a conservation officer, David Wingate,
who has single-handedly reconstructed Nonsuch Island in Bermuda,
which after 350 years of settlement had been ``a desert'' of rats,
goats and ``the skeletal remains of the old forest.'' Over the last
40 years Wingate got rid of the rats and goats, restored the forest
and its undergrowth and brought back herons and land crabs. His
reason is personal: he wants a petrel called the cahow -- native to
Nonsuch, thought to be extinct since 1620, but now found in small
numbers -- to come back to live. If he restores their home, maybe
they'll return.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the chapters, however, aren't stories but loosely joined
descriptions of humans and animals; the parties are well matched
for charm, talent and repulsiveness. Grizzlies in Wyoming spend
August eating only moths. The first four-inch baby sandtiger shark
that escapes its embryonic capsule swims around the uterus, rips
open all the other capsules and eats its siblings. Sloths are so
lethargic that they are green with algae; once a researcher who
kept one as a pet smelled ``something like a burning sloth,'' and
found it ``half-asleep on a large electric bulb, with its rear
going up in smoke, and . . . it wanted to stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   On the human side, one researcher who studies the social systems
of mice says he ``spent a sizable part of his career in a darkened,
windowless room,'' occasionally sitting still ``for an extra 20
minutes while a mouse 'had a nap between my trouser leg and me.' ''
Another, before he was killed flying into a cloud-forest
mountaintop, had memorized the songs of over 4,000 bird species.
Another runs a charter service for people who want to catch sharks
with the object of cutting out their jaws and tails as trophies.
The man preparing the home for the cahow loved nature so much that,
as a child, ``he once took a jar of spiders to bed with him, and
his mother found him asleep, covered with webs.''
</P>
<P>
   The last chapter is another story, about the author and a dog he
didn't know. Conniff was in a pasture above the western Irish coast
and saw a sheepdog tearing toward him ``with a crazy, bucketing
speed, and it leaped up at me almost before I had spotted it.'' The
dog, an energetic breed with spookily intelligent eyes, began a
chasing-game with Conniff, drawing him by degrees down toward the
coast, then to the water, then onto the rocks out in the water.
Conniff, only a little afraid, followed, wondering what the dog was
up to. The dog stopped at the last rock, waited for Conniff to
catch up, then plopped down and watched the sunset. Conniff watched
too. When it was over, the dog led Conniff back over the rocks and
up the pasture, and then took off without a goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's a perfect ending to the book, I'm not sure why.
Conniff is a splendid writer -- fresh, clear, uncondescending, and
with never a false step; one can't resist quoting him. His message
is urgent: ``We are in danger of turning what's left of the planet
into a petting zoo,'' and so we must learn that ``the world is full
of life-forms that are too strange, too beautiful, too powerfully
disturbing to let merely vanish.'' But though the message is
explicit in the introduction and illustrated in each chapter, it's
never developed into an argument: 16 chapters of anecdotes don't
add up to a convincing case. So the reader leaves still hungry.
How, in the history of the relations between humans and animals,
did we get to this petting-zoo stage? Where in those relations does
the sheepdog fit? What do those spider-loving and shark-hunting
humans say about these relations? And if the human reaction to
animals is a tangle of fear and love, will we always relegate
animals to either extinction or the petting zoo?

 MAESTROS OF THE PEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   A History of Classical Music Criticism in America.

   By Mark N. Grant.

 &UR; LET'S REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   BY DANA GIOIA
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay no attention to what the critics say,'' the composer Jean
Sibelius remarked. ``No statue has ever been put up to a critic.''
The irascible Max Reger expressed himself in more earthy terms. ``I
am sitting in the smallest room in my house,'' he wrote to a
critic. ``I have your review in front of me. Soon it will be behind
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom do composers publicly extol the virtues of criticism, but
how many would want to practice their craft in a society without
it? Criticism is a powerful, enlivening and necessary cultural
enterprise, but it is also a mostly ephemeral one. Great music
endures, often gaining resonance and clarity with time, but even
the best criticism fades. Few reviewers, except for
composer-critics like Hector Berlioz or Hugo Wolf, are read 50
years after their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   One virtue of Mark N. Grant's ``Maestros of the Pen'' is how
vividly it re-creates the charm and authority of many forgotten
reviewers. Taking material from hundreds of sources, including
defunct 19th- and early-20th-century newspapers, Grant has
assembled a lively narrative history of this neglected field. His
scholarship (assisted by Eric Friedheim) is formidable, but more
remarkable is the zest and personality with which he presents it.
Engaging and often amusing, the book is serious, but without a
whiff of pedantry.
</P>
<P>
   It surveys, digests and analyzes over 200 years of American
music criticism. Given the volume's manageable length, there are
many notable omissions. The book discusses mostly New York and
Boston critics, with only a few passing glances at writers
elsewhere. It ignores academic musicology and concentrates solely
on newspaper and magazine critics, sometimes following their
careers into radio, film and television. There is little coverage
of Italian opera criticism beyond the enthusiastic musings of Walt
Whitman. The treatment of contemporary critics is also spotty.
Grant, himself a composer, seems to prefer his subjects safely
dead. ``Maestros of the Pen'' also excludes most criticism of
recorded music. Consequently, it fails to address the decisive ways
in which recording technology has altered the experience and
dissemination of music. These omissions might have undermined the
book, but Grant handles his chosen concerns with such intelligence
that potential objections become mere qualifications. This may not
be a comprehensive history, but it is consistently cogent and
thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   Grant focuses mostly on individual critics. Examining the lives
and opinions of nearly 50 major music journalists, from
19th-century Transcendentalists like J. S. Dwight to contemporary
neoconservatives like Samuel Lipman, he uses careers as lenses to
view broader cultural developments, and he has a natural gift for
the biographical sketch. He concentrates on two eras, which he
calls the First and Second Empires. The first was the Gilded Age,
from the end of Reconstruction to World War I, which saw the rise
of music reviewers as a professional class of critics. Commanding
immense readerships in daily newspapers, these cultural mandarins
dominated the flow of information and ideas in a way not equaled
before or since.
</P>
<P>
   With obvious relish, Grant portrays the oversize personalities
of the New York critics once nicknamed the Old Guard -- power
brokers including W. J. Henderson, H. T. Finck, Richard Aldrich, H.
E. Krehbiel and James Gibbons Huneker. The imperious and
argumentative Krehbiel typified the cultural eminence of these
critics. He was so popular that The New York Tribune put his name
in electric lights on Broadway. A man of immense girth and even
larger ego, he was frequently mistaken for his friend President
William Howard Taft. Krehbiel never corrected the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's favorite among the Old Guard is the prolific and
profligate Huneker. Now almost forgotten, he was once the most
influential arts reviewer in America, covering music, literature,
theater and the visual arts, while also writing fiction. Fueled by
a dozen or more daily bottles of Pilsner, Huneker published half a
million words per year and still found time to chase divas, hold
court at Luchow's and practice Chopin. Helping move American arts
from puritan provincialism to cosmopolitan sophistication, Huneker
became the model for later culture czars like H. L. Mencken. For
Grant, Huneker serves as a representative figure of a vanished
intellectual authority, a magisterial critic and trained
instrumentalist who understood music's importance to general
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Second Empire'' begins in 1940. With fewer daily papers,
the individual reviewer had more influence, but print culture was
already losing ground. The dominant critics included Olin Downes,
B. H. Haggin, Henry Pleasants and Alfred Frankenstein. But for
Grant the Second Empire was the reign of Virgil Thomson, whom he
nominates as America's greatest music critic. The composer may have
catnapped during many concerts he reviewed, but he wrote about them
with brilliant alertness during his remarkable 14-year stint at The
Herald Tribune. He typifies the composer-critic of high standards,
discerning taste and refreshing candor.
</P>
<P>
   Interwoven with Grant's engaging chronicle of writers is a
speculative study on the nature and impact of criticism. Several
questions run through the book. Do critics play a significant role
in music history? Do they influence the practice of composers or
performers? Does critical opinion shape the enduring canon of
classical music? Should critics move beyond informed reportage and
evaluation into advocacy? To his credit, Grant tries less to answer
these difficult questions than to explore them -- without forcing
broader generalizations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-MAESTROS-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: broader generalizations.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He offers some persuasive examples of the role of critics in
fixing the classical canon. Most of the Old Guard, for example,
were ardent Wagnerians. While their enthusiasm did not create
Wagner's American vogue, their nearly religious zeal helped
perpetuate the singular piety in which operagoers still hold the
composer. Grant similarly documents Olin Downes's tireless advocacy
of Sibelius, which established the Finnish composer as a major
figure in American concert halls.
</P>
<P>
   But I was more often struck by how impotent even the most
eminent critics were in shaping posterity. Classical music is an
international collaborative enterprise involving not only critics
and composers but also conductors, instrumentalists, singers,
teachers, impresarios, publishers and listeners. No critic can
change any aspect of musical culture without assistance from other
constituencies. The Old Guard, for example, detested the early
modernists. Krehbiel called Arnold Schoenberg's music ``excreta,''
and Huneker confessed that ``if such music making is ever to become
accepted, then I long for Death the Releaser.'' Yet Schoenberg's
serial atonality soon became a trans-Atlantic orthodoxy, which has
only recently collapsed. Likewise, few American critics endorsed
Mahler as either composer or conductor. Not even his untimely death
at 50 sated the reviewers who had hounded him out of New York.
Krehbiel tastelessly denounced Mahler in his Tribune obituary, and
four decades later Downes still declared the Seventh Symphony
``detestably bad'' and the Fifth ``vulgar music.'' Yet the
championship of conductors like Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer and
Leonard Bernstein gradually created a huge cult for the composer.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's tone is elegiac. He sees the present as ``an embattled
time for classical music.'' There are fewer papers with fewer
critics writing ever shorter and less demanding reviews. Music
criticism has become increasingly cut off from larger cultural
concerns. The invigorating tradition of composer-critics like
Thomson and Deems Taylor has nearly vanished. Reviewing rock is
more lucrative. ``The baby boom,'' he comments, ``is the first
generation in American history whose mandarins are not occupied
with promoting the cultural good of classical music.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as his own study documents, classical music has always been
in trouble in America. Problems just change from one generation to
the next. We may have fewer critics today, but we have more
orchestras, opera companies and festivals. Recording and broadcasts
have vastly enlarged the variety and availability of classical
music. Perhaps all we need to reinvigorate criticism is a few books
as good as this one.

might say if he were a character in this book (in which that
memorable and unusual word unfortunately appears twice). But the
reader of the stories that precede ``A Conjunction of Dragon
Ladies'' will already have concluded that Braverman's relentless
focus is on abandoned women -- and that her characters'
observations are easily read as the author's self-conscious
summations of her aims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Craft Warnings'' is Braverman's second book of short
fiction (she is also the author of three novels and four books of
poetry), and in it we meet these protagonists: a 13-year-old girl
periodically abandoned to her grandmother's care by an
irresponsible mother; a 12-year-old girl who at long last meets her
one-legged Vietnam veteran father; a drug addict mother with an
infant she fantasizes about abandoning to nature (whence, too, she
gets the names she also fantasizes about giving him: Forest, Sky,
River, Wind). And then there is the photojournalist, rejected by
her parents when she gives birth out of wedlock, who senses that
she is ``part of an enormous midnight circle of women alone in
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a numbing lineup in place of what ought to be an array of
individuals -- a weakness exacerbated by Braverman's excessively
lush language, which blurs her characters' identities and dilutes
the urgency of the harsh reality they appear to be living through.
Many of these women go unnamed, though other people almost always
are named -- which is confusing and seems another unnecessary
reminder of the protagonists' abandoned states.
</P>
<P>
   The stories also share an annoying repetitiveness of moods, even
of fleeting thoughts. ``We are all barbarians,'' one woman
concludes (echoed by another's idea that ``we are barbarians with
lace panties, machine guns and charge cards''). Vanilla candles
appear in one story; a perfume of ``corrupted vanilla'' pops up
later. One woman notes that ``nobody thinks about . . . placing a
shell to your ear. Everyone knows there are no answers.'' Three
stories later, another discovers that ``roots . . . have dug in.
They know. . . . This is what you must hold to your ear . . . not
the shell, which is empty, and tells you only its name.'' It's
probably hard to believe that the second, incidental appearance of
a porcelain teacup (its violet flowers changed to rosebuds) can be
a major annoyance, but if you read these stories in order you may
have the same reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Frustratingly enough, ``Small Craft Warnings'' is also filled
with beautiful language studded with sharp observations. The
daughter of the Vietnam War vet thinks, ``He was my father by
marginal technicality, a spasm and a shudder.'' The drug addict who
hears the laments of abandoned women also notices a ``gray-haired
woman who looks like you think your grandmother should look before
all the old women got face lifts and started playing tennis.''
Unfortunately, Braverman doesn't give us enough of these guideposts
to her characters' thoughts, apparently not minding that the
luxurious prose of her interior monologues reflects more about her
style than it does about her people in extremis.
</P>
<P>
   When the photojournalist concludes that she ``had been diligent
with her observations. She had courted the brutally intense,'' it's
hard not to think that we have found another of Braverman's
footnotes about herself. But the ``brutally intense'' is always
deflected here by overripe phrasing. The reader of ``Small Craft
Warnings'' is likely to think of Braverman when the Vietnam vet's
daughter wonders, at one point, whether she ``had invented a
paradox, how something could be exquisite and simultaneously torn
and suffocating.''

 &UR; FEAR OF FLYING
</P>
<P>
   BY KAREN KARBO
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NO woman is razor sharp during the first year of her first
child's life. Heroic, yes. Capable of weighing in with clear-eyed
opinions on anything much beyond disposable versus cloth diapers,
no. My inner feminist wishes it weren't so, but every now and then
the publication of a book like ``Angels &AMP; Aliens'' confirms it.
Subtitled ``A Journey West,'' this disappointing memoir of the year
Mary Morris spent as a writer in residence at the University of
California, Irvine, while singlehandedly raising her infant
daughter, Kate, is not so much a journey as a compilation of
cliched observations about California that are so obvious no one
bothers to make them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Morris suffers in a bungalow overlooking the ocean in Laguna
Beach, an address most Californians would give their capped
eyeteeth for: ``In the morning I wake to a stream of relentless
sun. Outside, my neighbor (a woman I will never meet), dressed in a
string bikini, zinc oxide on her nose, wears a cordless Walkman
that projects two antennae from her head, and I know that I have
come to Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of four novels, three short-story collections and two
marvelous ravel narratives, Morris is normally a wise and
meticulous observer. Here, however, she falls back on the sweeping,
portentous pronouncement that is too all-inclusive to be true: ``In
this city, catastrophe lurks everywhere. From the ooze in the
earth, the brush fires that sweep the canyons, the earthquakes, the
mud slides that, gathering momentum, take million-dollar homes out
in Malibu.'' This is the sort of take favored by the evening news.
Unless you're one of the handful of people who own those
million-dollar homes, the main calamity the rains may bring is
getting stuck somewhere in open-toed shoes without an umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   The journey of the title also encompasses Morris's desultory
spiritual dabbling. Her first stop is the gloriously tacky Crystal
Cathedral and its overblown Christmas pageant, in which grown women
vie for the part of ``angels'' who ``fly'' over the congregation
with the aid of invisible wires. Morris is curious enough about the
angels to pose as a journalist for an East Coast newspaper in the
hope of getting an interview. ``Each angel has her tale to tell --
divorce, betrayal, loss. Not so different than mine, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a scene that surely ranks a place in the Instant Karma
Files, Morris is railroaded into taking a test flight herself.
After a rocky start, she begins flapping her arms and ``I soar and
dive, catch the wind, my wings flapping, hands flowing. I dip and
climb . . . as close as I've ever come to God.''
</P>
<P>
   She drifts through further encounters with crystal healers, a
U.F.O. abductee support group and a woman named Wanda Joy, who
channels an alien being called Ashtar, without deconstructing,
dismissing or embracing any of them. Her bizarre interactions with
Wanda Joy, who is involved in Project Evacuation (which will allow
all of Ashtar's believers to transcend their earthly vessels and
beam to the fourth dimension, where new planets await them),
somehow fail to impress Morris one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   By page 9, the reader knows Morris's problem is not the
relentless sun of California or the traffic or the brainless bigots
she encounters at every turn. It is her faltering relationship with
the father of her baby daughter. A renowned professor of
international law, he had originally planned to move to California
with Morris; in fact, it was he who had been offered an important
post and declined it at the last minute. Having refused to sign an
affidavit acknowledging his paternity, he fails to provide money
for Kate's care. ``We had not married. . . . We had been together
five years. I had seen him through his divorce. But he was
ambivalent about marrying again. He was older than I by almost 20
years, and he had so many responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a crystal ball to see where all this is headed.
Fortunately, by the end of her journey, Morris does too.

 &UR; LESSER THAN ZERO
</P>
<P>
   BY DANIEL MENDELSOHN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's a mystery to me why some people are complaining that Bret
Easton Ellis's latest novel is nothing more than a recycling of his
controversially graphic ``American Psycho'' (1991). ``American
Psycho,'' after all, was a bloated, stultifyingly repetitive,
overhyped novel about a fabulously good-looking and expensively
dressed Wall Street sociopath who tortures and dismembers beautiful
young women, whereas ``Glamorama,'' as anyone can see, is a
bloated, stultifyingly repetitive, overhyped book about an entire
gang of fabulously good-looking and expensively dressed sociopaths
who torture and dismember both women and men -- and lots of them.
Clearly, Ellis's authorial vision has grown broader and more
inclusive over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis made his name in 1985 with the cult best seller ``Less
Than Zero,'' a short, moodily effective morality tale about despair
among rich, unhappy young L.A. types; his subsequent fictions have,
with increasingly heavy-handed satirical intent, treated pretty
much the same theme and occasionally the same characters. The
nominal plot of ``Glamorama'' traces the disintegration of a young,
gorgeous, ``semi-famous'' model-cum-club-promoter called Victor
Ward, a United States senator's son who's so ennui- and
Xanax-ridden that he doesn't realize he's got involved in a group
of international model-terrorists until it's too late. Like its
predecessors, ``Glamorama'' is meant to be a withering report on
the soul-destroying emptiness of late-century American consumer
culture, chichi downtown division; but the only lesson you're
likely to take away from it is the even more depressing classic
American morality tale about how premature stardom is more of a
curse than a blessing for young writers.
</P>
<P>
   The new novel does provide Ellis with a vehicle for his
strengths, which are essentially reportorial rather than
novelistic. He has an uncannily keen eye for the tiny details of
the lives of the
</P>
<P>
   label-obsessed yuppies and would-be celebs he's sending up: much
of his prose consists of (intentionally) numbingly long lists of
his characters' clothes and accouterments, the Nokia cell phones
and Bang &AMP; Olufsen stereos and Prada handbags and Armani suits and
Ermenegildo Zegna ties out of which his loft-dwellers somewhat
hopefully attempt to assemble something like an identity. Even
better, he has perfect pitch for the way in which the denizens of
his upscale, downtown worlds have internalized, to deadening
psychological effect, the banalities of advertising and marketing:
his characters talk to one another and about themselves in what
sounds suspiciously like ad copy. (At one point Victor describes
himself as ``coolly disheveled in casual Prada, confident but not
cocky.'' )
</P>
<P>
   Ellis is less a novelist, in a way, than a kind of conceptual
artist in print: he likes to describe and mimic and juxtapose
things, in hopes that the juxtapositions will speak for themselves.
``American Psycho,'' with its many descriptions of rich Wall
Streeters' outfits -- relieved by the occasional disemboweling or
an authorial disquisition on the ``art'' of Whitney Houston -- was
apparently meant to suggest that corporate greed and consumer
culture were producing a generation of affectless ``killers'' to
whom everything had pretty much the same (low) value. Similarly,
the modishly thriller plot of ``Glamorama'' throws together a
madcap club opening, various fashion shows, a trans-Atlantic
crossing on the QE2, acrobatic sex scenes and many sequences in
which terrorists blow up trains and planes and automobiles and
torture their disloyal associates in extremely unpleasant ways,
thereby affording Ellis opportunities to gross you out with his
trademark affectlessness (``The device shreds his leg at the knee
and when I turn around I see his leg slide across the floor,''
etc., etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the morass of incident and body parts lurks the
point. The terrorists use a computer program (``PhotoSoap for
Windows 95'') to alter photographs and thereby control reality.
``You can move planets with this,'' one of the evil models says.
``You can shape lives.'' In a culture in which image -- and,
therefore, images -- is all-important, the author wants to say,
meaningful identity is obliterated and everyone becomes soulless
and interchangeable. (A running joke in both ``Glamorama'' and
``American Psycho'' is that characters are always getting confused
by their friends with other people, with no noticeable
consequences.)
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis's satirical message is, essentially, a one-liner, and
hardly an original one at that -- celebrity culture is vapid, yes,
and? -- and isn't remotely worth the endless pages in which his
vacuous and inconsequential characters talk vacuously and
inconsequentially about vacuous and inconsequential things: ``I'm
seeing Emily Lloyd maintaining remarkable poise while eating a
giant grilled shrimp.'' And the pretentious, halfhearted narrative
device, introduced a third of the way into the book, of suggesting
that the novel's action is actually part of a film that's being
made -- there are occasional references to ``the director'' or to
the fact that this or that scene is a ``flashback'' -- only
underscores how desperately the author is trying to impose,
retroactively, some shape and meaning on his rambling narrative.
Ellis goes to an awful lot of trouble to make sure you know how
disgusted he is by the superficiality of contemporary culture, and
the result is fiction that is -- well, disgusting and superficial.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-GLAMORAMA-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: disgusting and superficial.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's odd that Ellis's books are so little fun, given how ripe
their subjects are for parody. Even at its blackest, truly
devastating social satire -- you think of Evelyn Waugh's ``Loved
One'' -- has a certain gleefulness about it: if you really disdain
those awful people and their empty pretensions, you can't help
enjoying impaling them on their own vanities. But as you slog your
way through ``Glamorama,'' with its clumpy, dissertation-length
references to the first-name-only celebrities, to the expensive
clothes, the hair salons and gyms du jour, to the empty, rococo
sex, the high-tech gizmos and copious, casual drug-taking, you
can't help thinking that Ellis knows far more about all this than
mere journalistic curiosity requires; he reminds you of those
Southern judges who simply had to watch hours and hours of dirty
movies in order to determine that yes, they were pornographic. I
suspect that the relentless dreariness of Ellis's recent books --
the sense you get as you read them that you're somehow being
punished -- is a kind of authorial projection, the product of a
certain conflictedness. People who really abhor celebrity, and who
are truly offended by the way that the media and the market have
eroded privacy, generally don't allow themselves to be the subjects
of celebratory promotional films. ``This Is Not an Exit,'' the
forthcoming documentary about Ellis's life -- he's 36 -- will,
according to Alfred A. Knopf publicity material, be ``available for
bookstore events.''
</P>
<P>
   One documentary that came to mind as I read ``Glamorama'' was
``Unzipped,'' the 1995 film about the fashion designer Isaac
Mizrahi; it trod much the same territory that Ellis's novel claims
to explore but showed you, delightfully, that along with the
silliness and vanity and pretentiousness rampant in the fashion/
</P>
<P>
   celebrity crowd, there's fun and passion and, often, talent.
(Some people become celebrated for a reason, after all.) Ellis
doesn't give you the whole picture because he does the safe thing:
he sticks to descriptions of what his dull characters are wearing
rather than considering what they might be thinking or, God forbid,
feeling. But Ellis's recent books aren't so much novels as
advertisements -- for his knowing attitude, for how hip he is to
the scene. Sadly -- given its author's abilities -- ``Glamorama''
is itself just another artifact of the culture it pretends to
criticize: it's little more than a pose, a soulless, empty thing
that's dressed to kill, the literary and rhetorical equivalent of
standing around at some club in black Prada and wearing sunglasses
after midnight, trying to cow those even more insecure than
yourself into thinking you're interesting and even important. I
can't imagine that anyone actually enjoys these torturous novels --
except, perhaps, the people whom the books clandestinely celebrate,
the actor-models and model-writers and celebrity-editors and their
gang. But then, Ellis has become a sort of hip brand-name label in
the publishing world, and people go in for him precisely for the
reasons they might go in for a $300 Helmut Lang plain cotton shirt:
It's so outrageous they assume there has to be something to it. But
there isn't. The emperor has no clothes, designer or otherwise.

 &UR; THE WILL TO MADNESS
</P>
<P>
   BY ALAN RYAN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A nyone who knows anything about Friedrich Nietzsche knows two
things. The first is that as a young man he fervently admired
Richard Wagner's music dramas, and then turned against both Wagner
and the Christian religiosity of works like ``Parsifal.'' The other
is that at 44 he was stricken with a dementia caused by syphilis,
was rescued from a dingy boardinghouse in Turin by his devoted
friend Franz Overbeck, taken to asylums in Switzerland and Germany,
and later incarcerated in a red-brick villa in Weimar. There his
sister, Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche, received her anti-Semitic
friends and allowed them to view the dying sage, a fate from which
death released him in August 1900. Thirty years after, the most
repulsive of Nietzsche's many dubious admirers visited; Herr Hitler
was given one of Elisabeth's husband's anti-Semitic treatises and
her brother's sword stick.
</P>
<P>
   How does Nietzsche's passion for, and passionate rejection of,
Richard Wagner and all his works connect with his madness, and how
do these connect with the attraction his work held for generations
of violent anti-Semitic reactionaries? It is not clear that Joachim
Kohler's engaging and vivid book, in a fluid translation by Ronald
Taylor, can quite answer that question, but it sheds some light on
it. For Nietzsche's madness -- or rather, the route to his madness
-- took a peculiar form. In the months before he became all but
speechless, Nietzsche dramatized his increasing insanity in terms
of one of his favorite myths, the story of Theseus, Ariadne and the
Minotaur.
</P>
<P>
   The myth itself is clear only in outline -- all versions say
that Theseus arrives in Crete, kills Ariadne's half brother the
Minotaur, finds his way out of the Labyrinth with the aid of
Ariadne's ball of twine, escapes with Ariadne to Naxos and there
abandons her. What happens next to Ariadne varies from one version
of the tale to another. In one, Dionysus has her killed because of
her betrayal of her brother; in another, the god becomes her
bridegroom and mystically unites the human and the divine; in
Homer, Odysseus encounters her at the gates of Hades, dead.
</P>
<P>
   Among the last coherent or near-coherent letters that Nietzsche
wrote were those to Cosima Wagner, by then the widow of the great
composer, in which Nietzsche addressed her as ``Princess Ariadne'';
he declared the author of the letters to be none other than the god
Dionysus. It is with these extraordinary letters and the poems of
the ``Dithyrambs of Dionysus'' that Kohler, also the author of a
full-scale biography of Nietzsche, begins ``Nietzsche and Wagner.''
As Nietzsche became steadily less sane, Kohler writes, so he
recklessly identified with different selves ``and, like Dionysus,
his role model, exchanged one persona for another at will. At one
moment he saw himself as Shakespeare or Caesar, at the next as King
of Italy or as Wagner, a mortal enemy he pursued with all the
savagery he had at his command. And these figures all revealed
themselves to him as incarnations of the one god, the god Dionysus,
with whom he knew himself to be identical.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, prompts the question of why Nietzsche chose to
dramatize his growing detachment from reality in such terms. Cosima
Wagner was one of the 19th century's least likable heroines,
proverbial for her gawky appearance and her infinite selfishness,
and a far cry from the beautiful and self-sacrificing Princess
Ariadne. Kohler's answer is that the villain of the piece is not
she but Wagner. Richard Wagner was indeed the ``Old Minotaur'' that
Nietzsche called him; he lured Nietzsche into a dysfunctional
household of such labyrinthine complexity that it is little wonder
that Nietzsche became increasingly wild and erratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nietzsche and Wagner'' might be described as Nietzsche for
beginners -- that is, without philosophy -- though it is hardly
Nietzsche without tears. The bare-bones account of Nietzsche's life
begins not so much with his birth in 1844 as with the death of his
father five years later. Carl Nietzsche was a Lutheran pastor who
died of ``softening of the brain,'' which sounds very like a
dementia caused by the syphilitic infection that killed his son.
Responding to his mother's urgings, Nietzsche became a child
prodigy, and he also began to suffer from the nightmares and
headaches that plagued him all his life.
</P>
<P>
   What brought him to the state of ardent discipleship in which he
met Wagner in 1868 is obscure. He had known about Wagner from his
teens, but had disliked the music even while he admired the mythic
themes of operas like ``Tristan und Isolde'' and tried himself to
write an opera based on Nordic legends. It is clearer what he
admired once he had become intoxicated: Wagner promised to
re-create for the Germans the cultural climate in which the
classical Greek world had created the tragedies of Aeschylus. It
was this that ``The Birth of Tragedy'' spelled out in 1872 to its
astonished readers.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, it was a view with some alarming consequences, of
which Wagner's rabid anti-Semitism was the most obvious. Kohler
thinks that Nietzsche was as bad as Wagner in this regard. Both
despaired of, and despised, the comfortable bourgeois society in
which they lived; both harbored astounding visions of its
destruction in torrents of blood and its replacement by a society
in which godlike heroes treated the masses with a kindly contempt.
As to why the age seemed so indifferent to these archaic heroic
ideals, the answer was that a Jewish spirit of commercial
moneymaking had rotted German culture.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was that Wagner did not particularly wish Nietzsche
to set himself up as the philosophical spokesman on Wagnerian
themes. Nor did Cosima care for either the person of Nietzsche or
the intellectual ambition that drove him so painfully. She had
sacrificed herself to Wagner, and she wanted Nietzsche to sacrifice
himself to both of them -- a role in which he might be expected to
shop for Wagner's underwear or to write attacks on the critics as
Wagner and she decided. It was bound to end in tears, and it did.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-SUBJUGATION-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: and it did.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there were tears throughout, and a final rupture by
1878, five years before Wagner's death. The end of the friendship
was provoked by Nietzsche on the literary front and Wagner and
Cosima on the personal. In 1876, Nietzsche published ``Richard
Wagner in Bayreuth,'' a book that heaped praise on Wagner while
simultaneously describing him as the seductive destroyer of all who
came within his power, a Minotaur within a labyrinth. Most readers
thought the praise more than made up for the eccentric and not
entirely intelligible criticism; Wagner did not. Wagner and Cosima
decided that Nietzsche's unhealthy and febrile views were caused by
masturbation and the influence on him of Jewish friends, notably
the scholar Paul Ree. This astonishing nonsense went on being
repeated until the 1920's in the Wagnerian newsletter in Bayreuth.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, it was open warfare. Nietzsche passed up no chance
to mock Wagner's sentimental return to the Christian faith, and
Cosima tried to pretend that Nietzsche was dead. Nietzsche was the
weaker party, ever more sick in mind and body, and unable to avoid
hoping that Cosima would rescue him by turning against her husband
and his memory. It was useless. As the Wagner cult became more
intense after the Master's death, Cosima found her role as its high
priestess. Nietzsche was at best an inconvenience, at worst a
threat. Ariadne would neither deliver Theseus from the Minotaur nor
accept this second Dionysus alongside her departed Dionysian lover.
Intolerable as Cosima was, it is hard to see what she could in fact
have done for Nietzsche; still, one flinches at the last words of
this book: to his guardians at the German asylum, Nietzsche
declared, ``It was my wife Cosima Wagner who brought me here.''

 &UR; THE BOSS FROM PURGATORY
</P>
<P>
   BY DAVID SACKS
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bad employers can make for good fiction. The subject's a
natural: many readers have been unhappy employees, and wellsprings
of reader emotion -- resentment, embarrassment -- await an author's
skillful uncorking. Which is just what happens in ``Louse,'' a
delightfully eerie and angry first novel by a young New Yorker
named David Grand.
</P>
<P>
   With crazy but apt distortions, ``Louse'' mirrors the plight of
real-life workers in an era of job insecurity, video surveillance
and shameless corporate euphemisms. Yet Grand has even larger
aspirations: the novel's hallucinatory world suggests a religious
allegory (apparently sincere) posing questions about God's will or
presence in the universe. Although not every part of this ambitious
agenda succeeds, ``Louse'' is often provocative and hilarious,
occasionally stunning.
</P>
<P>
   The chapters alternate between two voices. Some are assembled
from ``official'' corporate sources -- staff memos, logbook
entries, public relations bulletins -- that give the reader
tantalizing scraps of information while exercising the author's
gift for parody. The rest are the personal observations of Herman
Q. Louse, a fly-on-the-wall character who is the obedient valet of
the man he's been instructed to call Poppy, the billionaire Herbert
Horatio Blackwell.
</P>
<P>
   By far the novel's best-drawn character, Poppy is a bedridden,
dying monster modeled on the aging Howard Hughes. Like Hughes,
Poppy owns a manufacturing, investment and gambling casino empire,
and it is based in a state that resembles Nevada. Like Hughes,
Poppy is a former daredevil pilot and Hollywood playboy, and he is
now addicted to prescription codeine. Poppy also shares old
Hughes's most notorious trait: a pathological fear of germs. Afraid
of most human contact, afraid to have his hair or nails clipped,
afraid of bugs, fresh air and fresh food, Poppy lives secluded in a
sanitized bedchamber. Louse and others tend him amid elaborate
hygienic precautions and social rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Lovingly, the author describes the meticulous duties required of
the domestic staff. Thus a conscientious worker prepares Poppy's
meal: ``Ms. Lonesome leans over the kitchen wash basin. She lifts a
scrub brush and applies it to the can of peaches. . . . She scrubs
the metallic container until all remnants of the adhesive once
holding the wrapper are gone. She scrubs until the canister is
shining. She wipes. She polishes with a fresh paper towel and
places the can on the tray.'' It is an image of diligence wasted.
But such scenes also point the way to the novel's higher ground --
a brooding on the futility of all human endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   The real Howard Hughes lived in hotels, with a whole floor
sealed off for him and his attendants. ``Louse'' chooses a more
imperial scenario: Poppy inhabits the penthouse of his corporate
headquarters, a cylindrical glass-and-chrome building ``with the
girth of a lake'' rising from the desert resort town of G., which
Poppy also owns. The ground floor is a public gambling casino with
a secret purpose. The rest of the building holds thousands of
corporate employees -- accountants, lawyers, clerks -- who toil day
and night.
</P>
<P>
   Poppy controls his company as insanely as he does his
bedchamber. Work and conversation are governed by voluminous,
stultifying rules. A huge security staff watches everything (an
idea the author plays with slyly, as in Louse's impression of the
attractive Ms. Lonesome: ``The pulse of red lights from the
surveillance cameras spreads across the pale pink pallor of her
lips'').
</P>
<P>
   We soon suspect that nearly everyone, Louse included, has been
drugged and brainwashed. ``Though you will find your long-term
memory impaired, you will find your short-term memory fully
functional,'' a perky indoctrination memo states. ``Your motor
skills should be impeccable and your energy level appropriately
blissful, as well as suitable for all required duties.'' Poppy's
dazed employees lack the presence of mind to quit or blow the
whistle. They'll stand for anything. The author takes this funny
notion and deftly, with self-restraint, turns it nightmarish.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we hear rumors of one free spirit. An executive named
Mortimer Blank has diverted company funds and is at large -- an
outlaw in the corporate forest, hunted fiercely by Poppy's
henchmen. This shadowy antagonist (blank  &QC;  mort  &QC;  death?) provides
much of the novel's suspense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louse'' often seems reminiscent of other satirical fables,
from George Orwell's ``Nineteen Eighty-four'' to Donald Antrim's
black-comic ``Elect Mr. Robinson for a Better World.'' The master,
of course, is Franz Kafka. Certainly the little people in Grand's
fiction are caught in a Kafkaesque system of guilt and obligation,
a kind of corporate purgatory. Louse receives no salary; instead,
like other employees, he owes the company money, a debt perpetually
renewed by disciplinary penalties. Similarly, a much-heralded
building called Paradise is under construction for occupancy by a
few select staffers -- which keeps everyone appropriately anxious
and motivated. The book's best scene -- a public ``correction'' of
a junior sales rep accused of abetting the rebel Blank --
chillingly combines elements of a staff luncheon, a television game
show and a 16th-century auto-da-fe. Throughout, ``Louse'' nicely
lampoons the bad employer's mandatory cheer, the phony equality of
office colleagues, the exploitative appeals to team spirit and high
standards.
</P>
<P>
   FLAWS there are, too. The novel's symbolism sometimes dampens
the storytelling, so that Blank's sedition seems less thrilling
than it should be. A related problem is Louse's passivity. We keep
waiting for the worm to turn. ``We were complicit. We could have
defied a little. Done something extraordinary,'' Louse says
regretfully at the end, and the reader is forced to agree. The only
real player is the supine boss, Poppy. The novel's larger message
also remains fuzzy: is the author saying that organized religion is
the ultimate corporation, or that corporate employers manipulate
the human thirst for expiation and salvation?
</P>
<P>
   Still, this ``Louse'' sticks to you, for its wit and imaginative
vision. Amid the twists and revelations of the closing chapters,
the old schemer's master plan finally comes into view -- yet
imperfectly. We see most of the how's but few of the why's. Which
is exactly the way David Grand seems to want it.

 &UR; ALL'S FAIR?
</P>
<P>
   BY JEREMY WALDRON
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours of May 25, 1861, a Maryland state legislator
named John Merryman was arrested in connection with an attempt to
disrupt the transport of Union troops from Baltimore to Washington.
Merryman was held at Fort McHenry, under the command of Gen. George
Cadwalader. The day after his arrest, Merryman's lawyer obtained a
writ of habeas corpus, directing General Cadwalader to produce the
prisoner so that a Federal court could examine the case for his
detention. The general instead sent one of his officers to say that
he was authorized by the President of the United States to suspend
habeas corpus during the present emergency in Maryland. (What
President Abraham Lincoln had actually commanded was that the
resistance in Maryland was to be counteracted by ``the most prompt
and efficient means . . . even, if necessary . . . the bombardment
of their cities and, in the extremest necessity, the suspension of
the writ of habeas corpus.'') The judge responded by ordering that
the general himself be brought by force to the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   A United States marshal went to Fort McHenry to serve the writ
of attachment, but -- not surprisingly -- he returned empty-handed.
General Cadwalader would not receive him. The judge considered
whether it would be worth forming a posse to bring the general into
court but decided against it, fearing that the posse would be
resisted with superior force. Instead, he delivered an opinion
stating that the President did not have the authority to suspend
habeas corpus. He sent a copy of his decision to the White House,
reminding the President of his sworn duty ``to take care that the
laws be faithfully executed.'' Lincoln made no direct response to
the court, nor did his Administration appeal the decision. (And the
Army certainly did not release Merryman.) But in a speech to
Congress on July 4, the President presented his critics with a
challenge. The laws as a whole were being resisted in this
rebellion, he said. Are ``all the laws, but one, to go unexecuted,
and the Government itself go to pieces, lest that one'' -- habeas
corpus -- ``be violated?''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Justices of the Supreme Court sometimes sat as
Federal circuit judges. The judge in the case of Merryman was Roger
Taney, Chief Justice of the United States, and the author of the
infamous Dred Scott decision (which in 1857 had held that
African-Americans could not be citizens). Needless to say, Northern
opinion was as outraged by Taney's decision in Merryman as it was
by the earlier infamy. The New York Times thundered that the case
presented ``the ungracious spectacle of . . . the soldier eager to
punish, and the jurist to exculpate a traitor.'' Nevertheless, five
years later (after the Union victory and with a Lincoln appointee
-- Salmon P. Chase -- as Chief Justice) the Supreme Court reached
essentially the same conclusion as Taney in a case called Ex Parte
Milligan. ``The Constitution of the United States is a law for
rulers and people, equally in war and in peace. . . . The
Government, within the Constitution, has all the powers granted to
it, which are necessary to preserve its existence.'' Habeas corpus
could be suspended, but only by Congress; and even then, the
majority said, civilians could not be held by the Army for trial
before a military tribunal, not even if the charge was fomenting an
armed uprising in a time of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Rehnquist is 16th in the line of Chief Justices that
includes Taney and Chase. With ``All the Laws But One: Civil
Liberties in Wartime,'' he has written a book that explores
Lincoln's situation, not primarily through legal or philosophical
analysis but by taking us through the variety of cases, from the
1860's to the 1940's, in which civil liberty issues in time of war
have arisen.
</P>
<P>
   The book is mainly narrative history, giving us an account of
the Civil War cases, the cases that arose during and immediately
after World War I and the cases that challenged the imposition of
martial law in Hawaii and the removal and internment of
Japanese-Americans in the Western states during World War II.
Actually, that summary is a little misleading. There are 13
chapters on the 1860's and only five on the 20th-century cases:
indeed, there are fewer than 30 pages on the World War II
internments, compared with more than 60 on the Milligan case alone.
That makes the book a little lopsided, the more so because the
disparity is never explained by the author.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rehnquist presents full and fascinating human profiles of
the major participants in these cases -- the statesmen, the
soldiers, the suspects, their lawyers and the judges -- and a level
of detail about the hearings and the decisions that provides the
reader with some understanding of what it must have been like to
grapple with these issues in a time of crisis. Not least is the
sense that we get, in a case like Merryman, of what a clash between
the executive and the judiciary is actually like: this provides a
healthy reminder of how much we usually rely, in the last resort,
on executive submission in upholding the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   In places, perhaps, there is a bit too much detail: at times it
seems Rehnquist wants to write like J. Anthony Lukas in ``Big
Trouble,'' giving us a history of everything that is mentioned in
the history and a background to everything that is furnished as
background. Do we really need to know that the author of the
majority opinion in Milligan went to stay with his uncle, an
Episcopal rector, when he was 5? Or to be reminded, at the
beginning of the chapter on Japanese internments, about ruinous
inflation in Germany after the Kaiser's abdication in 1918? Readers
will find themselves flipping rather impatiently through some of
these pages.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-LAWS-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: these pages.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if they are looking for provocative opinions or predictions
-- what this Chief Justice will do if a case like Milligan or
Korematsu (the most famous of the World War II Japanese internment
cases) ever comes before his Court -- they will be disappointed.
Rehnquist is quite sparing in his commentary. He criticizes the
Supreme Court majority in Milligan for holding that Congress had no
power to permit trials of civilians by military tribunals in time
of war, but mainly because that issue was not presented on the
strict facts of the case. And the courts, he says, should not
decide constitutional questions unnecessarily. He does speculate
that maybe ``Congress should be able to provide for trial of
defendants by a judge without a jury'' -- something like the
Diplock courts in Northern Ireland -- ``in a carefully limited
class of cases dealing with national security in wartime.'' But
this is not a suggestion he explores in any detail. He agrees with
Judge Learned Hand's insistence in one of the World War I cases
that the courts should resist any attempt by the Government to
equate strongly worded criticism of conscription with advocacy of
resistance to it. And he offers a helpful analysis of the
Japanese-American cases by suggesting, first, a distinction between
discrimination against groups of citizens and discrimination
against aliens, and second, a distinction between a policy of
evacuating people from coastal areas and a policy of continuing
detention.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Rehnquist expresses concern about the alacrity
with which the Roosevelt Administration accepted the military's
advice about the dangers posed by Japanese nationals and citizens
of Japanese ancestry. The President's approval of internment was
``perfunctory,'' given in the course of a telephone conversation.
As Attorney General Francis Biddle said later: ``I do not think he
was much concerned with the gravity or implications of this step.
He was never theoretical about things. What must be done to defend
the country must be done.''
</P>
<P>
   A nation that prides itself on the principle of civilian control
of the military should recognize that concern for civil liberties
is as much the job of the President as the courts. If it is, as
Rehnquist suggests, the task of public opinion to insure that both
branches take these issues seriously, then he can be congratulated
for providing in a very readable form some of the material they
will need for the responsible fulfillment of that duty.

 &UR; BIRTHRIGHT FOR SALE
</P>
<P>
   BY LARRY WOLFF
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you feel that the empire is disintegrating?'' Karl, the
apostate protagonist of Aharon Appelfeld's novel ``The
Conversion,'' asks. The declining empire in which he lives is the
Hapsburg empire of Austria-Hungary, one that in fact would
disintegrate at the end of World War I. In the opening chapter Karl
converts from Judaism to Roman Catholicism, intending to advance
his career in municipal public service in his provincial Austrian
hometown, remote from the metropolitan sophistications of
fin-de-siecle Vienna. In church at Karl's conversion are the many
other converts who have preceded him, and who welcome him into his
new identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spell of the ceremony gradually faded, and everyone grew
hungry. A ceremony like this is no more than a tonsillectomy, one
of his childhood friends had told him. But Karl now felt
differently: as if his legs were weighed down.'' There is a
reception afterwards, with pastries to satisfy everyone's hunger,
but nothing to quell the inner uneasiness, the postoperative
trauma, that Karl now experiences and that will haunt him for the
rest of the novel. Appelfeld's drama of a distintegrating identity
in the context of a disintegrating empire confronts the reader with
the force of a familiar nightmare, akin to those of Kafka, himself
a bureaucrat in Hapsburg Prague, who actually lived through the
imperial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Appelfeld was born in Czernowitz, in the former Hapsburg border
province of Bukovina. The city belonged to Romania after World War
I, to the Soviet Union after World War II, and today is part of an
independent Ukraine. Yet Czernowitz remained a Hapsburg town even
after the fall of the Hapsburgs, and the city's German-Jewish
culture was powerful enough to produce perhaps the greatest
midcentury German poet, Paul Celan. In fact Appelfeld was born on
the same street in Czernowitz where Celan lived in the 1930's.
Deported as a child to a concentration camp in Transnistria,
Appelfeld survived, escaped and went to Palestine after the war; he
has lived in Israel for the past 50 years and writes in Hebrew. He
has been well known to an international literary public since the
translation into English in 1980 of his brilliant novel ``Badenheim
1939,'' about an Austrian resort where Viennese Jews frivolously
delude themselves as they await deportation to Poland. ``The
Conversion,'' like ``Badenheim 1939,'' pursues the themes of
self-delusion and inevitable disaster, envisioning a world of
Austrian Jews who can not clearly recognize the fact that in
Austria they have no choice but to be Jews, who fool themselves
with the semblance of assimilation or the expedience of conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Appelfeld, together with Gregor von Rezzori, the author of
``Memoirs of an Anti-Semite,'' who also came from Bukovina, may
count as the last of the great Hapsburg writers. Robert Musil, who
may have been the greatest of all, scatologically called the empire
``Kakania'' in his epic masterpiece ``The Man Without Qualities''
and reflected on the violence of national rivalries there: ``It was
nothing more than the fact that every human being's dislike of
every other human being's attempts to get on -- a dislike in which
today we are all agreed --in that country crystallized earlier,
assuming the form of a sublimated ceremonial that might have become
of greater importance if its evolution had not been prematurely cut
short by catastrophe.'' In Appelfeld's novel the ceremony of
conversion appears as a futile attempt to evade the crystallized
dislike between Jews and Christians in Austria, and to escape the
imminently catastrophic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon there won't be any Jews left,'' an anonymous Christian in
the town says. ``Father Merser is baptizing them one after the
other. But I don't trust them. A Jew, even after he's been
baptized, is still a Jew.'' An unidentified Jew from another town
comments to Karl: ``Many Jews lived there once. Now only my wife
and me. All of them converted. It's difficult to live among
converts. They stare at you all the time.'' The double choruses of
Christians and Jews are similarly perplexed, unpersuaded and
repulsed by the religious gesture of the converts, who are left
with an awkward sense of their own alienation. ``At first the other
converts were pleased that Karl had converted. But over the years
he observed that they seldom showed themselves in public,
preferring to lead their lives in seclusion. They were never eager
to meet with childhood friends.'' The good-natured Christian madam
of a brothel disapproves of conversion, and tells Karl: ``Jews
should stay Jewish. That's the right thing for them.'' Translated
from the Hebrew by Jeffrey M. Green into terse, precise, sometimes
oracular prose, Appelfeld's fiction has some of the solemn tone of
biblical parable.
</P>
<P>
   Karl's conscience and imagination are provoked by the figures of
his old Aunt Franzi, once a scandalous cabaret singer, and her
friend Elsa Ring, once a glamorous actress of the demimonde. These
two women had belonged to the wider world of theatrical culture
centered on Vienna. Aunt Franzi had charmed an aristocratic
relative of the Emperor, while Elsa Ring had been admired on the
stage by Stefan Zweig. Karl attends the funeral of his Aunt Franzi,
and remembers uncomfortably that, in spite of her worldliness, she
always despised apostate Jews: ``Her love for her tribe was a
fierce love, quirky perhaps, but constant. She had changed her
lovers like dresses, but her love for her people was solid and
unwavering. If anyone spoke ill of the Jews or made accusations
against them, she would immediately rise up like a mighty
fortress.'' Elsa Ring had been no less proud, but in extreme old
age she began to receive visits from Father Merser, and eventually
she succumbed to his ineluctable invitations and insinuations. One
day the church bells rang: ``Then the truth struck like lightning:
it was Elsa Ring, or rather what was left of her, sitting in the
narrow wheelchair wrapped in a brown blanket. She was being pushed
by Father Merser along the street that led directly to the great
Church of St. George.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-CONVERSION-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: St. George.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the novel takes place in the claustrophobic setting of
Karl's provincial town, where church bells keep announcing new
conversions. In the final chapters, however, Karl deludes himself
into thinking he can find refuge in his mother's native village,
somewhere in the Carpathian mountains, maybe in Bukovina, though
the novel's Hapsburg geography remains vague. He discovers some of
the simple virtues of village Judaism, but also, in the end, in a
scene of apocalyptic siege, the savage violence of village
anti-Semitism. The fictionally elaborated Hapsburg empire sometimes
takes on some of the semimythological resonance of the embattled
empire in J. M. Coetzee's ``Waiting for the Barbarians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Conversion'' is at once a historical novel about the
Austrian past and an allegorical analysis of the significance of
religious identity, addressing issues that Appelfeld sees as still
relevant at the end of the 20th century. Written for the Israeli
public, and perhaps for the American public as well, his novel
seems to endorse the argument of the emphatic madam, ``Jews should
stay Jewish.'' The profoundly insightful essays of the intellectual
historian Carl Schorske suggest a more intricate concept of
relations between Jewish and Catholic cultural perspectives in
Austria at the turn of the century, illuminating also the case of
the empire's most renowned convert, Gustav Mahler. His baptism
helped make it possible for him to assume the post of director of
the Vienna Opera in 1897 but did not protect him from the nasty
denunciations of anti-Semitic reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   Magnus Dawison was in the cast when Mahler was conducting
Wagner's ``Lohengrin'' in Prague in 1899, and Dawison, who had
trained to be a synagogue cantor before becoming an opera singer,
took the opportunity to sing something in Hebrew for Mahler. ``I
sang with all my heart and soul,'' Dawison recalled. ``I put in all
the Jewish Weltschmerz, but also all the meaning of the words. The
master listened. And as I came to the end . . . he whispered in a
dry voice: 'Yes, that is religious! That's how I heard it as a
child, sung by the old prayer-leader in the village synagogue.' He
sat silent for a while, lost in thought. Suddenly he sat down at
the piano and began to play. To improvise. I heard phrase for
phrase the melody I had used. . . . And I sat spellbound, thinking
only how much our religious worship would have gained if only he,
the great man, had not turned away from it and from all that he
regarded as a frustrating burden.'' This account suggests that
Mahler felt he had lost something in his alienation from Judaism.
Appelfeld's novel, however, seems to say that the convert, cut off
from his own childhood, has lost everything.

   An overweight 14-year-old boy, starved for affection and trying
to stay afloat in a dysfunctional Irish-American household in
Queens in 1961, seeks refuge in Roger Maris's pursuit of the
home-run record. In 1990 our reviewer, Hilma Wolitzer, called this
a ``compact and affecting first novel.''

   &UR; BEHIND THE OVAL OFFICE: GETTING REELECTED AGAINST ALL ODDS

   By Dick Morris.

   Renaissance, $16.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's former adviser tracks the arc of his own
career, giving plenty of attention to the mechanics of polling and
policy making, as well as the overwhelming influence of money and
television in Presidential politics. This curious artifact has been
updated with a new introduction and the weekly briefing papers
given to the White House by the author and other political
consultants during the 1996 campaign (and later subpoenaed by the
Justice Department). Morris ``has written an account that future
historians of the Clinton Presidency will not be able to ignore,''
James B. Stewart wrote here in 1997.

   &UR; THE HEALING
</P>
<P>
   By Gayl Jones.

   Beacon, $12 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by a faith healer and former rock star manager, this
funny novel leans on free association to explore the power of faith
to banish violence and paranoia. Last year in these pages, Valerie
Sayers praised the ``gradual building of connections and insights
that culminates in a giddy outpouring of language.''

<P>
   &UR; A PRAYER FOR THE CITY
</P>
<P>
   By Buzz Bissinger.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage, $15 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   A journalist with extraordinary access tells the inside story of
Philadelphia's remarkable Mayor, Ed Rendell, whose drive and
honesty helped restore hope and fiscal soundness to a city on the
edge of collapse. Last year our reviewer, Robert Fishman, said this
``full-scale portrait of a struggling metropolis . . . brings to
mind such classics of urban reportage and analysis as J. Anthony
Lukas's 'Common Ground.' '' Miami, by Joan Didion (Vintage
International, $12), is a more impressionistic account of an
American city, dwelling on the Cuban exile community and the
shadowy links between the Bay of Pigs disaster and events like
Watergate and the Kennedy assassination. ``The world Miss Didion
describes in beautifully evocative prose is . . . a world of menace
and elliptical connections,'' James Chace wrote here in 1987.
Dallas Public and Private: Aspects of an American City, by Warren
Leslie (Southern Methodist University, $14.95), was first published
after John F. Kennedy's murder and seeks to explain a city whose
mix of extreme conservatism, religious expression and political
excess made it a place where nasty things were bound to happen.
This study, which includes a new foreword and preface, ``is a good
deal more than a revealing, a valuable and a careful book,'' George
Fuermann said here in 1964. ``It is also a courageous one.''

   This Argentine novel imagines the life of the strongman Juan
Peron, particularly his 18 years in exile and his ill-fated return
to power in 1973. The book ``is a brilliant image of a national
psychosis,'' Jay Cantor wrote here in 1988. Tales From the Blue
ArchiveS, by Lawrence Thornton (Bantam, $13.95), is the last of
three dream-driven novels by the author revolving around
Argentina's ``dirty war.'' It focuses on a woman's search for her
grandsons, who were among the ``disappeared,'' and on what happens
when she finally finds them. The tale ``blends the mundane violence
of recent Latin American politics with the high tragedy of
Elizabethan drama,'' Robert Houston wrote here in 1997.

   &UR; COUNT ME OUT
</P>
<P>
   By Russell James.
</P>
<P>
   Foul Play/Norton, $10 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   When one of the robbers of an armored car takes off with all the
loot, the mastermind of the heist tries to track him down through
the crook's ex-boxer brother and his 8-year-old daughter. In 1997
our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, admired this British mystery for
``the depth, as well as the darkness'' of its insights.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HISTORY OF JAZZ
</P>
<P>
   By Ted Gioia.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University, $15.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   This concise, accessible overview covers jazz from its roots in
slavery through jazz-rock fusion and beyond. In 1997 our reviewer,
Peter Keepnews, said that despite its occasional omissions and
lapses, ``the book is peppered with pithy and thoughtful
observations.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRESPASSING: MY SOJOURN IN THE HALLS OF PRIVILEGE
</P>
<P>
   By Gwendolyn M. Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $11 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   A well-off black lawyer tells how she rode the fast track to
success in corporate America, and how the pressures of racial
tokenism finally caused her to hop off. In these pages in 1997,
Deborah E. McDowell called this an ``engagingly written and fluidly
paced'' memoir.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOME AND AWAY
</P>
<P>
   By Joanne Meschery.
</P>
<P>
   University of California, $13.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   During the gulf war, a California woman struggles to balance her
growing political awareness with a troubled marriage and other
personal crises. The novel ``manages to deal sensitively with
serious issues,'' Constance Decker Thompson wrote here in 1994.

 BOOKS IN BRIEF: NONFICTION
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cover of POSADA'S BROADSHEETS: Mexican Popular Imagery,
1890-1910 (University of New Mexico, cloth, $50; paper, $24.95)
shows an engraving of a crazed man savagely chewing on a baby's
body while a winged dragonlike creature looks down menacingly from
the air. This surreal image was but one of many such gruesome
pictures designed by the Mexican artist Jose Guadalupe Posada
(1852-1913) and created for Antonio Vanegas Arroyo, a leading
publisher of broadsheets -- single-page periodicals -- that
reported on lurid crimes, executions, bullfights, cultural events
and politics. A precursor of today's tabloids, broadsheets were
cheaply printed and widely distributed as news and entertainment to
Mexico City's urban masses. They were the most ephemeral of printed
matter, bought, read and tossed away -- even Posada did not save
the majority of his works. But ``taken together, they form a
'people's history' of life in Mexico City during the years
bracketing the turn of the 20th century,'' writes the book's
author, Patrick Frank, who teaches art history at the University of
Colorado, Boulder. Posada was a hugely prolific commercial artist,
designing newspaper advertisements, product labels and magazine
illustrations; his work and import were rediscovered in the 1920's
by the Mexican political muralists Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente
Orozco and the French printmaker Jean Charlot. Posada, whose
imagery is reminiscent of Goya, is now considered one of Mexico's
most acerbic commentators and satirists. Although the prints are
mistakenly reproduced in halftone, which diminishes the strength of
the artist's powerful black line, ``Posada's Broadsheets''
nonetheless offers an insightful analysis of both the art and the
history of the time when it was created. _ STEVEN HELLER

   &UR; ORDINARY PARADISE
</P>
<P>
   By Laura Furman.
</P>
<P>
   Winedale, $22.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   When Minnie Furman died at the age of 47 of ovarian cancer, she
left behind a husband and three daughters. The family had coped
with her impending death by pretending she was not seriously ill.
Laura Furman, then 13, and her sisters were never allowed to
express their grief. But ``Ordinary Paradise'' shows how a
devastating loss, acknowledged or not, can seep through the family
psyche. Furman, whose novels include ``Tuxedo Park,'' responded to
her mother's death and her new stepmother's theatrical indifference
by trying to sleep away her depression, cutting her finger with a
razor blade, attempting suicide after a failed romance; a disease
contracted from another lover left her unable to bear children.
Furman writes a dreamy, imagistic prose. By turns emotionally muted
and fiercely angry, she is forthright about the possible
distortions of memory. However, for all its honesty and heroic
appeal, the memoir feels muffled, as if a layer of story lies
hidden. How did she lead herself from loneliness to a happy
marriage, from numbing depression to stories that would earn a
Guggenheim fellowship and publication in The New Yorker? _ ANDREA

<P>
   Essays on Art and Artists.
</P>
<P>
   By James Fenton.
</P>
<P>
   Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $25 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Reading James Fenton's essays is not unlike being taken on a
tour by an erudite but idiosyncratic guide, where detour is not at
all unusual and never beside the point. A fascinating, multilayered
essay on the sculptor Aristide Maillol, for example, offers a brief
history of the Cour Napoleon -- that is, the space at the heart of
the Louvre -- as well as Fenton's thoughts on what currently
occupies it, I. M. Pei's pyramid. ``Nobody who has glanced at this
space can possibly feel that this solution will last forever,'' he
writes. ``To believe this would be to subscribe to some theory of
the death of the history of taste.'' Fenton, the Professor of
Poetry at Oxford, is also a first-rate sleuth. In ``Seurat and the
Sewers'' he investigates, among other matters, the art historian T.
J. Clark's charge that the boys in Seurat's painting ``The
Bathers'' were bathing at a place in the Seine where undiluted
sewage was emptied (they were not). Other subjects in ``Leonardo's
Nephew'' include Freud's collection of antique statuettes, Egyptian
funerary portraits and Joseph Cornell. These essays educate,
enlighten, surprise and thrill, unfailingly.'' _ ROBIN LIPPINCOTT

   &UR; DANIEL DEFOE
</P>
<P>
   The Life and Strange, Surprising Adventures.
</P>
<P>
   By Richard West.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll &AMP; Graf, $26 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   This lively book rambles across the England of Daniel Defoe
(1660-1731), that realm of fops, rogues, merchants, sailors,
unctuous divines and fugitive pamphleteers. Richard West, a British
journalist, tracks Defoe's career by the books that he left
scattered along the way. Sometimes, West points out, Defoe's
imagination betrayed him. He squandered his wife's dowry and lost
heavily in the business ventures he undertook ``as wholesaler of
stockings, trader in wine and tobacco, breeder of civet cats,
promoter of diving bells or maker of bricks and pantiles.'' Defoe's
Protestant loyalties embroiled him in nasty religious quarrels. His
satirical pamphlet ``The Shortest Way With Dissenters,'' with its
straight-faced proposal for jailing and hanging Nonconformist
congregations, was taken seriously; the government hunted down the
author. The clearest surviving portrait of Defoe comes not from an
engraved frontispiece but from the notice placing a price on his
head. After pleading guilty to charges of ``seditious libel,''
Defoe spent time in Newgate Prison, the same grim jail frequented
by Moll Flanders. Hailing Defoe's travelogue ``Tour of Great
Britain'' as his masterpiece, West maddeningly devotes 84 pages to
a town-by-town precis, while shoehorning ``Robinson Crusoe'' into
one short chapter. Without posturing, this traditional
life-and-times approach raises critical questions about a writer
who packed his books with partisan judgments but whose own life can
only be reconstructed from asides in those same books. _ ALLEN D.

   &UR; LEARNING A TRADE
</P>
<P>
   A Craftsman's Notebooks, 1955-1997.
</P>
<P>
   By Reynolds Price.
</P>
<P>
   Duke University, $34.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The novelist, poet and playwright Reynolds Price laments that
through four decades of cultivating novice writers at Duke, he has
failed to convince them of ``the absolute necessity of discovering
one's own best self-tailored means of working daily.'' Try not to
write, he has famously counseled wannabes; ``if you can not do it,
don't do it.'' A living lesson in vocational compulsion, Price has
published his working notebooks from 42 years to illustrate how
``satisfactions'' can arise from incalculable time spent ``in a
harmless (and conceivably benign) form of making.'' Price has
worked out countless fictions within his ``handy debating room,''
where a given page may echo the anxiety of influence (``I burn to
do as fine a thing'' as Joyce's novella ``The Dead''), recall a
talk with Eudora Welty at Schrafft's or appoint his own
self-spurring tasks like ``Spin a sequence -- any sequence -- just
to see where you go,'' or wrestle with the problem of ``how to
suggest that life keeps on'' between scenes ``without giving the
impression that everybody simply slept or was unconscious.''
``Learning a Trade'' moves along appealingly because, while Price
pulls deep and often from his own memories, he never confuses a
notebook with a journal or diary -- forms he finds to be ``a
repetitive bore at the end of a day.'' Rather, his life is ``all in
the work,'' he once claimed. ``Not a secret spared.'' _ RENEE TURSI

 CONFESSIONS OF A LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Autobiography of Larry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   By Garry Shandling with David Rensin.
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The publicity over the final curtain of ``Seinfeld'' unfairly
obscured the simultaneous exit, after six seasons, of ``The Larry
Sanders Show,'' a comedy series so funny and risque as to make
``Seinfeld'' look positively bland. A glimpse behind the scenes at
an imaginary talk show, ``Larry Sanders'' starred its own creator,
Garry Shandling, as the neurotic host and featured celebrities
playing themselves as his guests in a mind-bending mixture of
fiction and reality. Now Larry, predictably bored and depressed in
retirement, has written an ``autobiography.'' We are told all about
his childhood -- lots of abuse, natch, but at least not of the
sexual variety. ``I had to wait until my first marriage to
experience sexual abuse,'' Larry confesses, ``and then there was
plenty of it.'' That marriage, by the way, went nowhere fast. ``If
only I could have loved her as much as I loved the audience,''
Larry mourns. ``Or maybe if there could have been 200 of her.''
Larry also reveals how he clawed his way to the top, lists the many
famous women he has slept with and gossips about the show's guests.
Sadly, the Larry who narrates this book is not the ``real''
backstage Larry -- whiny and passive-aggressive -- but merely Larry
the stand-up monologist, so the autobiography lacks the dimension
and bite of the television show. Still, for ``Larry Sanders'' fans
who haven't stopped craving that old Sunday night fix, even
watered-down Larry is a treat, and a lot better than no Larry at
all. _ BROOKE ALLEN

<P>
   &UR; RING AROUND THE MOON
</P>
<P>
   By Mary Burnett Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow, $24 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Mary Burnett Smith's second novel is, at least in part, a
meditation on fatherhood as seen through the eyes of her narrator,
a black woman named Amy Beale, who is looking back to her childhood
and particularly to the year when she turned 11 and witnessed the
meltdown of her parents' marriage. Young Amy is a precocious tomboy
living with her family just outside Philadelphia on the eve of
World War II. Initially, her days are consumed with adolescent
concerns: the nappiness of her hair, her budding friendship with a
white girl, her affection for her brothers, her mother's weariness
and the increasingly meddling attitude of her aunts. Race and class
conflicts erupt regularly between neighbors and extended family
members in Amy's small town, but as time passes she discovers that
the most volatile member of the community is her own father.
Smith's strength as a writer lies in the relaxed complexity of her
characters: the bad aspects of good women and the wise thoughts of
foolish men are utterly plausible. Smith also succeeds in capturing
the psychology of children: Amy views every event in her life as a
direct response to her own thoughts and actions. In this way,
``Ring Around the Moon'' is transformed from a sketch of a father
to a portrait of the daughter who reluctantly bears witness to his
failings. _ MAGGIE GALEHOUSE

   &UR; THE BOOK OF MEMORIES
</P>
<P>
   By Ana Maria Shua.
</P>
<P>
   University of New Mexico, cloth, $32.50; paper, $16.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The notion of memory as ``not only cerebral but emerging from
the heart'' is ``a rabbinical creation,'' writes Ilan Stavans,
editor of New Mexico's Jewish Latin America series, in the
introduction to its latest volume. Ana Maria Shua's eccentric comic
novel concerns a family of Polish Jews who emigrate to Argentina
during World War I. As translated by Dick Gerdes, ``The Book of
Memories'' gives a fictionalized account of Shua's own family's
life in Buenos Aires, drawing on the recollections of its many
members. Yet it is Grandfather Gedalia who takes center stage
through most of the narrative, whether we're hearing his own views
or merely hearing about him. In this, the novel draws on a classic
Yiddish convention, which Stavans describes as ``the unfolding of a
story while two guys talk.'' Here the voices belong to two
anonymous descendants who contradict each other about virtually
everything. ``I've . . . heard that one Sunday afternoon he took
Silvester on the trolley and then bought him a ham sandwich,'' one
reports of the patriarch. To which the other replies, ``Grandfather
Gedalia never ate pig's meat because it was against his religion.''
Back and forth the conversation flies: ``Grandfather Gedalia never
ate pig's meat in public.'' ``Grandfather Gedalia was a pig.'' At
times, though, Shua tries too hard to justify such contradictory
viewpoints, putting a strain on her lively characterizations. _

   &UR; NECESSARY FICTIONS
</P>
<P>
   By Barbara Croft.
</P>
<P>
   University of Pittsburgh, $22.50 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in this curiously unaffecting collection of short
fiction is unhappy, and the reasons are always very clear. While
set in the present or near-present, the world of ``Necessary
Fictions'' is an oddly retrograde one in which men are held
accountable for the happiness of women and children, and women are
unable to assume responsibility for their own lives. We meet women
who studied art, but settled for money; a woman who wanted to teach
English, but married a self-absorbed workingman. Men are unhappy
because they lack education or because their fathers had no respect
for their education or because they are alcoholics or because they
are Vietnam veterans. Women who try to be strong die of cancer.
While technically proficient, the stories are unconvincing because
their plotting relies so frequently on such cliches. _ GLORIA

   &UR; THE ESSENCE OF THE THING
</P>
<P>
   By Madeleine St. John.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll &AMP; Graf, $22 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   When Nicola's lover suddenly asks her to vacate the London
apartment they have (she thinks) happily shared, she falls into an
emotional maelstrom most readers will recognize. Very quickly, her
initial disbelief turns to self-accusatory scrutiny, then grief, as
Jonathan abruptly declares, ``This relationship is getting us
nowhere. I don't love you.'' Predictably enough, time, work and
friends are the crucial elements in Nicola's recovery. And it is
only after she has secured a glamorous new job in a different town
and reconciled herself to her loss that Jonathan realizes how empty
his life has become and asks to be taken back. In this novel, which
was a finalist for the 1997 Booker Prize, Madeleine St. John shapes
what might have been a bathetic story into a brisk, sophisticated
and artful narrative buoyed by an ironic use of the religious
imagery of hell, salvation and resurrection. (A friend likens
Nicola's failed affair to ``an Act of God in its suddenness, its
comprehensiveness, its magnitude.'') Through these associations,
St. John convincingly illustrates that ``nothing is as serious as
love,'' even when the misunderstandings and discord between the
sexes appear to be God's little joke on the human race. _ GARDNER

 THE AGE OF TERROR

 &UR; DREAMS OF HIS RUSSIAN WINTERS
</P>
<P>
   BY CALEB CRAIN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ALTHOUGH most of David Plante's protagonists are Roman
Catholics, he himself seems to be a Druid. He likes the woods --
literal and figurative -- and his novels are constantly wandering
into them. His alter ego, Daniel Francoeur, found the woods haunted
with ancestral spirits in ``The Country.'' In ``The Woods,'' the
same trees were haunted by the girl next door, who hoped for a
tumble with young Daniel to break the tedium of summer with her
parents. No such luck -- as it turned out in ``The Catholic,''
Daniel preferred men. Like most novels of homosexual
self-discovery, ``The Catholic'' was set in a city, but that didn't
keep out the trees. Daniel still erred into such a metaphorical
thicket as to vow that ``I'll go into the woods, and come out when
I'm cured or I'll die in the woods.'' To which an impatient friend
responded, ``I wish you'd stay out of those woods.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Joe, the 23-year-old American hero of Plante's new
novel, ``The Age of Terror,'' awakens alone and feverish on a sofa
in an empty Moscow apartment, it is not altogether unexpected that
he imagines ``a great forest in the falling snow'' and hurries off
to the railway station with a wish to be ``deep in the Russian
forests.'' It is not unexpected, but it is nonetheless bewildering.
Almost nothing Plante tells us about Joe explains this desire.
(Later, Joe speculates that in an earlier lifetime, in primeval
Rus, he must have ``prayed in the forest to a hole in the earth.'')
It's a laughably soulful thing to want, but that's because Joe is
trying to prove that he has a soul. Every so often, he presses his
face against a wall or pulls someone's head to his chest with a cry
or stages some other heartfelt pose. The age of ``The Age of
Terror'' is the socially chaotic final years of the Soviet Union,
but it is also the age of 23.
</P>
<P>
   It is the age, in other words, of freedom. The conceit of
Plante's novel is that political self-determination is settling on
Russia just as adult free will is settling on Joe. And both
parties, unfortunately, are succumbing to what Kierkegaard would
have called ``possibility's despair.'' Everything seems arbitrary;
nothing seems necessary. If Joe and the country in which he finds
himself are drifting toward what a happier person would call
``evil,'' it is because they are both pushing to find a meaning or
a limit that will hold.
</P>
<P>
   These are very Russian woods; Dostoyevsky may own them outright.
But Plante has been here before, in a peculiarly American way.
During the 20-page gay sex scene at the center of ``The Catholic,''
Plante's hero felt a similar vertigo. In that novel, as Daniel
experienced what he thought would always be forbidden, his
imagination skidded away from any moral tether: ``If I used my
imagination, really put it to use to invent experiments meant for
shocking discoveries, not even the most original imaginings would,
finally, appear to me original enough. . . . And because my
imagination would keep trying and trying for greater and greater
originality, it might try to make of me an original -- that is, a
grotesque.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Age of Terror,'' Joe tries out Daniel's experiment.
Daydreaming in a Leningrad hotel, he imagines a series of horrors:
a still-living body bricked into a wall, a hairy-backed rapist,
various mutilations. The worst he can come up with is a
concentration camp scenario in which he and a girl are ordered to
copulate; when they fail, their throats are slit. As he reveals
later to Gerald -- an alcoholic, sadistic American who recruits
Russian girls for prostitution abroad -- Joe lost his faith in God
when he became impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Joe seems to be confusing sexual guilt with religious guilt, and
his penitence leads him into a messy Oedipal triangle. As the
father figure, there is Gerald, a ``bad man'' ogre who challenges
``good boy'' Joe, and neither Joe nor Plante altogether resists
Gerald's overripe, degenerate appeal. But the official love
interest is a woman named Zoya -- or, rather, two women named Zoya.
</P>
<P>
   The first was both a real person and a figure of Soviet
propaganda, a Russian partisan tortured to death by the Nazis.
Plante quotes the poem that canonized her (which won the State
Prize of the U.S.S.R. in 1943) as his novel's epigraph. A
Stalinist-era engraving depicts this Zoya as matronly and
unremarkable, a comrade with a sensible haircut. But Plante has
chosen as his frontispiece an actual photo of her corpse. It's an
upsetting image -- a body lying in the snow, one breast exposed,
the other cut open -- of erotic, patriotic gore. The shock of
seeing it is what sends Joe to Russia. ``The Age of Terror''
meditates on this photo as on a religious icon.
</P>
<P>
   But Stalinism is no longer a religion that commands faith. Thus
the second, fictional, Zoya despises the woman she was named after.
When Joe first glimpses her, stalking him through the streets of
Leningrad, this Zoya is a figure of cold war fantasy, but Plante's
clean, careful prose quickly resolves her into something more
compromised and interesting: ``Her long suede coat was stained, and
her boots, of patent leather, were cracked, the fake leather
peeling from the heels, and her hat was of yellow cat fur.'' This
Zoya sells out Russia instead of dying for it. Although she is
collaborating (and sleeping) with Gerald, Joe falls for her,
woozily misreading her socioeconomic despair as existential angst.
In fact, Zoya has not lost her faith, but this discovery comes too
late for Joe, who colludes, half-wittingly, in turning Zoya into
her namesake's revenant.
</P>
<P>
   Plante colludes a little, too. The trouble is in that
photograph. Plante knows it's propaganda, but, like his hero, he
longs too much for belief to look at it any way but earnestly. More
dangerously, the photo's near-pornographic glamour seems to arouse
in Plante the same impulse toward the grotesque that Daniel
struggled with in ``The Catholic.'' ``The Age of Terror'' comes
close to confusing a need for faith with a desire to be seduced.
</P>
<P>
   This is rich if treacherous terrain. Plante leads his readers
into some deep, dark woods, though they may have to find their way
out on their own.

 &UR; TRAGEDY OF AN OPTIMIST
</P>
<P>
   BY VICTOR BROMBERT
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The voice of Primo Levi (1919-87) is perhaps the most moving to
have come out of the hell of the Nazi death camps. Its special
resonance has much to do with tragic paradoxes at the core of his
work. Levi wanted to speak for those who did not survive, yet he
questioned his trustworthiness as a witness. He saw it as a sacred
duty to tell the story of those who had reached the bottom of
abjection, but considered himself unworthy, even guilty, because he
came out alive. He felt compelled to denounce the horrors
perpetrated, but preferred to understand rather than judge. At
Auschwitz he had stared into the face of irrational cruelty, but he
did not give up his optimistic faith in rationality. After the
lager, or camp, there was no way for him to believe in divine
providence. Yet the same man who referred to the stories that
emerged from the camps as a ``new Bible'' ended up committing
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   When Myriam Anissimov's biography of him appeared in France in
1996, it was hailed as an important event. It was the first
full-length account of the salient episodes of Levi's life: his
growing awareness of the personal threat of Fascism, his capture by
the Fascist militia in a Resistance hideout in the Alps, his
deportation to Auschwitz, his liberation a year later by Soviet
troops, the railway odyssey of his return to his native Turin, his
work as a chemist and then as the manager of a chemical factory,
his gradual emergence as a major writer and intellectual figure.
Anissimov's book, now appearing in a shortened English translation,
provides a serious, lively, at times fervently told story that is
always sympathetic to Levi's shy personality and restrained tone.
</P>
<P>
   Anissimov is at her best evoking Levi's gentleness, his somewhat
puritanical and introverted reserve, his compulsion to talk about
what he saw and suffered in the camp. She deals perceptively with
his rude awakening to anti-Semitism in the late years of
Mussolini's rule, when the unexpected racial laws of 1938 stunned
not only Italian Jews (some of whom had been loyal Fascists since
the early days of the regime) but most other Italians as well. Levi
belonged to a thoroughly assimilated, well-to-do Piedmontese Jewish
family. Like most of his friends, he attended the liceo classico,
and then obtained a doctorate in chemistry. (This later saved him
from the gas chambers at Auschwitz when he was put to work as a
specialized slave laborer in a laboratory.) His cultural references
were Dante and Manzoni, even Melville and Conrad, rather than
Jewish lore, with which he was altogether unfamiliar. Auschwitz,
with Yiddish as the dominant language, was for him a culture shock.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's background helps explain why, at one of the high moments
in ``Survival in Auschwitz'' (the correct title is ``If This Is a
Man''), he refers at length to the 26th canto of Dante's
``Inferno,'' dealing with the figure of Ulysses, and describes his
own victorious struggle to reconstitute in his mind half-forgotten
lines of poetry. Some readers might have wondered why a Jewish
victim of the Shoah should have turned to a medieval Christian poem
when bearing witness to a collective atrocity that could not
possibly be justified in theological or poetic terms. But for Levi
the recourse to Dante's poem in order to teach Italian to a
French-speaking Alsatian fellow inmate in a German extermination
camp deep inside Polish territory became a symbol of universality
and of the possible survival of meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's reputation is largely based on his account of the
monstrous Nazi machine for reducing human beings to beasts before
dispatching them to the gas chambers. The lager is described as a
geometric nightmare filled with the cries of hunger and pain in all
the languages of Europe. With a sobriety made more sharply painful
by occasional humor, Levi depicts the unspeakable: the deportation
of entire families in sealed wagons, the beatings, the gruesome
work, the cold and filth, the merciless struggle for survival, the
``selections'' for extermination. But Levi's most original
contribution, later elaborated in ``The Drowned and the Saved,'' is
the analysis of what he called the ``gray zone,'' the contaminating
conditions under which victims are tempted into becoming
accomplices in the atrocities committed against them.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of such a gray zone is corrosive of moral values
and moral choices. To be a victim does not exclude guilt. Levi
deals lucidly with a particularly dehumanizing reality of the
camps, where the SS structured a hierarchy of violence that
delegated to selected prisoners, known as Kapos, arbitrary and
often homicidal power over others. At the lowest rung of this
hierarchy of degradation were the Sonderkommando squads of Jews
forced to stoke the crematoriums with the gassed Jewish victims.
</P>
<P>
   It has been suggested that Levi's love of science and his
training as a chemist explain his disposition to observe, describe
and analyze under the most appalling circumstances. His faith in
rational understanding led him to view the lager experience, in his
own terms, as a ``gigantic biological and social experiment.'' He
detected fundamental truths about human nature in the social
structures of the camp, claiming that this ``cruel laboratory'' was
a ``ferocious sociological observatory.'' He concluded, hoping not
to be misunderstood, that for him and others the lager, the camp,
``had been a university.'' Rather than indulge in self-pity, Levi
preferred to exercise, perhaps as a form of self-preservation, an
anthropologist's curiosity. Throughout his life, he retained his
faith in the clarity of thinking, his reverence for language and
communication. His love of philology went along with a durable
distaste for obscure writing. In ``Other People's Trades'' he
denounced the cult of the ineffable and of hermetic literature as a
form of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to write a biography of an author whose books are
largely autobiographical. Paraphrase is a constant danger. But
Anissimov has done conscientious research and provides valuable
background on the Jewish community in Turin, the details of camp
brutalities (about which Levi is himself often reticent), the
involvement of the industrial empire I. G. Farben in the
exploitation of cheap slave labor in the camps, the slow
recognition in Italy of Levi's literary accomplishments. She makes
sound use of interviews and newspaper accounts. And she can be
moving, as when she recounts the last night 650 Jews spent in the
Italian transit camp in Fossoli di Carpi before they were deported
by the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   This important book is not always served well by Steve Cox's
translation. Rendering into English a study written in French about
an author who wrote in Italian poses certain problems. It does not
help that the English version makes cuts, and often reshuffles the
materials in an obvious effort to shorten the original at the risk
of producing discontinuities. Even more damaging are the liberties
taken with the text by sometimes adding parts of sentences to what
the author said, or by making her say what she did not say.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's range is wider than is generally known. He wrote some
poetry -- not technically ambitious, but expressive in a dark mood
of the recurrent anguish and anger of the survivor. In addition to
the two books devoted to the death camp experience and to the
colorful narrative of his homeward journey through Eastern Europe
in ``The Reawakening'' (better translated as ``The Truce''), he has
written short stories (``Moments of Reprieve''), cautionary tales
in the form of science fiction (``The Sixth Day and Other Tales''),
two significant novels (``If Not Now, When?'' -- a colorful story
of Jewish guerrilla fighters in the forests of Belarus -- and ``The
Wrench,'' about the epic technological adventures of an expert
rigger), as well as an unclassifiable masterpiece, ``The Periodic
Table,'' which blends autobiographical elements with a humorous
essayistic fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Levi led an essentially sedentary existence. Auschwitz had been
the one adventure of his life. After his return to Turin, he
continued to live in the apartment where he was born, and he died
in the same building. He remained attached to his Piedmontese roots
and his Italian heritage. Like most Italian Jews, he continued to
feel at home among his countrymen, the vast majority of whom were
not anti-Semitic and who, even in the darkest moments of the war,
had shown much humaneness. But he had learned to be critical,
retrospectively, of political blindness. He deplored the lethargy
of his generation, which had viewed Fascism with distaste and
ineffectual irony without actively opposing it. Auschwitz taught
him a political lesson. It also taught him a great deal about the
broader community of Jews, especially the almost eradicated
Ashkenazi culture of Eastern Europe, which he came to admire.
Before writing ``If Not Now, When?'' he set out to learn Yiddish.
</P>
<P>
   His eagerness to listen and understand has appeared to some as a
limitation. His generally optimistic stance, it is true, does not
seem to come to grips with the irrational. But his hope that
problems can be solved by good will and reason also explains his
deep frustration, even despair, as he began to realize that the
younger generation no longer wanted to listen to him. His
depression over revisionist denials and the impossibility of a
meaningful dialogue with the young may be related to his suicidal
impulse, though Anissimov is ever so delicate about suggesting any
clear causal relation.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper message of Levi goes beyond the honesty, dignity and
self-respect of his testimony. It demonstrates humanistic pride in
the power of words and in the human struggle against matter. It
speaks of the essential fragility of human institutions and of
tragedy when they are allowed to collapse. For without civilized
institutions, human nature is naked and raw. In that sense, Levi
was hardly a naive optimist. And we might do well to ponder the
warning given in his last book, ``The Drowned and the Saved,'' of
how stripped we are when we allow the ideology of death to take
over: ``Reason, art and poetry are no help in deciphering a place
from which they have been banished.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Jan. 9, at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)
indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders for a
book.

   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; If, as the philosophers say, eyes are the windows
to the soul; and if, as many actors say, their job is to project
their innermost feelings onto the screen, imagine how tough it was
to make a movie like ``At First Sight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First Sight'' examines the difficult relationship between a
New York architect played by Mira Sorvino and Val Kilmer as a blind
masseur who temporarily regains his sight. Based on a true story by
Oliver Sacks, the doctor-writer who also provided the source
material for the film ``Awakenings,'' ``Sight'' keeps its focus on
the couple's problems rather than the more clinical aspects of the
blind man's condition.
</P>
<P>
   That established, falling in love without the requisite longing
gazes into one another's eyes was quite the acting challenge.
</P>
<P>
   For one of them, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of work, very difficult,'' says Chatsworth native
Kilmer, who has impersonated everyone from rock demon Jim Morrison
to Batman to Moses (in the animated ``Prince of Egypt''). ``I had
to make his whole persona, his whole vibe, seem effortless, because
there are a whole lot of things that take effort when you're blind,
but people like Virgil don't want people to know are an effort for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilmer did have expert help. A longtime neighbor in Santa Fe,
N.M., is a blinded Vietnam veteran. A blind masseur from the New
York suburbs also provided invaluable technical advice (``he was
always lobbying for more scenes with the dog,'' Kilmer notes. ``As
you can imagine, it's a very important relationship''). And Shirl
and Barbara Jennings, the real-life couple on whom the film's story
is based, visited the New York location both before and during
production last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bulk of the work was necessarily internal. And
sometimes traumatizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took months of practice,'' Kilmer reveals. ``I spent a lot
of time with my eyes closed in my room, or out on the street with
opaque contacts on so I couldn't see. I'd do that alone and with
friends, and it was actually more frustrating with friends. They'd
say, `Watch out!' They don't say watch out for what.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I was out alone, I'd find people would help, but they
also didn't. It's a very deep experience to just stand there on a
street and say to someone you know is near to you, `Excuse me, can
you point me uptown?' and they don't answer. They just don't want
to bother.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilmer's hard work made things easy for Sorvino ... at least up
to the point where her well-meaning Amy convinces Virgil to undergo
radical sight-restoring surgery, which leads to a whole new set of
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really seemed like Val was blind when we were playing the
scenes,'' Oscar winner Sorvino (``Mighty Aphrodite'') reports.
``His face responded to what I was saying, but his eyes would not
give me any flicker of response when I was looking right into them.
It must have been very hard for him, but it was great for me. If
you look, you'll see that my physical behavior is very different in
those scenes. I act like a person who's not being watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a certain way, the character is most vulnerable at those
points. All of her defenses are down because she's not feeling
judged or observed or anything. She's just feeling listened to.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's a powerfully seductive notion. And exactly what
director Irwin Winkler was aiming for, at least in the first,
falling-in-love part of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to present a blind man who was somebody an
audience might, in some way, feel pity for,'' says Winkler, a
successful producer (``Rocky,'' ``Raging Bull'') who lately has
turned to directing (``The Net,'' ``Guilty by Suspicion''). ``Also,
we're doing a romance, so I had to cast somebody that women in the
theater could consider having an affair with. I think doing that
with a blind man takes a bit with most women; but if he looks like
Val Kilmer, it might not take that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Winkler had heard the stories, though. Several directors,
including ``Batman Forever's'' Joel Schumacher and ``The Island of
Dr. Moreau's'' John Frankenheimer, publicly have accused Kilmer of
wanton misbehavior on their sets. But Winkler checked with his
close friend and Kilmer's ``Heat'' co-star Robert De Niro, who
vouched for the younger actor's talent and professionalism. Ditto
``Heat'' director Michael Mann, another Winkler pal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I spent some time with Val and we got along great,''
Winkler says. ``He has been terrific, and we've become very close
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordial as the atmosphere on the set may have been, the movie
had to chart the deterioration of Amy and Virgil's relationship
after he regains his vision and finds it almost impossible to
function in a world of assaultive new sensations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have only been 20 cases recorded in the last 200 years
of somebody having gone from sightlessness to sight,'' Winkler
explains. ``And most of the time it ended up tragically. There are
several cases cited in the Oliver Sacks piece where people
committed suicide. They just couldn't deal with a world that was so
violent to them, so difficult to suddenly be thrown into.''
</P>
<P>
   That, fortunately, was not the case with Shirl Jennings, whose
vision gradually faded away again after his operation. Naturally,
the interim was marked by unique stresses, and they formed the core
of ``At First Sight's'' drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was even harder after Virgil gains his sight,'' Kilmer
explains. ``The premise of this story couldn't be more simple and
complex: What if you fall in love at first sight and you can't see?
This is a true story, and a true love story. But even though it's
her love and belief that leads him through this experience of
seeing, at the same time she's trying to make him something that
he's not. That's one of his points of view; he's right and he's not
right about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Telling this fascinating medical story, but with the emphasis
really on the human relations between the two people, appealed to
me,'' Sorvino adds. ``And on their flawed personalities, rather
than a kind of ideal, Hollywood-esque situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to make a special effects movie; I always felt
this was a very personal story,'' Winkler confirms. ``I didn't want
to make a movie where, every time when it's Virgil's point of view,
something is out of focus or the dimension is different or
something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he was cured from the eye disease that he had, I wanted
Virgil to see normally. He sees exactly what we see; the difference
is, he doesn't know what he's seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad metaphor for troubled relationships everywhere. &QL;

`TURKS` A COP FAMILY WITH ONE BAD APPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; If you watch tonight's premiere of ``Turks,'' you
are more than likely to have this reaction: ``Haven't I seen this
before?''
</P>
<P>
   The CBS police drama about a Chicago family is predictable and
often cookie-cutter.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be surprised if your second thought is: ``This isn't
half-bad.''
</P>
<P>
   What separates this from many like it, including ``Trinity''
(which already has been taken off the fall schedule), is William
Devane (``Knots Landing''). The television veteran is undoubtedly a
star of the medium. He oozes with charisma, and in this vehicle,
with a close-cropped hairdo, Devane grounds the show.
</P>
<P>
   He spends a lot of time working and drinking with the boys after
work, leaving his wife lonely. This causes her to turn to the
church for companionship. Their three children are Joey, a
no-nonsense cop paired with an African-American partner; Mike, a
husband and father who is struggling to make sergeant; and Pauly,
the brainy college kid who gets mixed up with some bad characters.
</P>
<P>
   The writing is loaded with cliches and the show is predictable.
One of the story lines was almost lifted directly from the
``Trinity'' opener. Pauly not only gets mixed up with the wrong
crowd, he drives the getaway van at a warehouse robbery only to be
caught and given a stern warning by his own brother, Joey. This
comes back to haunt Joey.
</P>
<P>
   The best scene of the pilot episode comes before the credits,
when two thugs learn the hard way that you don't rob a cop hangout.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, ``Turks'' smoothly shifts from a family drama to a
police drama. This is an emotional brood, who all live on the same
block and yell at one other constantly. (Their poor neighbors.)
</P>
<P>
   They all get together at the end of the first episode for a
pickup game of basketball (which, incidentally, is how the first
episode of ``Trinity'' started).
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you've seen it before. But, hey, you've seen worse. &QL;

SPANISH-LANGUAGE STATION CONTINUE TO DOMINATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Three Spanish-language stations took the top
places in the latest quarterly ratings, illustrating the continued
dominance of Spanish programming in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican regional music KSCA-FM (101.9) placed first with 6.9
percent of the listening audience ages 12 and over. In second place
for the ratings period covering Sept. 24 to Dec. 16 was Spanish
adult-contemporary radio KLVE-FM (107.5) with a share of 6.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tied for third place with a 4.1 percent share was Mexican
regional music station KLAX-FM (97.9), which nearly doubled its
audience share in one year, and hip-hop KPWR-FM (105.9). The latter
station _ known as Power 106 _ grabbed the highest ranking among
English-language stations, although its audience consists largely
of English-speaking Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Among talk stations, KFI-AM (640) is tops by far, moving up to
fifth place and a 3.9 percent share in the fall, while KABC-AM
(790) dropped to 14th place with a 2.4 percent audience share, its
lowest position in nearly a decade. The retooled KABC tied with
increasingly popular talk outlet KLSX-FM (97.1).
</P>
<P>
   Newly revamped Glendale-based talker KIEV-AM (870) jumped to
28th place and a 0.8 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours, KFI's Bill Handel is circling KLSX's Howard
Stern, the top English-language morning personality. Handel edged
up from a 3.8 percent share to a 4.3 average quarter-hour rating.
Stern dropped from a 5.1 to a 4.7 audience share.
</P>
<P>
   But the numero uno morning personality in the area was KSCA's
Renan Almendarez Coello, who extended his lead and gained a
stunning 10.5 percent share in the fall, while KLVE's Pepe Baretto
placed second with a 7 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   Top-40 KIIS-FM (102.7), meanwhile, continues to dominate as the
top station for cumulative listening, a position the Burbank
station has held for six consecutive Arbitron quarterly surveys.
</P>
<P>
   In the sought-after 25-to-54 ratings race, KLSX afternoon-drive
talker Tom Leykis is No. 1 with a 3.0 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   EXIT THE NASTYMAN: Overnight host the Nastyman exits KLSX while
ex-Power 106 promotions director John Boyle and assistant Jeff
Carroll take over the shift. ... Ex-San Diego pop-alternative disc
jockey Greg Simms succeeds Larry Morgan middays at KYSR-FM (98.7).
... Sports talk KXTA-AM (1150) hires radio newcomer Derrick Hall as
John Ireland's morning co-host. Hall was previously public
relations director for the Dodgers. ... KABC afternoon driver Larry
Elder will soon be syndicated by the ABC Radio Network. &QL;

HOW TO COPE WITH LOSING A JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last year was the most brutal year of the decade
for job cuts nationwide, according to the outplacement firm of
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas. Last year's 677,795 cuts surpassed
the worst previous carnage, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been laid off for the first time _ assuming you
don't work in the high-tech sector _ you may feel a sense of
foreboding. Take heart and try these steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Take time to grieve, but not to wallow. Losing a job is one of
the most stressful things in life. It's perfectly natural to feel
hurt and angry, to think you were cheated out of something you
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   So cry, scream, get counseling, take a vacation, do whatever it
takes (within those darned moral and legal boundaries, of course).
Then move on. Otherwise those negative feelings will come across in
a job interview.
</P>
<P>
   _ Open the wound. Understand why you lost your job and what it
means for your future. Don't be too quick to let yourself off the
hook.
</P>
<P>
   If your plant closed or your company went out of business, you
might be in a dying industry. If you stay in it, be prepared to be
laid off again.
</P>
<P>
   If you were wiped out in a merger, was everyone in your company
dumped? The industry is consolidating; expect more cuts. Were all
the people in your classification let go? Maybe your skills are
becoming obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part. If some peers didn't get dumped, why
did you? If you made a mistake, that's all right. We all do. But if
you don't acknowledge it, you won't learn from it.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful about falling back on excuses like:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``My boss was a jerk.'' That boss is history, so it doesn't
really matter if he was a jerk or Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A lot of middle managers got dumped.'' Yeah, but some were
kept. What did they have that you didn't? Be objective. Would you
have kept the job if you had an MBA or better technical skills?
Were you too tough or too easy? Is your area of expertise too
narrow? If you don't get more training, will it be impossible to
land another middle management job?
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It was age discrimination.'' Then sue. But before you call a
lawyer, ask yourself one question: Do you have skills that a person
10 years younger doesn't have? Forget what the law says and apply
some common sense. If you're 45 and you can't offer an employer
more than a 35-year-old can, something is seriously wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to be out of work for six months. This is for strategic
purposes only. You'll probably get hired long before the six months
are up.
</P>
<P>
   But assume you are out of work the whole time. If all you've
done is hunt for a job in those six months, you'll look less
attractive and more desperate.
</P>
<P>
   You've been given a gift here. Take the six months to build up
your skills and to examine other careers.
</P>
<P>
   Are there consulting projects you could do? How about a
temporary job that expands your skills? Could you do an internship
to help you into a new field? Would a couple of college classes
help? The first thing I would do is learn enough to design my own
Web page. You can teach yourself, it's not rocket science and it
would impress any employer who is not a complete moron.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of businesses are establishing Web pages, but often they
can't or won't spend money on consultants. Don't you think they'd
love a self-starter who knew their field _ whether it's personal
finance or medicine or auto mechanics _ and could also spend a few
hours a month on their Web page?
</P>
<P>
   But that's just my strategy. What's yours?

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, Jan. 21:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSEWARES-SHOW (Chicago) _ If your home is like mine, it is an
imperfect thing, resistant to most efforts to make it a sanctuary,
even a little tyrannical in its dogged inconveniences. The bookcase
shelf isn't quite within arm's reach of the desk chair, the toaster
won't release an imperfectly sliced bagel, the bathroom vent
mysteriously funnels in rap music from some other apartment in the
building. (I assume it's in the building.) It was with this in mind
that I visited the International Housewares Show at the McCormick
Center here last week, where one of the themes, according to the
National Housewares Manufacturers Association, which sponsors the
show, was the ``healthy home.'' By Bruce Weber.

   MICHAEL-MARKETING (Undated) _ Moving from muscle power to brain
power is never easy. That's the task that faces Michael Jordan, now
that he has decided to leave behind burning glycogen in favor of

</P>
<P>
   CALIF-HARRISON-HOUSE (Undated) _ ``We miss New York all the
time,'' said Jerry Harrison, the keyboard player for Talking Heads,
the rock band that emerged from clubs like CBGB into the mainstream
in the 1970s with hits like ``Psycho Killer'' and ``Burning Down
the House.'' Since the early '90s, Harrison has worked as a record
producer, living with his wife and children on a mountaintop dense
with redwoods _ and on many mornings shrouded with fog _ near
Sausalito in Marin County, Calif. To ease the transition from a
loft in SoHo to the quasi-wilderness of Marin County, Harrison and
his wife, Carol, bought a 1960s redwood house, gutted it and
replicated elements of their Prince Street loft _ white walls,
slate floors and a stainless-steel staircase _ in the rustic shell.
Call it SoHo Goes Marin. By Elaine Louie.

<P>
   TULIKIVI-FIREPLACE (Bozeman, Mont.) _ The fire had burned down
to a heap of coals. With a gloved hand, Randy LaFerr opened the
oven door of his monumental Tulikivi soapstone fireplace from
Finland, and with a long-handle rake pushed the coals out the back
and into the stove below. The soapstone bricks that line the oven
were around 750 degrees, the perfect temperature, LaFerr said, to
start the hors d'oeuvres. He placed a plate of goat cheese and
cured olives with marinara sauce in the oven. In five minutes it
was bubbling gently behind the glass door. Tulikivi _ ``fire
stone'' in Finnish _ has rekindled the art of making huge heaters
out of native gray soapstone. By Jim Robbins.

<P>
   NY-REAL-ESTATE (New York) _ In what has become one of the

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I recently attended an academic conference where a well-known
neo-conservative historian spent nearly an hour chastising the
audience for being post-modern relativists.
 &HT;    She implored the scholars to seek ``truth'' -- which appeared to
mean recovering a unified and coherent past invested with Christian
theological meaning.
 &HT;    While some of her remarks were interesting, she also appeared
angry and bitter. Without personally knowing her audience, she
attacked the work of some present. She presumed to know the motives
behind their ideas and dismissed them as people without religious
convictions.
 &HT;    Throughout, she urged us to pursue the Truth -- a singular and
objective reality that she obviously understood and we did not.
 &HT;    After her bad-tempered tirade, I returned to my hotel room and
wearily called home. My husband and I chatted and, to cheer me up,
he put our one-year old daughter on the phone.
 &HT;    ``Hi, Emma. This is Mommy.''
 &HT;    ``Hi Omma,'' came the gently tentative reply.
 &HT;    My heart melted. Truth? All the truth I needed to know was in
the sound of that tiny voice.
 &HT;    Unfortunately for most people, truth -- especially religious
truth -- is construed as a set of intellectual propositions. Truth
is ``out there'' waiting to be discovered through science or
philosophy or history. Once found, it will be logical, orderly,
and, above all, clear. Truth will answer all our questions, ease
our doubts and erase all ambiguity.
 &HT;    So it seemed for the speaker. Although she knew nothing of my
faith, I know a little of hers through her written testimony. Once
a secular Marxist feminist, she converted in mid-life to a
traditionalist form of Roman Catholicism. Like many converts, who
take their new faith with a kind of intensity often lacking in
cradle believers, she appeared more Catholic than the pope.
 &HT;    Her life's journey had taken her from one radical truth to
another. She appeared to live in a black-and-white world where
truth is Truth and all else falsehood.
 &HT;    She, of course, is not alone. Around the globe, people are
seeking -- and perhaps finding -- the answer. The impulse to find
the Truth lies behind many political and social crusades as well as
various religious movements termed ``fundamentalism.''
 &HT;    The most obvious question rising from this worldview is: If
there is only one truth, why so many answers? Which truth is
correct if so many people believe different things?
 &HT;    These questions began to trouble Europeans in the 16th century
when a number of Protestant groups split off the medieval Catholic
church. The conundrum of religious diversity led some to reject
truth altogether and ultimately led to relativism and
privatization.
 &HT;    Thus, in the waning years of our century, those of an undogmatic
nature are unwilling to even address truth. ``Many ways to God,''
they insist, ``faith is a personal thing.''
 &HT;    I suspect many people are uncomfortable with either dogmatism or
relativism -- the two options most obvious in our culture or
churches.
 &HT;    There are, however, other ways of understanding truth.
Non-western religions construct truth in non-linear ways. Hence,
most forms of Hinduism and Buddhism avoid these problems. Perhaps
this accounts for their current popularity.
 &HT;    However helpful, most Americans are schooled in western
religions -- particularly Christianity and Judaism. Both faiths
were deeply affected by European ideas of truth and struggle
between dogmatism and relativism.
 &HT;    Although I cannot speak for Judaism as a whole, one Jewish
rabbi, Jesus, proclaimed: ``I am the truth.'' This odd statement
undermines much of what western Christians have thought about
truth. For Jesus, truth was a person -- not an idea, precept, or
doctrine.
 &HT;    Truth is a person?
 &HT;    Jesus pointed out that truth exists in relationship. To know
truth is to embrace another and embark on what theologian Martin
Buber called an ``I-Thou'' relationship. Truth, therefore, is like
all relationships: neither logical nor orderly on strictly
intellectual terms. Truth flourishes in community. Truth is messy,
fluid, and organic.
 &HT;    Truth does not demand intellectual conformity from her audience.
Truth is when people bump up next to each other, live and create
together.
 &HT;    Truth happens when a one-year old recognizes mommy's voice,
acknowledging an intimate connection beyond herself. With her
``hi,'' Emma reached toward a person who was both familiar and yet
unseen in an embryonic act of faith. Such faith is that which
carries us all toward God.
 &HT;    Religious truth is neither dogmatism nor relativism. It exists
outside those categories. It believes many things -- like love and
justice -- to be absolutely true. But it also thrives in life's
jumble of uncertainty and embraces its own limited vision. Therein,
faith is born. It raises questions, creates doubts, and fuels
ambiguity.
 &HT;    And the conference? Throughout, I wished I was with Emma
watching ``Teletubbies'' and learning something really important.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The last scene in ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is a sort of
parable of the World Wide Web. The carefully crated Ark is carried
into a gigantic government warehouse. The camera plays over row
after row after row of crates. You know the Ark is about to be
lost, once again.
</P>
<P>
   It's there. But no one knows where. So it is with the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned libraries share common organizing principles: a
card file, the Dewey decimal system. But there's no standard
taxonomy of information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of helpful librarians, you have search engines like
Yahoo!, Infoseek, and Excite. They aren't interchangeable. Some,
like Yahoo!, are organized by subject and may produce very limited
responses to queries.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like AltaVista, read and index every word of every file
they can find on the Web. Conducting a complete search on AltaVista
could be your life's work.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing shows the variations among search engines better than a
hunt for information about 401(k) retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ask HotBot to search for two different keywords _ ``40l(k)'' and
``401k'' _ and it will return with 10,866 documents containing
``401k'' and 92,115 documents with the more precise ``401(k)''
phrasing. AltaVista retrieves 70,120 documents containing ``40lk''
and 40,556 containing ``401(k).'' Yahoo! yields a mere 60 sites.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: How far you can go depends on where you start. Start
with Yahoo! and you will probably be frustrated at the paucity of
choices. Start with AltaVista and there is a good chance you'll be
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Excite (www.excite.com) offers a comfortable middle course. When
I searched for ``40lk'' or ``401(k),'' the engine returned with a
list of 20,218 Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where I wanted to go, I could visit sites put up by
corporate giants, such as www.quicken.com and
www.fidelityatwork.com (Fidelity's omnibus site for tax-deferred
savings plans), or sites maintained by individual enthusiasts such
as economist William Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other sites worth visiting, arranged according to
the three main issues in 401(k) saving:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RETIREMENT PLANNING &LR;  &QL; : Am I saving enough and getting enough
return to
retire at the appointed age?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASSET ALLOCATION &LR;  &QL; : How should I invest my money? How much risk
should I
take for a given return?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PLAN FEES &LR;  &QL; : Is my employer's 401(k) plan a good one? The
central issue
here is how much the plan costs and who pays for it. Diligent
saving and smart asset allocation won't mean much if a plan sinks
from the weight of its expenses or the mediocrity of its choices.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with retirement planning. One of the most attractive
basic retirement calculator sites belongs to an individual, Tracy
Paul, on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Her site (members.aol.com/tracy/paul/private/index.html) offers
a 401(k) accumulator and a retirement withdrawal plan. But like
other simple calculators, it omits factors like Social Security,
private pensions, and spousal earnings, so its usefulness is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   The online retirement calculator offered by Fidelity combines
your expected Social Security benefits, your expected private
pension, if any, and the projected results for your 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's site has no provision for private pensions, but it
does allow you to specify expected future living expenses, which
are just as important to a successful retirement as investment
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Many people can substantially improve their retirement outlook
by moving into housing that costs less or by moving to a part of
the country that is less expensive to live in.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, your retirement plan will work when your
accumulated financial assets equal about 20 times the annual
expenses not covered by other income sources. You get to that point
through asset allocation. The question is how to mix your
investment choices to get the highest return at the lowest risk.
</P>
<P>
   For a primer on how asset allocation can help produce a higher
return or lower risk, check out the Index Investor,
www.indexinvestor.com. Then look at William Bernstein's ``Efficient
Frontier: An Online Journal of Practical Asset Allocation''
(www.efficientfrontier.com), a site that combines dark humor with a
solid grounding in statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Another good site is Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe's new
venture, Financial Engines, at www.financialengines.com. Intended
as a service for 401(k) plans, Financial Engines forecasts the
chances that a saver will reach his or her goal with a given asset
allocation.
</P>
<P>
   And my own site, www.scottburns.com, provides a Couch Potato
Portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the investment community regularly complained
that people were too conservative as investors. But a new study by
the Employee Benefit Research Institute, www.ebri.org, indicates
that 401(k) holdings are now invested much as conventional pension
portfolios are, with just more than 60 percent in equities.
</P>
<P>
   To see if that trend holds true in the future, check in every
once in a while at www.hewitt.com/401kindex, an index of activity
in 401(k) plans; this site is maintained by Hewitt Associates, an
employee-benefits consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the cost of 401(k) plans was a non-issue for
most savers, but that's beginning to change.
</P>
<P>
   The shift from traditional, defined-benefit pension plans to
defined-contribution 401(k) plans has transformed money management
from a wholesale business into a retail one. In many cases, the
price of managing retirement assets has risen from less than 1
percent a year to more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about how these costs can affect long-term
performance, read the reports on fees from the Pension and Welfare
Benefits Administration at www.dol.gov/dol/pwba.
</P>
<P>
   A site that discusses the subject with, well, a good deal less
objectivity is 401k Scam at

</P>
<P>
   Many people can substantially improve their retirement outlook
by moving into housing that costs less or by moving to a part of
the country that is less expensive to live in.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, your retirement plan will work when your
accumulated financial assets equal about 20 times the annual
expenses not covered by other income sources. You get to that point
through asset allocation. The question is how to mix your
investment choices to get the highest return at the lowest risk.
</P>
<P>
   For a primer on how asset allocation can help produce a higher
return or lower risk, check out the Index Investor,
www.indexinvestor.com. Then look at William Bernstein's ``Efficient
Frontier: An Online Journal of Practical Asset Allocation''
(www.efficientfrontier.com), a site that combines dark humor with a
solid grounding in statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Another good site is Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe's new
venture, Financial Engines, at www.financialengines.com. Intended
as a service for 401(k) plans, Financial Engines forecasts the
chances that a saver will reach his or her goal with a given asset
allocation.
</P>
<P>
   And my own site, www.scottburns.com, provides a Couch Potato
Portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the investment community regularly complained
that people were too conservative as investors. But a new study by
the Employee Benefit Research Institute, www.ebri.org, indicates
that 401(k) holdings are now invested much as conventional pension
portfolios are, with just more than 60 percent in equities.
</P>
<P>
   To see if that trend holds true in the future, check in every
once in a while at www.hewitt.com/401kindex, an index of activity
in 401(k) plans; this site is maintained by Hewitt Associates, an
employee-benefits consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the cost of 401(k) plans was a non-issue for
most savers, but that's beginning to change.
</P>
<P>
   The shift from traditional, defined-benefit pension plans to
defined-contribution 401(k) plans has transformed money management
from a wholesale business into a retail one. In many cases, the
price of managing retirement assets has risen from less than 1
percent a year to more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about how these costs can affect long-term
performance, read the reports on fees from the Pension and Welfare
Benefits Administration at www.dol.gov/dol/pwba.

 By SCOTT BURNS  
 c.1999 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last scene in ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is a sort of
parable of the World Wide Web. The carefully crated Ark is carried
into a gigantic government warehouse. The camera plays over row
after row after row of crates. You know the Ark is about to be
lost, once again.
</P>
<P>
   It's there. But no one knows where. So it is with the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned libraries share common organizing principles: a
card file, the Dewey decimal system. But there's no standard
taxonomy of information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of helpful librarians, you have search engines like
Yahoo!, Infoseek, and Excite. They aren't interchangeable. Some,
like Yahoo!, are organized by subject and may produce very limited
responses to queries.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like AltaVista, read and index every word of every file
they can find on the Web. Conducting a complete search on AltaVista
could be your life's work.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing shows the variations among search engines better than a
hunt for information about 401(k) retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ask HotBot to search for two different keywords _ ``40l(k)'' and
``401k'' _ and it will return with 10,866 documents containing
``401k'' and 92,115 documents with the more precise ``401(k)''
phrasing. AltaVista retrieves 70,120 documents containing ``40lk''
and 40,556 containing ``401(k).'' Yahoo! yields a mere 60 sites.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: How far you can go depends on where you start. Start
with Yahoo! and you will probably be frustrated at the paucity of
choices. Start with AltaVista and there is a good chance you'll be
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Excite (www.excite.com) offers a comfortable middle course. When
I searched for ``40lk'' or ``401(k),'' the engine returned with a
list of 20,218 Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where I wanted to go, I could visit sites put up by
corporate giants, such as www.quicken.com and
www.fidelityatwork.com (Fidelity's omnibus site for tax-deferred
savings plans), or sites maintained by individual enthusiasts such
as economist William Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other sites worth visiting, arranged according to
the three main issues in 401(k) saving:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RETIREMENT PLANNING &LR;  &QL; : Am I saving enough and getting enough
return to
retire at the appointed age?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASSET ALLOCATION &LR;  &QL; : How should I invest my money? How much risk
should I
take for a given return?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PLAN FEES &LR;  &QL; : Is my employer's 401(k) plan a good one? The
central issue
here is how much the plan costs and who pays for it. Diligent
saving and smart asset allocation won't mean much if a plan sinks
from the weight of its expenses or the mediocrity of its choices.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with retirement planning. One of the most attractive
basic retirement calculator sites belongs to an individual, Tracy
Paul, on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Her site (members.aol.com/tracy/paul/private/index.html) offers
a 401(k) accumulator and a retirement withdrawal plan. But like
other simple calculators, it omits factors like Social Security,
private pensions, and spousal earnings, so its usefulness is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   The online retirement calculator offered by Fidelity combines
your expected Social Security benefits, your expected private
pension, if any, and the projected results for your 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's site has no provision for private pensions, but it
does allow you to specify expected future living expenses, which
are just as important to a successful retirement as investment
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Many people can substantially improve their retirement outlook
by moving into housing that costs less or by moving to a part of
the country that is less expensive to live in.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, your retirement plan will work when your
accumulated financial assets equal about 20 times the annual
expenses not covered by other income sources. You get to that point
through asset allocation. The question is how to mix your
investment choices to get the highest return at the lowest risk.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   If the stronger U.S. dollar lures you abroad for some seasonal
shopping, don't be one of the two out of three Americans who forget
to get a hefty rebate on their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Canada, and, to a lesser extent, Asia, a consumption
tax is built into the price of many goods and services. As a
visiting American, you're entitled to a refund on many of those
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking real money here? In some cases, yes. The rates
for consumption tax vary from country to country, from a relatively
modest 2.9 percent in Singapore to a whopping 20 percent in
Denmark, Italy and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Ireland, you must spend a minimum amount to claim a
refund. The minimum amount also varies (as little as $45 in Denmark
and as much as $340 in Switzerland and Liechtenstein), but in most
countries, you can accumulate purchases over time in order to reach
the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers may also be eligible for refunds on
business-related expenses, depending on the country. For example,
if you stay in a hotel in Germany for business, you (or your
company) can claim a refund on the 16 percent tax you pay.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, a company not based there may claim a
refund of the 17.5 percent value-added tax its employees pay for
hotels, rental cars, meals, telephone calls, trade shows, and even
marketing consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is in knowing how to get your money back. Let's say
you're in Milan, and you have no choice but to spend $2,000 on a
fabulous dress. You're entitled to a VAT refund of $400.
</P>
<P>
   The store clerk will need your passport _ always carry it when
shopping _ when he or she fills out the refund form. Each purchase
you make will be listed on the form, which must be presented to a
tax official when you leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   You must also be prepared to show the goods you purchased to the
tax-refund agent at the airport when you're flying out of any
country that's a member of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where many Americans get tripped up. If you check
your luggage before you locate a tax-refund kiosk, you might be out
of luck. The tax man can't be certain you're not trying to claim a
refund on goods purchased for a friend in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: Have the goods available for display. The refund
papers from the places of purchase will be stamped; simply mail
them in, and your charge card will be credited or you'll be sent a
check. Or you may even be handed a cash refund on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Things are a bit more complicated for the business traveler. The
rules differ widely from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   France, for example, will rebate only the 20.6 percent in VAT
paid for phone calls, marketing-consultant services, and trade-show
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The U.K., on the other hand, is relatively generous in rebating
taxes but won't do so for individuals _ only companies. And
companies can file only four times a year for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   There are firms such as EuroVAT (800-828-0609) and Fexco
(800-865-4561) that specialize in recapturing taxes due American
businesses. Their fee is generally 20 percent of the taxes
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But just as in the retail arena, the savings can be enormous.
Let's say the employees of an American-based company spend, in
total, 223 days a year in the U.K. on business.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose that these road warriors spend an average $150 a night
on hotels, $35 a day on rental cars and gasoline, and $35 a day on
meals _ all told, about $49,000 a year in travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.K. levies a 17.5 percent VAT, a company can obtain a
refund of about $8,500.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, Canada began honoring corporate claims for
refunds as well. The rates vary from province to province, but
Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Quebec will
refund not only the federal sales tax but also the provincial sales
tax, which alone can reach 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Japan says it rebates 5 percent on most business expenses, but
Karen Bostrom, a vice president of sales and marketing with
EuroVAT, says that in practice Japan generally refunds 5 percent
only on hotel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's 5 percent or 20 percent, that money is yours. Ask
for those pounds, francs, yen, or marks back. &QL;

<P>
   If the stronger U.S. dollar lures you abroad for some seasonal
shopping, don't be one of the two out of three Americans who forget
to get a hefty rebate on their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Canada, and, to a lesser extent, Asia, a consumption
tax is built into the price of many goods and services. As a
visiting American, you're entitled to a refund on many of those
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking real money here? In some cases, yes. The rates
for consumption tax vary from country to country, from a relatively
modest 2.9 percent in Singapore to a whopping 20 percent in
Denmark, Italy and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Ireland, you must spend a minimum amount to claim a
refund. The minimum amount also varies (as little as $45 in Denmark
and as much as $340 in Switzerland and Liechtenstein), but in most
countries, you can accumulate purchases over time in order to reach
the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers may also be eligible for refunds on
business-related expenses, depending on the country. For example,
if you stay in a hotel in Germany for business, you (or your
company) can claim a refund on the 16 percent tax you pay.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, a company not based there may claim a
refund of the 17.5 percent value-added tax its employees pay for
hotels, rental cars, meals, telephone calls, trade shows, and even
marketing consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is in knowing how to get your money back. Let's say
you're in Milan, and you have no choice but to spend $2,000 on a
fabulous dress. You're entitled to a VAT refund of $400.
</P>
<P>
   The store clerk will need your passport _ always carry it when
shopping _ when he or she fills out the refund form. Each purchase
you make will be listed on the form, which must be presented to a
tax official when you leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   You must also be prepared to show the goods you purchased to the
tax-refund agent at the airport when you're flying out of any
country that's a member of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where many Americans get tripped up. If you check
your luggage before you locate a tax-refund kiosk, you might be out
of luck. The tax man can't be certain you're not trying to claim a
refund on goods purchased for a friend in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: Have the goods available for display. The refund
papers from the places of purchase will be stamped; simply mail
them in, and your charge card will be credited or you'll be sent a
check. Or you may even be handed a cash refund on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Things are a bit more complicated for the business traveler. The
rules differ widely from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   France, for example, will rebate only the 20.6 percent in VAT
paid for phone calls, marketing-consultant services, and trade-show
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The U.K., on the other hand, is relatively generous in rebating
taxes but won't do so for individuals _ only companies. And
companies can file only four times a year for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   There are firms such as EuroVAT (800-828-0609) and Fexco
(800-865-4561) that specialize in recapturing taxes due American
businesses. Their fee is generally 20 percent of the taxes
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But just as in the retail arena, the savings can be enormous.
Let's say the employees of an American-based company spend, in
total, 223 days a year in the U.K. on business.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose that these road warriors spend an average $150 a night
on hotels, $35 a day on rental cars and gasoline, and $35 a day on
meals _ all told, about $49,000 a year in travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.K. levies a 17.5 percent VAT, a company can obtain a
refund of about $8,500.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, Canada began honoring corporate claims for
refunds as well. The rates vary from province to province, but
Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Quebec will
refund not only the federal sales tax but also the provincial sales
tax, which alone can reach 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Japan says it rebates 5 percent on most business expenses, but
Karen Bostrom, a vice president of sales and marketing with
EuroVAT, says that in practice Japan generally refunds 5 percent
only on hotel costs.
</P>
<P>

for those pounds, francs, yen, or marks back. &QL;

WITH AIRLINES RIDING HIGH, WHY ARE WALL STREET VIEWS MIXED?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN REED 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jerry Tims doesn't know much about airline
management, but he thinks he knows why U.S. carriers are preparing
to report that they made more money as a group in 1998 than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen the planes so crowded,'' said Tims, chief
executive of Dexide, a Fort Worth-based maker of surgical devices,
who has logged more than 100,000 miles annually for years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. carriers are flying more paying passengers than at any time
since World War II. And demand, Tims figures, is driving the record
$4.8 billion in profits that major airlines are expected to report
for 1998, excluding onetime events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planes are so crowded it's getting hard to see the real
benefits of being a Platinum member,'' Tims said, referring to his
elite status in American Airlines' frequent-flier program. ``You
can't hardly buy a coach seat and expect to get bumped into first
class any more, because all the first-class seats are already
filled.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors are jittery about airline stocks, and many
analysts are talking about them in relatively negative terms.
</P>
<P>
   Airline stocks have been bouncing up and down like a plane
flying through turbulence over the past several months. Two weeks
ago, stocks soared 14.6 percent, but they dropped most of those
gains last week.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, some analysts believe, is that the industry is at a
cyclical high and is poised to slip. Labor costs are rising, they
note. And Asia's economic crisis has triggered discounting on
Pacific routes that were once highly profitable.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Northwest and TWA, two carriers struggling for
business, are keeping the lid on domestic leisure fares even though
many airline executives believe they could increase prices 10
percent to 15 percent without running off passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it appears as if scheduled capacity increases will
slightly exceed the expected increase in demand this year for the
first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Starkman, an analyst for SBC Warburg Dillon Read in New
York, is one who is concerned about a potential squeeze on airline
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that times are going to be bad for the
airlines,'' Starkman said. ``We've just hit a peak. ... And while I
think the downside potential in the event of an economic softening
is not as great as it used to be with this industry, it's still
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives expressed worries about a potential slowdown
as recently as last fall. They say they are still concerned, but
they are more confident.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Carty, chairman of American Airlines and its parent AMR
Corp., admitted to ``some mild concerns'' last week about increased
capacity and softening demand in some international markets.
</P>
<P>
   But ``demand, especially domestically, continues to be very
strong,'' said Carty, whose Fort Worth-based company is expected to
announce this week that it beat its 1996 profit record of $1
billion by several hundred thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Big corporations that had taken steps to reduce their travel
last fall have regained their confidence in the economy, Carty
said, and are back on the travel bandwagon. Meanwhile, the nearly
insatiable demand for leisure travel continues, at least
domestically, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, U.S. carriers _ when the numbers are tallied _ are
expected to have filled nearly 71 percent of their seats with
paying passengers in 1998, up from 70.35 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The only time that U.S. airlines reported higher load factors
was around World War II, when 88 percent of all seats were filled
at a time that demand was artificially stimulated by government and
military travel.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the industry is reaping the benefits of tough decisions
it made this decade. After the industry's worst downturn in
history, when airlines lost $13 billion in four years, most
carriers sought to regain control of the supply-and-demand equation
by slowing the growth of capacity to below the growth rate in
demand. Last year was the fifth straight that the industry's
capacity grew less than demand for air travel.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the airlines are paying less, adjusted for
inflation, for fuel than at any time in the four decades of jet
travel. The major carriers, which save about $160 million a year
for every 1 cent drop in the average price of fuel, paid about 54
cents a gallon in 1998, down nearly 18 percent from 1997. In the
fourth quarter, jet fuel on the spot market fell as low as 33 cents
a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Mullin, chief executive of Delta Air Lines, which employs
about 5,000 people in North Texas, echoed Carty's sentiments in
public comments last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much better about the economic outlook than I did back
in September,'' he said. This week, Delta reported a record $194
million fourth-quarter profit and a record $1.1 billion profit for
1998, exceeding analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions of airline stocks vary on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts expect a jump in airline stocks this year,
probably after first-quarter figures are released in April, and
they are advising clients to buy now at what they see as relatively
cheap prices.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts are worried.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Browning and Michael Linenberg, who follow airlines for
Merrill Lynch, project a 12 percent decline in 1999 industry
profit, largely based on their belief that capacity will grow 5.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Starkman, the Warburg analyst, said he is concerned about labor
costs and a softening economy that might force the airlines to
increase discounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If fuel prices had not fallen in 1998, if they had simply
remained flat, operating profits for the airlines would have been
down,'' Starkman said. ``In fact, the airlines' operating profits
for '98 will be up maybe $500 million, but the airlines saved $1.9
billion to $2 billion from the fuel price drop. The rest of the
savings were eaten up by higher costs.''

JURY SPLITS VERDICT IN PIE-THROWING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MACKENZIE WARREN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When it came to pie crimes and misdemeanors,
jurors returned a bittersweet verdict in the case of three people
accused of tossing pies at San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown: The
jury convicted them of battery, but cleared them of the more
serious charge of assaulting a public official.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who testified against the defendants last week, expressed
regret about Tuesday's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume the jury thinks it's OK to punch an elected
official,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants, all members of the loosely organized
Biotic Baking Brigade activist group, said the verdict was a
victory for their cause and for free speech. Defense lawyer Mark
Vermeulen called the acquittal yet another pie in Brown's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope he takes this with a little more grace than the
last one,'' Vermeulen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the moment the pie hit his face,'' said defendant
Justin Gross, 27, of Berkeley. ``We got our message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Never denying that they threw the pies at Brown in the Nov. 7
attack, Gross and the other two defendants _ Rahula Janowski, 27,
and Gerard Livernois, 34, both of San Francisco _ said they had
wanted to draw attention to the mayor's policy on homeless people,
which they criticize as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   They face six months in jail for misdemeanor battery, but they
could have received a one-year sentence had they been convicted of
the more serious charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Superior Court jury deliberated for more than nine hours
before returning the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important to be careful how you choose to be an
activist,'' said juror Susan Cassidy. ``I support and appreciate
(activism) and empathize with these young people who are wanting to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy, a teacher, said she and the other jurors were not
convinced that the act was retaliating for the mayor's policies or
was meant to prevent him from carrying out his official duties,
essential ingredients in convicting for assaulting a public
official.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy District Attorney Maria Bee had grilled the defendants on
the stand last week about whether they would have carried out the
attack had they agreed with Brown's policies. They all said they
probably would not have. These admissions, Bee said in her closing
arguments, should lead to a verdict of guilty of assault on a
public official.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict came after a three-day trial last week. Judge Ernest
Goldsmith set sentencing for Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was hit with pies during the Great Sweep III, the mayor's
annual community street cleanup. The defendants said they had
targeted him on that occasion because they felt it symbolized what
they termed ``the great homeless sweep,'' the results of what they
call a heavy-handed attempt to rid the city of homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   Janowski, who left the courtroom wearing a Biotic Baking Brigade
T-shirt, said ``Operation Free Willie'' was a success, despite the
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pastry uprising,'' she said. ``There's a lot of
militant bakers out there. This isn't going to deter them.''

with redwoods _ and on many mornings shrouded with fog _ near
Sausalito in Marin County, Calif. To ease the transition from a
loft in SoHo to the quasi-wilderness of Marin County, Harrison and
his wife, Carol, bought a 1960s redwood house, gutted it and
replicated elements of their Prince Street loft _ white walls,
slate floors and a stainless-steel staircase _ in the rustic shell.

EASY WAY TO FACE DOWN A GRIZZLY: ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Meriwether Lewis, the moment of truth between human and bear
occurred on June 14, 1805, one day after he had discovered the
Great Falls of the Missouri. (Lewis and Clark's bear lore, along
with their other exploits, can be followed on line at
www.lewis-clark.org.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Having entirely forgotten to reload my rifle,'' Lewis wrote in
his diary, ``a large white, or rather brown bear, had perceived and
crept on me within 20 steps before I discovered him.'' Lewis tried
to walk slowly toward a tree 300 yards distant. ``I had no sooner
turned myself about but he pitched at me, open mouthed and full
speed. I ran about 80 yards and found he gained on me fast. I then
ran into the water.'' The grizzly bear abruptly turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause of his alarm still remains with me mysterious and
unaccountable,'' Lewis wrote, and many have echoed his words since
then.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the grizzlies of the Great Plains, so plentiful in Lewis
and Clark's diaries, have been wiped out or driven into the
mountains, but environmentalists, students, hikers and anyone who
wants to feel a sense of deep respect can go bear trekking on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Bear Den (www.nature-net.com/bears) is a home page for all
things ursine, including pandas, which have traditionally been
lumped with the raccoon family but are actually closer relatives of
the bears, according to recent DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Bear Den is run by Don Middleton, a school psychologist in
Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, which is near a big black bear
population in Riding Mountain National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Middleton's site has descriptions of the eight bear species,
including the sloth bear of Asia, sun bear, spectacled bear and
giant panda, all of them rare; Asiatic black bear, and the more
familiar brown, black and polar bears. It also has reviews of bear
books, videos, CD-ROMs and gear.
</P>
<P>
   Various links explore such controversial questions as the
usefulness of bear bells (are they a warning device or just noise
pollution) and pepper spray (you don't want to get close enough to
find out).
</P>
<P>
   ``Media, including the recent movie `The Edge,' usually portray
bears in unrealistic and anthropomorphic ways,'' Middleton wrote by
e-mail. ``I hope that people extensively studying my site will see
bears for what they are _ majestic pinnacle predators who should be
left alone for the most part, only studied from a distance and also
harbingers or sentinels of the sustainability of our last remaining
wilderness areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bear Den also pays homage to the need to talk about one's
bear feelings. A sample from the Quotes About Bears page comes from
John Muir, the pioneer: ``Bears are not companions of men, but
children of God, and His charity is broad enough for both.''
Another is from John Murray: ``Those who have packed far up into
grizzly country know that the presence of even one grizzly on the
land elevates the mountains, deepens the canyons, chills the winds,
brightens the stars, darkens the forest and quickens the pulse of
all who enter it. They know that when a bear dies, something sacred
in every living thing interconnected with that realm ... also
dies.''
</P>
<P>
   That verges on religion, but something meaningful often does
happen in bear encounters. John W. Uhler has put together a Bear
Story site on the Total Yellowstone Page
(www.Yellowstone-Natl-Park.Com/bearstor.htm), a selection of
up-close-and-personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
   James Musgrove's recently updated site on the American grizzly
bear (home.att.net/jrmusgrove/index.htm), provides a look at
current legal disputes and government action regarding the often
lopsided battle between friends of the bears and the logging,
mining and ranching interests.
</P>
<P>
   A sad but important part of his reporting is a running death
count (23 grizzlies were killed in and around Glacier National Park
in 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd W. Hofmann, creator of a short guide called Bear Fact
(www.planet.eon.net/homac/bear.html), wrote: ``I spend every second
weekend in Jasper National Park mountain biking. I was startled to
find people actually avoiding this national park due to the
perceived danger.'' He added, ``You honestly have a better chance
of being struck by lightning than suffering from a bear attack.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to cut the odds even further, the Bear Den's
offers important advice in its Guide to Backcountry Wisdom, as does
the North Cascades National Park site (www.nps.gov/noca/bear.htm)
and Bears and Glacier National Park
(www.nps.gov/glac/bearpage.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a rich Eastern site is Bear Manners: Getting Along in
the Backcountry (patc.simplenet.com/bearman.html) by Dean Ahearn,
an homage to the black bear in Shenandoah National Park.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1995, Henry Louis Gates Jr., a Harvard professor and perhaps
the most widely recognized African-American scholar today, cast
himself in the role of fast-talking encyclopedia salesman. Gates,
who had begun dreaming of creating a comprehensive encyclopedia of
the black world two decades earlier, found himself in New York
presenting his proposal to executives from the giant publishing
company Random House.
</P>
<P>
   But before he could finish his pitch, the company's chief
executive, Alberto Vitale, asked him if the encyclopedia could be
done as a multimedia CD-ROM, rather than in the conventional
print-only manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' was Gates' response. The only hitch: He had no
idea what a CD-ROM was.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates, who is popularly known as Skip, is a famously quick
study. And the result is the Encarta Africana, a new electronic
encyclopedia that attempts to distill the black experience into two
honey-hued CD-ROM disks.
</P>
<P>
   The disks _ crammed with 2.5 million words and more than 2,500
pictures, maps, graphs, sounds and video clips on practically all
things of African descent _ reverberate with their subject. A mouse
click can launch users, even those with modestly powered personal
computers, on a cinematic voyage along the Swahili coast, or permit
them to retrace centuries of slave routes between the ``dark
continent''and the New World, or simply watch, in stunningly stark
video clips, haunting scenes of civil rights marchers being
attacked with fire hoses and police dogs.
</P>
<P>
   A keystroke can call up a 1929 performance of Bessie Smith
belting out ``Saint Louis Blues,'' Duke Ellington's elegant
redesign of jazz, The Temptations crooning in their Motown glory
years in the 1960s or sounds from hip-hop's humble birth in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have finally a technology that can explore and explain the
expressive features _ music and dance, art and cinema, literature
and story-telling _ that are the heart of cultural achievements of
people of African descent,'' Gates enthuses in a three-minute video
clip in the encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other CD-ROM collections of some of the sights,
sounds, words and deeds of blacks, like last year's Encyclopedia
Britannica Profiles Black History. But most of them have been very
limited in scope and imagination.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Encarta Africana, officially released Monday by
Microsoft to mark the celebration of Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birth, had from its inception the audacious task of chronicling
black history and culture stretching back to the first Africans
and, for that matter, the first humans, some 4 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Almost for its ambition alone, the project has attracted an
enormous amount of attention and some controversy. For Gates and
his co-editor, Kwame Anthony Appiah, a Harvard colleague, the
struggle to create the encyclopedia had been taken many paths.
</P>
<P>
   Some led to deadends and crushing disappointments. Others met
with debate over whether the project was taking an Afrocentric or
Eurocentric perspective, and over who actually had the rights to
the idea of a black encyclopedia, long a reoccurring dream among
some African-American intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of creating the Encarta Africana, Gates and
Appiah called on more than 400 scholars to research and write more
than 3,000 articles that could appeal to everyone from grade-school
students to graduate-school students. Gates also persuaded noted
figures like Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian-born recipient of the Nobel
Prize in literature, and Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United
Nations, to participate in the project.
</P>
<P>
   Gates even called upon his friend, the basketball great Michael
Jordon, to preview the encyclopedia. Jordan's endorsement _ ``a
reference work which every family should own'' _ is stamped on the
encyclopedia's packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing some of the most popular features from Microsoft's
Encarta series, Africana was designed, its makers say, to show as
much as tell. Some officials at Microsoft have been describing the
encyclopedia, which costs $49.95 after a $20 mail-in rebate that
expires at the end of this year, as a groundbreaking marriage of
content and technology.
</P>
<P>
   One feature, for example, offers users six virtual tours that
include the slave castles of Goree island off the coast of Senegal,
West Africa and the Egyptian ruins at Medinet Habu, using
360-degree photographs that rotate with the nudge of a computer
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people in the United States are not going to
have a chance to make it over to Africa, so we really try bring you
the sights and sounds in a stimulating format,'' said Evette Gee, a
Microsoft project manager for Encarta Africana.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest dream of a comprehensive black encyclopedia
belonged neither to Skip Gates nor to Bill Gates, but to a man
whose life ended long before the advent of personal computers, the
Internet and CD-ROMS. In 1909, W.E.B. Du Bois, the first black to
graduate with a PhD from Harvard University, and who went on to
become the grand American intellectual, writer, social scientist
and Pan-African activist, called for the creation of a black
encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted this work, which he called the Encyclopedia
Africana, to tell the complete saga of Africa and its diaspora in
Europe, Asia, the Caribbean and the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Du Bois thought in 1909 that the principle cause of racism was
ignorance,'' said Gates in an interview, who is the director of the
W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research at Harvard.
``And if he could marshal `scientific evidence' _ that was his
phrase, that we could defeat racism. And the best way to marshal
scientific evidence was through an encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   While his belief would change over the years, as he came to the
conclusion that racism was rooted in economics, Du Bois nonetheless
pursued his dream of producing an encyclopedia of the black world
until his death in 1963 in Ghana, at age 94.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years of his life, Du Bois was living in Ghana
at the invitation of its president, Kwame Nkrumah, and was at work
leading the creation of the Encyclopedia Africana. Since then, his
work has slowly continued in Ghana, with three volumes published so
far.
</P>
<P>
   While a student at Cambridge University in 1973, Gates said, he
dreamed of completing the vision of Du Bois, whose brilliance and
self confidence, he acknowledged, still stagger him. At Cambridge,
he met a young philosophy major, Kwame Appiah, whose uncle is an
Asante chief in Ghana. They became friends and collaborators in
trying to make real what Appiah calls Du Bois' ``noble idea.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Gates, then an assistant professor at Yale University,
approached Encyclopedia Britannica with the idea. But the company
was not convinced that the project would make money. If Gates could
raise the millions required to create the encyclopedia, the company
told him, Britannica would produce it
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1995, after having taught at Harvard for four
years, that Gates felt secure enough there to try once again to
resurrect the idea. He had gotten pledges of development money from
Quincy Jones, the composer and media entrepreneur, and Martin
Payson, a high-ranking executive at Time-Warner, for the project.
It was then that he met with Random House officials and was asked
to consider making a CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, after working with Dynamic Diagrams, a Rhode
Island-based design group, Gates had a CD-ROM prototype of his
encyclopedia. But when he returned to Random House with it, he was
told that the bottom had fallen out of the CD-ROM market. The
company was no longer interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that they were only doing games,'' Gates recalled
recently. ``I could have cried. I was devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the ``edutainment'' CD-ROM market is rapidly
shrinking as more users turn to the vast, ever-changing resources
of the Internet, rather than the static data on disks, said L. Butt
Jr., director of entertainment and technology strategy at Forrester
Research, a Cambridge, Mass.-based research firm. There are some
exceptions, however, for CD-ROM encyclopedias like Encarta, Butt
said.
</P>
<P>
   After his rejection by Random House, Gates shopped the project
around New York, making presentations to numerous companies,
including, the Voyager Co. and Simon &AMP; Schuster. Still no deal.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Spring of 1997, while approaching Prodigy, the
Internet provider, to set up an online version of the encyclopedia,
Gates was also talking separately with Perseus Books and Microsoft.
The day after Gates finalized a deal with Perseus to produce a
single-volume text version of the encyclopedia _ scheduled for
publication in November _ Microsoft agreed to produce the CD-ROM
encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Persesus quickly reached an agreeement to split
the costs. No one will say how much the compendium cost, but a
source close to the project said the research budget was about $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gates had finally found publishers for the
encyclopedia, he learned that the original name he had in mind,
Encyclopedia Africana, would have to be dropped. The group still
working in Ghana to complete Du Bois' project, it turned out, owned
the rights to that name.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say the Ghana-directed scholars who have so-far
produced three volumes of what some believe may be a 20-volume
Encyclopedia Africana: Dictionary of African Biography
(www.ulbobo.com/eap) are the inheritors not only of the project's
name, but of its true spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a commercial product for the white
buyers,'' said Dr. Molefi Kete Asante, a widely published author
and former chairman of the African Studies department at Temple
University in Philadelphia. ``It is a project that is flawed,
because the people who created it, even though they have strong
credentials in the white academies, do not understand the African
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Asante is a leading proponent of Afrocentricity, which holds as
its chief tenet that black history must be seen from what he calls
an ``African center.'' Encarta Africana, he said, takes a more
Eurocentric approach to explaining the black world.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he points to the encyclopedia's passages on Egypt,
passages that, Asante said, work to confirm some historians views
that, despite its place on the African continent, Egypt's
civilization is somehow more akin to the Middle East, rather than
having evolved from from core African cultural and historical
roots.
</P>
<P>
   Asante and Raymond A. Winbush, a professor and director of the
Race Relations Institute at Fisk University in Nashville, also say
that Gates and Appiah asked few, if any, Afrocentric scholars to
join the more than 400 scholars who contributed articles to Encarta
Encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just disappointed that some of our great scholars, like on
slavery in America, were not invited,'' said Winbush, who is an
advisor to the Ghana-based project. He said the electronic
encyclopedia was not the ``definitive view of Africa.'' He
acknowledged, however, that it was ``a good first step, a baby
step.''
</P>
<P>
   The encyclopedia has drawn strong praise from Dr. Robert L.
Douglas, a noted African studies scholar. ``The sheer magnitude of
its size, scope and chronology (from four million B.C. to the
present) is magnificent in itself,'' said Douglas, professor of art
history and pan african studies at the University of Louisville in
Kentucky. ``Only with the coming years of its use in the multitude
of educational forums and the research potential that it promises
for teachers and scholars will its successes and failures be
realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates concedes that Encarta Encyclopedia is ``mainstream, very
mainstream.'' But that does not devalue its scholarship, others
agree. Any potentially controversy passage in the encyclopedia is,
he said, clearly labeled so. And often, he says, his group of
scholars, which he described as ``ideologically diverse,'' tried
hard to include opposing arguments on controversial interpretations
of black history and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a God complex,'' Gates said. ``We are not saying
that this is the Bible.'' he noted that this week he launched an
Internet site (www.africana.com) inviting anyone to send in ``ideas
and opinions'' regarding the encyclopedia's content. ``The more the
merrier,'' Gates said, suggesting that the encyclopedia may be
revised over time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CD-ROM is not yet for everyone. It does not come in a
Macintosh version (or a single-disk DVD version). And there are no
immediate plans for a Mac Encarta, either, said Microsoft's Evette
Gee. This could present a problem, some educators say, for poor,
inner-city school districts that may be more likely to have
Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft announced that it plans to donate 2,000 copies of
Encarta Africana to urban schools, part of an overall donation of
8,000 copies of the encyclopedia to other schools, including
historically black colleges and universities and selected public
libraries in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said that he is immensely proud of the encyclopedia, and
he is pleased with the thought that Du Bois might be pleased as
well. Last month, when Encarta Encyclopedia was being shipped, he
received a letter from David G. Du Bois, 71, the son of W.E.B. Du
Bois.
</P>
<P>
   In part, it read, ``Anthony Appiah and Henry Louis Gates Jr.,
inspired by Father's original idea, have made a magnificent, state
of the art contribution to African and African American Studies and
Humanities with Encarta Africana. Dr. Du Bois would have been
proud.''

   Some of the most obscure and most fascinating sites on the Web
can be found almost exclusively sticking to its soft underbelly, in
Web rings. Take, for example, Tales of Fur and Fiber
(members.aol.com/daknits/index.html), run by Rachel Hecht, which
includes a page of superstitions about knitting.
</P>
<P>
   With the Webmaster's Himalayan cat, Firkin, and Maltese dog,
Oliver, as guides, we learn: ``Knitting for children you may have
in the future, but before you are pregnant, is bad luck.'' ``If you
knit one of your own hairs into a garment, it will bind the
recipient to you.'' ``Don't knit a pair of socks for your boyfriend
or he'll walk away from you!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hecht, who lives in North Miami Beach, Fla., joined her site
with the Free Knitting Patterns Web Ring
(www.geocities.com/Paris/9197/knitring.htm), part of Webring.org.
It includes material from the Knit List, an online knitting group.
</P>
<P>
   Someone desperate to find superstitions about knitting (and
isn't everyone, at one time or another, during this brief time on
earth?) would be out of luck in all but one of the major search
engines. Alta Vista picks up the Fur and Fiber site. But other
search engines turned up uninspiring results or nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   The searches produced many hits on the ``Innuendo'' album by the
rock group Queen. The album includes ``knitting'' and
``superstition'' in its lyrics, and the occasional mention of
Madame LaFarge, the knitter from Dickens' ``Tale of Two Cities.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the Web Ring site, there was just one ring devoted to
knitting, and the superstitions were easy to find by browsing
through the list. So where else could one learn this crucial
information: ``Stabbing your needles through your yarn balls brings
bad luck to anyone who wears something made from that yarn''? Let
the wearer beware.

TWO AGENTS' DAYS: A REAL ESTATE DIARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The customer walked into the $1.5 million duplex
maisonette on Park Avenue and zeroed in on the decorative grilles
on the first-floor windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'd like to live in an apartment with bars on
it,'' Carlene Condon said, barely noting the ornate wrought-iron
balustrade, the swagged tapestry draperies, the Ionic columns and
the patterned marble floors. She shook her head. ``I mean,  &UR; Rikers
Island &LR;  has bars!''
</P>
<P>
   John Foreman, her real-estate agent, sighed. The day was not
getting off to a great start.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become one of the fastest-moving winter markets in
years, Manhattan real-estate brokers are hustling, trying to make
up for the third quarter, when buyers hesitated because of the
stock market's roller-coaster ride. Now, the agencies report, the
clients are back _ and buying. According to a Real Estate Board of
New York survey due out in early February, total sales volume in
the last quarter of 1998 rose 7 percent over the same period last
year. And according to a most year-end statistics, prices also
rose, well into the double digits for the larger apartments.
</P>
<P>
   So what is a day of selling real estate really like these days?
Is it a dawn-to-dusk frenzy, selling million-dollar duplexes as if
they were Volkswagen's New Beetle?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, a reporter tagged along with agents from two of the
city's most fiercely competitive companies, spending a day with
each.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman, a former architectural historian who has worked for
Halstead Property Co. for seven years, is so soft-spoken, the
reporter's back muscles hurt after spending a day leaning forward
to hear him.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Julie Gordon, a former Ford model turned co-op and
condominium saleswoman (why  &UR; do &LR;  real-estate agents always begin
their working lives in completely different occupations?), is
lively and outspoken. When desk mates at the Corcoran Group, where
she has worked for four years, were asked to characterize her, they
chanted in chorus, ``She's the one with the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps there is a certain symmetry that Foreman is working
with a woman who boldly compares the window grates in a Park Avenue
maisonette to those at the city prison. And that Ms. Gordon is
working with Robert McVeety, a record company manager who is as
reserved as Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what did you think of the apartments?'' Ms. Gordon asked
McVeety after viewing two one-bedroom apartments in a postwar
building on East 56th Street. ``OK,'' he replied, without passion.
</P>
<P>
   She pressed him: ``Which did you like better?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, life is full of compromises,'' he said. After a good 10
minutes of fruitless interrogation, Ms. Gordon thought she might
have unearthed a clue to his diffidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' she said a bit wearily. ``Let's look at some apartments
on the West Side.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 a.m., there's a message on the reporter's answering
machine from Julie Gordon: ``Oh, my God, it's snowing! It looks
like school is going to be canceled, and I don't have anyone to
take care of the kids, so I'll have to give up my appointments.
We're trying to get the Snow Patrol on the phone, but they're not
awake yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the day begins for Ms. Gordon, a 40-year-old divorced
mother of two who is trying to carve out a life selling real estate
while juggling her family responsibilities. She is not as well
known as her colleagues who are photographed in their Rolls-Royces
with celebrity clients: she walks to showings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon is a vice president at the Corcoran Group, a title
won because of the money she's earned. She once had a bulletin
board with a handful of her ribbons, each attesting to a sale of
more than $1 million; one day, she tossed them all out. ``I just
wasn't into the ribbons anymore,'' she said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   At 7, she calls back. ``We called the class mother and woke her
up. There's school.''
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, she throws open the door of her six-room
apartment at 141 E. 88th St., a prewar co-op that she rents. She's
still wearing a gray sweatshirt and sweatpants. Her daughters,
Laura, 9, and Kelly, 11, are already dressed for school. ``I feel
like we're in Montana _ and we're going off to kill that moose,''
their mother says, as they head out.
</P>
<P>
   Walking along Lexington Avenue at a rapid clip, Laura and Kelly
fight over who will get their mother's left hand. ``It's a better
hand,'' Laura insists, looking daggers at her older sister. A few
minutes before 8, the children are delivered to the
Nightingale-Bamford School, and Ms. Gordon speeds back to her
apartment. ``After the first time my clients go out with me, they
know to wear sneakers,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At 9, she's changing into her basic-black work clothes,
listening to messages: ``Oooh!'' she shrieks. ``I just found out
this guy who just bought an apartment from me the first day we went
out had looked at 37 other apartments with another broker. I feel
 &UR; so &LR;  bad for her!''
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour later, at the office on Madison Avenue, she calls
Bob McVeety, who wants to find an apartment for himself and his
wife. ``He's looking at one-bedrooms,'' she says. ``They're the
hardest to please. They're always trying to squeeze, to get more
bang for the buck. They want to see every 750-square-foot apartment
in Manhattan before they decide. It's not my niche, but I like him,
so I make an exception.''
</P>
<P>
   And if she  &UR; doesn't &LR;  like a client? ``I call 911,'' she says
referring to an extension at the office for just such
eventualities. ``I say, `I want to get rid of this buyer.' They can
take them over. Oh, sure, they'll give me a referral fee _ 10
percent. You go up to the broker and give her a kiss. Better her
than me!''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Across town, John Foreman is just getting started. His first
appointment is at noon. At 9:30, he leaves the giant postwar
complex on East 66th Street, where he sublets. He is bound for his
office on Madison Avenue to check out the ``show sheets'' (who in
his office is showing what), to return calls and to put together
his own schedule, which includes deciding whether he's ``going to
show somebody a piece of garbage just because you have to show them
 &UR; something &LR; .'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Foreman, 53, looks dapper in a camel's-hair coat and a
taupe-colored slouch hat. He grabs a cup of squash soup at E.A.T.
``How much could it cost?'' he asks, without checking. He soon
finds out: ``$8!'' Reeling, he takes the soup back to the office.
He is meeting Carlene Condon, a corporate lawyer, at a seven-room,
$1.4 million co-op on East 68th Street.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Condon, who has been looking for an apartment for more than
six months, had requested this particular building, if something
became available; it is a prewar doorman building with a fine Old
English courtyard garden seen through leaded-glass french doors.
But the apartment, freshly renovated, gets only a lukewarm ``nice''
from Ms. Condon. She is looking for something more dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop is the idiosyncratic Park Avenue maisonette, with
hidden marble shower and a kitchen with a balcony. Drama, yes, but
those bars on the windows just won't do. The broker and his client
shake hands. ``I'll call you,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman heads back to the Halstead office to check messages and
to track down a missing commission check for $8,000 (he found it).
At 1:30, he zips off to meet a well-known basketball player and his
wife, who want to buy on the Upper West Side, either a large
apartment in a prewar doorman building (her choice) or a town house
filled to the rafters with original details (his choice). Like some
other clients on this random workday, the basketball player
insisted that his name not be used for reasons of privacy.
Tactfully, Foreman is showing them three apartments and two
brownstones.
</P>
<P>
   They are disappointed in the first apartment, at 100 Riverside
Drive, listed as having ``5-6rms/riv views'' for $1.175 million.
``So where was the river?'' the basketball star asks, as he drives
away.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop is a magnificent brownstone that, alas, was almost
gutted years ago and renovated to a modern stuccoed sheen. ``It was
in several magazines,'' Judy Osten of Brown Harris Stevens, the
listing agent, says brightly. Foreman will split the commission if
the couple buys the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a shame!'' the basketball player says. ``How much do you
think it would cost to restore it to the way it was?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Osten leads the group to another brownstone at 44 W. 91st
St. Right away, the customers see a drawback: the house is right
across the street from an elementary school. ``Yes, but they're
little children,'' Ms. Osten says gamely. Inside, though, the
couple are enthralled. They roam from room to room, floor to floor.
They admire for the cherry kitchen, which leads out to a back
garden. He exclaims over the huge den at the rear of the first
floor, which opens to a tiny deck. ``See, what you'd have to do is
maybe just stain these boards darker,'' he says to no one in
particular. The house is $2 million. ``They'd have to come down a
lot _ like to $1.5,'' he says afterward. ``Then it'd be a good
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple then visit two elegant prewar buildings on West End
Avenue: an eight-room apartment at No. 924, the Clebourne, is
listed at $1.075 million and a seven-and-a-half room fixer-upper at
No. 875 is priced at $765,000. They are still leaning toward an
apartment they saw on their first outing with Foreman. ``There's a
bathroom situation,'' the basketball player explains. ``Yes, a
 &UR; situation &LR; ,'' his wife says with a laugh. They explain: there is
an old-fashioned shaving closet _ just a single sink _ which they
want to make into a third bathroom, but the board has already said
it would not allow the change. (Nonetheless, the couple has asked
Foreman to schedule an appointment to see it again.)
</P>
<P>
   His next customer is a banker named Aashish Kamat, a friendly
but taciturn man whom he shows a series of two-bedroom co-ops,
priced at $400,000 to $600,000. Kamat is very quiet the whole time.
``I am always quiet,'' he says, ``when I know I am going to spend a
very great deal of money.''
</P>
<P>
   At 1:15, Ms. Gordon walks the five blocks from her office to
meet McVeety at 136 E. 56th St. On the way, she explains her
strategy for the McVeetys. ``See, this couple's tough. I'd like to
see them go into a top-notch building. But his wife, Chris, is just
out of law school, so the boards might say: `Yeah, fine, she's
 &UR; going &LR;  to make a lot of money. Come back in a few years.'''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McVeety says: ``We're trying to make up our mind
whether to live in Westchester or the city.'' he says. They are now
living in a Brooklyn sublet. He carefully examines two
1,000-square-foot one-bedroom apartments, both with dining areas.
Both are priced at just under $300,000. ``I would like Chris to
look at both of these,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After her last showing, Ms. Gordon heads back to pick up her
daughters at school and to make some calls from her apartment. It
is 2:30. Her day of showing co-ops is over.
</P>
<P>
   Six hours later, Foreman shows a small $269,000 one-bedroom in
the Schwab House, a postwar building at 11 Riverside Drive.
Afterward, he sinks into a sofa in the lobby and pulls out his cell
phone. One last call, and his day is done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither broker has ended up with a signed contract _ or anything
close to it _ but that's hardly unusual, both say.
</P>
<P>
   Before making a sale, an agent often shows a customer 30 or 40
apartments, Foreman says. ``And sometimes you have dry spells, when
you don't make any money for a very, very long time. I've got an
ex-wife and a kid at boarding school. That's why I do so many
rentals; they're quick. Sometimes you can wrap up a deal in a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Foreman sold one town house and 11 apartments, but he
rented 12 apartments, each with a hefty commission: usually 15
percent of a year's total rent. (With sales, the commission is
normally 6 percent, which gets divided with the agency and with any
other broker involved.) ``It's not an easy living,'' he continues.
``You have to work hard. I came to this job when I was 45, and I've
learned to live with the uncertainty. I like being my own boss.
Some big-time brokers rake in a lot of money.'' He chuckles. ``And
frankly, I aspire to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both agents refuse to say exactly how much they make. They get
no salary; they live on their commissions. Ms. Gordon says she has
to bring in at least $120,000 to keep her desk at the agency.
Foreman makes in the low six figures. ``Emphasize the  &UR; low &LR; ,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon has adopted a devil-may-care attitude. ``Hey, I only
sold five apartments last year,'' she says. ``And when I sold the
fifth, I said: `Whoa! That's it. That's all the money I need for
this year. And I headed off to St. Bart's.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, she says, she already has five apartments that will
close in the next few months. ``And then guess what? It's off to
St. Bart's again!''

FLEX THAT FACE: NEW ELECTRICAL TREATMENT TOUTED AS ALTERNATIVE TO
FACE LIFTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ I stare intently into the mirror, squint my
eyes and stretch my face into various contortions _ pursing the
lips, lifting the eyelids, poking out the chin, elongating the
mouth, sucking in the cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I can definitely see a slight difference.
</P>
<P>
   I'm studying the effects of a session at Fort Worth's European
Skin Care Institute, one of several salons in the area offering a
new nonsurgical alternative to a face lift. Facial muscular therapy
rests on the premise that as facial muscles weaken with age,
wrinkles form and skin sags. To relieve and reverse those
inevitable signs of aging, say proponents of the theory, the 101
muscles that cover the face and neck need to be exercised and toned
with controlled contractions _ but without stretching the skin.
Exercise, they say, renourishes and revitalizes the tissue that
bonds the skin to the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was hatched eight years ago by a Florida woman who
wanted a face lift but learned that because of her medical history,
she was not a candidate for surgery. Working with a biomedical
engineer, she came up with the Belisle Systems' Facial Muscular
Therapy, a battery-operated device designed to stimulate facial
muscles electrically, contracting them and then releasing them.
</P>
<P>
   The technology for FMT is similar to that used for
transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) units to relieve pain,
except that the face is given a full workout with the resistance
necessary to tighten and tone muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can compare this to working out your body muscles, only I
work out the facial muscles for you,'' says Diana Denton, a
registered nurse who worked at Cook Children's Medical Center in
Fort Worth before joining the staff at European Skin Care
Institute. ``This is very different from a facial massage, even a
deep facial massage. It literally exercises and tightens the
muscles that are at the root of the aging process as far as the
face is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Sessions take about an hour and a half and involve placing
electrodes dipped in a heavy ultrasound gel on specific points of
the face to deliver electrical waves to the interconnected facial
muscles. Denton says that friends and relatives are likely to
notice the difference and comment after five or six treatments. The
folks from Belisle recommend an initial series of 20 treatments,
which can run as much as $3,500. After that point, one treatment
every one to three months is suggested to maintain and further
improve the face and neck uplift. Without the follow-up
maintenance, facial muscles will begin to loosen and sag again
after a couple of years, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a time machine,'' says Alexander von Illyes,
president of the European Skin Care Institute, ``but the technique
is refined to the point now where we can achieve significant
results in as few as 20 sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you improve the underlying structure,'' he says,
``everything else improves with it _ especially loose skin on the
neck and around the eyes and on the jaw line.''
</P>
<P>
   Denton, 42, not only gives the treatments but also gets them.
She says the treatments she began while training for her new job
were a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   ``A surgical face lift was not an option for me,'' she says. ``I
could not afford the downtime or the cost of surgery, but my face
has always been a little lopsided. The left jaw hangs down a little
lower than the right, and my eyes had started to sag a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the right place at the right time,'' she says. ``I
think this could help a lot of people look better.''
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of the therapy depends on the way the muscles
of the face are interconnected, exact placement of the electrodes
and the order in which the muscles are worked, Denton says. In
addition, people with pacemakers or metal implants in their face or
neck are not candidates for the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   My own experiment in FMT lasted an hour and a half (twice as
long as expected because I apparently tend to ask a lot of
questions). For purposes of comparison, I offered only one side of
my face as a testing ground. I felt a tingling sensation, and
sometimes pulling with quick little jerks as a current passes from
one electrode to the other. If the pull becomes uncomfortable,
Denton said, it can be decreased immediately. If you can't feel it
at all, the charge is increased.
</P>
<P>
   As Denton worked just below my right cheekbone, I could see my
left eyebrow twitching. As she worked around the right outside
corner of my lip, I could feel the left side quiver. She delivered
six to 10 pulses of electricity, repeated 10 to 12 times each, to
about 20 sites on the right side of my face.
</P>
<P>
   When we're done, I carefully study the results. The bag under my
right eye is less puffy, the smile lines on the left side more
pronounced. There is even an extra crease under my left eye. Wasn't
there a matching one on the right side before my one-sided facial
workout?
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, most of the people I asked said the effects of
the therapy had, predictably, vanished.
</P>
<P>
   But I could see the difference. I believed it was there.

DAY 2 GOP REACTION TO CLINTON SPEECH: GRUDGING ADMIRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after Bill Clinton's State of the Union
address, some Republicans governors expressed grudging admiration
for the impeachment-embattled president's ability to deliver the
speech that prompted high approval ratings for him in overnight
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quintessentially Bill Clinton,'' said Oklahoma's
Republican Gov. Frank Keating in a conference call with reporters.
Keating called Clinton's laundry list of priorities on Social
Security, health care, education and defense a combination of ``New
Deal and shining city on the hill,'' references to speech imagery
favored by Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's commendable that the president wants to use the surplus
for Social Security,'' Keating said. ``Now it's time to get down to
details, to make sure this is a long term solution and not
rhetoric. If Republicans and the president can come together and
resolve the Social Security crisis now, all Americans will
benefit.'' Keating stressed that ``the public wants a bipartisan
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   But he criticized Clinton for not offering Republicans ``more of
an olive branch. We make it a point to compliment Democrats who
make governance possible. It was Republicans who balanced the
budget, and the president made no mention of that. The recovery
started in 1991 (under President George Bush), and no mention was
made of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Ed Schafer of North Dakota, joining the
conference call, said, ``The president is a great deliverer,'' and
added that in the speech ``there was something for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schafer criticized Clinton for not including a tax cut among
his proposals and said he was relying too heavily on government
solutions in areas such as Social Security. ``He's reinstituting
the era of big government,'' Schafer said.
</P>
<P>
   In his Social Security rescue plan, Clinton said the government
should invest a quarter of the budget surplus funds that he would
divert to the Social Security trust fund over the next 15 years and
called for setting up federally subsidized savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming, who also took part in
the conference call, said Clinton's speech ``showed a mastery of
politics. There is no more truth, only perception. Clinton used the
weapons of mass distraction in his address.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said in an
interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that since Clinton
``probably will'' survive Republican efforts to remove him from
office, ``we need to move forward. We can't leave these wounds
open.''
</P>
<P>
   And conservative activist Gary Bauer, a possible Republican
presidential contender, told reporters he admired Clinton's ability
to ``compartmentalize'' his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure most people in public life in Washington facing
the sort of charges he's facing would have quite had the
performance he had last night,'' said Bauer, a former Reagan
administration official who has been a leading critic of Clinton.
``It's an incredible phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls released Wednesday by ABC, CBS and NBC showed the public's
approval of Clinton's job performance is still high at the same
time that the Senate is hearing evidence on whether he should be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   His job approval rating was 66 percent in the ABC poll, 72
percent in the CBS poll and 76 percent in the NBC poll. In the CBS
poll, six out of 10 said his actions are not serious enough to
warrant his removal.

A NEW VACCINE CAN HELP CURB A NATIONWIDE UPSWING OF LYME DISEASE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by LYME DISEASE-INFO) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The desperation in Jacqueline Smith's voice
is undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dying of Lyme disease, chronic, reoccurring neurological
Lyme disease, and people keep saying Lyme disease is not a problem
in this part of the country,'' says the Fort Worth resident, 42.
``I've suffered from this since 1985, and it's about to put me in a
nursing home. We've had a damn old vaccine for dogs for years, and
nothing for humans.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the country's most common tick-borne illness, a
multistage, multisystem disease transmitted from animals to humans
and caused by infection with a spiral-shaped bacterium known as
``Borrelia burgdorferi.'' If the disease progresses and the
bacteria invade the brain and spinal cord, infecting the central
nervous system, it can cause severe anxiety, insomnia, memory loss,
moodiness and depression, hallucinations, panic attacks, paranoia,
manic depression, seizures and even dementia, according to the
American Lyme Disease Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people associate the disease with the Northeastern
part of the country where it was first diagnosed just over two
decades ago, cases have been confirmed in every state except
Montana, and new cases continue to develop at a rate of about
10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Texas counts 2,000 probable cases, 725 confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Officially disabled by chronic Lyme disease, Smith counts
herself among nearly 100,000 cases that have been reported to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She has home health
nursing care, can no longer walk without a cane, and depends
primarily on a three-wheeled cart to get around.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's case is extreme; doctors and scientists say that most of
the time Lyme disease is preventable and curable. Public awareness
of what the disease is and how it spreads is part of the solution.
And on Dec. 21, the Food and Drug Administration approved LYMErix
as safe and effective. It is the first human vaccine against the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   CONFUSING SYMPTOMS: Smith's Lyme disease was diagnosed in 1990
after she had endured numerous blood tests, a spinal tap and a
ferocious series of medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   She had been treated for fatigue, headaches, weight loss, joint
pains, fever, irritable bowel syndrome, irregular heartbeat and
other nonspecific symptoms since late 1985.
</P>
<P>
   She believes she contracted the disease while she was working as
a nurse and caring for a patient known to have Lyme disease.
Although most health officials maintain that the disease is spread
to humans only through tick bites, Smith says she got it through a
needle stick. She says her daughter, who also has been found to
have Lyme disease, contracted it through maternal-fetal
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The needle stick came in August 1985, two months before Smith's
first symptoms hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you feel like you've got the flu, but it stays on you
longer, then it goes into remission, then it comes back worse than
ever,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, she ended up at Parkland Memorial Hospital in
Dallas, hallucinating. The diagnosis was psychosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to put me in the mental ward, but then, thank God,
they did a spinal tap that showed I had an infection of the brain
and needed IV antibiotics again. It's a common late manifestation
when you have neurological involvement with Lyme,'' she says. ``It
is the most horrible thing I have ever experienced, like you are in
a deep fog on a merry-go-round, going faster and faster. It's
terrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Most cases of Lyme disease are not nearly as severe as Smith's.
The disease can usually be treated successfully with four to six
weeks of intensive antibiotics, although it can be difficult to
diagnose.
</P>
<P>
   Onset is commonly associated with a characteristic target-shaped
skin rash known as ``erythema migrans,'' which can vary in size but
is most often about 2 inches across. The rash is often accompanied
by flulike symptoms including headache, fever, fatigue, joint
aches, muscle aches and a stiff neck.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS OUTBREAK: The first cases of Lyme disease in Texas _ nine
of them _ were reported in 1986, says Julie Rawlings,
epidemiologist with the Texas Department of Health. The next year,
the number jumped to 33. In 1992, the state had a high of 113 new
cases. In 1997, the most recent year for which there are complete
records available, 60 cases were reported to the Texas Department
of Health. There were 97 cases the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of new cases in Texas has been down in the last
year, but it has mostly to do with the drought,'' Rawlings said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings says all it would take is a wet year for the ticks to
get happy and prolific, and she doesn't want to provide a false
sense of security by saying the numbers are going down.
</P>
<P>
   Experts blame the fast-emerging disease, in part, on the quickly
growing deer, mice and tick populations and on migratory birds,
which often carry tiny ticks hundreds of miles before the ticks
fall off, looking for their next blood meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Land-use patterns are a major factor,'' says Dr. Richard
Falco, an entomologist with Calder Vector Ecology Research
Laboratory at Fordham University and research consultant for the
American Lyme Disease Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He studies ticks and teaches in the infectious disease
department at Fordham.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason there is so much more Lyme disease now is probably
because land-use practices have changed,'' Falco says. ``Here in
New York, we used to be pretty much agricultural, but now the
forests that were cleared for farming have started coming back. The
deer populations have increased, and the mouse populations _ and
especially the tick populations.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather plays some role along with the mass production of
acorns and with biological factors, including the number of hosts,
predators and parasites, Falco says.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the tick population, Falco recommends insecticide in
residential environments in places where ticks are prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend spraying on your own property,'' he says.
``Probably 70 percent of the Lyme disease here in Westchester
County is acquired right in our own back yards. Insecticides are
one weapon, as is the new vaccine,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For those traveling _ or hunting _ in areas where ticks are
found, experts also suggest taking personal precautions. ``Dress
appropriately, with long pants and shirt tucked in, use a repellent
spray, check for ticks and remove them promptly,'' says Dr. Michael
Caldwell, commissioner of health for Dutchess County, New York.
``If you remove any tick within 24 hours of attachment, it will
greatly reduce the risk of tick-borne disease. You need to pull
them straight out with a point tweezers.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people do not even know they have been bitten by a tick
unless they find one on their body. The tick emits a little
anesthetic from its mouthpiece, numbing the area when it attaches,
according to Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   FROM BAD TO WORSE: If left undetected and untreated, the Lyme
bacterial infection can cause irregular heart rhythms and spread to
the joints. When the disease infects the brain and spinal cord, it
can be devastating. Even after Lyme disease is cured, some victims
continue to suffer certain symptoms, especially arthritis and
neurological problems, says Caldwell, whose county lies about 100
miles north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Dutchess County has more Lyme disease for its population
(270,000) than any other place in the country, with about 1,800 new
cases each year.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell was principal investigator for clinical trials of the
new vaccine, developed by SmithKline Beecham pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of deer and white-footed mice, both carriers of
Lyme,'' Caldwell says. ``About half the ticks we test carry the
Lyme bacterium.''
</P>
<P>
   The bacterium is not as common in Texas, but Lyme disease is the
most common tick-borne disease in the state, Rawlings says. She
estimates that about 2 percent of the ticks found in Texas carry
the bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vaccine will protect only against Lyme disease, but 90
percent of tick-borne disease is now Lyme,'' Caldwell says.
</P>
<P>
   Three doses of the vaccine are recommended for the most
effective protection, with the second given one month after the
first and the third one at 12 months. The efficacy rate is 79
percent protection after three injections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, three doses provide the best protection, but two
provide some protection. I recommend starting sooner than later.
You can reduce the risk by 50 percent with just two doses,''
Caldwell says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Lyme disease is both preventable and curable, but
infection often is not protective. Even after you've had it, you
are at risk of getting it again, so the vaccine would be beneficial
for anyone living in or working in or visiting an area where there
are a lot of ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For Fort Worth's Smith, the vaccine comes too late. Still, the
former nurse hails its significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope doctors will prescribe the vaccine now that we finally
have one,'' she says. ``I know veterinarians who won't give their
own dogs the Lyme vaccine for dogs and cats because they say Lyme
disease is not a big enough problem around here,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   Smith knows just what a problem it can be.

LAPPING UP LUXURY: WOMAN'S BELOVED `GIRLS' LIVE THE HIGH LIFE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By MELISSA FLETCHER STOELTJE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ People are always telling DeAnne Doane that if they
should ever die and come back to life, they want to come back as
one of her dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon us, one of her ``girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Doane owns two miniature red dachshunds named Inga Marie and
Gretta Anne. To say these canines are pampered is like saying the
Titanic was a large boat.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs _ make that ``the girls,'' which is how Doane and all
her friends refer to them _ take naps in a bed lined in
animal-print fabric in their Houston condominium. They share a
second bed in a swank, upper East Side apartment in Manhattan. They
own matching leopard-print scarves. They vacation in exotic
locales, where they hobnob with celebrities. They dine in the
finest New York restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   They have their own Easter dresses. They have their own polo
hats. They have their own custom-made lederhosen, which they wore
to a dachshund costume party in New York, where they won first
place.
</P>
<P>
   When they fly _ and they do, frequently _ it's always
first-class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the flight attendant,'' says Doane, when asked
if the pups ever get released from their big Sherpa bag while en
route to New York, the Caribbean or some other exciting
destination. ``If he or she is a dog lover, then out they come.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that Doane loves her dogs. Lots of people love
their dogs. Doane cherishes her dogs, darn near worships them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no parents, no children, no siblings, no aunts,'' says
Doane, relaxing on a couch inside her elegant Houston condo,
decorated in burnished beiges, browns and golds _ the colors of
dachshunds. ``They're my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Petite, svelte and stylish, wearing an animal-print scarf that
matches those around her dogs' necks, Doane is a self-confessed
workaholic, a hopeless Type A. She spends more than half the year
in New York on business. As vice president of national business
development for Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, she
brokers billion-dollar deals in a high-pressure job that involves
long hours, extensive travel, enormous stakes and the occasional
bunking-out on a conference room floor.
</P>
<P>
   She's go-go and big-time. Her dogs, she says, are her serenity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could have the job I do without them, without
the endorphins they give me,'' she says, stroking Inga's forehead,
making the dog's eyes blink sleepily. ``It's so nice to come home
and have them there to nurture me. They give me balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The dogs nestle beside her on the sofa, curling photogenically
and burrowing their snouts into the cushions. Gretta, 15, is the
oldest (``that's 120 in dog years,'' says Doane), with a
silver-tinged muzzle and slightly clouded eyes. Several years ago
she had a disc removed from her spine _ back problems are common
among dachshunds, says Doane _ and she must take daily arthritis
medication. But she's still peppy, shamelessly begging for petting
by sitting up over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Inga, 6, is ``my tomboy, my athletic one,'' says Doane, who
inherited the dog when her mother died of cancer four years ago.
Inga is obsessive about her little blue ball and unabashedly
attached to Gretta. Whatever Gretta does, Inga does. The two are
inseparable: they won't sleep unless they're touching. At night,
they sleep with Doane in her bed, at the foot of which she has
rigged a series of stair-step suitcases so that Gretta can ascend
painlessly. Inga has her own stuffed toy from FAO Schwarz, which
she must have to fall asleep.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the dogs have the run of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very good with boundaries,'' admits Doane, smiling
down tenderly at her two little weiners.
</P>
<P>
   Doane (who is divorced) says in the past male suitors have had a
hard time understanding her relationship with her dogs. They get
jealous. But any man who would love her must also love her dogs,
she attests. She believes dogs are a good filtering device in this
regard: People who love dogs tend to be inherently nice; dogs,
conversely, can often ferret out bad apples. In the past, Doane has
brought home certain blind dates to meet the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would bristle, they wouldn't settle down,'' says Doane of
the dogs. ``It would turn out the men had some character flaw, and
the girls picked up on it.''
</P>
<P>
   She takes the girls everywhere (except her office.) When she
can't, they are left in the care of Juan, the dog walker, who is
equally doting. Doane rises from the sofa (the girls following her
with their eyes, in unison) to fetch photo albums documenting their
many exploits together. Here are pictures of a recent vacation at
Carmen del Playa, where she and the girls met actor Jerry van Dyke
on the beach and subsequently enjoyed Christmas dinner at his
Mexican hacienda (van Dyke and his wife used Inga and Gretta as
stand-ins for their own missing pooches, she explains.) Here are
the girls relaxing in the sand, looking chic in sun visors and
sunglasses. Here they are dining in an upscale New York eatery,
where an enchanted Burt Bacharach (a dachshund lover) decided to
join them for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the girls in Central Park, at the founding party of a
singles' group that seeks to unite unattached people who share a
love of dogs. (Doane plans to form such a group in Houston, with a
kickoff this March.)
</P>
<P>
   Doane estimates she spends more than $200 a month on film and
processing for pictures of the girls. She sends some of these to
dachshund magazines _ in which the girls have often been featured
as ``centerfolds'' _ and to friends in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people they're my little nieces from Houston, Texas,''
says Alexandra Linden, a treasury service employee at a Japanese
bank in Los Angeles who has a framed photo of the girls in their
beach regalia on her desk.
</P>
<P>
   Some may think Doane goes a little overboard with her doggies.
Not Jodie Tanner, a co-worker at Fidelity Title who owns a
miniature dachshund named Spooker.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeAnne and I have bonded because of our animals,'' says
Tanner, who keeps a framed portrait of her own dog on her desk.
``My husband passed away a year ago last September, so I can really
understand how she has that feeling for her animals. With my
husband being gone, my little dog is even more special. He doesn't
even know he's a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, Spooker and the girls exchange Christmas gifts, she
says. Last Christmas, he gave them a doggie snack jar; they gave
him a tasty bone. They've never met in person, but it's a ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Doane's dachshund love affair began when she was a teen-ager in
Houston, when she acquired her first one as a stray. For the past
25 years, she has taken her dachshunds (she's on her third
generation) to Houston-area nursing homes at Christmas, so that
elderly residents can stroke and cuddle them. One woman insisted
that Inga be placed in her bed as she went to sleep, and so in Inga
went.
</P>
<P>
   Gretta, Doane says, ``kissed my tears away'' when her mother
died, when her father died, through countless other heartaches as
well. Dogs, she says, are simply the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't care what you produce, they don't care what you
look like. All they want is to be with you. What more can you ask
for?''
</P>
<P>
   Doane ``can't even think about'' the day when Gretta dies, a
looming inevitability. Several years ago, Gretta experienced renal
failure and came close to dying. With the care of Dr. Robert Sweet,
the girls' veterinarian, as well as a canine kidney specialist, she
survived, although today she is permanently incontinent. To protect
her hardwood floors, Doane bought a pair of ``piddle pants'' for
Gretta, hot pink with black accents. They are stylish, almost
jaunty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took them off her, though, for the interview,'' says Doane.

NEW LYME VACCINE HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR CURING ARTHRITIS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies LYME DISEASE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning it was referred to as ``Lyme arthritis.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease was originally described in 1975 by medical
researchers evaluating an outbreak of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
in and around Lyme County, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, some belief that bacteria may be a common
trigger in many forms of arthritis. Like genes or obesity, bacteria
might be one factor in the development of the disease, according to
the Arthritis Foundation, which was also involved in the
development of the new vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very exciting and positive outcome,'' says Brian
Butcher, vice president for research and professional education.
``We at the Arthritis Foundation are very excited, because this is
an ultimate outcome of the many years of research support in Lyme
disease that we have provided.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to preventing further cases of Lyme disease, the
vaccine may provide a model for addressing other types of arthritis
where there are preliminary indications for bacterial triggers,
Butcher says, including rhuematoid arthritis, lupus and ankylosing
spondylitis, a kind of arthritis that affects the spine.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Checking for ticks
</P>
<P>
   Heading for the great outdoors? The Arthritis Foundation
recommends taking personal precautions to avoid the risk of tick
bites. Among them: Conduct detailed tick checks at the end of each
day (to remove any tick before it can transmit disease), wear light
clothes (so ticks will be visible), tuck pants cuffs into socks (so
ticks cannot gain access to the skin) and properly use insect
repellents that contain the chemical insecticide DEET.
</P>
<P>
   For free brochures and additional information on Lyme disease,
call the Arthritis Foundation at (800) 283-7800.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Research on Lyme disease
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country are taking some novel approaches
to try to stop ticks and Lyme disease on their march across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Lizards may be protecting some areas of the country, including
parts of Texas, from Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   The small Western fence lizard, a favorite feeding host for the
Western black-legged tick that carries Lyme disease, has a protein
in its blood that kills the Lyme bacteria as the tick sucks,
harming neither the tick nor the lizard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lizards are doing humanity a great service here in the west,''
says Dr. Robert Lane of the College of Natural Resources at the
University of California at Berkeley, who reported on the lizards
last year in the ``Journal of Parasitology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The infection rates are diluted out west and down south
because you have a host that acts as a dead end for transmission,''
says Dr. Richard Falco, a medical entomologist at Fordham
University and scientific consultant for the American Lyme Disease
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He is looking for a similar biological agent to help control
Lyme disease in colder parts of the country, where the lizards
cannot survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at nematodes and fungi that might appeal to the
ticks and work similarly,'' Falco said when contacted by phone last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Falco is also participating in a U.S. Department of Agriculture
project that started in Kerrville several years ago and involves
applying insecticides to paint rollers around troughs that are
supplied with corn to attract deer.
</P>
<P>
   As the deer reach their heads into the feeders to eat the corn,
they rub their necks against the rollers and self-apply the
insecticide, which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
It kills the ticks but does not harm the deer, Falco says.
</P>
<P>
   Also, researchers at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst
are studying how parasitic wasps can be used as tiny guided
missiles to kill ticks.
</P>
<P>
   The wasps use a sharp appendage to lay eggs within the ticks.
Their offspring hatch inside the ticks and kill them.

DAY 2 GOP REACTION TO CLINTON SPEECH: GRUDGING ADMIRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS lede; Republican sted Republicans; pickup2ndgraf, ``it

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after Bill Clinton's State of the Union
address, some Republicans governors expressed grudging admiration
for the impeachment-embattled president's ability to deliver the
speech that prompted high approval ratings for him in overnight
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quintessentially Bill Clinton,'' said Oklahoma's
Republican Gov. Frank Keating in a conference call with reporters.
Keating called Clinton's laundry list of priorities on Social
Security, health care, education and defense a combination of ``New
Deal and shining city on the hill,'' references to speech imagery
favored by Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's commendable that the president wants to use the surplus
for Social Security,'' Keating said. ``Now it's time to get down to
details, to make sure this is a long term solution and not
rhetoric. If Republicans and the president can come together and
resolve the Social Security crisis now, all Americans will
benefit.'' Keating stressed that ``the public wants a bipartisan
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   But he criticized Clinton for not offering Republicans ``more of
an olive branch. We make it a point to compliment Democrats who
make governance possible. It was Republicans who balanced the
budget, and the president made no mention of that. The recovery
started in 1991 (under President George Bush), and no mention was
made of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Ed Schafer of North Dakota, joining the
conference call, said, ``The president is a great deliverer,'' and
added that in the speech ``there was something for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schafer criticized Clinton for not including a tax cut among
his proposals and said he was relying too heavily on government
solutions in areas such as Social Security. ``He's reinstituting
the era of big government,'' Schafer said.
</P>
<P>
   In his Social Security rescue plan, Clinton said the government
should invest a quarter of the budget surplus funds that he would
divert to the Social Security trust fund over the next 15 years and
called for setting up federally subsidized savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming, who also took part in
the conference call, said Clinton's speech ``showed a mastery of
politics. There is no more truth, only perception. Clinton used the
weapons of mass distraction in his address.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said in an
interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that since Clinton
``probably will'' survive Republican efforts to remove him from
office, ``we need to move forward. We can't leave these wounds
open.''
</P>
<P>
   And conservative activist Gary Bauer, a possible Republican
presidential contender, told reporters he admired Clinton's ability
to ``compartmentalize'' his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure most people in public life in Washington facing
the sort of charges he's facing would have quite had the
performance he had last night,'' said Bauer, a former Reagan
administration official who has been a leading critic of Clinton.
``It's an incredible phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls released Wednesday by ABC, CBS and NBC showed the public's
approval of Clinton's job performance is still high at the same
time that the Senate is hearing evidence on whether he should be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   His job approval rating was 66 percent in the ABC poll, 72
percent in the CBS poll and 76 percent in the NBC poll. In the CBS
poll, six out of 10 said his actions are not serious enough to
warrant his removal.

HOME CLINIC: PREPARING TO HANG A LARGE MIRROR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hanging large mirrors can be a problem because they are heavy,
difficult to maneuver and require adequate wall support.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find a ready-made large mirrors that fits your
specifications, you can order one custom cut to almost any
reasonable size and shape. Look in the Yellow Pages under
``Mirrors, Retail'' to find a shop that will cut a mirror to your
specifications. Before ordering a mirror take the time to
accurately measure the space where you intend to hang it.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to mount the mirror in the middle of a large wall
that has ample space on either side, then your measurements need
not be precise. If, however, you want to place the mirror in a
recess with little clearance, it is essential to take accurate
measurements so the mirror will fit properly.
</P>
<P>
   Measure the width of the area in at least three different
places, top, midpoint and bottom. Take the narrowest measure and
subtract at least 3/4 inch to find the width needed for the mirror.
The extra 3/4 inch will allow room so you can position the mirror
without scratching the adjacent walls.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a mirror that's at least 1/4-inch thick. Thinner 1/8-inch
mirrors are less expensive, but they are not as sturdy and are apt
to be wavy. That can cause distortions in the reflected image.
Usually, the mirror will have smooth, ground edges on all sides.
You can, if you wish, order the mirror with beveled edges, but
there will be an additional cost for this.
</P>
<P>
   After you purchase the mirror, you are faced with the task of
maneuvering it into place. This may not be easy because large
mirrors are heavy and they can break under their own weight if they
are not gripped and supported correctly during transport. Remember
also that mirrors are not usually made of safety glass _ unless
they are made for closet or shower doors. If a mirror breaks, it
can split into a number of sharp and dangerous pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Do not try to move a large mirror by yourself. Enlist the aid of
an able-bodied assistant to help you. Wear heavy-duty work gloves.
The gloves will provide a better grip and protect your hands. In
addition, the gloves will keep the oils on your skin from getting
on and damaging the silver coating on the back of the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   It will be easier to carry the mirror if you use glazier's
handles. These handles have large suction cups that attach directly
to the surface of the glass. They are especially useful when you
have to maneuver the mirror into a tight space where it may be
difficult to get a good hand-hold around the edges of the mirror.
Unfortunately, these suction-cup handles are often difficult to
rent _ not all equipment rental stores have them. If you have to
carry a large mirror up winding stairs or navigate through narrow
spaces, it may be safer to pay the mirror store to move it for you.
</P>
<P>
   Secure the mirror to the wall with two lengths of extruded
aluminum ``J- channel'' _ so-called because the cross section of
the bracket looks like the letter ``J.'' The channels come in two
configurations, one for the top and one for the bottom. They look
similar, but the top channel has a wider lip than the bottom
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Use a hacksaw with a fine-tooth blade to cut each channel to
length, then file all the ends smooth. Mount the channel onto the
wall with drywall nails driven into the studs. You may have to
drill new holes if the existing holes in the channel do not line up
with the studs. Be careful when you hammer the nails; if you miss,
you could dent the channel.
</P>
<P>
   Attach the bottom channel first, then position the top channel
so it is 3/8 inch higher than the height of the mirror. This gives
you enough clearance so you can slip the mirror into the top
channel and then lower it into the bottom one.
</P>
<P>
   Large mirrors need additional support, in the form of mastics,
to hold them in place. Mastics are adhesives that are applied to
the back of the mirror. It is important to only use mastic
specifically formulated for mirror mounting. Other types of
mastics, like construction or panel adhesives, may damage the
silver coating on the back of the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Place a few large globs (about 3 inches in diameter) in the
center of the mirror about 12 inches apart. Do not put any mastic
within 6 inches of the mirror edge; it could ooze out when you
press the mirror in place. Position the mirror in the channels,
then press firmly on the surface of the mirror to spread the
mastic. The mastic will dry in about 24 hours and hold the mirror
tight against the wall.

THE RAVAGES OF AFGHANISTAN'S GENDER APARTHEID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday, Jan. 26)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which is worse?
</P>
<P>
   Not being able to go to a doctor because he is a man and you are
a woman and there are no longer any women doctors?
</P>
<P>
   Or having your thumb chopped off because you are wearing nail
polish?
</P>
<P>
   One is life threatening, but the other is such a ridiculous
prohibition that it is almost more chilling.
</P>
<P>
   Both are happening to women in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   It always seems easier to dismiss brutality when it happens on
the other side of the world, in a place you'll never go. You can
say it's their madness. Their way.
</P>
<P>
   But in Afghanistan it is not as convenient as madness.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two years now, members of the Taliban militia have
been killing and humiliating the women of Afghanistan. The whole
society is under siege, but it is the spirit of women and girls
that leaders seemingly most want to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the world community know and condemn this, but
not enough to make it stop, and so the petitions continue to show
up in mass mailings on the Internet. People like Hillary Clinton
and Madeleine Albright express their outrage. International
feminist groups keep gender apartheid in Afghanistan as a priority
interest. Individuals wear small lapel pins of mesh fabric to
announce their solidarity with Afghan women and girls.
</P>
<P>
   The mesh represents the eye piece in the burqa, the required
head to toe body wrap that marks and imprisons all females under
Taliban rule.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Hale is a Sonoma State University student who leads
vigils, sits at information tables, talks to classes and carries
petitions calling for the United States to condemn the Taliban's
acts.
</P>
<P>
   She once tried on a burqa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really suffocating. You feel very vulnerable. The screen
in front of your eyes leaves you blindsided, so you can't walk
upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   You also can't use your hands for balance, or anything else, she
said, because the garment is designed to be held closed. So all you
can do is walk in it.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a woman in Afghanistan you must be accompanied every
time you leave your house by a male relative - husband, father,
son, brother. If you walk with someone who is not your relative you
can be charged with adultery and publicly whipped, unless you are
married and walking with someone who isn't your relative and then
you can be killed.
</P>
<P>
   Corey, a full-time student, single mother and president of the
Feminist Majority Leadership Alliance on campus, which would all be
considered incredible luxuries or crimes by someone living in
Afghanistan, makes the connection between her world and theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Taliban took over less than three years ago women
worked in the professions, next to men in the fields, served in
parliament, dressed as they wanted, gathered freely. Little girls,
like boys, grew up with possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Students ask Corey if her petition, which will go to President
Clinton, Secretary of State Albright and U.N. secretary general
Kofi Annan, is ``religious interference.'' She shows them where
other Muslim countries have disassociated themselves from the
Taliban which inappropriately uses religion as its excuse. Informed
discussion has followed with Muslim women students explaining the
difference between choosing to wear a veil and women being forced
to be totally concealed.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority, asks, ``How
can women be safe anywhere if some governments can carry out gender
apartheid with impunity?''
</P>
<P>
   In the global community, if your neighbor is beating his wife,
you need to do something about the screams.
</P>
<P>
   So, imagine yourself in their place. Suddenly, you must give up
your job and take your daughters out of school. You cannot meet a
friend. You cannot wear shoes that make noise. Your windows must be
painted black so that you can't be seen. You cannot even pluck your
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the claustrophobia inside the burqa that you are now
forced to wear. There is no air on your skin. Journalist Jan
Goodwin reports that women are so poor that they can't even afford
their own burqa but must share one with the neighborhood. Each must
then wait days for her turn in order to go out to buy food.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the shame. You are hooded and shunned like you have some
communicable disease, which they explain is that the sight of you
causes men to lose their self control.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, even the men who do not agree with the leaders start
to treat you poorly in order to protect themselves. And then it
becomes part of male thinking, and even, worse, female thinking,
that women are truly inferior.
</P>
<P>
   The bullies win.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast. In December the California-based oil company,
Unocal, withdrew its plans to build the trans-Afghanistan pipeline.
It cited pressure from feminist groups for it to stop doing
business with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if women know, and if they shared any satisfaction
behind their burqas.
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't laugh. In Afghanistan it's illegal to laugh in
public.

   BOZEMAN, Mont. _ The fire had burned down to a heap of coals.
With a gloved hand, Randy LaFerr opened the oven door of his
monumental Tulikivi soapstone fireplace from Finland and with a
long-handle rake pushed the coals out the back and into the stove
below. The soapstone bricks that line the oven were around 750
degrees, the perfect temperature, LaFerr said, to start the hors
d'oeuvres. He placed a plate of goat cheese and cured olives with
marinara sauce in the oven. In five minutes, it was bubbling gently
behind the glass door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taste of food cooked in a Tulikivi is unlike anything else
I know of,'' said LaFerr, who owns the Enterprise Fish Company
restaurants in Santa Monica and Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The use of wood-burning stoves and fireplaces, which boomed in
the 1960s and '70s, has waned because of the danger of chimney
fires and the nonstop work involved in sawing, chopping and
carrying wood. There are also regulations, especially in the West,
that govern new wood stoves and fireplaces because they are a major
source of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Tulikivi, a company based in Jukka, Finland, says it has solved
many of those problems by using an old technology. Tulikivi _
``fire stone'' in Finnish _ has rekindled the art of making huge
heaters out of native gray soapstone. The company has found a way
to mass-produce a four-ton product that is both esthetic and
efficient (though as expensive as a new car and almost as big).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm attracted to functional art,'' LaFerr said. ``Things that
are beautiful and at the same time have a superior function.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is l8 years old and has been operating in this
country for 12 years, though much of that time it has been plagued
with organizational problems. The North American sales department
has been reorganized, however, and Heikki Vauhkonen, the son of the
founder, Reijo Vauhkonen, has moved to New York with his wife, Anu
Vauhkonen, to oversee operations.
</P>
<P>
   Tulikivi sold 17,000 units worldwide last year, mostly in
northern Europe. Just 250 of those were in the United States,
making Tulikivis rarer than Ferraris. (In the spring, the company
will open a large new showroom in Cold Springs, N.Y.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet the beauty of the Tulikivi, its price (as much as $16,000)
and the freedom it affords from hourly trips to the woodpile have
made it revered in the Western states. ``There's some kind of
hearth magic about this soapstone,'' said Tom McGuane, the
Montana-based novelist, who has a small Tulikivi in his bedroom.
``It's comforting to lie in bed in the winter and watch the
flames.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rocky Mountains, with their cold winters and omnipresent
wood piles, have become home to scores of Tulikivis. Add to that
the trend toward self-sufficiency, spawned by the belief that a
Year 2000 computer apocalypse will cause wide power disruptions,
and interest multiplies. ``I've had five or six installations lined
up at the beginning of each year for the last few years,'' said Ron
Pihl, a mason who is the Tulikivi distributor and installer in much
of the West. ``This year I have 20, and many of those are because
of Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tulikivi principle is simple. Make an extremely hot fire of
well-seasoned wood with the damper wide open for two or three
hours. Once the embers die down and the dampers are closed, the
stone gets even hotter. For the next 12 to 24 hours, heat from the
Tulikivi radiates into the house, all without any further feeding
or stoking.
</P>
<P>
   I was skeptical of the claims but invested in a modest Tulikivi
to heat my home outside Helena, Mont. Even on the coldest days, the
Tulikivi gets so hot during our ritual evening fire that we can
slow-cook a stew in its oven the following day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like most is that you don't have to get up in the
morning and light a fire,'' said LaFerr's wife, Shelley. ``It's
still warm.''
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the Tulikivi is its gray soapstone, shot through
with spidery white veins. It is quarried next to the factory at
Jukka and has a talc content ideally suited for the high
temperature of the stove. Soapstone conducts 8 to 10 times as much
heat as brick fireplaces and holds the heat longer. Yet it is soft,
which makes it easy to saw and carve. When polished, it has a silky
smooth feel, similar to marble.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the Tulikivi is a home appliance with a stirring
history. In the mid-1500s, during what has been called the Little
Ice Age, the population of Europe was growing, and firewood was
scarce. Most homes were heated with a simple fireplace. The first
patent for a more efficient stove was granted in 1557. Primitive
masonry stoves, some with sleeping platforms on top, spread through
Europe. Germans still use a wood stove covered with ceramic tiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedes were credited with developing the modern masonry
stove in 1767, when Baron Carl Johan Cronstedt, an architect, came
up with a more efficient design. The Finns took the Swedish unit,
with its baffles to trap gases and heat, and added heat-absorbing
soapstone, from the mountains of Karelia in Finland. In the early
1900s, the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen designed some masonry
stoves; later, Tulikivi used some of those designs.
</P>
<P>
   With central heating, masonry-stove-design waned. But in the
last decade, the heaters have made a comeback. Tulikivi builds its
stoves by hand in Finland, then breaks them down for shipping. The
13 standard models, from four to six feet in size, are capable of
heating 750 to 1,500 square feet on one level (more if there are
two levels).
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drawback to a Tulikivi is the price. While a
conventional wood stove sells for a few hundred dollars, Tulikivis
range from $4,500 to $16,000 and more. Custom units _ one had
carved animal figures and soapstone tiles inlaid with jasper and
onyx _ can reach $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the start. The stoves must be professionally
installed by a mason, which adds $1,000 to $3,000. Figure $1,000 to
$3,000 more if it is to go into an existing home.
</P>
<P>
   No one puts a Tulikivi in the trunk of the car and installs it
on a Saturday afternoon. Buying the stove requires a serious
commitment. It is best if an architect plans the unit's place in a
new home; a retrofit requires engineers. The Tulikivi also has to
have its own foundation, and because it burns so hot, it may need a
particularly high chimney.
</P>
<P>
   Some will say that they are worth it. ``I've seen units that are
100 to 150 years old in Finland,'' said Dale Hisler, a mason who
works with Pihl. ``And they increase in value.''

SURFING IN CIRCLES AND LOVING IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ore., Okla., Va., Wash., N.J., Pa., Md.)   (af)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If using a search engine can be like drinking from a fire hose,
Internet surfing using a Web ring is like sharing a cup of tea with
a group of strangers who are batty about some hobby of yours, like
collecting Australian emergency-squad insignia.
</P>
<P>
   Web rings are circles of Internet pages on various topics that
are linked democratically, by their creators, a change from the
wider Web's more official and commercial clamor. The rings provide
homespun displays of hobbies, obscure and common expertise and
general camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60,000 Web rings, including more than one million
member sites, can be searched via Webring.org, which was purchased
in December by Geocities, the free home-page service. There are
similar Web-ring structures, like Looplink (www.looplink.com) and
The Rail (www.therail.com), but Webring.org is the largest.
</P>
<P>
   A Web ring is like a giant backyard fence, said Bruce J. Zanca,
a Geocities spokesman. ``It allows all the people who are
interested in the same topic to move in next door to each other,
click on an icon, go to their neighbors' houses and see what's
doing in there,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   It all started in June 1995, when Sage Weil, a high school
student in Ashland, Ore., wrote some computer code to link Web
sites, or particular pages from various sites, in rings. Weil is
now a junior studying computer science at Harvey Mudd College in
Claremont, Calif. The main advantage of a Web ring, he said, was
that ``it allows anyone to create their own little community.''
</P>
<P>
   Webmasters join a ring by adding to their pages the code that
can be found on the home page of the particular ring. Surfers are
then able to move from one site in the ring to another by clicking
the Forward or Back buttons, the Show Next Five Sites button or a
button that will call up a site at random from the ring.
</P>
<P>
   By hitting the Forward button enough times, surfers can usually
travel through the entire ring and eventually land back at the
beginning. But some Web rings, like The Rail, take you straight
through the sites without looping you back to the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking for something in a Web ring is easier than doing a
search because search engines have gotten so difficult, they just
don't pick up the site you want and you get 400,000 hits,'' said
Gayla Nelson of Guymon, Okla., who runs a personal home page called
www.gaylasgarden.com, which has 316 pages, including a place to
adopt virtual houseplants. ``If you're doing a search for a Web
ring on prisoners of war, you get whole sites devoted to them, not
just sites with a dedication page about POWs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayla's Garden receives about 100 sites a day, about 10 percent
of them via the 20 rings she has joined, which include Moms with
Modems, the Original ICQ Web ring (based on the instant messaging
system) and a Christmas ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lot more traffic because some people surf through
Web rings and just want to look at pet pages or recipe pages,'' she
said. Charley Lanusse, chief operating officer of Geocities'
Starseed division, which operates Webring.org, conceded that fewer
sites were searched through Web rings than through search engines.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the things driving the Web-ring phenomenon is the
explosive growth in personal home pages, sites run by people _ not
companies or schools or governments _ that usually cover hobbies,
opinions, lists of favorite ska recordings, earnest poetry,
pictures of pets and links to other sites. Geocities said it had
two million personal home pages last June and now has 3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sites are posted by ordinary people referring to
ordinary or not-so-ordinary things: their families, their pets,
their odd or mundane hobbies and interests. Rings linking similar
sites have sprouted up to embrace People Born on the Fifth of May,
anything having to do with Mendham, N.J. (population 4,890), and
fans of fractal art, plus connoisseurs of Hanson, cribbage players,
fans of particular songs, and, of course, people who have
derogatory things to say about Web rings.
</P>
<P>
   For surfers interested in certain topics, Web rings provide more
content per click than search engines. The rings are frequently run
by people who are passionate, informed and up to date about their
topic of choice and who monitor the editorial content of the ring
and of the Web at large, focusing on their particular passion.
</P>
<P>
   Most can be searched through the home page of Webring.org,
though most people first run across rings by noticing the Forward
and Backward buttons at the bottom of a Web page in a ring.
</P>
<P>
   That's how William and Pauline Stout of Hamilton, Ontario,
discovered Web rings. Now they run nine of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We happened to be surfing through, looking for graphics,''
Stout said, ``and we happened on one that said Web site-design Web
ring.'' The Stouts hope that the Web design business they run will
get them off their disability pensions, Stout added.
</P>
<P>
   The Stouts have found Web rings helpful in promoting their
growing business, at www.execulink.com/wstout, and have enjoyed the
camaraderie the Web ring offers with other Web page designers. ``If
one person is good at what they do, it promotes the others, so
you're not just helping yourself, you're helping other people in
your group,'' Stout said. He has also started rings to connect
e-mail penpals, to promote helping the homeless and to welcome
newbies to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But the rings are not entirely rosy. Those that aren't carefully
watched by ringmasters tend to have defunct pages that break the
circle. Sources of information are hard to verify, especially on
personal home pages, and many surfers are unaware that rings even
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Paul M.A. Baker, a professor at George Mason University in
Fairfax, Va., who studies online communities, said Web rings
offered ``a lot of peripheral on-the-edge sort of stuff _ someone
writing about the maintenance of varnishes on wooden handgun
stocks, really weird stuff.'' If a site was really substantive, he
said, it would not need to join a ring but would be picked up by
surfers using search engines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web ring seems to be kind of a way to give strength to the
aggregate, as if having links of related things created a whole out
of it,'' he said. ``I wouldn't rely on anything there unless I knew
the quality of the source itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The rings remind him of how surveys are conducted to determine
the leaders in any society: ask people who are the influential
ones, then ask those influential people for the names of the
influential, until there are no more names. ``There's a finite
number of self-referencing links,'' Baker said, and the same is
true within Web rings.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Geocities purchase in December, the Web ring
phenomenon had been short on commercialization, one of its main
selling points in the eyes of netizens who are sick of spam and
flickering advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem like there's a substrate of the Web out there
that increasingly won't show up in the commercial search engines,''
said Marc A. Smith, a research sociologist at Microsoft. ``Web
rings are endogenous. They bubble up from below.''
</P>
<P>
   He appreciates rings for the way members direct traffic to one
another. ``The fact that they're doing it noncommercially and
cooperatively is one of the very positive things about the Net,''
Smith said, especially when some search engines charge fees to
companies that want to make sure that their sites get preferred
placement in the list of search results, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Geocities bought Webring.org, ring members fretted that
rings would lose their cachet as a sanctuary from commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geocities is generally loathed because of its hideous pop-up
ads and the watermark,'' said a Webmaster for a ring, Kymm Zuckert
of Weehawken, N.J., referring to the advertising pages that attempt
to capture the interest of visitors to Geocities sites and to the
Geocities' watermark, an animated G that appears on each screen.
``If Geocities tries to do any of that with Webring, there will be
a massive exodus.''
</P>
<P>
   Pop-up ads and watermarks have been very unpopular with
Geocities users, and the company says they will not appear on Web
rings but will show up, as they always have, on Geocities home
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Weil, who wrote the code that glues Web rings together, said he
did not want to see the rings commercialized and did not think
Geocities would do that. ``I think what makes Web rings really
useful is the Webmasters say `I'm going to create a Web ring,
something that's valuable, and they have a certain attachment to
it,'' he said. ``I was very leery of betraying their trust in
Webring, to allow them to create something they're personally
responsible for and own, and then if some company starts plastering
ads on their sites, they're like hello, this is the site that I
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geocities was very understanding of the sensitivities the
ringmasters have. As soon as the merger was announced, people in
the rings were saying `no pop-ups, no watermarks, blah blah blah,'
but from our perspective, it was very clear and obvious that that
would never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baker, no fan of commercialism, said advertising could offer
a seal of approval to sites that might otherwise lack credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, a site with ads tells you something in a way
of validation _ at least someone else feels this is worthy of
putting money on,'' Baker said. ``The fact that there are no ads
there tells you that the site is not perceived as much of a
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanusse, of Geocities, said Webring had a different mechanism
for advertising than Geocities: most Webring advertisements appear
on the screen that introduces the next five pages in the ring. He
does not expect that to change, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zanca, the Geocities spokesman, said his company, which paid
about $25 million in stock and cash for Webring, was interested in
some unused advertising space on the rings and in how Web rings
could increase traffic to Geocities home pages.
</P>
<P>
   But the spirit of Web rings remains decidedly not corporate.
Dinty W. Moore, an English professor at the Altoona campus of
Pennsylvania State University, likes Web rings because they let
computer users shape the Internet, much as Usenet participants
create their own newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet users in search of some method to the random madness
of the Web have latched onto an organizing method that they
control,'' said Moore, author of ``The Emperor's Virtual Clothes,''
(Algonquin Books, 1995). ``They create the rings, they add the
pages, they spin off new, ever-more-specific rings. Where portals
like Yahoo aspire to be `media networks,' by shaping and organizing
the topic areas by which Web info is defined, Web rings are very
grass-roots.''
</P>
<P>
   As in other places on the Web, irrepressible rants and raves and
self-reflexive groups pop up in rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a Web-ring Web ring, a ring about rings,'' said Scott
Wenzel of Knoxville, Md., who runs Child Free
(www.fred.net/turtle/kids/ring.html), a ring for people who have
chosen not to have children. He belongs to several rings _ about
cats, Swedish cars, the blues and antique tractors _ but he won't
visit the Webring Addicts Web ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried I'll get sucked into a black hole and end up in
another side of the universe.''

SCIENTISTS ARE PUBLISHING MORE ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga., Conn.)   (af)  
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Print versions of scientific journals could soon be a thing of
the past, as the Internet gives rise to thousands of electronic
journals and helps usher in a new era for scientific publishing,
according to an article published Wednesday in the journal Nature. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Much evidence suggests that maintaining a plethora of
high-price, low-circulation journals as the primary means of
scientific communication is no longer the best way to meet the
needs of users,'' said the article, written by Declan Butler.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years or so, as traditional publishers have
put electronic versions of their journals onto the Web, the rise in
the number of so-called E-journals has been meteoric.
Reed-Elsevier, the largest commercial publisher of scientific
journals, now has more than 1,200 of its titles on line,
Springer-Verlag has 360, and Academic Press has 174. ``A journal
without a Web version is now rare, and probably endangered,'' the
Nature article said.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of E-journals has yet to help lower the high price of
subscribing to scientific journals. Many traditional print journals
now on the Web charge a surcharge for the electronic edition, in
addition to the basic subscription fee, or restrict access to
subscribers. A few publishers offer lower rates for an
electronic-version-only subscription to a journal.
</P>
<P>
   But many scientific researchers and research librarians say they
hope that E-journals will eventually alter the economics of
scholarly publishing. In several scientific quarters, electronic
journals are springing up to compete with expensive print titles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Association of Research Libraries' Scholarly Publishing
and Academic Resources Coalition, for example, recently announced
the debut of PhysChemComm
(www.rsc.org/is/journals/current/physchemcomm/pccpub.htm), an
electronic journal from England's Royal Society of Chemistry, to
compete with print journals that cover chemical physics and
physical chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the entire editorial board of the high-priced journal
Evolutionary Ecology, published by Wolters Kluwer, based in the
Netherlands, left in protest over the journal's subscription price.
Led by the journal's former editor in chief, Michael Rosenzweig, a
professor at the University of Arizona, the group has just begun
producing Evolutionary Ecology Research, a lower-priced alternative
in both print and electronic form (www.evolutionary-ecology.com).
</P>
<P>
   Research libraries, many of which struggle to pay for expensive
print journals, generally welcome the change. At Denmark's national
Technical Knowledge Center and Library in Lyngby, outside
Copenhagen, print journals are being phased out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant savings when you go from print to
electronic only is the fading away of the staff-intensive work
procedures connected to handling the print editions,'' said Lars
Bjoernshauge, the director of the library. By shifting away from
handling paper, the Danish library expects to increase its titles
by 25 percent by the end of this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some research librarians are less sanguine about the rate at
which scientific publishing is changing. ``It should happen
faster,'' said William Loughner, physical sciences bibliographer at
the University of Georgia. ``I could come up with a list of real
science journals that are new and independent and it would be a
very short list.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle to faster change is concern among librarians over
how electronic materials will be preserved for posterity. ``We're
not sure electrons are stable enough to withstand the test of
time,'' said Ann Okerson, an associate university librarian at Yale
University.

DAY 2 GOP REACTION TO CLINTON SPEECH: GRUDGING ADMIRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS lede; Republican sted Republicans; pickup2ndgraf, ``it

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after Bill Clinton's State of the Union
address, some Republican governors expressed grudging admiration
for the impeachment-embattled president's ability to deliver the
speech that prompted high approval ratings for him in overnight
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quintessentially Bill Clinton,'' said Oklahoma's
Republican Gov. Frank Keating in a conference call with reporters.
Keating called Clinton's laundry list of priorities on Social
Security, health care, education and defense a combination of ``New
Deal and shining city on the hill,'' references to speech imagery
favored by Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's commendable that the president wants to use the surplus
for Social Security,'' Keating said. ``Now it's time to get down to
details, to make sure this is a long term solution and not
rhetoric. If Republicans and the president can come together and
resolve the Social Security crisis now, all Americans will
benefit.'' Keating stressed that ``the public wants a bipartisan
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   But he criticized Clinton for not offering Republicans ``more of
an olive branch. We make it a point to compliment Democrats who
make governance possible. It was Republicans who balanced the
budget, and the president made no mention of that. The recovery
started in 1991 (under President George Bush), and no mention was
made of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Ed Schafer of North Dakota, joining the
conference call, said, ``The president is a great deliverer,'' and
added that in the speech ``there was something for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schafer criticized Clinton for not including a tax cut among
his proposals and said he was relying too heavily on government
solutions in areas such as Social Security. ``He's reinstituting
the era of big government,'' Schafer said.
</P>
<P>
   In his Social Security rescue plan, Clinton said the government
should invest a quarter of the budget surplus funds that he would
divert to the Social Security trust fund over the next 15 years and
called for setting up federally subsidized savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming, who also took part in
the conference call, said Clinton's speech ``showed a mastery of
politics. There is no more truth, only perception. Clinton used the
weapons of mass distraction in his address.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said in an
interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that since Clinton
``probably will'' survive Republican efforts to remove him from
office, ``we need to move forward. We can't leave these wounds
open.''
</P>
<P>
   And conservative activist Gary Bauer, a possible Republican
presidential contender, told reporters he admired Clinton's ability
to ``compartmentalize'' his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure most people in public life in Washington facing
the sort of charges he's facing would have quite had the
performance he had last night,'' said Bauer, a former Reagan
administration official who has been a leading critic of Clinton.
``It's an incredible phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls released Wednesday by ABC, CBS and NBC showed the public's
approval of Clinton's job performance is still high at the same
time that the Senate is hearing evidence on whether he should be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   His job approval rating was 66 percent in the ABC poll, 72
percent in the CBS poll and 76 percent in the NBC poll. In the CBS
poll, six out of 10 said his actions are not serious enough to
warrant his removal.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American consumers set a record last year. They
bought more projection televisions than ever before, just over one
million of them. And with that, these mammoth sets captured the
largest share they have ever had of the nation's television market:
a whopping 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With those numbers, it may seem odd that since digital
high-definition television went on the market a few months ago,
every manufacturer in the world has chosen to manufacture and sell
huge rear-projection, high-definition sets. Every manufacturer but
one.
</P>
<P>
   Alone in the industry, Sony recently began selling a 34-inch
HDTV, the traditional sort with a picture tube. Sony sells the set
with its own stand, but you can also set it on a table, though you
had better select the table carefully. This set weighs 205 pounds.
And a look at it helps explain why Sony chose this path _ and why
everyone else chose the other.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is important because just about everyone will
have to buy a digital television receiver sooner or later, as the
nation makes the transition to digital television in the next 10
years or so. Most people will probably choose to buy televisions
that are like the ones they already have, and more than 95 percent
of all televisions sold today are the tabletop sort with picture
tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's wide-screen HDTV looks quite nice _ and it should,
considering the price: $9,000. Still, it's a product whose life
span is likely to be short, at least at that price, because several
manufacturers have announced their plans to begin selling similar
models at half that price or less later this year.
</P>
<P>
   So for many people, a look at the Sony television may serve
largely as an instructive exercise as they look toward the day when
they can buy HDTVs at prices that do not exceed the credit limits
on their charge cards.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing a seasoned viewer notices when watching HDTV on
Sony's television is that while the picture is far clearer than
anything available on a conventional set, it just does not reach
the level of clarity that the big projection televisions can offer.
</P>
<P>
   Picture clarity is largely a matter of resolution, and that is
determined by the number of picture elements, or pixels, on the
television screen. The best of the big-screen HDTVs can display
1,080 horizontal lines and 1,920 vertical lines. That gives a total
pixel count of a little more than two million.
</P>
<P>
   But it is extraordinarily difficult to squeeze two million tiny
phosphor dots onto a 34-inch television screen _ even a wide
screen, like Sony's. When Sony first made its product announcement
in September, the company said the set would provide 1,080
horizontal lines but refused to specify the vertical number.
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, a company spokesman said the screen would have
900 vertical lines, which means that Sony's screen has a little
less than one million pixels. That's three times as many as a
conventional analog set, but only half as many as a full-resolution
HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced HDTV viewers quickly discover a phenomenon that
helps explain the seductive nature of this new medium. When the
resolution of a television reaches a certain level, the viewer's
perception of it changes. The image seems three-dimensional, real _
like looking out a window. As a result, viewers respond to the
programming in a new way.
</P>
<P>
   An HDTV set offering two million pixels easily reaches that
level, and so does one with 25 percent fewer pixels. But the
threshold lies somewhere between that level and the resolution
offered by this Sony set. The Sony offers a sparkling, clear
picture, but watching it is like watching a beautiful picture. It's
not like looking out a window. Still, that is not the whole story
of HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   Keiichi Kubota, a senior engineer with NHK, the Japanese
television network, who helped design that nation's high-definition
system, explained in a recent discussion why NHK had named the new
medium ``high definition'' television instead of ``high
resolution'' television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because resolution is only one part of it,'' he said.
HDTV also offers greater brightness and contrast, he noted. The
color palette is richer and broader. The sound quality is higher.
In fact, for those people who have the requisite audio equipment,
the American system offers six-channel surround-sound audio.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, because the transmissions are digital, they are
generally free of the ghosts, snow and other interference that
hamper conventional television broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   So even if this Sony set and future tabletop HDTVs cannot match
the resolution of their monster-size brethren, they do offer all of
these other advantages. And this set also includes what Sony calls
``digital reality creation'' circuitry, which enhances the
resolution of conventional broadcasts and videotapes, vastly
improving the picture quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the new digital age, that becomes important because once
viewers see HDTV, most of them never want to go back. And for many
years to come, only a minority of the television programming will
be high-definition. Several companies are offering special
circuitry with their HDTVs, conceptually similar to Sony's, that
enhances regular programming. But Sony's is particularly effective.
</P>
<P>
   While Sony eventually revealed the full resolution numbers for
its set, many other manufacturers have not been so forthright. At
the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev., early this month,
several companies showing tabletop HDTV sets said those televisions
each offered two million pixels of resolution when it was obvious
that they could not. When challenged, the companies acknowledged
the exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the consumer-electronics industry decided that a set
had to have 1,080 horizontal lines to qualify as an HDTV. But the
manufacturers decided not to specify the number of vertical lines,
leaving the door open for misleading advertising. Given the
important differences in picture quality _ the resolution
``threshold'' _ that problem is likely to haunt the industry once
HDTV becomes a mainstream product.
</P>
<P>
   But for many people, it may not matter. HDTV is meant to be
watched by viewers who are fairly close. But in most homes, viewers
sit on a sofa 10 to 15 feet away from the television. At that
distance with a tabletop set, it would be hard to tell the
difference between HDTV and regular television.

<P>
   ``We miss New York all the time,'' said Jerry Harrison, the
keyboard player for Talking Heads, the rock band that emerged from
clubs like CBGB into the mainstream in the 1970s with hits like
``Psycho Killer'' and ``Burning Down the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '90s, Harrison has worked as a record producer,
living with his wife and children on a mountaintop dense with
redwoods _ and on many mornings shrouded with fog _ near Sausalito
in Marin County, Calif. To ease the transition from a loft in Soho
to the quasi-wilderness of Marin County, Harrison and his wife,
Carol, bought a 1960s redwood house, gutted it and replicated
elements of their Prince Street loft _ white walls, slate floors
and a stainless-steel staircase _ in the rustic shell.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Soho Goes Marin.
</P>
<P>
   The house, which the Harrisons designed with Jonathan Foster, a
Manhattan architect and a friend from Harrison's days at Harvard's
architecture school, is merrily hybrid: urban within, rural
without. It is a three-story, 5,000-square-foot loft wrapped in
redwood.
</P>
<P>
   The first floor is for the whole family. The second is primarily
for the four children: Griffin, 11, Aishlim, 9, Dylan, 7, and Micah
Barth-Rogers, 13, a friend who joined the family in August when his
mother became ill. ``He's just another brother,'' Aishlim said,
shrugging. The third floor _ bedroom, sitting room with 61-inch
television, and office _ is for the parents. (But children have
been known to curl up in front of the television, along with their
cats, Zulu, Kiwi and B.D.)
</P>
<P>
   If Harrison's life is animated by music, the house is enlivened
by wild changes in the weather. In the course of a day, or
sometimes just a few hours, the sky will shift from a chill mist
that penetrates the marrow to brilliant sunlight to pitch darkness
shot with zigzags of lightning. ``When it's bright, there are hard
shadows,'' Harrison said. ``On moody days, there's a filtered
light, and on some days we are above the clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he left New York, he said, ``To interact with nature
and 100-mile-an-hour winds.'' He laughed. ``That's an acceptable
excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason was actually far more prosaic. By the late '80s, the
heyday of Talking Heads was over. The group had stopped touring in
1985, and its last album, ``Naked,'' was released in 1988. ``In the
mid-'80s, I went back and forth to Milwaukee,'' said Harrison, who
was born there 49 years ago. ``My mother had cancer, and my father
had died.'' While he was caring for his mother, he met Carol, then
a student at the University of Wisconsin, and in 1987, Griffin was
born. By 1989, Aishlim was on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea how to estimate how much money I'd make,''
Harrison said. ``So in 1993, we moved to Milwaukee.'' In Manhattan
in the early '90s, it cost $1,000 a day to rent a recording studio;
in Milwaukee, it cost $1,000 a week. And if he wanted to go to a
club to hear music, ``it cost $3 to get in, and $3 for a drink,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But after two years in Milwaukee, the family wanted to find a
permanent place to live. The answer was Marin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only place with 10 recording studios and a suburban
environment where we can send kids to public schools,'' Harrison
explained. Some other attractions: ``Skywalker Ranch is here.
Fleetwood Mac, Sly and the Family Stone, Stevie Wonder _ they all
recorded here. And Bonnie Raitt lives in Marin.''
</P>
<P>
   Although zoning laws kept the Harrisons from enlarging the Marin
house, they demolished the interior. It was a dark warren of
wood-paneled rooms, and it had an architectural peculiarity: there
were  &UR; no &LR;  windows facing the Pacific. But the couple loved the site
and knew what they wanted. ``Simple and open,'' Ms. Harrison said.
In 1995, Foster flew to California, spent four days walking through
the old house with the Harrisons and prepared the design on a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The focal point, the element that signifies Soho, is a
stainless-steel staircase that soars from the entrance hall to the
second floor. But what gives the staircase exceptional grace is its
lightness: it has open treads and thin horizontal rails, so
sunlight and air flow through unobstructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Jerry's idea _ the shape of the staircase,'' said Ms.
Harrison, 37, who not only helped design the house but also scoured
stone yards for granite, auction houses for the Art Deco living
room furniture and flea markets for the 1930s orange and white Art
Deco pottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry told me to take it and run with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first floor has an airy kitchen with gleaming
stainless-steel appliances, and in the center a black granite
island. On the second floor, a perforated steel catwalk, the kind
usually found in warehouses, cuts across the double-height living
room and ends in a small spiral steel staircase, which also has
open treads, and slender, curvy rails. Three children's rooms are
on this floor, with Griffin and Micah sharing bunk beds in one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the third-floor master bathroom, the black and white tiles
also speak of Soho, as do the white walls throughout the house. The
only color repeated in the house is turquoise, which turns up on
the front door, the mullions and the spiral staircase on the
exterior. Ms. Harrison chose turquoise because on the color wheel
she was using, it was shown as the complementary color to the
reddish-orange of redwood.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The windows, all new, frame views big and small. To the north is
Mount Tamalpais, which Haight-Ashbury hippies of the '60s
considered the most transcendent place to take LSD. West lies the
Pacific, which is invisible when the fog rolls in _ not on tiny cat
feet but in thick, billowing ruffs that blanket the ground. To the
east is San Francisco Bay, and everywhere, redwoods shoot 75 feet
toward the sky. Even a task like rinsing dishes is less onerous
when the kitchen sink faces Muir Woods with Mount Tam peeking
through the branches.
</P>
<P>
   Bathing, too, is blissful when set in an aerie. The master
bathtub, large enough for two, looks out over the tops of the
redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   Such comfort is not cheap. Renovating the house took two years
and cost $600,000, with the lawn finally put in last month. ``I had
a good year last year, and I had a good year this year,'' Harrison
said. Among the albums he has produced are ``God Shuffled His
Feet''(1993) by Crash Test Dummies, whose lyrics suggest that his
omniscience is not a sure thing, and ``Throwing Copper'' (1994) by
Live, which sold 10 million albums worldwide, more than the
combined sales of ``Little Creatures'' and ``Stop Making Sense,''
the two top-selling Talking Heads albums.
</P>
<P>
   Does he miss the big time, when Talking Heads was playing Radio
City Music Hall and was on the cover of Rolling Stone?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' came the unhesitating answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997 I did a tour, `No Talking, Just Heads,' with Chris and
Tina,'' he said, referring to Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, two
original Talking Heads. ``And I did a two-week tour last year with
Live, so that softens the blow.'' In the last two years, he, Frantz
and Ms. Weymouth have recorded 15 to 20 tunes for an album that may
be released this year.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison admits to being wistful about Manhattan. He brings to
mind the adage that you can take the boy out of New York, but you
can't take New York out of the boy _ especially if he has a bit of
architecture school in his bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dropped out to join Talking Heads,'' he said, grinning. He
seems to have no regrets.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Foster, the Manhattan architect who worked with Jerry
and Carol Harrison to design their house, chose perforated steel
grating for the catwalk-balcony that leads across the living room
to a third-floor study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grating is used for mezzanines in warehouses and loft
structures when you want a thin, 3-inch second floor, rather than a
thick, 12-inch floor,'' Foster said. Spiral staircases are
traditionally attached to balconies, he said, and here the steel
staircase was simply sanded and coated with clear lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   THE BALCONY
</P>
<P>
   Open-Grip steel grating sells for around $10 a linear foot, 12
inches wide; the price varies with the width. The grating for the
balcony, which narrows from eight feet to five, cost $1,350,
excluding the cost of the structural framing and the railing, which
were custom made. McNichols Company, 2 Home News Row, New

   The seven-foot staircase, with treads three feet wide, cost

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The customer walked into the $1.5 million duplex
maisonette on Park Avenue and zeroed in on the decorative grilles
on the first-floor windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'd like to live in an apartment with bars on
it,'' Carlene Condon said, barely noting the ornate wrought-iron
balustrade, the swagged tapestry draperies, the Ionic columns and
the patterned marble floors. She shook her head. ``I mean,  &UR; Rikers
Island &LR;  has bars!''
</P>
<P>
   John Foreman, her real-estate agent, sighed. The day was not
getting off to a great start.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become one of the fastest-moving winter markets in
years, Manhattan real-estate brokers are hustling, trying to make
up for the third quarter, when buyers hesitated because of the
stock market's roller-coaster ride. Now, the agencies report, the
clients are back _ and buying. According to a Real Estate Board of
New York survey due out in early February, total sales volume in
the last quarter of 1998 rose 7 percent over the same period last
year. And according to a most year-end statistics, prices also
rose, well into the double digits for the larger apartments.
</P>
<P>
   So what is a day of selling real estate really like these days?
Is it a dawn-to-dusk frenzy, selling million-dollar duplexes as if
they were Volkswagen's New Beetle?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, a reporter tagged along with agents from two of the
city's most fiercely competitive companies, spending a day with
each.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman, a former architectural historian who has worked for
Halstead Property Co. for seven years, is so soft-spoken, the
reporter's back muscles hurt after spending a day leaning forward
to hear him.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Julie Gordon, a former Ford model turned co-op and
condominium saleswoman (why  &UR; do &LR;  real-estate agents always begin
their working lives in completely different occupations?), is
lively and outspoken. When desk mates at the Corcoran Group, where
she has worked for four years, were asked to characterize her, they
chanted in chorus, ``She's the one with the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps there is a certain symmetry that Foreman is working
with a woman who boldly compares the window grates in a Park Avenue
maisonette to those at the city prison. And that Ms. Gordon is
working with Robert McVeety, a record company manager who is as
reserved as Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what did you think of the apartments?'' Ms. Gordon asked
McVeety after viewing two one-bedroom apartments in a postwar
building on East 56th Street. ``OK,'' he replied, without passion.
</P>
<P>
   She pressed him: ``Which did you like better?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, life is full of compromises,'' he said. After a good 10
minutes of fruitless interrogation, Ms. Gordon thought she might
have unearthed a clue to his diffidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' she said a bit wearily. ``Let's look at some apartments
on the West Side.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 a.m., there's a message on the reporter's answering
machine from Julie Gordon: ``Oh, my God, it's snowing! It looks
like school is going to be canceled, and I don't have anyone to
take care of the kids, so I'll have to give up my appointments.
We're trying to get the Snow Patrol on the phone, but they're not
awake yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the day begins for Ms. Gordon, a 40-year-old divorced
mother of two who is trying to carve out a life selling real estate
while juggling her family responsibilities. She is not as well
known as her colleagues who are photographed in their Rolls-Royces
with celebrity clients: she walks to showings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon is a vice president at the Corcoran Group, a title
won because of the money she's earned. She once had a bulletin
board with a handful of her ribbons, each attesting to a sale of
more than $1 million; one day, she tossed them all out. ``I just
wasn't into the ribbons anymore,'' she said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   At 7, she calls back. ``We called the class mother and woke her
up. There's school.''
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, she throws open the door of her six-room
apartment at 141 E. 88th St., a prewar co-op that she rents. She's
still wearing a gray sweatshirt and sweatpants. Her daughters,
Laura, 9, and Kelly, 11, are already dressed for school. ``I feel
like we're in Montana _ and we're going off to kill that moose,''
their mother says, as they head out.
</P>
<P>
   Walking along Lexington Avenue at a rapid clip, Laura and Kelly
fight over who will get their mother's left hand. ``It's a better
hand,'' Laura insists, looking daggers at her older sister. A few
minutes before 8, the children are delivered to the
Nightingale-Bamford School, and Ms. Gordon speeds back to her
apartment. ``After the first time my clients go out with me, they
know to wear sneakers,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At 9, she's changing into her basic-black work clothes,
listening to messages: ``Oooh!'' she shrieks. ``I just found out
this guy who just bought an apartment from me the first day we went
out had looked at 37 other apartments with another broker. I feel
 &UR; so &LR;  bad for her!''
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour later, at the office on Madison Avenue, she calls
Bob McVeety, who wants to find an apartment for himself and his
wife. ``He's looking at one-bedrooms,'' she says. ``They're the
hardest to please. They're always trying to squeeze, to get more
bang for the buck. They want to see every 750-square-foot apartment
in Manhattan before they decide. It's not my niche, but I like him,
so I make an exception.''
</P>
<P>
   And if she  &UR; doesn't &LR;  like a client? ``I call 911,'' she says
referring to an extension at the office for just such
eventualities. ``I say, `I want to get rid of this buyer.' They can
take them over. Oh, sure, they'll give me a referral fee _ 10
percent. You go up to the broker and give her a kiss. Better her
than me!''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Across town, John Foreman is just getting started. His first
appointment is at noon. At 9:30, he leaves the giant postwar
complex on East 66th Street, where he sublets. He is bound for his
office on Madison Avenue to check out the ``show sheets'' (who in
his office is showing what), to return calls and to put together
his own schedule, which includes deciding whether he's ``going to
show somebody a piece of garbage just because you have to show them
 &UR; something &LR; .'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Foreman, 53, looks dapper in a camel's-hair coat and a
taupe-colored slouch hat. He grabs a cup of squash soup at E.A.T.
``How much could it cost?'' he asks, without checking. He soon
finds out: ``$8!'' Reeling, he takes the soup back to the office.
He is meeting Carlene Condon, a corporate lawyer, at a seven-room,
$1.4 million co-op on East 68th Street.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Condon, who has been looking for an apartment for more than
six months, had requested this particular building, if something
became available; it is a prewar doorman building with a fine Old
English courtyard garden seen through leaded-glass french doors.
But the apartment, freshly renovated, gets only a lukewarm ``nice''
from Ms. Condon. She is looking for something more dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop is the idiosyncratic Park Avenue maisonette, with
hidden marble shower and a kitchen with a balcony. Drama, yes, but
those bars on the windows just won't do. The broker and his client
shake hands. ``I'll call you,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman heads back to the Halstead office to check messages and
to track down a missing commission check for $8,000 (he found it).
At 1:30, he zips off to meet a well-known basketball player and his
wife, who want to buy on the Upper West Side, either a large
apartment in a prewar doorman building (her choice) or a town house
filled to the rafters with original details (his choice). Like some
other clients on this random workday, the basketball player
insisted that his name not be used for reasons of privacy.
Tactfully, Foreman is showing them three apartments and two
brownstones.
</P>
<P>
   They are disappointed in the first apartment, at 100 Riverside
Drive, listed as having ``5-6rms/riv views'' for $1.175 million.
``So where was the river?'' the basketball star asks, as he drives
away.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop is a magnificent brownstone that, alas, was almost
gutted years ago and renovated to a modern stuccoed sheen. ``It was
in several magazines,'' Judy Osten of Brown Harris Stevens, the
listing agent, says brightly. Foreman will split the commission if
the couple buys the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a shame!'' the basketball player says. ``How much do you
think it would cost to restore it to the way it was?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Osten leads the group to another brownstone at 44 W. 91st
St. Right away, the customers see a drawback: the house is right
across the street from an elementary school. ``Yes, but they're
little children,'' Ms. Osten says gamely. Inside, though, the
couple are enthralled. They roam from room to room, floor to floor.
They admire for the cherry kitchen, which leads out to a back
garden. He exclaims over the huge den at the rear of the first
floor, which opens to a tiny deck. ``See, what you'd have to do is
maybe just stain these boards darker,'' he says to no one in
particular. The house is $2 million. ``They'd have to come down a
lot _ like to $1.5,'' he says afterward. ``Then it'd be a good
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple then visit two elegant prewar buildings on West End
Avenue: an eight-room apartment at No. 924, the Clebourne, is
listed at $1.075 million and a seven-and-a-half room fixer-upper at
No. 875 is priced at $765,000. They are still leaning toward an
apartment they saw on their first outing with Foreman. ``There's a
bathroom situation,'' the basketball player explains. ``Yes, a
 &UR; situation &LR; ,'' his wife says with a laugh. They explain: there is
an old-fashioned shaving closet _ just a single sink _ which they
want to make into a third bathroom, but the board has already said
it would not allow the change. (Nonetheless, the couple has asked
Foreman to schedule an appointment to see it again.)
</P>
<P>
   His next customer is a banker named Aashish Kamat, a friendly
but taciturn man whom he shows a series of two-bedroom co-ops,
priced at $400,000 to $600,000. Kamat is very quiet the whole time.
``I am always quiet,'' he says, ``when I know I am going to spend a
very great deal of money.''
</P>
<P>
   At 1:15, Ms. Gordon walks the five blocks from her office to
meet McVeety at 136 E. 56th St. On the way, she explains her
strategy for the McVeetys. ``See, this couple's tough. I'd like to
see them go into a top-notch building. But his wife, Chris, is just
out of law school, so the boards might say: `Yeah, fine, she's
 &UR; going &LR;  to make a lot of money. Come back in a few years.'''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McVeety says: ``We're trying to make up our mind
whether to live in Westchester or the city.'' he says. They are now
living in a Brooklyn sublet. He carefully examines two
1,000-square-foot one-bedroom apartments, both with dining areas.
Both are priced at just under $300,000. ``I would like Chris to
look at both of these,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After her last showing, Ms. Gordon heads back to pick up her
daughters at school and to make some calls from her apartment. It
is 2:30. Her day of showing co-ops is over.
</P>
<P>
   Six hours later, Foreman shows a small $269,000 one-bedroom in
the Schwab House, a postwar building at 11 Riverside Drive.
Afterward, he sinks into a sofa in the lobby and pulls out his cell
phone. One last call, and his day is done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither broker has ended up with a signed contract _ or anything
close to it _ but that's hardly unusual, both say.
</P>
<P>
   Before making a sale, an agent often shows a customer 30 or 40
apartments, Foreman says. ``And sometimes you have dry spells, when
you don't make any money for a very, very long time. I've got an
ex-wife and a kid at boarding school. That's why I do so many
rentals; they're quick. Sometimes you can wrap up a deal in a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Foreman sold one town house and 11 apartments, but he
rented 12 apartments, each with a hefty commission: usually 15
percent of a year's total rent. (With sales, the commission is
normally 6 percent, which gets divided with the agency and with any
other broker involved.) ``It's not an easy living,'' he continues.
``You have to work hard. I came to this job when I was 45, and I've
learned to live with the uncertainty. I like being my own boss.
Some big-time brokers rake in a lot of money.'' He chuckles. ``And
frankly, I aspire to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both agents refuse to say exactly how much they make. They get
no salary; they live on their commissions. Ms. Gordon says she has
to bring in at least $120,000 to keep her desk at the agency.
Foreman makes in the low six figures. ``Emphasize the  &UR; low &LR; ,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon has adopted a devil-may-care attitude. ``Hey, I only
sold five apartments last year,'' she says. ``And when I sold the
fifth, I said: `Whoa! That's it. That's all the money I need for
this year. And I headed off to St. Bart's.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, she says, she already has five apartments that will
close in the next few months. ``And then guess what? It's off to
St. Bart's again!''

NATO'S JOB IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a pattern to the crimes of Serbian strongman Slobodan
Milosevic. By exploiting historical memories of Serbian suffering,
he has stoked animosities against Croats, Bosnian Muslims, and now
Kosovar Albanians. When his aggressions lead to catastrophes for
Serbs and he confronts a countervailing military power, Milosevic
dons the mask of a diplomat to sign cease-fires and peace
agreements. As soon as he believes there is no credible threat of
force to restrain him, he breaks the agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's massacre of Albanian villagers in Kosovo confirms
the Milosevic pattern of bellicose action, diplomatic accords, and
broken pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Unarmed monitors were supposed to preserve the cease-fire
negotiated last fall by Richard Holbrooke, the US special envoy.
But Serb soldiers or special forces and the militiamen of the
Kosovo Liberation Army have been ambushing each other all winter,
leading to the Serb atrocities Friday in the vicinity of a village
called Racak.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran US diplomat William Walker, chief of the 700
monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, witnessed the mutilated bodies in a gully near the village
and called the massacre a crime against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Now Milosevic has expelled Walker, blatantly violating his
agreements with NATO, the OSCE, and the UN Security Council. Even
Milosevic's supporters in Moscow have counseled him to reconsider
and honor his promises of last October.
</P>
<P>
   To revive the cease-fire in Kosovo, NATO must confront Milosevic
with an ultimatum: Stop the carnage or Serb military targets will
be bombed. But the massacre in Racak also demonstrates that the
unarmed OSCE monitors are not able to keep the peace. They ought to
be replaced with a large force of armed NATO troops, a contingent
potent enough to deter both the Kosovo Liberation Army and their
Serb antagonists.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should not, however, make any effort to prescribe the terms
of a political settlement of the conflict. It should stop the
killing and leave it up to the belligerents to negotiate a mutually
acceptable solution.
</P>

acknowledges that the economy is rolling along with few signs of
the slowdown that the Fed had expected. Testifying before the House
Ways and Means Committee, he says those good economic times could
be lulling investors into a trap, as the rebound in share prices
over the last three months has left stocks at levels that ``would
appear to envision substantially greater growth of profits than has
been experienced of late.'' By Richard W. Stevenson.

<P>
   William A. Williams Jr. is a former member of the Mormon Church,
which is known for its detailed collection of genealogical
information, and a former actuary, familiar with small but vital
details about populations. So perhaps it figures that he has become
the Internet's sovereign of citation and ruler of reference, the
man who posted the Concordances of Great Books, an online
searchable index of 86 authors and 200 full texts.
</P>
<P>
   Dickensians as far away as Japan send him kudos for his Web
site, at www.concordance.com. And they are far from the only
intense users of Williams' works. If you care to find out where in
the works of Shakespeare the word incardine appears, want to know
how many times Hamlet or Job cursed their stars or wonder where
exactly Walt Whitman sang the body electric, you can plug in a word
to search his index.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which first appeared on the Web in June 1998, grew out
of an electronic conversation Williams had with a man on the
alt.religion.mormon newsgroup. The man wanted to study the
occurrence of various words in the Bible, the Book of Mormon and
several other texts to see if one of those books had evolved from
others.
</P>
<P>
   It took Williams a few months to teach himself the Perl
programming language and write a program for creating concordances.
(Created primarily for searching religious texts, concordances are
also used for legal depositions and in business.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to process files to create index files, several for
each book,'' Williams said. ``And they kind of reference each other
in such a way that you can pull out the occurrences of words very
quickly, 500 references in a second or two. The biggest job is
getting the text files into a form where you can use it. A lot have
junky stuff in it, like hyphens at the end of lines. That's a big
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the works indexed on his page are no longer under
copyright and were obtained from the Project Gutenberg and Books on
Line electronic libraries. Williams got permission from publishers
to put up some of the Mormon-related texts he offers that are not
yet in the public domain. His Web-site host, Primegen Internet
Labs, is generous with space on its server and charges him about
$500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't do this to make money, but to have something
to do, and hopefully create something to benefit others,'' said
Williams, 61, who is retired and lives with his wife, Ruth, in
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., north of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Williams himself favors English authors, particularly Austen,
Dickens and Shakespeare. Still, his favorite book is ``Les
Miserables,'' by Victor Hugo. Books by all four authors appear on
his site.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the average number of hits per day, the most popular
stops on the site are Mark Twain (about 18 hits), Charles Dickens
(24), Jane Austen (11), the LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints) Research page (13) and the Bible (5). Euripides
has also racked up many visits. Kenneth W. Starr has fared less
well, and Williams is thinking of dropping his report for lack of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The page also provides visitors with links to the North American
Kant Association and the Sherlockian Holmes pages, among other
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Williams' collection, concordance software turns up on an
eclectic variety of Web sites. Bleary-eyed college students can
find both mentions of the word peach in the collected poems of T.S.
Eliot (www.missouri.edu/enggf/tsebase.html).
</P>
<P>
   Recovering alcoholics can search for heartache, hangovers,
holidays and havoc in ``The Big Book,'' published by Alcoholics
Anonymous (www.royy.com/concord.html). Dungeons and Dragons players
can search rule books for spells, magic items and enchantments at
Effie Rover's Fantasy Role Player's Library (www.effierover.com).
</P>
<P>
   All of the ``Wheel of Time'' books, by Robert Jordan, can be
searched by using a Yahoo-style directory of categories
(www.d.umn.edu/knovek/wotc/wotcToC.html).
</P>
<P>
   A concordance of Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman,''
including a list of all the words used in the play, by frequency,
is available at www.konbib.nl/dutchess.ned/18/06/info-0289.html.
And in a surprising nod to technology, the Mennonite hymnal is also
ready to be searched at the click of a mouse, not on line but on
disk. &QL;

A NEGLECTED MASTER'S HAUNTING CONSOLATIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARRY SINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something so improbably consoling about the sadness at
the heart of the best Vernon Duke melodies. This redemptive
afterglow could be a consequence of sheer melodic sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Duke knew how to construct a song, elegantly, with surpassing
craft and harmonic flair. Yet the earned wisdom behind the sadness
in his music transcends flair and craft and goes beyond
sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the songs are even inherently unhappy. ``Autumn in
New York,'' ``April in Paris'' and ``I Can't Get Started'' _ to
name Duke's most identifiable trio _ inhabit an emotional realm
uncommon in the American popular song canon, that of dry-eyed
ballads of unusual poignancy. The melancholy induced by these
songs, while hauntingly seductive, is never glum.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Duke remotely a sad kind of guy. An aristocratic White
Russian emigre turned Broadway songwriter, he seems to have had a
rather good time of it all, dressing with notorious dash and, in a
polyglot of languages, charming chorus girls and theatrical
producers alike. Duke knew everybody, from his dearest friend, the
Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev, to Picasso and Chanel,
Balanchine and Jean Cocteau, and even an antic young serviceman
whom Duke discovered during World War II, Sid Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, alongside his prodigious Broadway output, from the
1920s into the 1960s, Duke enjoyed a parallel career as a classical
composer. Under his given Russian name, Vladimir Dukelsky, he
turned out ballet scores, concertos, sonatas, art-song cycles and
at least three symphonies for the world's most celebrated
orchestras and conductors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he never caught on as a brand-name composer, certainly not
in the sense that Prokofiev did, nor was he even on a par with his
grandest Broadway peers. This misfortune is attributable in part to
Duke's personality _ he could be a difficult collaborator and a
less than ideal promoter of his classical work. Duke was also just
plain unlucky, though he does seem to have chosen projects badly.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, Duke wrote music for grownups. His songs
sang most majestically about ambivalence, not the uplift that Tin
Pan Alley consumers overwhelmingly preferred. His probing melodies
brought out wonderfully melancholic resonances in lyricists who
were by nature, if only on the page, rather jolly _ Ira Gershwin,
Ogden Nash and even Yip Harburg.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, these songs speak perhaps more directly to our own
self-doubts and longings in 1999 than they did in a 1930s culture
that looked to its songwriters for escape.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a small flurry of Duke ventures, both live and
recorded, offers an opportunity to reflect on this neglected yet
somehow essentially contemporary composer who, like his other close
friend George Gershwin, pioneered a ``crossover'' career before the
concept even had a name.
</P>
<P>
   Most illuminating is a just-released album of familiar and
obscure Duke melodies exquisitely sung by the opera singer Dawn
Upshaw. In March, City Center's ``Encores'' concert series will
revive ``The Ziegfeld Follies of 1936'' with its legendary Vernon
Duke-Ira Gershwin score.
</P>
<P>
   The kick-off to the current Duke boomlet, though, came on Jan.
10 with the world premiere of a long-lost Dukelsky piano concerto
performed at Carnegie Hall by the pianist Scott Dunn and the
American Composers Orchestra, led by Dennis Russell Davies.
</P>
<P>
   The piano concerto resurfaces like some kind of Chekhovian
keepsake; the story of its genesis is in fact a microcosm of the
cycle of aspiration and disappointment that defined Duke's life and
career. Duke was born in a Minsk railroad station on Oct. 10, 1903.
He attended the Kiev Conservatory with Vladimir Horowitz, among
others, wrote revolutionary arias (under duress) for the newly
ascendant Communist Party and escaped with his family on the last
ship out of Odessa in 1919 just ahead of the Soviet cavalry.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint playing cocktail piano in Constantinople, Duke
arrived in New York in 1921, hoping to pursue a classical career
but hungry to learn more about American popular music.
</P>
<P>
   Composed at the instigation of the pianist Arthur Rubinstein in
1922, Duke's concerto was, in his words, ``a one-movement,
pianistically grateful, not too cerebral'' piece. Rubinstein, upon
hearing the finished work in New York, suggested that the
20-year-old Dukelsky take his concerto and ``go to Paris,'' where a
premiere would be easier for Rubinstein to mount. Dukelsky took
this suggestion to heart; Rubinstein did not. The concerto was
never performed.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Paris, though, Duke did gain an introduction to Serge
Diaghilev, the exalted Russian ballet impresario. Diaghilev
listened to Duke's concerto and promptly commissioned a new ballet
score from him. Dukelsky, the classical composer, was in business.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Duke, the Broadway songwriter, also found success after
he returned to New York in 1929, but in sporadic bursts. Even his
biggest Broadway hits were inconclusively received at first.
``April in Paris,'' written with Harburg for a 1932 revue called
``Walk a Little Faster,'' bombed so badly initially that Harburg
harangued his collaborator in a Times Square restaurant, raging
that Duke's melody for the song was only ``all right for decadent
Europeans.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn in New York,'' composed on a whim by Duke in 1934 (both
the music and the stunning, pensive words) as a ``pendant to `April
in Paris,''' was interpolated later that year into a flop revue
titled ``Thumbs Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even Duke's peerless ``I Can't Get Started,'' an old
unused ``trunk tune'' refurbished with an ideal Ira Gershwin lyric
for the 1936 ``Follies,'' was dismissed by Duke himself as just one
component of ``a dead score,'' until the jazz trumpeter Bunny
Berrigan put ``I Can't Get Started'' on the Hit Parade to stay.
</P>
<P>
   On her album ``Dawn Upshaw Sings Vernon Duke'' (Nonesuch), Ms.
Upshaw restores to ``April in Paris'' and ``Autumn in New York''
their sly original verses, each an understated contrast to the
heights of rapture and depths of ennui that the songs present. In
fact, Ms. Upshaw may be Duke's ideal interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   The only opera diva on the scene today with a classic pop
singer's gift for phrasing and a torch singer's emotional
fearlessness, she possesses the craftsmanship and the soul to take
on the full range of Duke's songwriting talent. His bittersweet
chromaticism, unexpected key modulations and dense harmonies are
all sung with a crystalline simplicity that eloquently illuminates
Duke's darker side.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome as they are, these Duke standards are not the true stars
of Ms. Upshaw's album, however. Far more revelatory are the obscure
and even unpublished Duke songs that she and her producer, Tommy
Krasker, have unearthed. It is a sad fact of Duke's career that
following his greatest Broadway success, the joyous score he
composed for ``Cabin in the Sky'' in 1940 _ including the ineffable
``Taking a Chance on Love'' _ Duke suffered a string of failures:
more than seven book musicals and revues that throughout the 1940s,
50s and 60s died every possible critical and commercial death.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Upshaw proves that the caliber of music that Duke
bestowed on these flops was not only astonishingly high but also
preternaturally progressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love I Long For,'' a ballad of conflicted Sondheim-like
anguish, written with Howard Dietz for a forgotten 1944 musical
version of ``Sadie Thompson''; ``Round About,'' a lush meditation
on life's bittersweet circularity, created with Ogden Nash for the
equally forgotten 1946 musical ``Sweet Bye and Bye'' _ these are
just two of 10 lesser-known Duke songs that Ms. Upshaw resurrects.
</P>
<P>
   She is aided by an array of stellar orchestrators and the
pianists Fred Hersch, Eric Stern and Richard Rodney Bennett. The
album concludes with ``Ages Ago,'' a wistful little gem composed
for a 1957 Broadway production of Jean Anouilh's ``Time
Remembered'' _ words and music by Vernon Duke, for whom, it is
worth remembering, English was at best a third language, after
Russian and French. The song includes these lines:
</P>
<P>
   When evening comes, I live in the past, &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our past as I can see it, &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Was much too full, too lovely to last, &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so be it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, according to his widow, Kay Ingalls, Duke conceded
that he had perhaps endured some bad luck but said he had refused
to surrender to it. He continued, until his death from cancer in
1969 at the age of 65, to write constantly: a terrific memoir
(``Passport to Paris''), poetry (four published volumes in
Russian), letters (a particular passion), classical music pieces
and, of course, American popular songs.
</P>
<P>
   It had been George Gershwin who, back in 1924, Americanized the
name Vladimir Dukelsky, coining the moniker Vernon Duke. ``Don't be
scared about going low brow,'' Gershwin insisted then. ``It will
open you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is the quality of consolation we perceive in Duke's
haunted music: the sound of a rigorously trained Russian composer
allowing himself to open up, American style, his world weariness
undermined, though never overpowered, by optimism. If so, there is
in that nothing really sad at all.

CLINTONIAN CONTRADICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are contradictory times. The president of the United
States is disgraced, impeached, and his trial is underway. One
might have expected a national gloom, but there is none. President
Clinton stood before Congress and the nation Tuesday night in a
time of unparalleled prosperity and well-being with an address that
boosted his already high approval ratings even higher. The union
has seldom been in a better state.
</P>
<P>
   There is the usual carping from the right that Clinton is trying
to insert big government into places it doesn't belong and from the
left that he isn't pushing government intervention enough. But the
American people are satisfied with his performance, and just as his
lack of discipline and avoidance of the truth got him into this
mess, so have his political instincts and his capture of the
political center saved him time and again. He has successfully
poached many of the issues the Republicans considered their own,
and he is the only Democratic president in this century not to face
a challenge from a candidate on the left.
</P>
<P>
   His big themes _ the economy, Social Security, education, and
health care _ are all safe, poll-tested products put forth by this
most poll-conscious president in history. But that doesn't mean his
positions are wrong or that these issues are not worthy of the
nation's attention. Far from it. When all else is going so well,
these are areas in which things might go wrong if left unattended.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the president's men began three days of defense of
Clinton's outrageous untruths. Yet there is little indication that
the public is riveted by these proceedings. The press does its duty
by reporting them, as it must. But to most Americans, it is as if
the goings-on in Washington really don't matter _ and in a sense,
they matter less than they have in 70 years. From the stock market
crash of 1929 to the coming down of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the
United States was in a continual state of crisis. The Great
Depression, World War II, and the Cold War followed closely on one
another, and Americans looked to Washington for the answers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, by almost every yardstick, the nation's health is good.
Employment is high; inflation is low. The American economy has
emerged much stronger from a painful period of readjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Crime statistics are down, real wages and the stock market are
up. So far, the United States has avoided the economic storms that
have battered so much of the rest of the world, and instead of
megatyrants such as Hitler and Stalin, Americans now face
mini-tyrants such as Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic, who are
dangerous and need watching but are not comparable to the foes of
yore.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Americans no longer look to Washington as they did
before. We are in an era where the unbridled forces of market
globalization can sweep smaller governments aside, and Fed chairman
Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin arguably have
more say over the well-being of Americans than the president.
Clinton, with no great domestic or foreign crisis, has contracted
government's role in ways that were both realistic and necessary.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that there are not still problems. As Senator
Edward M. Kennedy said Monday, civil rights remain the nation's
unfinished business. This doesn't mean that dangers and hard times
won't come again, and when they do, Americans will look toward
Washington again for answers. But for these blessed years _ may
they last _ the role of Washington and the presidency is not as
central to the lives of citizens as in the dangerous years. The
greatest contradiction is that President Clinton, with so much to
offer, should have brought down such discredit on the office he
holds.

BELLS AND WHISTLES FOR THE `HEALTHY HOME' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ill, Mich.)  (js) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ If your home is like mine, it is an imperfect thing,
resistant to most efforts to make it a sanctuary, even a little
tyrannical in its dogged inconveniences. The bookcase shelf isn't
quite within arm's reach of the desk chair, the toaster won't
release an imperfectly sliced bagel, the bathroom vent mysteriously
funnels in rap music from some other apartment in the building. (I
assume it's in the building.)
</P>
<P>
   It was with this in mind that I visited the International
Housewares Show at the McCormick Center here last week, where one
of the themes, according to the National Housewares Manufacturers
Association, which sponsors the show, was the ``healthy home.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, apparently, are becoming more concerned with the
dangers inherent in the world at large _ ``They're hearing a lot
about things like stress, carbon monoxide, E. coli, tainted meat,''
said Lisa Casey Weiss, a ``lifestyle consultant'' for the
association _ and therefore are eager to create a safe haven in the
living room and the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The show, from Jan. 10 through 13, was huge _ more than 2,000
exhibitors, vast tracts of floor space taken up with the
awe-inspiring evidence of enterprise and ingenuity _ and it wasn't
hard to find the theme illustrated. There were a lot of new
products designed to make the house and its accouterments not just
nicer for you, but nicer to you.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to note that the Europeans, no matter how
celebrated for expensive facial cleansers and $800 Miele vacuum
cleaners, are amused by the American obsession with cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
   As Suellen Hoy points out in her book ``Chasing Dirt: The
American Pursuit of Cleanliness'' (Oxford University Press, 1995),
the ideal of cleanliness in this country has shifted from
preventing disease to becoming a way of being irredeemably
American. If the products at the International Housewares Show
reach the masses, homemakers will soon fight disease (or at least
allergies and asthma) by attacking dust mites and will take
temperatures without being invasive. But they will also find ways
to make the house odor free (not just for cleanliness, but for the
appearance of cleanliness) and to cook pizzas in microwaves without
reading the instructions.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Philips, for example, is introducing a battery-operated
thermometer (about $80) that is just wiped across the forehead. The
marketing angle is that you can check sleeping infants without
waking them. ``It's as accurate as a rectal reading,'' Lori
Intetssano, a company representative, explained brightly.
</P>
<P>
   Adobeair, a maker of electric heaters, was promoting
``safe-sense technology'' with a portable heater ($149) that sets
off warning lights and beepers if anyone gets within three feet and
shuts off entirely if the invader gets to within a foot.
</P>
<P>
   From my walk around the convention, I learned that our homes are
not as safe as we thought. Why else would Bissell, a company famous
for carpet cleaners, let conventioneers know, in a large display,
that ``95 percent of American households are infested with dust
mites''? Fortunately, Bissell's new allergen removal formula, used
with its new line of upright steam carpet cleaners, ($229 to $299,
available this spring) addresses the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Eureka has a way of fighting not only dust mites but E. coli and
salmonella _ in this case on bare floors _ with the Enviro Steam
Cleaner, a sanitizing $99.99 mop replacement. Evidently, the
companies that make floor cleaners and vacuums (``dirt suckers'' in
industry parlance) feel it's good to know as much as possible about
the filth in our homes. Most new bagless vacuums, for instance,
feature dirt collectors made of clear plastic. ``The consumer has
the perception she's cleaning better because she can see the dirt
right in front of her,'' said Bruce Gold, executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   These days, vacuum manufacturers boast features like ``cyclonic
action'' to separate what the vacuum sweeps up into smaller and
larger particles (I'm not sure why), and ``Hepa filters'' and
``true Hepa filters'' that scrub the vacuum's exhaust before
shooting it back into the room. Hepa, a current industry buzz
acronym, stands for ``high-efficiency particulate air.'' ``True''
Hepa filters, according to the Eureka Co., which has several
machines featuring them, are the most hard-working, removing
``99.97 percent of all particles from the air, down to three-tenths
of a micron.''
</P>
<P>
   Air purifiers employ Hepa technology, too. Once a medical
product, air purifiers are now so in demand for the odor- and
grit-sensitive among us that they are marketed by shape. One has a
flattened side so the machine sits unobtrusively against a wall.
Decorative.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the most striking example of niche marketing was in the
air-clearing category; a man named Daniel Antepenko, president of
Classic Tool, of Spruce Pine, Ala. _ an aptly named home for an air
purification business _ was there promoting a single product, an
exhaust system that hooks up to your toilet. Vac-A-Way, it's
called, ``a revolutionary new way to remove commode odors'' ($120,
plus shipping).
</P>
<P>
   After a while I began to feel lucky to be out of the house,
where so many unseen threats apparently lurk. So I began searching
for new ways to make myself more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Ease at home _ that's the ticket. Samsung, the electronics
company, is behind the Imwo _ the intelligent microwave oven _ a
product with a built-in computer and data base, developed by
Rutgers University scientists, that relieves the burden of having
to read the instructions on the back of microwavable food packages.
The Imwo reads the bar code on the frozen pizza box, taps into its
data base and cooks the pizza according to the maker's own
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Wine with that pizza? Never good with a corkscrew? Try the
Winemaster, a foolproof device from Vacuvin, a Dutch company, which
sells for $65. It snaps down over a bottleneck and with a couple of
deft tugs on its various levers, bingo! With its 49 moving parts
it's a little heavy and overdesigned (and kind of
sinister-looking), but if your aim is wine and not esthetic ritual,
it's perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers are clearly hip to the urge for immediate
gratification. Microwavable socks (from New Product International)?
A toilet night light (from Prestige Line)?
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago we showed our blood-pressure products here,'' said
Harvey S. Cohen, vice president of Lumiscope, a 75-year-old medical
appliance company in Edison, N.J., that has expanded into massage
therapy implements. In the last five years, he said, the company's
line of vibrating wands and slippers and such has expanded to 20
percent of its sales.
</P>
<P>
   Conair, known for hair dryers, has also been exploring the
self-indulgence market. Its new products include foot massagers, an
aromatherapy lamp and a Water Jet Bath Spa that drapes over the rim
of the tub and rhythmically churns the bath water _ instant
mini-Jacuzzi ($59.99 to $69.99, depending on the retailer).
</P>
<P>
   Another obvious trend is home massage without the masseuse. I
tried portable back massagers and platforms with vibrating balls
for the feet. I wore a mask that made the bridge of my nose
vibrate. I sat in several elegant chairs (up to $3,000) that I
swear had hard-knuckled midgets living inside them. I ended up
quite loose, even a little jiggly.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite device, though, was the Back Maestro, a product
developed by Homedics, of Keego Harbor, Mich. The Back Maestro
($99.99) is a cushion that drapes over an office chair or a car
seat and, with a hand control, allows you to prescribe where on
your body, and in what rhythm, you wish to be pummeled. Here's the
amazing (or ridiculous) thing: If plugged into the stereo, the
cushion will respond to the music, massaging to the beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really smart,'' said Paulette Abraham, the company's
director of marketing. Oh? Could I hook it up to my bathroom vent
and put that mysterious rap music to good use?
</P>

WANTED: F.O.B.'S (FRIENDS OF BARBIE)  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been many years since I felt even the slightest envy for
my cousin Mary Ann's collection of Barbies.
</P>
<P>
   I can barely remember how her white doll case smelled of new
plastic. Or how its cunning little gold clasp opened so smoothly to
reveal dozens of matching outfits and hats and shoes, all lined up
by color on hangers and in tiny cardboard drawers. Or how the Midge
doll was held snugly in place by an elastic strap. Or how _ if
anyone had bothered to ask _ I would have recommended against
dressing Skipper in the culottes combination with the flowered
headband.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one asked me. I was six years younger than my
cousin so I did not join her and the Hinchey girl from next door
when they played with the dolls. Could this have been the root of
the aching suspicion that my own Barbie was inferior because she
did not possess such essential accessories as a head scarf and
cat's-eye sunglasses? If so, I got over that, too. Years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what I told everyone until the other day in the
car, when my 7-year-old daughter, Ella, piped up from the back
seat. ``I saw on TV that on the Internet you can make a custard
Barbie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customized, Ella,'' corrected Zoe, her older sister. ``There
was this commercial about how you can make a doll who is a friend
of Barbie. You pick how she looks. They mail her to you.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounded like an expensive proposition, I muttered from the
front seat. But inside, I was thinking: Yesssss. How many times had
I stood in front of Barbie displays, frustrated because none of the
zillions of available dolls were adequate substitutes for my
cousin's? But now I had hope.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's not fashionable in these days of rampant
Barbie-bashing to admit a fondness for a doll who once declared
that she preferred shopping to math. As a mother of three
daughters, I might be expected to frown on a toy whose original
theme song included the lyrics, ``Barbie's small and so petite/Her
clothes and figure look so neat. . . . Someday I'm going to be
exactly like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at my own childhood, I can't say that exposure to
Barbie harmed me. Perhaps it even toughened me. After devouring
such old-fashioned books as ``Cheaper by the Dozen,'' ``Life With
Father'' and ``All-of-a-Kind Family,'' I was familiar with the
concept of outdated sex-role stereotypes at a very young age. I did
not want Barbie's life style. I just needed her as a prop in
elaborate make-believe plots that involved her and Midge not
inviting my cousin along when they went to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, my daughters and I gathered expectantly at my
computer.
</P>
<P>
   A blond Barbie in a tight miniskirt appeared on the opening
screen of www.barbie.com. Clearly, we had come to the right place.
Clicking on My Design revealed the details of the customized
Barbies. Drawbacks: Each doll costs $39.95 _ plus $7.95 for
shipping _ and might not arrive for up to eight weeks. Benefits:
You are able to name your own doll, then click to choose the color
of her eyes, skin and hair, facial features, clothes, accessories
and such sexually nonspecific interests as ``community work,''
``geology'' or ``running a company.''
</P>
<P>
   At each step, the site helpfully displayed the doll in progress.
So if you made a ghastly mistake by, say, pairing the ``pulled back
and pretty'' hairstyle with the ``open mouth smile,'' it was easy
to fix with a few quick clicks.
</P>
<P>
   For Ella, the exercise turned out to be a kind of online
Rorschach test. She created a Barbie who reflected her own
personality, a doll who ``lives in the suburbs,'' ``is interested
in books'' and ``loves to play the piano.'' Ella's most agonizing
decision was choosing a hairstyle resembling her own. Since ``bangs
in the eyes and a crooked part'' was not an option, she settled for
``long and wavy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Zoe? As usual, my oldest child tried to balance her own
interests with mine. Her doll ``spends a lot of time at the beach''
but also ``loves to surf the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Did I order the dolls for them? Why even ask? The bigger
question for a Barbie addict like myself was, Why didn't I create
my own custard doll, the one I had yearned for since childhood: a
Midge with messed-up hair and a line of blue ink on her cheek?
</P>
<P>
   I would not have hesitated but my expectations had been too
high. At least that's what Lisa McKendall, Mattel's director of
marketing communications, told me when I phoned to complain that
the customization options were too limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midge got married and disappeared _ she hasn't been in the
line since the 1960s,'' Ms. McKendall explained.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. McKendall said she understood my quest. ``One time I met
a woman in New York who had this little Barbie sweater,'' she said.
``Her neighbor made it for her 35 years ago, and she felt compelled
to bring it to a meeting to show me. So sometimes it's not about
the doll so much as it is about the relationships that people had
with her.''
</P>
<P>
   My daughters will pester our mail carrier daily for the next
eight weeks. But I am patient. In my heart I believe www.barbie.com
will someday offer a Skipper in culottes.

   The more things change, the more they drive us insane. At least
that's the way it seems in computer technology, where products have
the life spans of insects.
</P>
<P>
   The frantic pace of innovation in the computer industry is a
mixed blessing. On one hand, we benefit from a torrent of newer,
faster, better and cheaper products, creating value for the
consumer at a speed unmatched in any other industry in history.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, rapid advances in technology condemn us to a
treadmill of rapid obsolescence. It is frustrating to buy version
1.0 of something, knowing that version 1.1 is already in
development and that version 2.0 is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   But more vexing are the phantom upgrades that we often don't
know about, midcourse corrections and improvements that are not
widely publicized by either the manufacturers or the dealers.
Sometimes the changes are subtle, while others are significant.
</P>
<P>
   The harm comes when consumers think they are buying the newest
technology, only to discover later that they purchased yesterday's
product. It is as if you went shopping for a butterfly and wound up
with a caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, for example, the Intel Corp. introduced the Celeron
processor as a low-cost alternative to the Pentium II chip. The
Celeron was basically a Pentium II chip stripped of a high-speed
memory subsystem called Level 2, or L2, cache. Without the cache,
the enervated Celeron chip was such a dog that many major PC makers
refused to build systems around it.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Intel introduced a significantly improved Celeron
with 128 kilobytes of L2 cache. It called the new chip the
300A-megahertz Celeron, to distinguish it from the 300-MHz Celeron
chip with fleas.
</P>
<P>
   The result, however, is that Intel now offers two different
300-MHz Celeron processors. Unless the shopper is up to speed or
has a knowledgeable salesperson to help point out the right one,
there is a risk of going home with one of the original bow-wow
Celerons.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Intel's newer and faster Celerons all have the L2
cache, and all offer impressive performance for the price. Just be
aware that the 266-MHz and non-A 300- MHz chips are caterpillars.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months after it introduced the iMac computer last
summer at $1,299, Apple Computer made it better. For the same
price, Apple added a better graphics card and more video memory,
and made some other minor improvements.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid hurting sales of the original iMacs that were already
in retail stores or the distribution pipeline, neither Apple nor
the stores publicized the fact that newer and better iMacs were
available at the same price as the old ones. The only clue was a
model number that ended in B instead of A.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling how many unsuspecting customers bought the
box containing the old A model when the revision B model could have
been sitting on the shelf right next to it or being held in the
back room until the A models were sold out.
</P>
<P>
   The transition was not prolonged because the iMacs sold so
quickly, although that is little comfort to people who bought the A
iMac when the B was already in the stores. Apple has since
introduced a new and further improved generation of iMacs and cut
the price on the older ones.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft released the Windows 98 operating system upgrade on
June 25 last year and within a week announced that a ``multimedia
enhancement'' was in the works. The upgrade to the upgrade, which
Microsoft insisted was not a bug fix, was made available in August
to customers who knew enough to check Microsoft's Web site
periodically.
</P>
<P>
   But six months after the ``enhancement'' was offered on line,
customers who buy the Windows 98 upgrade package at retail stores
are getting the same original and presumably unenhanced program
that Microsoft shipped back in June.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Microsoft includes a clever Windows Update link
under the Windows 98 Start button that automatically scans the
user's computer to determine whether there are any updates
available on line that might be helpful. The user then has the
option of downloading the latest enhancements and bug fixes.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Symantec Corp. released a new version of its
popular Norton Systemworks utility package for Windows computers
(reviewed favorably in this space on Dec. 31). The new version
added a fifth utility to the package, an excellent program called
Cleansweep.
</P>
<P>
   The company called the new version 1.1 and labeled the disks
1.1, and the installation screen identified the software as 1.1,
all signaling that it was an update of the original, four-utility
version 1.0.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sarah Hicks, a Symantec group manager, the unusual
decision was made to call the upgraded product 1.0 because
relabeling it 1.1 might have caused dealers to pull the old
versions off the shelf. Symantec might have lost sales of the older
version, and, Ms. Hicks said, there was also a risk that harried
dealers might be too busy during the hectic holiday shopping season
to restock with a new version.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So the new version was stacked alongside the old version, and
the only difference on the box is that the new 1.0 has an added
line on the front listing five utility programs instead of four. On
the back, there is a paragraph of information about Cleansweep. The
price stayed the same. Only those customers who knew details of the
new release got the better version.
</P>
<P>
   Symantec now says that people who bought the older version can
return it for a full refund within 60 days of purchase or, if they
bought it before Nov. 30, upgrade to the new version for $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   Angry yet? Ready to quit going to computer dealers and to start
shopping on line? Not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   PC Connection (www.pcconnection.com) is still promoting the
older version of Systemworks 1.0 for the original list price of
$69.95, with no mention that it is the discontinued and inferior
version. The promotional material on the PC Connections Web site
describes the older version.
</P>
<P>
   The new version (which Symantec has now decided to call Norton
Systemworks 1.0 With Cleansweep despite the 1.1 label on the disk)
is not offered. But a spokeswoman for PC Connection said that if
Symantec was sending the new version, that is what people would
get.
</P>
<P>
   Another major online software dealer, PC Mall (www.pcmall.com),
was featuring a picture of the old Systemworks box on its front
screen this week as a ``Web-only special for a limited time only!''
The cost was $58.99, ``plus, take an extra $10 off with mfr mail-in
rebate!'' the advertising copy read. ``Norton Systemworks gives you
the current version of four powerful Symantec utilities in one
convenient box.'' But the version shipping since Nov. 30 has five
utilities, not four.
</P>
<P>
   The problem goes beyond these few products, of course. Even if
you did not buy an A-series iMac, a non-A-series Celeron 300 or
Norton Systemworks 1.0 without Cleansweep, the increasing disdain
for consumers is cause for concern. Shopping for computers and
software is hard enough these days without such cavalier treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Stores often stock thousands of products, and it is virtually
impossible to keep track of all product upgrades. Sometimes the
dealers are not told about the changes. Sometimes they are, but the
stores are too busy to swap out the older products or to pass the
word to all the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour Merrin, a consultant in Santa Fe, N.M., who publishes a
newsletter on trends in computer retail, notes unhappily that big
computer stores are cutting staff and eliminating staff training
programs as competition and price pressure increase.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Harrington, editor of Computer Retail Week, says that
ultimately consumers bear the burden of thoroughly researching the
products they are buying, whether they are shopping for computers
or any other type of electronics.
</P>
<P>
   For those who lack time to do so, he advises them to seek
reputable dealers and bond with any clever and trustworthy
salespeople they encounter. Another tip, he said, is to wait six
months before buying any newly released product, to give the
companies (and less patient consumers) a chance to find and fix
early glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers appreciate the chance to buy older products,
either because stores cut the prices of trailing-edge products to
the point they are great bargains or because they own older
computers than cannot meet the newer software requirements. But if
the stores do not cut the prices, and do not tell the buyers that
the products are not current, well, that bugs me.

TAKING SOME OF THE FUN OUT OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Product notes are at the end of article.) 
(js) 
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life was much simpler 40 years ago, when all you had to do was
spin the wheel, drive down the road, get a job, get hitched, buy a
house, take out an insurance policy, have a couple of kids, maybe
play the stock market and retire with as much money as possible.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Game of Life, first published by Milton Bradley in
1960. Times change. So do board games. Life is more complicated
now. It's a CD-ROM published by Hasbro Interactive (Milton Bradley
was bought by Hasbro midway into President Ronald Reagan's first
term). The new game is stored on a flat piece of plastic rather
than a flat piece of cardboard. These days, Life is played in front
of a computer monitor instead of around a table.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spinning a wheel, you click on an icon marked
Spinner. And instead of pushing a miniature car, you watch a
computer-generated convertible cruise through a theme-park
landscape filled with animated landmarks _ it looks like a
miniature golf course. The car radio shifts from doo-wop to
psychedelic pop, rock, disco, new wave and techno as you drive
through the decades between 1950 and 2010, past the giant drive-in,
the towering coffee cup, the monumental mortarboard, the church,
numerous vacation resorts and onward to senescence.
</P>
<P>
   The object remains: whoever retires with the most money wins.
But the means to that end have altered considerably. In the old
game, there were five careers for someone with a bachelor's degree:
doctor ($20,000 per year), lawyer ($15,000), journalist ($10,000),
teacher ($8,000) and physicist ($10,000). Or you could skip college
(meet future spouse, pay $500 for diamond ring, take a
correspondence course, pay $500) and start working for $5,000 a
year. Whatever it was, you were going to do it for the rest of your
life, then retire to Millionaire Estates or, barring that, to a
cottage in Countryside Acres.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to 1999. The job options have expanded
considerably. You can be a doctor or a teacher. But you can also be
a travel agent, a salesperson, an athlete, an artist or a superstar
(an official job designation _ blame People magazine). Not only
that, but your salary bears no relationship to the amount of
training your job requires. Your salary comes up on a slot machine.
You could be a $30,000-a-year doctor or a $100,000-a-year athlete,
or vice versa. There are also the Lose Your Job and Mid-Life Crisis
squares to contend with _ if you land on them, you switch careers
and change salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But financial success requires more than just cruising past Pay
Day. It also depends on how often other players land on your Career
Spaces. (Have Tattoos Removed, Pay Doctor $100,000.) ``Whether
anyone lands on your Career Spaces is pure luck,'' the manual
informs us, ``so choose any career you like!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, work is not the only way to accumulate the mountain
of cash that defines success in Life. There's also luck. But
notions of luck have changed a lot since Kennedy-era kids played
Life on rainy afternoons. In 1960, luck had a lot to do with
gambling. Lucky Day squares told you that it had been a good day at
the races or that you'd had a great weekend in Vegas. And there
were lots of chances to risk what you had. Keep the $10,000 or go
for $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those risks have been removed from the new version,
which is much more wholesome. The gambling references have gone the
way of the three-martini lunch. Instead, good luck consists of Life
Tile spaces where you are allowed to do a good deed. Learn sign
language. Support the Special Olympics. As an outward sign of
inward grace, all these activities involve a large cash payoff.
Help the homeless; earn a five-figure bonus. It looks like a
utopian dream world next to the 1960 version of Life, where every
social commitment had a cost. (``Give to charity, pay $5,000.'')
There were lots of burdensome family obligations: ``Father-in-law
needs money, pay $10,000.'' You forked over the cash. These
trade-offs were built into the game, and the object was to retire
as a millionaire despite them. You spent $500 to bail your uncle
out of jail. You didn't earn $25,000 for fishing with your kid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The CD-ROM's goody-goody stance is somewhat hypocritical,
however. The disk runs on a home PC, which occupies the least
social space in any house. To play, you literally have to turn your
back on your family, although you can play it on the Internet,
sending chat messages back and forth to strangers.
</P>
<P>
   And for all its digital enhancements, Life on CD-ROM is actually
less interactive than its cardboard counterpart (from any era). In
a game that lasted more than an hour, my participation took 2
minutes and 11 seconds. If you're playing against the computer,
this game is pretty pointless and text messages on the Net are a
poor substitute for actual social interaction.
</P>
<P>
   The real fun in Life, or in any board game, is what happens
among the players between turns. It's not just what they say. It's
the faces they make, the laughter, the moments of spontaneous
cruelty. All of that is possible because of the space a board
creates. The game board defines a circle, a circumference of people
facing one another. The whole point of the game is to sustain that
sense of inclusion. That's why the rules of most board games are so
simple. Concentrating too hard on the rules would rob players of
the fun _ the interpersonal shenanigans that occur two feet above
the board. Those are the real games. The cardboard and plastic is
just an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Digital versions of cardboard games often miss the mark because
they don't create the right kind of space. Board game players face
in. Computer game players face out. When you sit in front of a
monitor, you're facing out, and the vista is a synthetic world
waiting to be explored. Even if it's a networked world and lots of
people are playing, the individuals are all facing out. They just
happen to be facing out toward the same thing. They're separate,
but looking in the same direction. They're linked, but they're not
connected.
</P>
<P>
   Circa 1999, that's Life.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you're ever stopped in your own car for speeding
or making an illegal U-turn, chances are the police officer pulling
you over will know your name before even getting out of the patrol
car.
</P>
<P>
   No, the officer is not a member of a psychic cops network. While
trailing you, however, the officer types your license plate number
into a small computer to find out about your vehicle. Such
computers, called mobile data terminals, sit between the driver's
seat and the front passenger seat in the 2,000 marked police patrol
cars in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile data terminals, or MDTs, will also be used by New York
police for other purposes, like speeding response times to 911
calls. Currently, if you dial 911 in New York City to report an
assault taking place outside your window, the 911 operator who
takes your call will enter the location, and any other information
you give, into a computer-aided dispatch, or Cad, system. Within
seconds, a 911 dispatcher in the same building, in downtown
Brooklyn, retrieves this information from the Cad system and reads
it over a two-way radio to a police squad car, directing the car to
the site of the incident. Depending on various factors, this
process can take seconds or minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is for the 911 operator receiving an emergency call to
type the information directly into the MDT system, which should
shorten the response time. Moving to a digital dispatch system will
get more information out to more officers faster, said Lt. Ted
Dempsey of the Office of Technology and Systems Development at the
New York City Police Department. It will also clear the congested
radio bands used by dispatchers for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be a need for radio communication,'' Dempsey
said. ``But we're hoping to take the bulk of our communication
online through the MDTs within a couple of years. By then, the
system will be used by officers to get the details of the job, to
acknowledge they've received the job and to let the dispatcher know
they've arrived on the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   An MDT lets a patrol officer have access to vehicle and driver
information without going through a dispatcher. ``It used to be
that to find anything out about motor vehicles, driver's license
records or normal car stop stuff,'' said Sgt. Joseph Grogan of the
18th Precinct in Manhattan (Midtown North), ``we would have to ask
a dispatcher, who was busy as an octopus just handing out workloads
to cars, to stop and run a separate license or plate check, while
life out there was flying by. Now we can run checks in our cars by
ourselves, and it takes just a few seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey said that long-range plans called for expanding the kind
of information available to officers using MDTs from the New York
State Police Information Network. ``If there's an incident in a
school after hours, for example, the patrol car will be able to
pull up the building hours of operation, the name of the
superintendent on duty, as well as a record of any other incidents
in the neighborhood around that time,'' Dempsey said. ``This is
information that the radio dispatcher doesn't have the time to look
up.''
</P>
<P>
   MDTs also help officers keep what they know quiet. ``If you
radio in a guy's name while your partner's got him against the wall
and the dispatcher radios back a message that he's wanted, the guy
will be able to hear all the information you've just received and
try harder to make a break on you,'' said Officer Randy Gaines.
``But when you do a name check via an MDT and get the information
sent back digitally, you're not giving the guy a clue about what
you know.''
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, the Police Department is talking with a number
of handheld-computer manufacturers about supplying officers on foot
with portable MDTs. Efforts to this end have been hampered,
however, by the fact that most handheld computer devices
communicate within a cellular frequency hundreds of megahertz above
the UHF bandwidths used by New York police.
</P>
<P>
   The MDTs in patrol cars also allow officers to communicate with
one another. In an environment that resembles an online chat room,
the MDT network lets an officer broadcast instant messages to other
officers in the division and respond to questions like the location
of the ASPCA or the correct procedure for a parking summons during
a parade.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey said there was a strict policy against unauthorized
personal messages, although the occasional Yankee score or lunch
plan slipped through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from the late 1970s, when the first MDTs were
installed in several patrol cars in Atlantic City. (The first MDTs
were installed in New York City in 1986.) John McFadden, vice
president for sales in Motorola's wireless data division, which
supplies New York police with MDTs, said it had taken a few years
for officers to get used to using the computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, they complained that they weren't
secretaries and that they didn't want to learn how to type,''
McFadden said. ``It took them a while to see the value in it.''

<P>
   Moving from muscle power to brain power is never easy. That's
the task that faces Michael Jordan, now that he has decided to
leave behind burning glycogen in favor of generating marketing
electricity. He's changing from shorts to a three-piece suit. A
Nike advertisement from last year shows him as a chief executive,
wearing a suit and sitting at a desk. And he's already on the board
of another company: Oakley, best known for its sunglasses.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the products he endorses for Oakley, and whose marketing
he has helped plan, is the $1,500 Time Bomb watch, which also
converts mechanical energy to electricity. Using a tiny flywheel,
the Time Bomb employs the wearer's natural movement to generate
electricity. The power is stored in a lithium capacitor so it never
needs a new battery. Self-winding mechanical watches have long been
around, but they stopped when at rest. By linking mechanical and
electronic, the Time Bomb can sit up to two weeks on a dresser
without stopping.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But $1,500? A gold watch, sure, a jeweled watch, but who would
buy a $1,500 watch like the Time Bomb? How many watches and the
batteries to run them could you buy for the same money? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You have your Cartiers and your Rados and your Rolexes,'' said
Colin Baden, Oakley's head designer, ``but there's a whole new
consumer group becoming affluent. They don't know what Rolex is,
but they sure know Oakley.'' The demographic group described
sounded as ifit consisted chiefly of early-round NBA draft choices.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Time Bomb's name has already resulted in Oakley getting
calls from nervous postal inspectors; its style is no more
reticent. The effect is a combination of Rube Goldberg and H.R.
Geiger, designer of sets for films like ``Alien,'' with a dose of
Groucho Marx's Professor Flywheel thrown in. It could be a prop
from some cartoony sci-fi movie like ``Space Jam,'' say, starring
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It's a blobby chunk of a metal the company calls X metal, a
light titanium alloy used in its frames for sunglasses. Hard metal,
hard edge _ the Time Bomb takes the shape of the Oakley ``O'' logo
and turns it into what looks like some obscure part from Jordan's
Ferrari.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The esthetic, Baden said, is ``mechanical sculpture,'' and the
company's design is called Splayed Logically Offset Geometry: SLOG
is the acronym used at Oakley. On the back of the watch is a little
glass window through which you can see its mechanism _ a glimpse
into its mystery, a courtside seat on its performance. What you see
are tiny flywheels and springs, escapements and gears, that might
seem quaint and old-fashioned in the electronic era of chips and
liquid crystals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's about showing off, of course, which is not always bad.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unlike what Jordan has done all his career: turn a
physical game into a high theatrical event.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So the Time Bomb is a warning: get ready for Michael Jordan,
designer and marketing executive. Jordan not only appears at
publicity events wearing the Time Bomb, but also is involved in the
design and marketing of it and other Oakley products, notably a
line of sunglasses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He has an innate sense of style that is very valuable to this
company,'' Baden said. ``He's an active participant in our design
department. He helps in development and hangs out in the studio.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to be skeptical of these claims, but at Nike, Jordan
has long had an active part in designing shoes and other items. The
Air Jordan line has prospered, while sales of other Nike products
have lagged.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jordan left the game, he said, because there were ``no mental
challenges left.'' But he is not so much retiring as narrowing his
focus, addressing what the business schools call his core
competence: stardom. Jordan made just $33 million a year for
playing basketball, versus $40 million for his endorsements. Like
the writer who enjoys everything about his trade except the
paperwork, he's set to enjoy all the benefits of athletic stardom
without the sweat. My 9-year-old approves. Now, he says, Jordan
will have more time to make movies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And he will have time to help design products like the Time
Bomb. But flashiness that works on the court is not necessarily
what works on the street or in the office. Converting Jordan style
into products has its limits. Being like Mike is fine up to a
point, but most of us would no more try to carry off watches and
glasses that look fine on Jordan than try to dunk from the paint.
Who said man was meant to fly, much less flywheel?

FILES LOST? PERHAPS NOT

   Q: Is there a way to find files deleted from a hard drive by
mistake? What if the file name is not known or remembered?
</P>
<P>
   A: Even if files are not purposely dragged to the Windows
desktop Recycle Bin (or into the Trash if you work on a Mac), they
can disappear from view with the wrong combination of keystrokes or
a crash and seem lost. But before panicking when a file becomes
missing in action, use the computer's Find function (use a Date
Modified search if you cannot recall the name) to search for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Trash and Recycle Bin icons are actually folders on your
hard drive for storing files you do not want anymore. Until you
empty the Trash or Recycle Bin folder, the files are still on your
computer; you can look through them and drag out the ones you want.
Right-clicking on the Recycle Bin calls up the option to empty it;
you dispose of the Mac's Trash with the Empty Trash option under
the Special menu. After you empty the folder, the files are
overwritten.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you empty your Recycle Bin or Trash, third-party utility
programs can help recover a deleted file. But you would need to
have one of these programs, like the Unerase feature of Norton
Utilities for Windows or Macintosh, already installed on your
machine. Trying to install recovery software might just overwrite
the deleted files that you were trying to get back.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The customer walked into the $1.5 million duplex
maisonette on Park Avenue and zeroed in on the decorative grilles
on the first-floor windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'd like to live in an apartment with bars on
it,'' Carlene Condon said, barely noting the ornate wrought-iron
balustrade, the swagged tapestry draperies, the Ionic columns and
the patterned marble floors. She shook her head. ``I mean,  &UR; Rikers
Island &LR;  has bars!''
</P>
<P>
   John Foreman, her real-estate agent, sighed. The day was not
getting off to a great start.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become one of the fastest-moving winter markets in
years, Manhattan real-estate brokers are hustling, trying to make
up for the third quarter, when buyers hesitated because of the
stock market's roller-coaster ride. Now, the agencies report, the
clients are back _ and buying. According to a Real Estate Board of
New York survey due out in early February, total sales volume in
the last quarter of 1998 rose 7 percent over the same period last
year. And according to a most year-end statistics, prices also
rose, well into the double digits for the larger apartments.
</P>
<P>
   So what is a day of selling real estate really like these days?
Is it a dawn-to-dusk frenzy, selling million-dollar duplexes as if
they were Volkswagen's New Beetle?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, a reporter tagged along with agents from two of the
city's most fiercely competitive companies, spending a day with
each.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman, a former architectural historian who has worked for
Halstead Property Co. for seven years, is so soft-spoken, the
reporter's back muscles hurt after spending a day leaning forward
to hear him.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Julie Gordon, a former Ford model turned co-op and
condominium saleswoman (why  &UR; do &LR;  real-estate agents always begin
their working lives in completely different occupations?), is
lively and outspoken. When desk mates at the Corcoran Group, where
she has worked for four years, were asked to characterize her, they
chanted in chorus, ``She's the one with the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps there is a certain symmetry that Foreman is working
with a woman who boldly compares the window grates in a Park Avenue
maisonette to those at the city prison. And that Ms. Gordon is
working with Robert McVeety, a music publishing company executive
who is as reserved as Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what did you think of the apartments?'' Ms. Gordon asked
McVeety after viewing two one-bedroom apartments in a postwar
building on East 56th Street. ``OK,'' he replied, without passion.
</P>
<P>
   She pressed him: ``Which did you like better?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, life is full of compromises,'' he said. After a good 10
minutes of fruitless interrogation, Ms. Gordon thought she might
have unearthed a clue to his diffidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' she said a bit wearily. ``Let's look at some apartments
on the West Side.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 a.m., there's a message on the reporter's answering
machine from Julie Gordon: ``Oh, my God, it's snowing! It looks
like school is going to be canceled, and I don't have anyone to
take care of the kids, so I'll have to give up my appointments.
We're trying to get the Snow Patrol on the phone, but they're not
awake yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the day begins for Ms. Gordon, a 40-year-old divorced
mother of two who is trying to carve out a life selling real estate
while juggling her family responsibilities. She is not as well
known as her colleagues who are photographed in their Rolls-Royces
with celebrity clients: she walks to showings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon is a vice president at the Corcoran Group, a title
won because of the money she's earned. She once had a bulletin
board with a handful of her ribbons, each attesting to a sale of
more than $1 million; one day, she tossed them all out. ``I just
wasn't into the ribbons anymore,'' she said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   At 7, she calls back. ``We called the class mother and woke her
up. There's school.''
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, she throws open the door of her six-room
apartment at 141 E. 88th St., a prewar co-op that she rents. She's
still wearing a gray sweatshirt and sweatpants. Her daughters,
Laura, 9, and Kelly, 11, are already dressed for school. ``I feel
like we're in Montana _ and we're going off to kill that moose,''
their mother says, as they head out.
</P>
<P>
   Walking along Lexington Avenue at a rapid clip, Laura and Kelly
fight over who will get their mother's left hand. ``It's a better
hand,'' Laura insists, looking daggers at her older sister. A few
minutes before 8, the children are delivered to the
Nightingale-Bamford School, and Ms. Gordon speeds back to her
apartment. ``After the first time my clients go out with me, they
know to wear sneakers,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At 9, she's changing into her basic-black work clothes,
listening to messages: ``Oooh!'' she shrieks. ``I just found out
this guy who just bought an apartment from me the first day we went
out had looked at 37 other apartments with another broker. I feel
 &UR; so &LR;  bad for her!''
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour later, at the office on Madison Avenue, she calls
Bob McVeety, who wants to find an apartment for himself and his
wife. ``He's looking at one-bedrooms,'' she says. ``They're the
hardest to please. They're always trying to squeeze, to get more
bang for the buck. They want to see every 750-square-foot apartment
in Manhattan before they decide. It's not my niche, but I like him,
so I make an exception.''
</P>
<P>
   And if she  &UR; doesn't &LR;  like a client? ``I call 911,'' she says
referring to an extension at the office for just such
eventualities. ``I say, `I want to get rid of this buyer.' They can
take them over. Oh, sure, they'll give me a referral fee _ 10
percent. You go up to the broker and give her a kiss. Better her
than me!''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Across town, John Foreman is just getting started. His first
appointment is at noon. At 9:30, he leaves the giant postwar
complex on East 66th Street, where he sublets. He is bound for his
office on Madison Avenue to check out the ``show sheets'' (who in
his office is showing what), to return calls and to put together
his own schedule, which includes deciding whether he's ``going to
show somebody a piece of garbage just because you have to show them
 &UR; something &LR; .'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Foreman, 53, looks dapper in a camel's-hair coat and a
taupe-colored slouch hat. He grabs a cup of squash soup at E.A.T.
``How much could it cost?'' he asks, without checking. He soon
finds out: ``$8!'' Reeling, he takes the soup back to the office.
He is meeting Carlene Condon, a corporate lawyer, at a seven-room,
$1.4 million co-op on East 68th Street.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Condon, who has been looking for an apartment for more than
six months, had requested this particular building, if something
became available; it is a prewar doorman building with a fine Old
English courtyard garden seen through leaded-glass french doors.
But the apartment, freshly renovated, gets only a lukewarm ``nice''
from Ms. Condon. She is looking for something more dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop is the idiosyncratic Park Avenue maisonette, with
hidden marble shower and a kitchen with a balcony. Drama, yes, but
those bars on the windows just won't do. The broker and his client
shake hands. ``I'll call you,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman heads back to the Halstead office to check messages and
to track down a missing commission check for $8,000 (he found it).
At 1:30, he zips off to meet a well-known basketball player and his
wife, who want to buy on the Upper West Side, either a large
apartment in a prewar doorman building (her choice) or a town house
filled to the rafters with original details (his choice). Like some
other clients on this random workday, the basketball player
insisted that his name not be used for reasons of privacy.
Tactfully, Foreman is showing them three apartments and two
brownstones.
</P>
<P>
   They are disappointed in the first apartment, at 100 Riverside
Drive, listed as having ``5-6rms/riv views'' for $1.175 million.
``So where was the river?'' the basketball star asks, as he drives
away.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop is a magnificent brownstone that, alas, was almost
gutted years ago and renovated to a modern stuccoed sheen. ``It was
in several magazines,'' Judy Osten of Brown Harris Stevens, the
listing agent, says brightly. Foreman will split the commission if
the couple buys the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a shame!'' the basketball player says. ``How much do you
think it would cost to restore it to the way it was?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Osten leads the group to another brownstone at 44 W. 91st
St. Right away, the customers see a drawback: the house is right
across the street from an elementary school. ``Yes, but they're
little children,'' Ms. Osten says gamely. Inside, though, the
couple are enthralled. They roam from room to room, floor to floor.
They admire for the cherry kitchen, which leads out to a back
garden. He exclaims over the huge den at the rear of the first
floor, which opens to a tiny deck. ``See, what you'd have to do is
maybe just stain these boards darker,'' he says to no one in
particular. The house is $2 million. ``They'd have to come down a
lot _ like to $1.5,'' he says afterward. ``Then it'd be a good
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple then visit two elegant prewar buildings on West End
Avenue: an eight-room apartment at No. 924, the Clebourne, is
listed at $1.075 million and a seven-and-a-half room fixer-upper at
No. 875 is priced at $765,000. They are still leaning toward an
apartment they saw on their first outing with Foreman. ``There's a
bathroom situation,'' the basketball player explains. ``Yes, a
 &UR; situation &LR; ,'' his wife says with a laugh. They explain: there is
an old-fashioned shaving closet _ just a single sink _ which they
want to make into a third bathroom, but the board has already said
it would not allow the change. (Nonetheless, the couple has asked
Foreman to schedule an appointment to see it again.)
</P>
<P>
   His next customer is a banker named Aashish Kamat, a friendly
but taciturn man whom he shows a series of two-bedroom co-ops,
priced at $400,000 to $600,000. Kamat is very quiet the whole time.
``I am always quiet,'' he says, ``when I know I am going to spend a
very great deal of money.''
</P>
<P>
   At 1:15, Ms. Gordon walks the five blocks from her office to
meet McVeety at 136 E. 56th St. On the way, she explains her
strategy for the McVeetys. ``See, this couple's tough. I'd like to
see them go into a top-notch building. But his wife, Chris, is just
out of law school, so the boards might say: `Yeah, fine, she's
 &UR; going &LR;  to make a lot of money. Come back in a few years.'''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McVeety says: ``We're trying to make up our mind
whether to live in Westchester or the city.'' he says. They are now
living in a Brooklyn sublet. He carefully examines two
1,000-square-foot one-bedroom apartments, both with dining areas.
Both are priced at just under $300,000. ``I would like Chris to
look at both of these,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After her last showing, Ms. Gordon heads back to pick up her
daughters at school and to make some calls from her apartment. It
is 2:30. Her day of showing co-ops is over.
</P>
<P>
   Six hours later, Foreman shows a small $269,000 one-bedroom in
the Schwab House, a postwar building at 11 Riverside Drive.
Afterward, he sinks into a sofa in the lobby and pulls out his cell
phone. One last call, and his day is done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither broker has ended up with a signed contract _ or anything
close to it _ but that's hardly unusual, both say.
</P>
<P>
   Before making a sale, an agent often shows a customer 30 or 40
apartments, Foreman says. ``And sometimes you have dry spells, when
you don't make any money for a very, very long time. I've got an
ex-wife and a kid at boarding school. That's why I do so many
rentals; they're quick. Sometimes you can wrap up a deal in a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Foreman sold one town house and 11 apartments, but he
rented 12 apartments, each with a hefty commission: usually 15
percent of a year's total rent. (With sales, the commission is
normally 6 percent, which gets divided with the agency and with any
other broker involved.) ``It's not an easy living,'' he continues.
``You have to work hard. I came to this job when I was 45, and I've
learned to live with the uncertainty. I like being my own boss.
Some big-time brokers rake in a lot of money.'' He chuckles. ``And
frankly, I aspire to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both agents refuse to say exactly how much they make. They get
no salary; they live on their commissions. Ms. Gordon says she has
to bring in at least $120,000 to keep her desk at the agency.
Foreman makes in the low six figures. ``Emphasize the  &UR; low &LR; ,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon has adopted a devil-may-care attitude. ``Hey, I only
sold five apartments last year,'' she says. ``And when I sold the
fifth, I said: `Whoa! That's it. That's all the money I need for
this year. And I headed off to St. Bart's.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, she says, she already has five apartments that will
close in the next few months. ``And then guess what? It's off to
St. Bart's again!''
</P>

   Growing Persimmons
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the last few years I've been eating the flat or round
persimmons, which are totally different from the kind with a
pointed end. These often have four seeds that are quite large. I
planted them and have gotten a green-leafed plant. What will happen
as it gets larger? Is it tropical? Should it be brought indoors?
</P>
<P>
   A. Round, flattish persimmons like Fuyu, which can be enjoyed
while still firm, are indeed very different from the
pointy-plum-shaped varieties like Hachiya, which tend to be sweeter
when completely soft but are inedibly astringent until that happy
day arrives. Yet, both of them are the same species, Diospyros
kaki, the Oriental persimmon. There are somewhere around 2,000
known cultivars of this fruit, most of them developed in Asia,
where persimmon trees are widely admired for their beauty as well
as their utility.
</P>
<P>
   Height can be up to 30 feet, though it's usually kept much lower
by pruning. The shiny leaves start the season pale green, then
darken, then turn yellow and red before dropping in fall, and the
bright orange fruit often clings long after the branches are bare,
to very ornamental effect.
</P>
<P>
   Oriental persimmons require plenty of sunshine and do best in
areas with mild winters. They are not tropical _ in fact, most
require at least a short dormant period in order to bear fruit _
but they thrive best in warm places, from the Carolinas on south,
and even the very toughest will be killed if the temperature drops
to zero Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   American persimmons, D. virginiana, are considerably hardier
than the Orientals. They do fine in the mid-Atlantic states, and
some varieties can survive as far north as southern Massachusetts.
Though their astringent-till-soft fruit tends to be small, roughly
golf-ball size, it can be every bit as tasty as that of the
Orientals.
</P>
<P>
   Varieties are perpetuated by grafting, since persimmons do not
come true from seed, and that means there's no way to know whether
your plant will bear fruit that resembles the one you ate. It could
be larger, smaller, more or less sweet; even its relative
astringency could be different, since this characteristic can
depend on weather and pollination as well as genetics.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the fruit comes out, your tree will be pretty _ if
it survives. Persimmon enthusiasts in areas where hardiness is
borderline sometimes plant the trees in barrels and winter them
over in the garage, but they aren't really houseplants.
</P>
<P>
   Oriental persimmons are available from Lowder Farm and Nursery,
15251 NW Highway 129, Trenton, Fla. 32693; (352) 463-7742; free
price list. A wide variety of the American species is offered by
Nolin River Nut Tree Nursery, 797 Port Wooden Road, Upton, Ky.

IMAGINATION THAT TRANSCENDS EXPECTATIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM LITTLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ George Bernard Shaw once described
Vancouver as ``the pick of Canada,'' and even his caustic fellow
wordsmith Dylan Thomas, in a letter to his wife, called it ``a
quite handsome hellhole.'' But a metropolis of dance? Home to an
internationally ambitious ballet company? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1985, when the latest of a series of West Coast balletic
phoenixes rose tentatively from the ashes of Pacific Ballet
Theater, nothing so ambitious as a passport appeared on the agenda
for the new Ballet British Columbia. It was to be a Vancouver-based
company with a regional mission, to bring ballet to the various
centers of its home province. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade later, the company was dancing at Whitman
Hall at Brooklyn College, where it was characterized by Anna
Kisselgoff in The New York Times as ``a handsome group of 16
classical dancers whose bold demeanor evokes the tough, frank
manner of contemporary ballet troupes in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, John Alleyne, the company's artistic director for
the past seven years, regards that New York debut as premature, and
his associate artistic director, Marquita Witham-Lester, goes even
further: ``We were on a subscription series, and the audience
didn't know who we were. They saw ballet in the title and seemed to
expect `Giselle' or `Romeo and Juliet.' Instead, we gave them a
program of contemporary Canadian work. They left up the aisles like
lemmings.''
</P>
<P>
   So what has the company decided to offer the audience in its
return one-week New York engagement starting Tuesday at the Joyce
Theater? A program of contemporary Canadian work. Only this time,
Alleyne insists, ``We have the right theater, the right public, the
right repertory and the right dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Giselle'' and ``Romeo and Juliet'' were never in the cards for
Ballet British Columbia. Early on, its artistic directors, whether
the retired Grands Ballets Canadiens ballerina Annette av Paul or
her successors, Reid Anderson, Patricia Neary and Barry Ingham,
recognized that Vancouver lacked the resources to support a
large-scale company.
</P>
<P>
   Not that dance itself was unable to thrive. Today, Canada's
third largest city boasts 27 professional companies. But their
seasons are short, their dancers are few and their competition
includes some of the most beautiful natural scenery known to keep
people out of theaters. ``Many of the dancers who come here also
love the outdoors,'' says Ms. Lester, herself native born. ``We
have a lot of layoff time; our season is only 30 weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   A company of sybarites? Alleyne laughs at the notion. Most of
its 14 members are Canadian born and trained; some come from the
United States, Japan, China and Poland, but all are expected to
perform as soloists and contribute to the creative life of the
company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we seek out mature dancers,'' Alleyne says. ``The
men are mostly in their early 30s, the women in their late 20s.
They came here from other companies with a clear objective: to be
part of an ensemble of individuals who can participate actively
with choreographers in the creation of new work.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, works by major international figures like John
Cranko, Jiri Kylian and William Forsythe have turned up among the
newly commissioned pieces. Through its Dance Alive series, Ballet
British Columbia also sponsors visits to Vancouver by major
domestic and foreign companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it is those specially commissioned works, literally dozens
of them over the last decade and virtually all of them Canadian,
that have given Ballet British Columbia its special identity. As a
choreographer himself, Alleyne has deliberately cultivated a
dance-making environment in the company's two modest studios. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Born in Barbados, Alleyne immigrated to Canada with his parents
at the age of 5 (his 39th birthday precedes his Joyce Theater
opening by one day). He trained at the National Ballet School in
Toronto and spent his dancing career with the Stuttgart Ballet and
the National Ballet of Canada, eventually becoming the latter's
resident choreographer before taking up his Vancouver appointment
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``John isn't just a choreographer,'' says Trisha Baldwin,
executive director of the ballet company. ``He is a leader. He
understands dancers. He knows how to talk to audiences. He draws
everyone into the process of creation.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is often part of Alleyne's own process of creation to
give the dancers ideas and have them work out some of the actual
steps. For someone reared in a strict environment of balletic
classicism, he champions a surprising amount of invention in the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inviting the dancers to work this way can make getting to the
end result a longer journey,'' he says. ``The reward is seeing them
develop as creative beings. I'm a huge lover of classical ballet,
but I want it to remain a creative art form.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Alleyne clearly chooses his dancers, he likes to say
that they also choose him, and in large measure because of his way
of working. The company he took to New York last time was
different: he had inherited most of those dancers. ``They were good
dancers, but they weren't really my dancers,'' he says. ``I didn't
want to go back to New York until I felt the company had an
opportunity to develop a new repertory that we had worked on
together. Only one of the works is mine, but I'm not really that
magnanimous. The three others all appeal to my admiration for craft
and refinement in movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The other works include ``There, Below,'' a dance for five
couples exploring James Kudelka's fascination with the art of
partnering; ``The Fall,'' a duet by Serge Bennathan lamenting man's
self-destructiveness, and ``Conversation Piece,'' Mark Godden's
portrait of forbidden love inspired by 18th-century genre painting
of fashionable people.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these choreographers has enjoyed a close association
with another Canadian company: Kudelka with the National Ballet, of
which he is currently artistic director; Bennathan with the Toronto
modern-dance ensemble Dancemakers, which he directs, and Godden
with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, for which he functioned for several
years as resident choreographer. In fact, Alleyne's own ``Sex Is My
Religion'' is the only work on the Joyce program to have been
created for Ballet British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its title (which comes from a play by the Canadian
dramatist Colin Thomas), Alleyne's ballet has less to do with
either sex or religion than with the lifelong impact of the
relationship between a mother and child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things rarely happen in a linear way in my ballets,'' he
explains. ``Everything is highly textured. Phrases break up and
continue two minutes later. The work shifts very rapidly in its
emotional intent. I used to say I do 20 minutes of bombardment and
5 minutes of pleasure. I guess I still do that, but I think now
that it is sometimes important to show not what is but what one
hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly an idealist, Alleyne has let his capacity to hope mellow
the anger sometimes found in his earlier work. ``My parents were
brought up in a time when they were regarded as lesser beings in
the Caribbean,'' he says. ``And I experienced some of the same
feelings in my life in North America and Europe. But if I had
allowed tradition to win, I would never have come to where I am
today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognized this particularly when Arthur Mitchell invited me
to do a work for Dance Theater of Harlem,'' says Alleyne, who has
also choreographed for the New York City Ballet's Diamond Project.
The work in Harlem, he adds, ``was one of the best experiences of
my life, being in the studio with his dancers and realizing that
their stories were my stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Home is nonetheless the far-from-Harlem studios on Vancouver's
west side, where Alleyne and his dancers do their primary work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided,'' he says, smiling, ``that there is no point
competing with the incredible beauty of the mountains and the
ocean. A lot of artists can't bear to work in such an environment.
They feel inessential. But because Vancouver is relatively small
and isolated, there is a real feeling of community among the
artists who do work here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in Europe for eight years in an environment in which
tradition had been written and no one was expected to diverge from
it. In Vancouver, we are still writing our tradition, and that is
why I find it one of the most exciting places to live.''

YOUNG `TURKS' CARRY IRISH BANNER INTO SWEEPS BATTLE FOR CBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the last shall be first.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seems with ``Turks,'' the last morsel in the 1998-99
stew of Irish-flavored programming, and possibly the tastiest.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, ``Turks'' may need the luck of the Irish to survive its
midseason tryout. It will air Thursdays at 9 p.m., a slot owned by
NBC for much of this decade, thanks to the strength and quality of
``Seinfeld.'' Perceiving a chink in NBC's ``Seinfeld''-free armor
now, CBS hopes to make inroads by sending ``Turks'' over the
battlements in a quest for more Thursday night viewers,
particularly during the February ratings sweep, which begins next
Thursday. (ABC recently did the same thing, albeit with the god of
love, ``Cupid.'')
</P>
<P>
   CBS's move is risky, because ``Diagnosis Murder'' has been a
shrewd piece of counterprogramming that earned CBS a loyal audience
on Thursdays at 9. The problem is that it's an older-skewing
audience, a demographic not coveted by Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turks,'' which is appealing despite a reliance on timeworn
cliches, is aimed at the lucrative 18-to-49-year-old demographic,
and if CBS can attract the same number of viewers that it attracts
to ``Diagnosis Murder,'' the network can actually make more money
because advertisers are willing to pay more for a younger audience.
One problem: People who like ``Diagnosis Murder'' for its light,
formulaic approach in the manner of ``Murder, She Wrote'' aren't
likely to warm to ``Turks,'' a darker, character-driven endeavor
with continuing story arcs from week to week. This means CBS may
have to bring an entirely new group into the tent. (``Diagnosis
Murder'' switches to 8 p.m. Thursdays for the time being, while
``Promised Land'' takes a breather.)
</P>
<P>
   Joe Turk would never put up with such shenanigans, but,
unfortunately, he's only make believe and he has no say in how long
``Turks'' will stay on the air, or where it appears in the
schedule. For better or worse, William Devane plays Sergeant Turk
with the firm jaw and steely gaze you'd expect of a tough Chicago
policeman who wouldn't hesitate to pull over a network exec on
suspicion of DUI _ decision-making under the influence (of
advertisers).
</P>
<P>
   Turk has two sons who are also cops, and another whose gambling
habit puts him at odds with the family code of honor, not to
mention on the wrong side of the law. Turk's marriage is rocky, and
his relationship with his sons, while close, wouldn't exactly
qualify as warm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turks'' is from executive producer Robert Singer, who has
plumbed both the lighter drama (``Lois and Clark: The New
Adventures of Superman'') and the weightier stuff (``Midnight
Caller'') with some success. Thursday night's effort is notable for
its subtle melding of humor and drama into a mixture that is
pleasing, though numbingly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   As dramas go, ``Turks'' is no ``EZ Streets.'' The scripts honor
the time-tested police-drama banalities: the ethical cop forced to
make the tough choice, the question over whether a ``good shoot''
was justified, the inevitable wounding of a principal character.
The latter happens to Mike Turk (David Cubitt) in episode three,
and if I were a betting man like Mike's brother Paul (Michael
Muhney), I'd plunk down some serious folding money on odds that
Mike will pull through, maybe after a close brush with the
hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The cliches are annoying, but the writing is solid enough and
the characters compelling enough to make a viewer put his feet up
on the ottoman and sit for a spell. Devane is especially fun to
watch, as is Ashley Crow, who plays a waitress who helps Turk deal
with his loveless marriage. The plots run a little deeper than the
sort of programming CBS does best, but if ``Turks'' works, CBS will
have begun a monumental revision of its Thursday night diagnosis _
from murder to money.
</P>
<P>
   Turks. Hourlong police drama about a close-knit Chicago family.
Starring William Devane, David Cubitt, Ashley Crow, Matthew John
Armstrong, Helen Carey, Michael Muhney and Sarah Trigger. Premieres
Friday night on CBS. Parental guideline rating: TV-14.

A TRIBUTE TO JUDITH: A SUCCESSFUL ARTIST, MOTHER AND WIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the flower bed below the deck, where she could
delight in their color, promising green daffodil shoots nudged
through the winter leaf mulch. And the woman who in many columns
you've come to know as ``Wife Person'' allowed as how it seemed a
tad early for spring in Seattle, but that she was anxious to have
me uncover them so she might see them by Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hahn, my wife and partner for 36 springtimes, won't be
asking me to pick her a fresh bouquet of her very own daffodils. My
Judith died suddenly, of a heart attack, last Friday in Evergreen
Hospital Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was very comforting that several of her doctors cried when
they later talked to me. Most everyone who met Judith liked her,
and we can all take her untimely death a little personally. I
shared her with you in columns because she was very, very special.
</P>
<P>
   You often read that someone died ``after a courageous battle.''
And Judith never ceded so much as an inch or a minute of precious
time to the chronic progressive form of multiple sclerosis that
took a little bit of her energy and capabilities every year. After
20 years learning to play the rotten hand she was dealt, she was on
her way out of the hospital, after her second successful surgery in
a month, and downright enthusiastic about life.
</P>
<P>
   She had repeatedly rejected professional advice about going into
``a facility,'' and opted, instead, to live and work at home. An
overwhelming number of friends and health care professionals knew
we could handle it. If you are a caregiver, you know.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a whole lot we couldn't do, even considering the
physical limitations that put her in a wheelchair. She could be
hell on wheels once she powered-up her new electric wheelchair and
zipped down the sidewalk or through a shopping mall. But she was a
gentle, refined and very sensitive woman who gave much more to
life, and to those around her, than ever she asked or expected. And
while she did not suffer fools lightly, neither was she a snob. She
loved to share and to teach as much as she loved to learn.
</P>
<P>
   She was beautiful, my wife. A dazzling smile, twinkly blue eyes
and lovely blonde hair. We grew up about a block from one another
in Chicago, and went to the same grade school and high school, the
same church, etc., but never dated. Eventually we both went to the
University of Illinois, where she was an art student and I was one
of those perpetual college drop-in-and-outers. The minute I saw the
cute little blonde from the old neighborhood walk out of the
college dorm as a beautiful young woman, my heart went into my
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   She had me framing paintings two days later. Two years later, we
married while still students. We followed her academic work to
Michigan State University, where she earned a master of fine arts
degree. Judith was winning professional art competitions before she
was graduated. Her work is in the Brooklyn Museum, the Smithsonian,
and many major collections.
</P>
<P>
   About the time we followed my work here, far from our respective
families, she was diagnosed with this crippling disease that
eventually made it difficult and then impossible to water ski,
garden, walk or drive. She had to give up physically demanding
printmaking and became a painter. A Northwest painter.
</P>
<P>
   Her eye delighted in the patterns of forest ferns or water
waves, and she was excited at seeing row upon row of daffodils in
the Skagit Valley or dahlias in the Sammamish Valley below our
home, or the sea of bobbing heads at Bumbershoot. Lord, did she
love Bumbershoot, and the Folklife Festival, and the University
Street Fair. She knew I disliked these crowds, but she came home
exhausted and utterly happy at having been out in the moving tide
of people.
</P>
<P>
   She fell in love with Puget Sound and insisted we travel down
the county roads and blacktops that took her close to the fields
and the farms and rivers. She saw, and later captured in her
paintings, the simple elegance of ferns and fences and the
rough-cut beauty of sunlight on river rocks. People in Pioneer
Square and boats at Port Angeles. She even made the Ballard Bridge
look good.
</P>
<P>
   And she tried _ oh, how she tried _ to make me look good. As I
would dress quietly every weekday morning in the dim light of our
closet, trying hard not to wake her, I would turn to leave and
hear: ``You're not going into Seattle dressed like THAT, are
you?!'' But she was my best editor and fairest fan. And I think,
despite the rolling of her eyes, that she was pleased to be known
as ``Wife Person'' as much as Judith Hahn, signature member of
Northwest Watercolor Society.
</P>
<P>
   She never complained how unfair it was; neither did she feel
sorry for herself, or let anyone else do so. She was not a
``handicapped artist,'' she insisted, but simply an artist who
happened to be in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   And a very active and caring wife and mother. She made it to all
those wet, cold soccer games, to all the school concerts, to all
the Scout ceremonies. And, to our great joy, our son's wedding
aboard the old ferry Skansonia last spring. Judith painted the
portrait that Stefan and Christie used for their wedding
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   She was a remarkable woman, My Judith, not for what she endured
so much as for her daily victories, and for the way she could light
up a room. Her light never dimmed till the very end.
</P>
<P>
   It is really hard writing of Judith in past tense. As I busied
myself with cleaning away those medical supplies and equipment that
had become part of our daily homelife, I paused at a simple
disposable paper cup on the sink. It was rimmed with her lipstick
impressions. And I cannot yet discard it.
</P>
<P>
   I know that's sorta silly. There are all her prints and
paintings, all those album photographs. Everything in our home
reflects her touch, her vision. When my older sister died not long
ago, Judith felt my hurt and bought me a lavender rose plant to
remind me of my sister.
</P>
<P>
   And just now, in the flower bed below the deck where she loved
to look down on them, the daffodils are coming to life again.

FIRST-DOWN STRIPE IS FOR VIEWERS ONLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a question about the gold stripe on some of the pro
football games. Can that only be seen by the TV audience, or is it
visible to the players? _ L.F., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The onfield stripe, which has appeared this month on
telecasts of some NFL playoff games and the Fiesta Bowl, is visible
only to TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The stripe marks the line a team must cross to get a first down
on offense. Players and officials can pass in front of it as if it
were painted on the field.
</P>
<P>
   During NFL playoff games on CBS, the effect was created by
Princeton Video Image. Several companies provide similar technology
for other events. Video insertion also has been used to place
advertising and other information during Major League Baseball
games, soccer and auto racing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What mailing address can I use to contact Kirk Kerkorian? _
I.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Kerkorian, a financier and philanthropist who owns the MGM
Grand Hotel and a majority share of MGM Studios, has several
business addresses. Employees at each company asked that they not
be published for the purpose of contacting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not something we do,'' said a Kerkorian representative
at Tracinda Corp., his Las Vegas-based company that owns the MGM
properties. Tracinda does not publish its address or phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Kerkorian, 82, never grants interviews and is described by
colleagues as extremely shy. He is worth $5.7 billion, according to
Forbes magazine, and has donated an estimated $500 million to
charities related to education, health care and other efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an Armenian immigrant farmer, Kerkorian also supports
Armenian causes with efforts such as donating $25 million for
airlifts of medicine and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What actor played the part of the drunk Santa Claus in
``Miracle on 34th Street,'' and what else did he appear in? _
B.L.A., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: That uncredited role was portrayed by Percy Helton, according
to the Internet Movie Database at www.imdb.com.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who died in 1971 at age 77, appeared in 70 movies and
more than 20 TV shows during his seven-decade acting career.
</P>
<P>
   Some other Helton performances that show up on TV today are on
``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' as Sweetface, ``Beverly
Hillbillies'' as Homer Cratchit, ``Jailhouse Rock'' as Sam
Brewster, and several appearances on ``Gunsmoke.''  &QL;

INTERNET COMPANIES PAY TODAY FOR PROMISE OF PROFITS TOMORROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The mind-numbing sums being paid for Internet
companies that may not even make a profit are part of a gamble to
dominate the next generation of computer couch potatoes and their
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Investors believe Web sites such as Excite Inc. will be the
Internet equivalent of a television network with an important
twist: The Internet has the potential to knock down the shopping
impulse barrier and allow users to instantly buy, for example, a
pair of jeans they see worn by a TV character.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the At Home Corp. announced it would acquire Excite
in a $6.7 billion stock swap. At Home, which like Excite is based
in Redwood City, Calif., sells high-speed Internet access over
existing cable TV lines. Neither company has ever made a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous gamble on portals _ the Internet home pages that
provide links to other sites _ is based on the possibility of
accessing a wealth of personal data as more and more people gain
access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``User information is the currency of Web portals,'' said Peggy
O'Neill, an analyst with the Dataquest research firm in San Jose.
The portals ``can get a lot more worth out of their advertising
sells with that kind of data.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Excite, other popular portals include Yahoo, the
Lycos Network and the Disney-backed Go.Com.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street cheered the At Home-Excite deal, but one influential
commentator said the current wave of portal deals had gotten out of
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fad,'' said Esther Dyson, who publishes the Release 1.0
industry newsletter. ``Sure, the higher access speeds are going to
get more people on the Web, but then it means that people will
leave portals for other sites that much faster.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson said companies like Excite were ``way overvalued.''
</P>
<P>
   At Home founder Will Hearst, a former publisher of the San
Francisco Examiner, countered that high-speed access would make
portals more, not less, important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faster access will affect the style of Web usage, but people
still need a centralized site to organize their experience,''
Hearst said. ``You can click through TV channels pretty fast these
days, but you still need some sort of a channel guide to tell you
what's on. The Web is a million channels, and portals help organize
all that information without having to remember a hundred URLs or
keep track of thousands of bookmarks.''
</P>
<P>
   The At Home-Excite deal comes on the heels of America Online's
$4.2 billion acquisition of Netscape Communications Inc. Last week,
telecommunications companies Pacific Bell and Bell Atlantic each
rolled out Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line service for
consumers. The service transforms ordinary phone lines into a
high-speed Internet access lines that are always on, much like a
telephone dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   At Home offers its own always-on high-speed Internet access
service through existing cable TV lines.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, who is also a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP;
Byers, a Silicon Valley venture capital company that helped broker
the Excite sale, said the burgeoning success of portals has made
them a valuable asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest ones just keep getting bigger,'' Hearst said.
``Once everyone realized that there were not going to be that many
portals, other companies started to buy in, instead of trying to
create their own.''
</P>
<P>
   This allows advertisers to target their portal messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is AOL worth more than General Motors, Yahoo worth the
same as Boeing and Amazon worth more than Sears?'' said Beth
Vanderslice, president of San Francisco's Wired Digital, which is
about to close the deal that makes it part of the Waltham,
Mass.-based Lycos Network. ``Wall Street is acknowledging the
millions of people who visit portals and the ability of these sites
to gather information about their visitors and act on this
information to their mutual continuous benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the interactive payoff,'' said Patrick Keane, a senior
analyst with the New York-based Jupiter Communications. ``The
potential to focus an ad message is what makes portals tick, as far
as investors are concerned.''

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In the 1940s and '50s, Fort Worth was
renowned for its Cats baseball team, its pioneer status in the TV
industry, civic icon Amon Carter and a slew of illicit sin palaces
where gangland types knocked one another off in real-life imitation
of Dashiell Hammett's bloody private-eye fiction. Although the
Cats, early TV and Carter have been woven into modern-day versions
of city history, the shady stuff, like an embarrassing relative's
snapshot in a stuffy family's photo album, has been pointedly
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't see why,'' says Ann Arnold, a Fort Worth
educator and activist. ``When I first moved to the city in 1949,
there was so much of that going on _ gambling, gangland slayings _
that to me the interesting thing was the dichotomy between us
normal folks and the gamblers and gangsters. I mean, it wasn't like
today, with drive-by shootings and nobody safe in their front
yards. It was a completely separate, fascinating culture.''
</P>
<P>
   After a fruitless search for books about Fort Worth history that
included material about those wild-and-woolly days, Arnold decided
to write her own. Two years later, the result is ``Gamblers &AMP;
Gangsters,'' published by Eakin Press of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing the book turned out to be very easy,'' says Arnold,
66. ``I started by going to the (Fort Worth) public library, where
they had a folder with some newspaper clippings about gamblers who
had been indicted in 1951. From there, I studied other newspaper
accounts and got some names of people to contact. I talked to them,
and most of them would say, `You've got to talk to so-and-so, too,'
and it just spread from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Arnold's sources included veteran area journalists
such as Carl Freund and Madeline Williams, former Fort Worth Cats
manager Bobby Bragan and Gerald Saxon of the University of Texas at
Arlington's Special Collections Division. But most of her best
material came from descendants of Jacksboro Highway hooligans and
even, in the case of 90ish George Wilderspin, straight from the
lips of one of the participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just loved George,'' Arnold says, laughing about the
colorful gangland character. ``He's such a crusty old fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   As ``Gamblers &AMP; Gangsters'' relates, in the 1940s and '50s much
of the Jacksboro Highway became a haven for illicit gambling
joints, prostitution rings and strong-arm financial shenanigans
that would never have passed muster in a court of law. Much of the
dirty dealing went on, however, with area law enforcement carefully
looking the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Even the area's leading newspaper was a conspirator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amon Carter didn't want anything in the `Star-Telegram' that
detracted from the image he wanted his city to have,'' Arnold says.
``If we find today that most of these gangster stories have been
swept under the rug for decades, well, Amon Carter had a lot to do
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, however, makes up for anyone else's attempts to pretend
that the bad things didn't happen. ``Gamblers &AMP; Gangsters'' begins
Nov. 22, 1950, when all-around nasty fellow Nelson Harris and his
pregnant wife were killed by a car bomb. It took the death of
Juanita Harris and her unborn child, Arnold writes, to make
upstanding Fort Worth residents ``realize crime and corruption were
serious problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite lengthy accounts of other gory deaths, ``Gamblers &AMP;
Gangsters'' also provides its share of chuckles. Elmer Sharp, an
enforcer so tough that he wrestled his own pet bear, is recalled as
someone who still could be beaten up by his mother. Reporters for
an evening paper are depicted trying to talk a police chief into
timing his raids to fit their deadlines and not those of their
morning competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be a fun book,'' Arnold says. ``I guess that's
because I still see myself as a teacher who tries to make history
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   She evidently has. Eakin Press has ordered a second ``Gamblers &AMP;
Gangsters'' printing, and Arnold has had requests for the book from
as far away as Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``That surprised me, because I thought it would be only of local
interest,'' she admits. ``But people just seem to like it. Even
surviving relatives of people who were not treated too kindly in
the book _ treated objectively, I hope, but not kindly _ have said
they liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold's plans for her next book projects include a look at
local law schools and courts, and a novel based on real-life Fort
Worth crime. The latter is already written; Arnold is shopping for
a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like writing, and when you work on one book you hear
something that can lead to another project,'' she says. ``I'm glad
`Gamblers &AMP; Gangsters' is pleasing people. It's about things that
are part of what made Fort Worth what it is today.''

IN THE NEW RUSSIA, COMEDY LACKS BITE  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOSCOW _ It's not hard to make fun of what is happening in
Russia these days. New jokes about the new rich (now the new poor
after last summer's financial crisis) are posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin's fumbling speech is always an easy
laugh. There may be more comedy routines about bank failures than
there are solvent banks in Russia. But real humor _ the deep,
biting, funny-sad satire that makes Russians laugh, usually at
themselves _ has become rarer, or at least so says Mikhail
Zhvanetsky, the country's premier stand-up comedian and humor
writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In prison, without freedom, humor is much more interesting; it
is nobler somehow,'' he said on the eve of his most recent one-man
show in Tchaikovsky Hall, Moscow's biggest concert hall. ``It
carries with it the idea of protest, of a struggle against the
regime. And everybody is in agreement. In fact, that was the great
achievement of Soviet power: people were unanimous, everyone
thought the same. Just try to achieve something like that in a free
society. Never. You'll fail.''
</P>
<P>
   People may have laughed in unison in the old days, but that
doesn't make Zhvanetsky nostalgic for censorship. It just means he
has had to adjust to a new reality, to audiences that are more
distracted, more divided, more diverse _ and smaller. Tchaikovsky
Hall was only two-thirds full on the night of his big concert (in
part because ticket prices averaged $10, too high for the average
Zhvanetsky devotee), and the bond between comedian and audience,
once strung tight with the tension of political risk, seemed at
times to go flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``All information is available; a satirist cannot discover
anything new,'' said Zhvanetsky, 64, ``so humor doesn't play the
role it played before. Now is the time for satirists to show off
their talent. Before, it was enough to prove they were brave.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zhvanetsky _ a short, balding man who, with glasses
perched on the end of his nose, reads his material from typewritten
sheets, legs apart and chest thrust forward _ makes people laugh.
Sometimes they laugh so hard they cry.
</P>
<P>
   When NTV, Russia's largest private television station, recently
broadcast a 16-part series of pure Zhvanetsky, showing him reading
through a collection of work written over the last 30 years, it was
at the top of the ratings, except for one night when another
station tried to fight back with Peter Falk in an old ``Colombo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Zhvanetsky is No. 1, both in the Soviet Union, now in Russia,
and in all points of the world where Russian-speakers live,'' said
Gennady Khazanov, another well-known comedian who, like Zhvanetsky,
had his heyday in the ``perestroika'' years of the 1980s. ``For the
majority of thinking people, he is the symbol of humor in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis here is on the word ``thinking.'' Zhvanetsky and
others are quick to point out that the general level of humor in
Russia has sunk as the country has emerged into the bright light of
freedom. ``Before, humor was aimed at the level of the head, then
it went down to the heart, then we had jokes about health,'' said
Zhvanetsky. ``Now it has slipped even lower, with most of it at
about the urogenital level. It is not even about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the language of humor has changed, coarsened by the
criminal jargon that has crept into Russian speech. ``I sometimes
get advice,'' he said. ``People say, `Misha, you should spend some
time in prison, a year or two.' They say, `You would see such
interesting things there, and it would make your humor so
understandable to the people.' That's why we have this exchange:
the satirist amuses the public by mimicking what he or she has seen
or heard watching the public. So he is amused watching them, then
they are amused watching him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so with Zhvanetsky, who now as before manages to infuse his
sketches with philosophical insights and literary touches. His work
is in the same class as the books of Ilf and Petrov, writers of the
1930s who, like Zhvanetsky, were from Odessa, the Black Sea port
known as the crucible of Russian-Jewish humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a classic,'' said Leonid Parfyonov, general producer at
NTV. ``He writes about the national character with a kind of
philosophical lyricism. It is literature, and such things don't
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhvanetsky, who worked for a while as a mechanic at the Odessa
port, began as a writer of monologues for a local satirical
theater. In the 1960s, his work attracted the attention of Arkady
Raikin, a legendary Russian comic actor. But Zhvanetsky's notoriety
as a performer as well as a writer peaked later, when he began to
appear behind closed doors at Russia's elite establishments. There,
his listeners _ sometimes scientists, sometimes high-ranking
bureaucrats, once even cosmonauts out there circling in space _
were trusted to keep his jokes secret.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they eventually leaked out, and like the bitter songs
of Russia's beloved bard, Vladimir Vystotsky, circulated widely on
scratchy recordings.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Zhvanetsky returned to the public stage in the
mid-80s, his monologues, like Vysotsky's songs, had already been
committed to memory by legions of fans from all walks of life,
dissidents and Communist party members, workers and physicists,
anybody who found the daily burdens of Soviet life both unbearable
and unbearably funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zhvanetsky personified deep perplexity,'' Yuri Bogomolov wrote
in a review in the newspaper Izvestia about the Zhvanetsky classics
after they were broadcast on NTV. ``He didn't lash out, or skip
around. He simply tried to figure out the logic of what was
happening to us. Having found it, he understood that this logic was
absurd. That was the essence of his satire. Step by step, sketch
after sketch, he created an encyclopedia of Soviet absurdity that
eventually turned out to be, unintentionally, the true history of
the Soviet state.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, much of that absurdity continues today in the new
Russia. The sketch that got the biggest laugh at Tchaikovsky Hall
was about a befuddled Russian Everyman who is told to sit still and
keep quiet as former leaders of the Young Communist League turn
their wagons around and become young capitalist bankers, only now
to change signals and turn around again. Somehow, the Everyman is
always left bringing up the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Some old Soviet themes _ like that of the endless queuing up for
scarce goods _ have been replaced by more modern Russian ones about
cars queuing up to inspect prostitutes. There are more topical
jokes, about homosexuals who are released from the usual
obligations on International Women's Day, about Jews who are
ashamed to be Jews, and about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these might not pass muster in the United States, but
then Zhvanetsky _ who makes regular trips to appear before
audiences of Russian immigrants _ freely confesses to not
understanding modern American morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the part of America I like the least,'' he said, ``the
relations between men and women, all this business about sexual
harassment. People don't know where to look, what to touch. It
makes me worry about where the next generation of Americans are
going to come from.'' Like most Russians, he finds the Clinton
scandal baffling, but above all ``ungentlemanly'' on the part of
the congressional investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Although he still mocks politicians, Zhvanetsky says he wants to
move away from attacks on the government, and take a closer look at
Russians themselves. ``Finally I realized that it is not the
government we should focus on but ourselves,'' he said, ``that is,
those of us who don't want to work. It has been described before:
people sit in a cage, the cage opens, and they are unwilling to get
out. It's ridiculous, but there is a strong desire of Soviet people
to work on a collective farm. There, you can steal and you can
drink, calmly.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other comedians, Zhvanetsky has little time for the
ever-circulating jokes about the new Russians, as the
gold-bedecked, Mercedes-driving new rich in Russia are called. ``It
is a huge sphere of humor for everybody but me,'' he said. ``I also
touch upon it, but since I try my best to improve life, I prefer to
prod those who do nothing. In fact, everyone is a bit sick and
tired of new-Russian jokes. They are too primitive, both the jokes
and the new Russians themselves.''

`TURKS' OFFERS NOTHING NEW IN COP SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TURKS 
Starring: William Devane, David Cubitt, Michael Muhney, Sara
Trigger, Helen Carey, Matthew John Armstrong, Ashley Crowe 
On: CBS, Thursday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pity TV's poor cop-show writers, having to churn out scene after
scene in a genre that truly has been there, done that, and revealed
some serious rear end along the way. After two decades of ace crime
dramas like ``Hill Street Blues,'' ``NYPD Blue,'' and ``Homicide,''
all of which spent years breaking new ground, there just isn't much
fertile territory left to explore. And so we find recent
urban-police series _ last year's ``Brooklyn South,'' for instance,
and now a midseason replacement called ``Turks'' _ simply going
through the motions, with the cops racing up tenement stairs to
round up perps and pimps, or dodging the well-manicured hand of
internal affairs, or falling into bed for affairs of a less
criminal nature. And don't forget to add plenty of street-poetic
cursing. Formerly an adjective used to mean fresh and real,
``gritty'' now connotes little more than tired and cliche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turks,'' which premieres Thursday at 9 p.m., has the great
advantage of William Devane, the rubber-faced actor best remembered
from his 10-year stint on ``Knots Landing.'' With his downturned
mouth and piranha teeth, he brings the weight and ease and
distinction that a cop show like ``Brooklyn South'' sorely lacked.
He's sort of a small-screen Jack Nicholson. But even Devane, who
plays the police-sergeant father of three sons, two of whom are
cops, can't rescue ``Turks'' from the TV vacuum. By the time, in
episode 2, that Devane must talk a jittery kid out of a drug-store
hostage situation, it's clear the series is going to make no effort
at originality, content to become nothing more than a police-drama
parallel to the medical regurgitations of ``L.A. Doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago family at the center of ``Turks'' is Irish, a newish
TV gimmick that was the much-noted glue of three fall series, the
similar ``To Have and to Hold'' and ``Trinity'' as well as the
sitcom ``Costello,'' all of which have been canceled. ``Turks'' is
less offensive in its stereotyping than those other shows, although
the boys do spend a bit too much of their time at Emmit's Tavern,
doncha know. We quickly learn the undiscussed Turk family problems,
mainly that Devane's Joe Turk is married to a bitter church-going
woman who can't bear his touch. Of the two sons on the force, Mike
is the married father of one who will undoubtedly be paired with a
comely female partner at some point, and Joey is the younger
hothead who explodes when a sloppy older cop insults Joey's mother.
Both of them struggle with unfavorable comparisons to their heroic
dad. The third son, Paul, is a compulsive gambler whose part in a
heist triggers a chain of only-on-TV coincidences that put Joey
under investigation by internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Could ``Turks'' develop into something worthwhile? The signs
don't point that way, even as Devane's very presence does battle
with the mediocrity around him. The dialogue creaks from the
opening moments of the show, when a waitress delivers an obscenity
to a lewd customer with the help of some word play involving a
hockey disc. And the action scenes are clothed in painfully
familiar trappings, with crimes set in abandoned warehouses, bad
guys who seem to have acne and bad noses, and shooting that lapses
into oh-so-stylized slow-mo. It's all very . . . gritty.

<P>
   Even as their budgets and, occasionally, their aspirations have
ballooned, Broadway musicals give the impression of having grown
smaller in recent years, at least in part because of the
near-disappearance of dance from the American musical theater.
</P>
<P>
   Dance is still there, but it's either nondescript, as in
``Footloose,'' or solemnly obligatory, almost instructive, as in
``Ragtime.'' The sense of excitement and discovery has disappeared.
If you have any doubt about what has been lost or, better yet, if
you just want to have a terrifically entertaining night of Broadway
theater, then you can't afford to pass up ``Fosse,'' now at the
Broadhurst.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a very particular, epic-size musical revue. In its
consideration of the career of Bob Fosse as dancer, choreographer
and director on Broadway, in Hollywood and on television from the
late 1940s into the 1980s, it celebrates the art, high spirits and
dazzling inventiveness of a theater now known only through
revivals.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned, however. ``Fosse'' is an anthology composed mostly of
climaxes for which there are no build-ups. Some numbers are
presented in their entirety, while others are spliced into medleys
and not always easy to identify. Yet the elegant-looking production
is given cohesion by the dynamic character and the restless mind of
Fosse himself.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the pure exhilaration that comes only rarely these
days, when watching a cast of 32 talented performers dancing and
singing with an energy that, from time to time, threatens to raise
the roof.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Fosse'' looks back over approximately 40 years of dance in
theater and movies, it inevitably prompts the question: What
happened?
</P>
<P>
   It may be Jerome Robbins who forever confounded our expectations
for dance in the Broadway musical. His contributions still
astonish: think of his role in transforming ``Fancy Free,'' the
Robbins-Leonard Bernstein ballet, into ``On the Town'' (1944), of
his priceless Keystone Kops ballet for ``High Button Shoes''
(1947), of ``The Small House of Uncle Thomas'' ballet for ``The
King and I'' (1951) and of those balletic gang rumbles in ``West
Side Story'' (1957). He led us to believe that it would be the
classically trained choreographer, skilled also in modern dance,
who would bring new life and meaning to the American musical
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins was as much at home in a Broadway house as in Ballet
Theater. He brought a breadth of vision to musical shows t unique
and, by comparison, called attention to what some people saw as the
limitations of such Broadway-bred choreographers as Fosse, Michael
Bennett and Gower Champion.
</P>
<P>
   An unfair comparison, really. Robbins was not just a great
choreographer. He was a genius. He was one of a kind, without
compare. He wasn't someone next to whom anyone else can be measured
without the help of a large footstool.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographers of the stature of Fosse, Bennett and Champion
were masters of their own class of entertainment. No wonder they
became directors: Broadway was then a dancing place.
</P>
<P>
   If you have seen the work of the choreographers from ballet and
modern dance who have recently been corralled by the musical
theater, you might have noticed that there haven't been any Jerome
Robbinses among them. You might also have realized that these
recruits can be even more limited in their vision than the earlier
generation of hoofers who went on to become superlative Broadway
choreographers. (The one possible exception: Garth Fagan, the
modern dancer and choreographer whose work is integral to the
success of Julie Taymor's vision of ``The Lion King.'')
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing contemporary Broadway choreographers is not
only training but also experience. As the number of musical shows
produced each year has dwindled, and as dance has come to look like
an afterthought in the operettas that have dominated the scene, the
choreographic gene pool has all but dried up.
</P>
<P>
   No more that opportunity for Broadway gypsies to move from one
show to several others within a single season, to survive flops,
hits and road tours, to be hired and fired and to know that there
is another show casting around the corner, if not this week, then
next. No time to acquire the itch, not simply to dance well but to
create one's own idiosyncratic dance vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   If you saw Fosse's film ``All That Jazz'' (1979), a gorgeous but
self-absorbed Fellini-esque examination of the life of a director
very much like himself, you already know that he was a man given to
excess. The air he breathed was filtered through his cigarettes. He
drank too much, ate amphetamines for breakfast, loved his wife and
mistress and was faithful to neither. The film's most flamboyant
conceit: Fosse's foreseeing his own death, which was to come in
1987 when he was 60.
</P>
<P>
   Except for his fine screen version of ``Cabaret'' (1972) and
``Lenny,'' his comparatively disciplined biographical film about
Lenny Bruce, all of Fosse's movies reflect the tendency toward
excess that marked his life, though not his shows. He went a little
mad in the movie studio, like the kid who decides he is able to fly
with a parasol.
</P>
<P>
   Note ``Sweet Charity'' (1969), the first film he directed. Among
other things, the manic cross-cutting from one image to the next
and the use of gigantic real-life locations, from Lincoln Center to
Wall Street and the Brooklyn Bridge, all but swamp the adaptation
of his hit Broadway show of 1966. He effectively upstages not only
Shirley MacLaine, the star, the book by Neil Simon and the Cy
Coleman-Dorothy Fields score, but also his own distinctive
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   There is something infectiously cheeky and bold about Fosse's
movies as well as his shows. Yet his singular strength is his
choreography, which, when seen in the theater at its best, cuts to
the quick. It can make us laugh, and sometimes, without warning, as
in the final moments of ``Chicago,'' it can become unaccountably
moving. These are the gifts of the man whose work is now being
recalled on the stage of the Broadhurst.
</P>
<P>
   As a choreographer, Fosse is a satirist. He is cool, spare of
detail. At his best, he is also a brilliant caricaturist, someone
who uses a minimal number of precisely drawn lines to express the
essence of a single character, of several characters, of a whole
raft of characters, in a specific time, place and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   I remember (I hope accurately) the initial image in the Broadway
production of ``Sweet Charity'': Gwen Verdon, seen alone in
silhouette against an orange-lighted cyclorama, her weight on one
leg, her hip thrust to the other side, one arm akimbo _ a Broadway
taxi dancer waiting for a customer and waiting, maybe forever, for
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet Charity'' provides ``Fosse'' with two of the show's most
elegant sequences: the marvelously comic ``Rich Man's Frug,'' in
which Manhattan nobs, as ferret-faced as Maurice Sendak characters,
sweep around a nightclub as if untroubled even by gravity (as
choreographed by Fosse, the dancers appear to float), and ``Big
Spender,'' wherein Charity's taxi-dancer pals stand at the bar and
face the audience, alternately wheedling and intimidating their
would-be customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other memorable numbers recalled: ``Steam Heat''
from ``The Pajama Game'' (1954), ``Mr. Bojangles'' from ``Dancin'
'' (1978), ``Take Off With Us _ Three Pas de Deux'' from ``All That
Jazz,'' in which three nearly nude couples, one heterosexual, one
homosexual and one lesbian, make love, going as far as a standard
modern balletic vocabulary allows, and the foot-stomping grand
finale, ``Sing, Sing, Sing,'' also from ``Dancin'.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   My favorite: a sly, spirited take on the old standard ``Me and
My Shadow'' from Fosse's last show, ``Big Deal'' (1986), in which
Eugene Fleming, Kim Morgan Greene and Dana Moore add a sexual
dimension to the song so languidly and sentimentally sung by Ted
Lewis from the 1920s into the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat less effective, in part because they can be seen in
context next door at the Shubert Theater where ``Chicago'' is
playing: Fred Ebb and John Kander's ``Razzle Dazzle'' and
``Nowadays.'' ``Shoeless Joe From Hannibal, Mo.,'' from ``Damn
Yankees'' (1955), also isn't helped by the fact that the number was
better done in the 1995 Broadway revival, choreographed by Rob
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Maltby Jr. is the director responsible for coordinating
the many talents involved, including Gwen Verdon, Fosse's widow,
the show's artistic adviser, and Ann Reinking, Fosse's companion,
who is the co-director and (with Fosse) co-choreographer. Note that
the spiffy production was initiated and is being presented by
Livent Inc., the bankrupt Canadian company (which is also
presenting ``Ragtime''), founded by the besieged, deposed
entrepreneur Garth Drabinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Note also two other expert performers who help to make this
enterprise work: Valarie Pettiford, who is both an accomplished
Fosse dancer and a singer to shake the rafters, and that superb
dancer Scott Wise, who also sings the elegant though abbreviated
``Razzle Dazzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing so much of Fosse's extraordinary work, in such a
condensed form, also provides clues as to the identity of those who
may have influenced him. Fosse himself acknowledged his debt to
Jack Cole, the Broadway and Hollywood choreographer sometimes
credited for having created ``jazz dancing.'' ``Fosse'' also brings
to mind Charlie Chaplin, an association I had never noticed before.
If Charlie Chaplin had been a choreographer, he might have created
dances like Fosse's.
</P>
<P>
   The resemblance is remarked on not because of Fosse's fondness
for derby hats and gloves. Rather, it's because the singular
fashion in which Fosse uses the dancer's body, at rest and in
motion, so frequently evokes Chaplin mannerisms, everything from
the way the Tramp walks and stands to the way he controls his
hands, even his elbows.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference: Chaplin depends on close-ups of the Tramp's
face to verify what has already been made clear. Fosse appreciates
the full figure. The costumes he favors for his dancers, including
black leotards, have a way of deflecting attention from individual
features to allow movement to become the principal expression of
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fosse,'' you should understand, is a rich, bewitching show. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Art,'' Yasmina Reza's superbly funny French play, is clearly a
theatrical phenomenon both in this country, where it is being seen
in Christopher Hampton's English translation, and abroad, where it
is playing _ or has played _ in more than 40 countries. It seems to
be unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   At the Royale Theater in New York, Judd Hirsch, Joe Morton and
George Wendt have replaced the English cast, which earlier replaced
Alan Alda, Victor Garber and Alfred Molina, who opened the show at
the Royale last March. That company has just opened at the Ahmanson
Theater in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Another company is at the Royal George in Chicago. London, where
the play opened in 1996, is on its ninth company. Meanwhile,
``Art'' continues in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other places it has been seen: India, Peru, Belarus,
Japan and Serbia. Remember, this is a comedy about three Frenchmen,
members of the bourgeoisie, whose longtime friendship is about to
dissolve in acrimony over the acquisition by one of the friends of
a white-on-white painting. Does wit suddenly sell like kung-fu
movies? In some places, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   A return visit to the Royale to see the new cast confirms my
original reaction: ``Art,'' directed in New York as well as in
London by Matthew Warchus, is an exceptionally wise and
sophisticated work. It succeeds in being stylishly contemporary
without ever dropping brand-names or references to any celebrity
born after Seneca. Further, it is a play that seems to fit with
ease any number of good if quite different actors.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt, who is still best remembered as Norm in the long-running
sitcom ``Cheers,'' easily slips his large frame into the role of
Yvan. It's a part actors might die for: the harried friend who
helps precipitate the crisis by becoming engaged and rebelling
against his position as the comedy relief for the two other men.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch is furiously, seriously comic as Marc, the full-time
control freak. Morton is splendidly condescending as Serge, the
divorced doctor who embarks on a life as a collector by buying the
painting for a price his pals find ludicrous, 200,000 francs, or
approximately $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art'' is a delight in the economy of its construction. Running
90 minutes and played without an intermission, it never seems to
hurry but, by the time it ends, a friendship has been analyzed in
the kind of minute psychological detail you are more likely to find
in a well-written short story or novel. ``Art'' breathes as if it
had a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   There is something mysterious about writing so firm and true: it
is infinitely adaptable. After watching each of the three casts I
have seen play it, I have been convinced that no one else did it
better, or even quite the same.

THAT AGE THING 
TRIXIE HELPS OUT 
A LOSING BET
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you question someone who asks questions for a living,
choose your words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   After a talk Jan. 14 by LESLEY STAHL, a correspondent on the CBS
News magazine ``60 Minutes'' and the author of the just-published
autobiography ``Reporting Live'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), a woman in the
audience at the National Press Club in Washington tried to ask a
question about television's reputation for pushing women aside as
they age. Fumbling for words, she said something about, ``Now that
you're in your golden years. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd gasped and giggled. Ms. Stahl, 57, smiled. ``I can't
say the word that's come to mind,'' she said, apparently referring
to her questioner, ``but it _ in the words of Barbara Bush _ it
rhymes with witch.''
</P>
<P>
   There was laughter as Ms. Stahl said, ``Go ahead, go ahead, tit
for tat, tit for tat.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she mentioned several other women who have had long careers
in television news, including BARBARA WALTERS, DIANE SAWYER and
CONNIE CHUNG.
</P>
<P>
   A little while later, Ms. Stahl apologized, saying that she had
intended the remark to be funny but she feared that it had not come
across that way. She also invited the woman to come up to the
platform and shake her hand.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that she misquoted Mrs. Bush, whose 1984 remark
about GERALDINE A. FERRARO was, ``I can't say it, but it rhymes
with rich.'' Later Mrs. Bush said the word she had had in mind was
``witch.'' (Ms. Stahl, whose office said she was traveling Tuesday,
did not return a call for comment.)
</P>
<P>
   TRIXIE HELPS OUT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the speedy one,'' said the actress JOYCE RANDOLPH, who
played Trixie on ``The Honeymooners'' in the 1950s. Now, wearing
comfortable shoes and a fur coat, she was talking about a friend,
the restaurateur JEAN-CLAUDE BAKER.
</P>
<P>
   He had recruited her for an unusual assignment: walk at a
leisurely pace from his restaurant, Chez Josephine, on West 42nd
Street near Ninth Avenue, to every theater in the neighborhood.
Baker would walk at a faster pace. Both had stopwatches to see how
long each trip took.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to quiet theatergoing customers who worry about how
long they can stay at Baker's restaurant without being late for a
performance. He was tired of having customers worry that they were
lollygagging over the lobster cassoulet.
</P>
<P>
   Synchronizing stopwatches, he and Ms. Randolph set out.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at the Westside Theater, a block away at 407 W. 43rd
St., in 1 minute 59 seconds. She arrived in 3 minutes 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   They walked back to the restaurant and headed for the theater
where ``The Lion King'' is playing, the New Amsterdam, at 214 W.
42nd St. near Seventh Avenue. Baker recorded his time as 6 minutes
35 seconds, Ms. Randolph's as 9 minutes 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   As they left for the next destination, the Nederlander Theater
on West 41st Street, where ``Rent'' is playing, Baker seemed
pleased. ``People behave like children, panicking at 7:15, when we
all know you have 50 minutes because the show will never start
before 5 minutes past,'' he said.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A LOSING BET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, NINA TOTENBERG, a correspondent for National Public
Radio, made a bet on the air. She bet two broadcast-booth
colleagues, NEAL CONAN and DANIEL SCHORR, $1 each that President
Clinton's lawyers would forgo their scheduled Tuesday presentation
at the impeachment trial to avoid competing with the State of the
Union Message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost, right?'' Ms. Totenberg said by telephone Tuesday,
having all but forgotten the wager.
</P>
<P>
   Did it prove anything?
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves that when you've been covering the same story for
months and been live on the air for in one case 15 hours straight
filling as much as an hour and a half at a time,'' she said,
``you'll say almost anything.''  &QL;

 &HT;    POTATO CHIPS DEVOTED TO THE POPE AND OTHER VENTURES STIR DEBATE
IN MEXICO
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins 600 words.
 &HT;    With POPE-SKED-0121.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ With all due respect, John Paul II is fast
becoming known here as the Potato Pope.
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-holy nickname is derived from a debate that's broken
out in Mexico over the unusual level of marketing to promote Pope
John Paul II's fourth visit to Mexico, which begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To help finance or publicize the pope's tour, Catholic officials
in Mexico approached Sabritas, a popular Mexican potato chip
company, and about two dozen other corporations seeking donations.
</P>
<P>
   Sabritas, a division of the U.S.-based Frito-Lay -- a subsidiary
of PepsiCo -- took up the clergy's invitation by churning out
special commemorative bags of chips wrapped in a yellow ribbon
emblazoned with the Vatican's coat of arms.
</P>
<P>
   Inside each bag, buried among the salty fare, is a tiny
photograph of the pope or one of nine other religious figures
revered by Mexicans. Sabritas is also selling a separate
card-holder for two pesos -- about 20 cents -- so that the faithful
can collect all 10 photographs and display them.
</P>
<P>
   Not lost on Mexicans is the fact that, in Spanish, the word
``papa'' means both pope and potato.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's purely coincidental,'' said Tod MacKenzie(CQ both), a
spokesman for Frito-Lay in Plano, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie said the chips, which have the full blessing of the
Catholic church, are selling well at three pesos a bag (about 25
cents) despite media reports here that some Mexicans think the
pope's visit has been over-commercialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The archdiocese (in Mexico City) approached Sabritas and a
number of other companies and asked them to help spread the word,''
MacKenzie said. ``They were looking for non-traditional ways to
reach Mexicans in every corner of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabritas, he said, was ``frankly, quite honored to be approached
for such a worthy cause.'' With 90 million photographs inside the
bags and some 400,000 Sabritas distribution points around Mexico,
MacKenzie said, the church will be able to reach ``an awful lot of
the faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $200,000 in profits from the sales of the
card-holders will be donated to the Pilgrim Aid Foundation, a fund
for the construction of a house to host pilgrims visiting Mexico
City's famed Our Lady of Guadalupe Basilica.
</P>
<P>
   One of those pilgrims who was visiting the Basilica this week,
however, said she didn't really appreciate the potato chips
dedicated to the pope, who has frequently spoken out against
materialism and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have distributed those photos for free, without
putting them inside bags of chips, couldn't they?'' said Teresa
Duran of Ciudad Juarez, a city on the Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   A cartoon in the Mexico City newspaper La Jornada lampooned such
business ventures celebrating the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many commercial messages, will I have time for the
divine word?'' the pope wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Cardinal Norberto Rivera, speaking to Mexico City's
Reforma newspaper, defended the potato chips venture and other
corporate publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an era of publicity, and we are men of this era,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other corporations contributing services or money
include Mexicana Airlines, which will fly the pope to St. Louis,
Mo., and Hewlett Packard, which contributed high-tech know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi, the soft drink giant, has erected a number of huge
billboards in Mexico City promoting the pope's visit and declaring,
``Mexico, Always Faithful,'' a slogan with the same hip ring of the
``Pepsi Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Azteca television station, which promises saturation
coverage of the pope, has been running commercials designed to stir
faith -- and, some people say, attract viewers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the commercials features a fictional truck driver who
becomes incensed when a tire blows out during a rain storm. He
slams the door of his truck so hard his rosary beads fall from his
rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   A hand in vestments calmly retrieves the rosary beads, a
ubiquitous decoration in Mexican vehicles. The camera cuts to the
back of a bent, almost ghostly figure that's obviously supposed to
be the pope walking along the road.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion poll of 400 Mexico City residents conducted by
Reforma found that among those who had seen the commercials 63
percent thought they were publicity for the station while only 25
percent thought they were a ``spiritual message.''
</P>
<P>
   But the same poll found that 50 percent of Mexico City residents
believed that the commercialization of the pope's image would be
``positive'' for the promotion of Catholicism in Mexico. Only 37
percent said the marketing would have a negative impact.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City resident Florentina Caudillo, 76, a devout Catholic
who was also at the Basilica is among those who are not offended by
the marketing flurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the way businesses want to express their faith,
that's OK with me,'' she said.

DON'T BE TOO SURE OF A `MARRED' LEGACY FOR CLINTON -- THE
UN-REAGAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)  
 &HT;    
 By JIM CASTELLI  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The conventional wisdom -- the consensus among politicians and
media personalities -- has been consistently wrong about the
scandal surrounding President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
 &HT;    Those who create such ``wisdom'' have been more concerned with
what they want to happen, or what they think is supposed to happen,
rather than what is actually happening.
 &HT;    That's more than enough reason to question the confident
statements that Bill Clinton has been weakened anddisgraced and his
legacy permanently marred.
 &HT;    Put another way, there is reason to believe that Clinton has, in
fact, been strengthened by the scandal and that his legacy will be
far more positive than anyone now imagines.
 &HT;    To be sure, future historians are hardly likely to talk about
Clinton without referring to his impeachment following a full year
of headlines about a sexual scandal. But that won't be the whole
story.
 &HT;    Andrew Johnson was impeached, but historians now generally agree
that his impeachment was highly partisan and that it was Congress,
not Johnson, who was disgraced.
 &HT;    Historians also generally agree that Richard Nixon would have
been impeached and convicted over Watergate-related offenses, and
would have deserved to be, if he had not resigned.
 &HT;    But Nixon's legacy is far bigger than Watergate. His conduct of
the Vietnam War, detente with the Soviet Union, opening of
relations with Communist China, and his domestic policies -- many
of which would be regarded as dismayingly liberal by today's House
Republicans -- are also part of a very mixed legacy.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton was impeached on virtually a straight party-line
vote in the House, but no one beyond a handful of anti-Clinton true
believers think that the Senate trial will result in conviction. At
worst Clinton will receive a censure, at best (for him), nothing
more than impeachment by the House. If Clinton is still president
when all this is over, he will have won.
 &HT;    The notion that he has been weakened by the scandal ignores
public opinion, which has been consistent and resistant for a year.
The more Republicans attack Clinton, the more the public thinks
positively of Clinton and negatively of the Republicans.
 &HT;    In polls taken after Tuesday's State of the Union address,
anywhere from 66 percent to 76 percent of Americans approved of
Clinton's job performance -- three times the approval rating Nixon
had when he resigned. The president is the most admired man in
America and his wife the most admired woman.
 &HT;    Clinton's party is fresh from a surprisingly strong showing in
the mid-term elections, and while the Republicans still control
Congress, Clinton is within reach of what Nixon used to callan
ideological majority. The Republicans have already lost two
speakers of the House over the Lewinsky affair, and the Republican
Party has its lowest approval rating in a generation.
 &HT;    The claims that the public won't trust Clinton on other issues
because he lied about Lewinsky don't hold up. Even amid all the
references to ``Wag the Dog,'' the public overwhelmingly believed
that Clinton ordered the bombing of Iraq for the right reasons, not
as a distraction from impeachment.
 &HT;    The public doesn't believe Clinton when he talks about things
they don't want to hear about, but they trust him when it comes to
doing his job.
 &HT;    The public also seems to trust Clinton and the Democrats more
than the Republicans on the issues likely to occupy Congress for
the next two years -- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs and
education.
 &HT;    And that is the irony behind the likelihood that Clinton's
legacy will be positive: Because of Bill Clinton, the American
people once again want government to work for them.
 &HT;    Clinton is the un-Reagan. Ronald Reagan spent eight years in
office downgrading government. He left the sense that government
shouldn't try to do anything, and he left a gigantic deficit that
made it almost impossible to think about government doing anything
new.
 &HT;    George Bush was somewhat less opposed than Reagan to government
trying to do things for people, but he lamented in his Inaugural
Address that America had more will than wallet.He never tried to
find either will or wallet, and the result -- in the face of a
recession -- was a feeling of national despair and 62 percent of
voters throwing Bush out of office.
 &HT;    Clinton came in arguing that there was nothing wrong with
America that couldn't be fixed by what's right with America.He
believed, in effect, that America could find both will and wallet;
he balanced the federal budget while adding new social programs.
 &HT;    Clinton's push for one big program -- a massive health-care
reform -- failed, but he has made major changes in America through
dozens of smaller changes.
 &HT;    Today, people can't lose health insurance because they change
jobs or have pre-existing conditions, and millions more children
have access to health care. Clinton has succeeded in his goal of
making two years of college or technical school affordable for
virtually every American. The controversial welfare reform bill he
signed has -- so far, at least -- moved people from welfare to work
without forcing people into the streets.
 &HT;    Clinton made it intellectually and financially possible, even
desirable, for Americans to once again look to government to do
good things for people. That's why so many conservatives loathe
him. But it's a heck of a legacy.

   MEXICO CITY _ With all due respect, John Paul II is fast
becoming known here as the Potato Pope.
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-holy nickname is derived from a debate that's broken
out in Mexico over the unusual level of marketing to promote Pope
John Paul II's fourth visit to Mexico, which begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To help finance or publicize the pope's tour, Catholic officials
in Mexico approached Sabritas, a popular Mexican potato chip
company, and about two dozen other corporations seeking donations.
</P>
<P>
   Sabritas, a division of the U.S.-based Frito-Lay -- a subsidiary
of PepsiCo -- took up the clergy's invitation by churning out
special commemorative bags of chips wrapped in a yellow ribbon
emblazoned with the Vatican's coat of arms.
</P>
<P>
   Inside each bag, buried among the salty fare, is a tiny
photograph of the pope or one of nine other religious figures
revered by Mexicans. Sabritas is also selling a separate
card-holder for two pesos -- about 20 cents -- so that the faithful
can collect all 10 photographs and display them.
</P>
<P>
   Not lost on Mexicans is the fact that, in Spanish, the word
``papa'' means both pope and potato.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's purely coincidental,'' said Tod MacKenzie(CQ both), a
spokesman for Frito-Lay in Plano, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie said the chips, which have the full blessing of the
Catholic church, are selling well at three pesos a bag (about 25
cents) despite media reports here that some Mexicans think the
pope's visit has been over-commercialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The archdiocese (in Mexico City) approached Sabritas and a
number of other companies and asked them to help spread the word,''
MacKenzie said. ``They were looking for non-traditional ways to
reach Mexicans in every corner of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabritas, he said, was ``frankly, quite honored to be approached
for such a worthy cause.'' With 90 million photographs inside the
bags and some 400,000 Sabritas distribution points around Mexico,
MacKenzie said, the church will be able to reach ``an awful lot of
the faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $200,000 in profits from the sales of the
card-holders will be donated to the Pilgrim Aid Foundation, a fund
for the construction of a house to host pilgrims visiting Mexico
City's famed Our Lady of Guadalupe Basilica.
</P>
<P>
   One of those pilgrims who was visiting the Basilica this week,
however, said she didn't really appreciate the potato chips
dedicated to the pope, who has frequently spoken out against
materialism and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have distributed those photos for free, without
putting them inside bags of chips, couldn't they?'' said Teresa
Duran of Ciudad Juarez, a city on the Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   A cartoon in the Mexico City newspaper La Jornada lampooned such
business ventures celebrating the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many commercial messages, will I have time for the
divine word?'' the pope wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Cardinal Norberto Rivera, speaking to Mexico City's
Reforma newspaper, defended the potato chips venture and other
corporate publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an era of publicity, and we are men of this era,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other corporations contributing services or money
include Mexicana Airlines, which will fly the pope to St. Louis,
Mo., and Hewlett Packard, which contributed high-tech know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi, the soft drink giant, has erected a number of huge
billboards in Mexico City promoting the pope's visit and declaring,
``Mexico, Always Faithful,'' a slogan with the same hip ring of the
``Pepsi Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Azteca television station, which promises saturation
coverage of the pope, has been running commercials designed to stir
faith -- and, some people say, attract viewers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the commercials features a fictional truck driver who
becomes incensed when a tire blows out during a rain storm. He
slams the door of his truck so hard his rosary beads fall from his
rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   A hand in vestments calmly retrieves the rosary beads, a
ubiquitous decoration in Mexican vehicles. The camera cuts to the
back of a bent, almost ghostly figure that's obviously supposed to
be the pope walking along the road.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion poll of 400 Mexico City residents conducted by
Reforma found that among those who had seen the commercials 63
percent thought they were publicity for the station while only 25
percent thought they were a ``spiritual message.''
</P>
<P>
   But the same poll found that 50 percent of Mexico City residents
believed that the commercialization of the pope's image would be
``positive'' for the promotion of Catholicism in Mexico. Only 37
percent said the marketing would have a negative impact.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City resident Florentina Caudillo, 76, a devout Catholic
who was also at the Basilica is among those who are not offended by
the marketing flurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the way businesses want to express their faith,
that's OK with me,'' she said.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``At First Sight'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Val Kilmer, Mira Sorvino.
</P>
<P>
   Val Kilmer plays a blind man who regains his sight. But this
fact-based drama, loosely based on a metro Atlanta couple, never
finds its focus. Mira Sorvino plays Kilmer's new love, but the
chemistry between the stars is as bleak and gray as the wintry
setting.2 hours, 8 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-legged wonder. The newest computer-animated feature from
the makers of ``Toy Story'' is the eye-popping, witty tale of an
ant named Flik (voice of Dave Foley), who recruits a bunch of
circus bugs to battle evil grasshoppers (the chief villain is
voiced by Kevin Spacey). There's enough going on here to keep every
adult, child or arachnid vastly entertained. 1 hour, 34 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' PG-13 (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a true story, this legal thriller stars John Travolta
as a small-time personal injury lawyer who tackles two giant
corporations whose careless waste management caused leukemia in a
dozen kids. Robert Duvall is his cagey opponent. Travolta is
miscast and the movie can't quite decide what its focus is. Still,
it more than makes its case with intelligence and old-fashioned
Hollywood ``let us entertain you'' craft. 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Jesse'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by Tim Kirkman.
</P>
<P>
   Gay North Carolina native Tim Kirkman wanders his home state
pondering how he and Sen. Jesse Helms could have grown up in the
same small town, but turned out so differently. It's a gentle, warm
and amusing documentary that captures some of the flavor of a New
South torn between progress and tradition. One hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' PG-13 (profanity, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alfre Woodard and Al Freeman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This warm, funny, utterly engaging family film insists you can
go home again, even if you've never been there before. Alfre
Woodard stars as a messed-up Chicago single mom with two kids. Her
own mother (Mary Alice) ships her south to Mississipppi to stay
with her uncle (Al Freeman Jr.) and try to get her life straight. 1
hour, 41 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Cate Blanchett gives a luminous portrayal, and
Geoffrey Rush gives her sturdy support as court politics and
intrigues swirl about. This is a really good story. Of a girl
becoming a woman, of a woman becoming a queen. 2 hours, 4 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling paranoia plot devices from other movies (``The
Conversation,'' ``Three Days of the Condor''), Tony Scott's lively
thriller keeps Will Smith and Gene Hackman on the run from big
government bad guys. A sharp cast and slick production compensate
for the movie's occasional lapses in logic. 2 hours, 7 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.''44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Faculty'' R (profanity, violence, gore, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elijah Wood, Jon Stewart and Bebe Neuwirth.
</P>
<P>
   Although most high school students might compare their teachers
to aliens, at Herrington High they really are. In this flimsy and
unoriginal but fun monster-thriller, the students band together to
fight their fate when they discover that their teachers, including
the football coach (Robert Patrick) and the principal (Bebe
Neuwirth), want to turn them into computer-generated creepies. (Cox
News Service) 1 hour, 50 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ghosts of Dickens' Past'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christopher Heyerdahl
</P>
<P>
   In this earnest but dull family film, the young Charles Dickens
(Christopher Heyerdahl) recounts a ghostly encounter with a young
girl w2ho inspired ``A Christmas Carol.'' It's well intended, but
it drains the magic out of the Christmas classic. 1 hour, 30
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' Not rated but contains sexual themes and
brief nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant re-imagining of the final days of gay British
director James Whale. Whale, best known for his classic horror
movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died mysteriously in 1957. Ian
McKellen is marvelous as a recluse who becomes interested in the
new gardener (Brendan Fraser). There's excellent work all around,
but McKellen is the movie's gnawing, unsettling center. 1 hour, 35
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilary and Jackie'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   Never quite hitting its intended crescendo, this real-life
psychological drama about the relationship between two musical
sisters still strikes some major chords. Emily Watson (``Breaking
the Waves'') stars as Jacqueline du Pre, a world-famous cellist who
died in 1987 of multiple sclerosis. Rachel Griffiths plays her
sister, Hilary, who swapped a career for cozy domesticity. 2 hours.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurlyburly'' R (profanity, violence and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright Penn and Meg
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   A terrific acting ensemble, a terrible script. Sean Penn and
Kevin Spacey are the unstable center _ casting partners and condo
roomies _ around whom circle hangers-on (Chazz Palminteri, Garry
Shandling) and disposable women (Meg Ryan, Robin Wright Penn). Set
in 1980s Hollywood, the movie is about things like sex, drugs,
misogyny and maleness. It's actually a saga in free-fall that ends
up in a talky, coked-up tailspin. 2 hours, 2 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``In Dreams'' R (violence and disturbing themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be called ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' meets ``The
Eyes of Laura Mars,'' a psychic woman (Annette Bening) is harassed
in her dreams by a child-murdering pyscho. For at least an hour,
the movie is truly eerie and disturbing, but an overly long
encounter between Bening and the madman proves damaging.1 hour, 40
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of a
concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. It certainly takes a certain courage to put
a life-affirming spin on Hitler's Final Solution, but Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrongheaded. In Italian with English subtitles. 2
hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' R (profanity, brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine.
</P>
<P>
   British actress Jane Horrocks, who can belt out tone-perfect
impersonations of everyone from Judy Garland to Shirley Bassey, is
pretty much the whole show here. The rest of the film, alas, is a
fairly feeble show-biz fable in which her blowzy mom (Brenda
Blethyn) and a seedy agent (Michael Caine) try to get this shy
recluse on stage. See it for Horrocks; check out the concession
stand in between her numbers.1 hour, 30 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' PG-13 (profanity, crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a renegade med student who believes the
rigid rules of health care could use a few laughs. It's ``Dead
Poets Society'' with lab coats. The laughs are good, but when it
tries to get serious (often), the flick is as deep as a bedpan. 1
hour, 56 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' PG (violence, intense themes)
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular animated musical epic that retells _ with some
embellishments _ the Book of Exodus. Val Kilmer is the voice of
Moses, God's choice to lead the Hebrew people from slavery in
Egypt. Ralph Fiennes speaks for the Pharaoh, Moses' ``adopted''
brother. Other talent includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and
a host of animators. The movie is visually impressive, insistently
reverential. 1 hour, 39 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of E.G. Daily and Christine Cavanaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rugrats hit the big screen with a big issue: making way for
a new baby. The film version of the TV hit is amiable, if frenetic,
aimed at kids who need to be stimulated every few seconds. 1 hour,
19 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, overworked Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish
his play ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win
the hand of noblewoman Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) in this witty comedy
that uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot devices. The
script's cleverness can sometimes get in the way of genuine
feeling, but its ambition is refreshing. 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Anything but simple, this is a character-driven black comedy
with some powerful moral-qualm undercurrents. In the deep snows of
rural Minnesota, two brothers (Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton) and
a pal (Brent Briscoe) find a downed plane with $4 million in cash.
Their ``simple plan'' to split the money leads to a chain of
increasingly disastrous events. 1 hour, 57 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' PG-13 (profanity, adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts play competing moms _ one
biological, the other step _ in this comedy/weepie that tackles
some complex ``blended family'' issues, then cops out by giving a
character a fatal disease. Still, the sturdy cast does much to
redeem the mush-headed script (add Ed Harris in the dishonest role
of doting dad who somehow never sees his kids). 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Theory of Flight'' R (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't soar as it could, but the two leads keep it aloft with
their marvelous acting. Kenneth Branagh is an
artist/dreamer/inventor whose shenanigans earn him 120 hours of
community service. Specifically, caring for a cantankerous young
woman (Helena Bonham Carter) with Lou Gehrig's disease. Lots of
'60s whimsy and symbolism here, but the stars' expertise is enough
to make the pluses outweigh the minuses.1 hour, 38 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   The Thin Red Line'' R (profanity and war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson
and Adrien Brody.
</P>
<P>
   Less a war movie than a meditation on life, death, love, hate,
man and nature. Terrence Malick puts his unmistakable stamp on the
drama of an Army division's struggle to capture Guadalcanal from
the Japanese during World War II. Fueled with voice-overs, gorgeous
images and sudden violence, it's superbly strange, an epic that
feels intimate but distant at the same time. 2 hours, 50 minutes.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The new IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a
fictional story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a
budding teenage paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her
dino-hunting dad (Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be
a dinosaur egg into his lab, Ally, alone with it, accidentally
cracks it and is thrust back in time 65 million years, when the big
beasts roamed the earth.40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Varsity Blues'' R (profanity, sexuality, nudity, substance
abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Van Der Beek and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   James Van Der Beek plays a high school football player in this
insulting mix of beery teenage humor and rampant sexuality.1 hour,
40 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' PG (sexual themes, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Bannen and David Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   A broad, twinkly Irish comedy about what happens in a tiny
village when it's discovered that one of the residents is the
holder of a lottery ticket worth nearly $7 million. The movie is a
little too eager to please, a little too Lucky Charms Irish. But
the two leads, devilish old-pro codgers Ian Bannen and David Kelly,
are practiced charmers, and there are lots of winning little
moments along the way. 1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' PG-13 (comic violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler and Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   A watered-down comedy. After a successful stab at romantic
comedy in ``The Wedding Singer,'' Adam Sandler returns to his
lowbrow roots with this ``Happy Gilmore'' rewrite about a bayou
bumpkin who becomes a college football star. It's dumb and
predictable, which would be OK if there were more laughs. But Kathy
Bates is hilarious as Sandler's domineering mama. 1 hour, 26
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   This Internet-era update of ``The Shop Around the Corner'' stars
Tom Hanks as a book-chain magnate and Meg Ryan as the small-store
owner he's putting out of business. Little do they know that
they're each other's e-mail sweethearts. ``Sleepless in Seattle''
director Nora Ephron gets the charm working again in a remake that
delivers. 2 hours. B
</P>

   Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray and Doug Hamilton write for the

   BELLSOUTH _ As a result of the recent currency devaluation in
Brazil, BellSouth Corporation (NYSE: BLS) said today that it
expects to record a foreign exchange impact on earnings for the
first quarter of 1999. The amount is yet to be determined, but
based on the floating rate of the Brazilian real as of Jan. 19 and
BellSouth's share of the US dollar debt of its Brazilian
investments of about $1 billion, it would be approximately $172
million, or 9 cents per share. (Kanell, Atlanta

   GM-EARNINGS _ General Motors Corp.'s strong performance in North
America overcame the effects of last summer's strikes and weak
results overseas to generate a record fourth-quarter profit of $1.8
billion, up 8 percent from the same period a year ago. The world's
largest automaker reported today that it earned $2.61 a fully
diluted share, compared with $1.7 billion, or $2.33 a share, in the
last three months of 1997. (Wagner, Dayton Daily News). 12.

<P>
   NCR-EARNINGS _ NCR Corp. exceeded analysts expectations by

The Dayton-based computer equipment and services company said it

quarter, compared with $36 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in
the comparable period last year. (Dayton Daily News). 10-12.

   BELLSOUTH _ As a result of the recent currency devaluation in
Brazil, BellSouth Corporation (NYSE: BLS) said today that it
expects to record a foreign exchange impact on earnings for the
first quarter of 1999. The amount is yet to be determined, but
based on the floating rate of the Brazilian real as of Jan. 19 and
BellSouth's share of the US dollar debt of its Brazilian
investments of about $1 billion, it would be approximately $172
million, or 9 cents per share. (Kanell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   GM-EARNINGS _ General Motors Corp.'s strong performance in North
America overcame the effects of last summer's strikes and weak
results overseas to generate a record fourth-quarter profit of $1.8
billion, up 8 percent from the same period a year ago. The world's
largest automaker reported today that it earned $2.61 a fully
diluted share, compared with $1.7 billion, or $2.33 a share, in the
last three months of 1997. (Wagner, Dayton Daily News). 12.
</P>
<P>
   NCR-EARNINGS _ NCR Corp. exceeded analysts expectations by
posting strong fourth-quarter and full-years earnings Wednesday.
The Dayton-based computer equipment and services company said it
earned $49 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, during the fourth
quarter, compared with $36 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in
the comparable period last year. (Dayton Daily News). 10-12.

CITY OF PAIN IS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE NEED HELP TO LEAVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
By c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a perfect world, we would all live in a suburb of
Contentment, in the city of Happiness, but this is not a perfect
world.
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of Happiness, in the valley of The Shadow of
Death, lies another city. A dark city where the sun genuflects to
the cool, pale rays of the moon. It is a colorless place filled
with colorless people wearing blinders and struggling to pull huge
carriages filled with troubles, heartache, and pain. No one is
actually from this city. No one should be there for long.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the residents of this city don't even know where they
are or precisely how they came to be there. Lost inside their own
skins, they vainly search to find themselves, to find a way out.
Far too many residents of this eerie place drown in a bottomless
lake of tears near its center. That in itself is remarkable when
one considers that in this city, Depression it is called, everyone
cries alone.
</P>
<P>
   I have been to this city.
</P>
<P>
   I have been there with friends and relatives for a few days as
we mourned the death of a loved one. I have been there alone for
days that became weeks when geographical isolation and my personal
insulation deceived me into thinking that joy was meant to be
shared, while sadness was meant to be hidden behind a smile that
never reached my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me when I tell you, this place is very bad. If you have
not been there, don't be so harsh in your judgment of those who
reside there. They would gladly leave, if they only knew how. The
city of Depression is easy to find, but it's so hard to leave. I
wish I knew why.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly nothing appealing about Depression. The food
is tough and tasteless. The air is always cold and heavy. Sounds
are muted, and a loving touch often feels like a jab from a boxer's
glove. It's a strange, awful place. Yet people often remain there
for years. Some even build mansions where they store their payload
of disappointment and guard it zealously with insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the No. 1.MDNM/ cause of suicide is untreated depression.
There are more than 30,000 suicide.MDBR/s.MDNM/ .MDNM/nationally
every year. In Texas in 1995, in the 25.MDBR/ to .MDNM/44 .MDNM/age
group, there were more suicides than homicides, according to the
National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.
</P>
<P>
   So you might be thinking, ``What do all these people have to be
so sad about? They've got jobs, families, and food on the table.
They just need to deal with it and move on.'' Well, as.MDNM/ the
saying goes, your blues ain't like mine. We all react differently
to the various stresses of life. Some people need a little help to
``deal with it.'' Help might be in the form of a physician, a
counselor, or a good friend with a big shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Asking for help is not a sign of weakness. When you've lost your
way and have stumbled into Depression, you need some guidance, like
a map. Once you're back in familiar territory, you can store the
map or discard it completely. But you've got to get out of there as
quickly as possible. The longer you stay, the worse it gets.
</P>
<P>
   My plea is to the millions of people who suffer from depression;
if only one of them heeds my advice, my plea is not in vain. Get
help. You can feel better. Believe me. I know.
</P>
<P>
   I have been to this city.

<P>
   ``Everyday Tao''
</P>
<P>
   By Deng Ming-Dao
</P>
<P>
   HarperSanFrancisco/$15
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who follow Tao learn an inner direction in their lives.
They accept who they are, and they ascertain and then accept the
details of their lives. They take advantage of who they are and do
not try to be someone they are not. They accept that they were
born, they accept that they will die, and they take the distance
traveled between those two points as their personal path.''
</P>
<P>
   Deng Ming-Dao writes not another translation or academic's
reflection on classical works, but a clear, down-to-earth guide
toward gaining spiritual awareness for our day-to-day journey.
Everyday Tao examines the Chinese word/picture in its most
primitive style (the Small Seal Script), a language in which a
picture is truly worth many words. Each ideogram provides the
starting point for a Taoist lesson on nurturing an intimate
relationship with nature, others and ourselves. Fundamental Taoist
thought is delivered in savory bite-size pieces; easy to digest,
deliciously sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   Deng Ming-Dao, author of ``365 Tao: Daily Meditations,
Chronicles of Tao: The Secret Life of a Taoist Master'' and
``Scholar Warrior: An Introduction to the Tao in Everyday Life,''
has shown, once again, that rare ability to convey core principles
in universal context (without scaring off the novice).

   ``Songs From the Heart''
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Adams
</P>
<P>
   Verity Records
</P>
<P>
   Along with Kirk Franklin, Yolanda Adams is of one Texas' most
successful gospel artists, having earned several Grammy nominations
and also Top 5 spots for several releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs From the Heart,'' which has ascended to the Top 10 on
the national gospel charts, is another worthy release from the
Houstonian, chock-full of good songs and the woman's amazing
vocals. Adams is probably gospel's Whitney Houston, in that she
specializes in big, soaring ballads that display those vocal
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, though, one can't help but be a tad
disappointed by ``Heart.'' The songs (by a variety of writers;
Adams co-wrote three) are good, and the trips into traditional
gospel _ such as ``Lord, I Want to Be a Christian'' and a
three-song ``Jesus Medley'' _ are well-chosen and well-arranged.
</P>
<P>
   But there are, quite simply, too many slow ballads here, and
several of the songs (including the medley) are sweetened too much
by unneeded string arrangements. It's a relief when she dips into
gently funky stuff such as ``God Will Take Care of You,'' but she
never quite does that enough. Adams has an enormous amount of
talent, but now and then ``Heart'' is just too gauzy and mellow for
its own good.

COKE BOTTLE TO STAY, GIANTS OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco Giants officials won't back down
from a plan to erect a giant Coke bottle in their new China Basin
baseball stadium, but they have once again promised to shield it
from view outside the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will effectively screen the Coke bottle,'' team spokeswomen
Staci Slaughter said Tuesday at a City Hall hearing.
</P>
<P>
   And if that doesn't happen, neighbors who oppose the plan have
vowed to sue in an attempt to remove it, said South Beach activist
Jeffrey Leibovitz, who is leading the fight against the project.
</P>
<P>
   The Coke bottle, which will rise 80 feet, is part of a
children's play structure to be located behind the left-field
bleachers. Kids will be able to climb on it, and when a Giants
player hits a home run, the cap will pop off and the bottle will
spit out celebratory bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   The project won the OK from the planning and redevelopment
commissions, and from a neighborhood citizens advisory task force
after the Giants scaled back the original plan that called for a
110-foot structure. Still, there are some neighbors wary of a huge
pop bottle in their back yard and others who just plain don't like
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Brodkin, who heads Coleman Advocates for Children &AMP;
Youth, called the Coke bottle a ``permanent monument for bad
taste'' that is intended to seduce children into drinking ``an
addictive substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Stephen, dental director for the San Francisco Health
Department, called the bottle ``a public health hazard'' because it
promotes a soft drink that contributes to tooth decay.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giants representatives said the Coke bottle is a go, noting
that Coca-Cola is a major sponsor of the privately financed
ballpark. Slaughter said the plan is to shroud the structure from
outside view with trees and other foliage, or another screening
device. The bottle, of course, will be quite visible from within
the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, who requested the
hearing, said he ``personally is not happy with the Coke bottle,''
but conceded there is nothing the city can do at this point to stop
it.
</P>
<P>
   Coke, the second-largest sponsor of the new stadium, contributed
about $20 million of the total $306 million ballpark cost.

QUAYLE (Phoenix) - After launching an attack on ``liberal
Republicans,'' Dan Quayle is taking his first formal step toward
running in 2000. Quayle will file exploratory campaign papers
Thursday in Washingon, and then make a public declaration on
``Larry King Live,'' the same TV show that Ross Perot used to
launch his presidential campaign. Quayle discusses this and other
things _ like his thinly-veiled jab at George Bush _ in an
interview with ``The Arizona Republic.'' By MICHAEL MURPHY. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
IMPEACH-AZNOTES (Phoenix) - Hundreds of people have called or
e-mailed ``Arizona Republic'' reporter Julie Amparano in response
to her columns gauging the public's response to Bill Clinton's
impeachment trial over the last week. Some have confessed their own
affairs and wondered what's so bad about cheating, anyway. Another
compared Bill and Hillary to MacBeth and Lady MacBeth, saying they
will never wash the `'blood'' of scandal from their hands. Here are
the personal stories and sentiments of those who have responded to
the column. By JULIE AMPARANO. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CORDBANK (Phoenix) - When Karen Williamson delivered twins in
November, she fortified their financial futures with savings
accounts and college funds. But that wasn't enough for the Phoenix
mom. So she banked a little of their blood just to insure their
longevity. Drawn painlessly from their umbilical cords moments
after their Cesarian births, blood from each child was quickly
whisked by courier to a cord blood bank at the University of
Arizona campus in Tucson. And, after being processed, it will
remain there indefinitely, preserved in liquid nitrogen at 400
degrees below zero Fahrenheit until one of the twins needs it for a
life-saving cure. By LINDA HELSER. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AMWEST (Phoenix) - America West announced record earnings of for
the fourth quarter and year-end. Fourth quarter net income was
$22.4 million, and it topped $108 million for the year, up 45
percent from last year's record of $75 million. By PETER CORBETT.
Story will move in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Undated) - An atomic bomb exploded in Rep. John
Shadegg's face about 30 seconds into the president's State of the
Union speech, and he didn't even flinch. The fallout wasn't strong
enough to penetrate Shadegg's thick shield of arrogance. By E.J.
MONTINI Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Someone's knocking at my door. I have a
feeling it's Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, I liked Jerry when he came to my house several weeks
ago and pulled out a semi-dead orange tree from my front yard,
using nothing but his bare hands and a whole lot of angst. But
apparently I was Jerry's gold mine, and though he eventually
stopped asking for work, he just started asking me for outright
cash. I said no and felt really bad for him. I kept on feeling
really bad about it until my husband did the math, figured out that
in the two days that Jerry had done work for us and our neighbors,
he had made more than we both did in a week. By LAURI NOTARO. Story
moved in the ``L '' category. &QL;

A MARRIAGE MADE IN DOUBLE-WIDE HEAVEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Kinkade is a painter of treacly landscapes who has a
nationwide string of galleries. He is the self-proclaimed ``Painter
of Light,'' whose work appeals to people with little formal art
training.
</P>
<P>
   La-Z-Boy is the largest manufacturer of upholstered furniture
sold in the United States. Its trademark chairs and sofas that flip
up, lean back and plug in are known as ``motion furniture'' and are
popular among those who watch a lot of television.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkade and La-Z-Boy found each other. The pairing, with a
profound marketing resonance, was announced in midsummer to snorts
of derision and mutterings of ``how perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Time passed; then the press kit arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Squirming in anticipation and poised to snigger, we were
disappointed. The moment was squelched. The Thomas Kinkade Home
Furnishings Collection was not half-bad. It was more decent than
horrible.
</P>
<P>
   There are tapestries inspired by Kinkade's most saccharine,
shimmering paintings, such as ``Eiffel Tower'' and ``Victorian
Garden.'' The heavy case goods _ chests and armoires _ are carved
with his signature ``N,'' a symbol for his wife Nanette that is
hidden, at least once, in all his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a damask fabric that is an all-over ``N'' design.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds so ghastly _ the Eiffel Tower, the hidden ``N'' _ and
the news release reads even worse. ``Sink into the comfort and
warmth of a Thomas Kinkade painting with La-Z-Boy's new Gatsby
sofa.'' Or what about this: ``These fabrics reflect our
interpretation of the types of patterns one might find inside the
homes depicted in Thomas Kinkade's paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   If only the furniture actually measured up, er, down to its
potential. The actuality, though, is soft, pretty fabrics and
decent furniture with classic shapes and nice proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Drat _ left choking on an unrequited snigger.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Warm and increasingly moist air will flow north from the Gulf of
Mexico, eventually encountering a mass of cooler air from the
northern Mississippi Valley to the Middle Atlantic States. A front
separating the two air masses will be the focus for abundant clouds
and an expanding area of wet weather. Meanwhile, the unsettled
conditions will persist in much of the West where a moist flow from
over the Pacific remains vigorous.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will become locally heavy at times in the Ohio Valley as
strengthening winds from the south bring humid air into the region.
Farther south, bands of showers and thundershowers will develop
from the Tennessee Valley to the central coast of the Gulf of
Mexico. Later Thursday over the southern Mississippi Valley, a
potent jet stream disturbance will incite strong, gusty
thunderstorms, heavy rain and perhaps a few tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will thicken over most of the Northeastern States as high
pressure moves off the New England Coast. Patchy light rain and
drizzle will develop near a wavering front from the Middle Atlantic
States to extreme southern New England. Meanwhile, sunshine will
gradually yield to clouds over eastern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Colder air will spread south through the interior West. Showers
will occur near the Northwest Coast and a few interior valleys
while intermittent snow will fall along west-facing slopes in the
northern and central Rockies. Most of the Southwest will be partly
to mostly sunny and dry. However, low clouds and fog will linger in
the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Snowy January
</P>
<P>
   So far this month, 24.4 inches of snow have fallen at La Crosse,
Wisconsin, marking the town's fourth snowiest January on record.
Snowfalls across a large chunk of the upper Middle West continue to
stay ahead of the normal pace for snow this winter. The upper
Middle West has been favorably positioned to the north and west of
a beaten track of storm systems, which have cut a path from the
southern Plains to the eastern Great Lakes. Later Thursday and
Thursday night, another storm will take a similar path, but the
lack of a deep Arctic air mass will result in a mix of wintry
precipitation at La Crosse.

CULTURE NOTES: ARGENTINE ART IN AUSTIN; GENIUS OF THE SHAKERS;
REMEMBERING BURROUGHS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ariz., N.Y., Argentina)    (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contemporary art from Argentina takes the spotlight beginning
Friday at the Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art at the University of
Texas in Austin, where about 75 large-scale works of painting,
sculpture and assemblage by nine of that country's artists parody
middle-class Argentine ideas of good taste.
</P>
<P>
   The artists include Antonio Berni, Jorge de la Vega, Alberto
Heredia and Victor Grippo. Most of the works have never been
exhibited in the United States, and the display will be accompanied
by complementary exhibitions, lectures, symposiums and films on the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   After it closes on March 7, the exhibition, ``Cantos Paralelos:
Visual Parody in Contemporary Argentinian Art,'' is to travel to
the Phoenix Art Museum, where it will remain from July 24 to Sept.
26. Next year it will travel to museums in Bogota, Colombia, and
Buenos Aires, Argentina.

   A Certain Style
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly 400 objects, from fragile bonnets and
woodworking tools to rocking chairs and drawings that record
spiritual visions, go on display Thursday in an exhibition at the
Paine Webber Art Gallery, at 1285 Avenue of the Americas between
51st and 52nd Streets.
</P>
<P>
   The show, ``Shaker Gifts, Shaker Genius: The Collection of the
Shaker Museum and Library,'' celebrates the history and artistic
and cultural legacy of the American Shakers, a sect established in
1774 by Ann Lee and eight followers who came to the Colonies in
search of religious freedom. Continuing through April 21, the
exhibition was organized by the Shaker Museum in Old Chatham, N.Y.,
a leading center for study of the Shakers.

<P>
   Novel Occasions
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Burroughs, author of ``Naked Lunch,''
``Queer'' and ``Junky,'' would have turned 85 on Feb. 5, and he
will be remembered in literary fashion with a weekend's worth of
events.
</P>
<P>
   Concurrent with the publication by Grove Press of ``Word Virus:
The William S. Burroughs Reader,'' the provocative author will be
the subject of ``A Tribute to William S. Burroughs,'' a panel
discussion and multimedia presentation at Tishman Auditorium of the
New School, 66 W. 12th Street in Greenwich Village, at 7:30 p.m. on
his birthday. The next day, at 1 p.m. at the Poetry Project in St.
Mark's Church, 131 E. 10th St. in the East Village, readers ranging
from the actor Steve Buscemi to the publisher Barney Rosset are to
take part in a reading of favorite passages from his works.

Award.'') 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ It's so ``surreal'' some editors have ruled out
further use of the word as tiresomely banal. But nobody is
restraining the use of the word ``historic,'' and that is just what
it doesn't feel like. The sense of this epoch is really more an
outlandish farce or melodrama, exciting but of no essential
significance.
 &HT;    The president of the United States is charged with such grave
dishonor that he must be removed from office. At the same time,
that same president appears before both houses of Congress in
solemn assembly to tell them of his plans for the country, which
stretch as far as a half century ahead.
 &HT;    Of course, if President Bill Clinton is convicted of perjury and
obstruction of justice and expelled, it would be historic because
that has never happened before in the United States. But it seems
too far-fetched, considering the miserably pointless circumstances.
What's more, the partisan arithmetic seems too impervious to
argument _ enough Republican votes (a majority) in the House to
impeach and in the Senate to try, but not enough (two-thirds) to
convict.
 &HT;    Clinton's State of the Union address was glowingly upbeat, full
of confidence and promise. It focussed on the medium and long term,
five to 50 years ahead, with no reference at all to the immediate
attempt to cut him down. His lack of embarrassment, contrition or
malaise clearly infuriated his Republican opponents all the more.
 &HT;    The two young congressmen chosen to respond on TV for the
majority party, Jennifer Dunn of Washington and Steve Largent of
Oklahoma, had nothing to offer but their claims of personal virtue
and dedication, all delivered in overly familiar political
windbaggery.
 &HT;    When it comes to public issues, rather than his personal
misbehavior, Clinton doesn't provide them with much of a target,
while his easy, cheerful style, without a hint of discomfort, is
masterly.
 &HT;    Still, one of the two mysteries about the whole Clinton scandal
is why the hard-line right hates him so much. They do. They refer
to him as Evil Incarnate.
 &HT;    One analysis is that he has co-opted a lot of conservative
issues _ such as crime, middle-class problems with child care, poor
education standards _ and they feel he has stolen their birthright.
But that doesn't explain enough. After all, in a way it is a
repudiation of the left they abhor. There is also a rebound, a
revenge, against those who epitomized the counterculture rebellion
of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a kind of grim and satisfied
conviction that so much defiance could only come to a bad end.
 &HT;    The polls confirm the fact that the public at large doesn't
share the indignation at all. Why? _ that is the second mystery.
The questions that pollsters usually ask don't help much. The
answers tend to brush the surveys aside much more than to reveal
the underlying thoughts of either the hard-liners or the general
public.
 &HT;    The drama in the atmosphere all seems artificial, generated by
media and prosecutors, while the typical ordinary reaction is ``Oh,
leave him alone.''
 &HT;    Surprisingly, Dunn began her rebuttal to the president's speech
by saying it was wrong to talk so much about crisis. ``There isn't
any crisis, Americans are sound.'' But that's the president's first
point. ``The state of our union is strong,'' he said.
 &HT;    So what is the fuss about? Probably most congressional
Republicans are no more intense about it than their constituents,
but the militant leadership has achieved a capacity for
intimidation that keeps them from risking the charge of being
``soft'' or defecting.
 &HT;    The situation has been compared to the period of Sen. Joe
McCarthy's fierce campaign against the Communists he professed to
smell everywhere. It was enough to silence even Dwight Eisenhower.
 &HT;    But the McCarthy era, which finally blew up in ridicule, was
ABOUT something, an ideological crusade. It is very hard to say
what the Monica Lewinsky scandal is about, except by sniggering.
Still, it has taken on a momentum of its own that makes the next
weeks hard to predict.
 &HT;    The longer term is easier. As Clinton said in his speech, it has
to be about Social Security, education and public debt, and nothing
that is argued in his trial will make any real difference. It was
noticeable that he dwelt almost entirely on domestic social issues,
with only a brief passing reference to foreign affairs and
America's role in the world.
 &HT;    He was defending himself naturally, but he was also reflecting
what is predominantly on the mind of Americans as the country
enters the new century. Just getting on with life, nothing for the
rest of the world to get upset about.

 &HT;    Still, one of the two mysteries about the whole Clinton scandal
is why the hard-line right hates him so much. They do. They refer
to him as Evil Incarnate.
 &HT;    One analysis is that he has co-opted a lot of conservative
issues _ such as crime, middle-class problems with child care, poor
education standards _ and they feel he has stolen their birthright.
But that doesn't explain enough. After all, in a way it is a
repudiation of the left they abhor. There is also a rebound, a
revenge, against those who epitomized the counterculture rebellion
of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a kind of grim and satisfied
conviction that so much defiance could only come to a bad end.
 &HT;    The polls confirm the fact that the public at large doesn't
share the indignation at all. Why? _ that is the second mystery.
The questions that pollsters usually ask don't help much. The
answers tend to brush the surveys aside much more than to reveal
the underlying thoughts of either the hard-liners or the general
public.
 &HT;    The drama in the atmosphere all seems artificial, generated by
media and prosecutors, while the typical ordinary reaction is ``Oh,
leave him alone.''
 &HT;    Surprisingly, Dunn began her rebuttal to the president's speech
by saying it was wrong to talk so much about crisis. ``There isn't
any crisis, Americans are sound.'' But that's the president's first
point. ``The state of our union is strong,'' he said.
 &HT;    So what is the fuss about? Probably most congressional
Republicans are no more intense about it than their constituents,
but the militant leadership has achieved a capacity for
intimidation that keeps them from risking the charge of being
``soft'' or defecting.
 &HT;    The situation has been compared to the period of Sen. Joe
McCarthy's fierce campaign against the Communists he professed to
smell everywhere. It was enough to silence even Dwight Eisenhower.
 &HT;    But the McCarthy era, which finally blew up in ridicule, was
ABOUT something, an ideological crusade. It is very hard to say
what the Monica Lewinsky scandal is about, except by sniggering.
Still, it has taken on a momentum of its own that makes the next
weeks hard to predict.
 &HT;    The longer term is easier. As Clinton said in his speech, it has
to be about Social Security, education and public debt, and nothing
that is argued in his trial will make any real difference. It was
noticeable that he dwelt almost entirely on domestic social issues,
with only a brief passing reference to foreign affairs and
America's role in the world.
 &HT;    He was defending himself naturally, but he was also reflecting
what is predominantly on the mind of Americans as the country
enters the new century. Just getting on with life, nothing for the
rest of the world to get upset about.

   &LR; A Tough Choice: Bowlgame or Baby &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The folks at babycenter.com, which offers advice and products
for expectant and new parents, want to help expectant parents
answer one of life's most important questions: will the birth of
our baby interfere with a major sporting event?
</P>
<P>
   To avoid possible conflicts, the site's creators have conceived
the Sports Event Conflict Catcher and Conception Blocker. Through
the magic of databases, the site (www.babycenter.com/conflicts)
allows parents to enter in the anticipated arrival date of their
bundle of joy, and determine which of three thousand sporting
events they are likely to miss as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for a digital age twist on the phrase ``planned
parenthood,'' you can choose an event you do not want to miss, say,
the National Rodeo Championships (Dec. 3-12, Las Vegas), and the
``Birth and Labor Conflict Catcher'' will tell you that the week of
Feb. 26th is one which requires contraception, not attempted
conception.
</P>
<P>
   And, for those facing an imminent conflict, the site includes a
function that will give you directions from sporting sites, say,
the Orange Bowl, to your hospital. But no guarantees implied:
thanks to the vagaries of due dates, the site warns you that there
is only a 5 percent chance of it being completely accurate, still
better than the odds of Michael Jordan returning to basketball.
</P>
<P>
   BabyCenter.com's chief executive, Matt Glickman, said his
daughter, Emma, was born last March during the Final Four.
``Truthfully, I'm not the biggest basketball fan,'' he said. ``I'm
a Cleveland Browns fan. I was lucky to have a baby when the Browns
weren't even in existence.''

   New Wristwatch Tells The Time, and the Place &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new wristwatch from Casio Computer will tell its wearers not
just the time, but where they are.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced this month at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las
Vegas, the Casio Global Positioning System Watch communicates with
satellites to continuously find its longitude and latitude. The
screen of the watch also shows on a crude map the position of the
watch relative to some established point of reference, say, where
you left your car before you started hiking.
</P>
<P>
   But like most consumer electronics that come in condensed form,
the watch-bound GPS device is more expensive than many similar
handheld models. When it comes out this summer, it is expected to
cost $500 to $600, several hundred dollars more than basic handheld
versions.
</P>
<P>
   While outdoor types use the GPS watch to find their way home,
they can field pages on their other wrist with a second high-tech
timepiece, the Beepwear Pro, introduced at CES. The Beepwear Pro
can receive paging messages up to 104 characters long via the
Skytel system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $179 cost for the watch, the paging service
can cost from $7.95 to $49.95, per month, depending on the
geographic coverage. The Beepwear Pro is on its way to stores this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The watch, made by Beepwear Paging Products, a joint venture of
Timex and Motorola, can also 150 telephone numbers and addresses.  &QL;

   Suit to Cut Web Access At Library Is Dismissed
</P>
<P>
   In California, library patrons of all ages still are free to
check out the Internet. Last week, a state court in Alameda County
dismissed a lawsuit that charged that a public library violated the
constitutional rights of a 12-year-old boy who last year walked
into a library in a San Francisco suburb and used the Internet to
view and download pictures of naked women.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother, referred to as Kathleen R. in court records,
filed the suit saying the government had violated its
constitutional responsibility to protect the boy from harm by
permitting him access to content deemed ``harmful to minors.'' The
woman asked the court to suspend use of the Internet at the
Livermore Public Library, in a San Francisco suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Public libraries across the country were closely watching the
case because they are struggling with whether and how to restrict
access of minors to the Internet. And further muddying the waters,
last year, a federal court ruled that the use of Internet software
filters, those that attempt to prevent access to pornographic Web
pages, by the Loudon County public library in Virginia was a
violation of patrons' First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the California case, Judge George Hernandez of the Alameda
County Superior Court, dismissed the suit last Thursday without
comment. In October 1998, he dismissed a suit brought, by the same
woman, that had said the library's Internet policy violated state
law, not the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union, which
supported the city of Livermore's open-access policy, said the
plaintiff and her lawyer were ``long on rhetoric and short on case
law.'' The woman said she would appeal the ruling. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Portable Way To Access Your E-Mail &QL;
</P>
<P>
   E-mail users who cannot bear to be without the service when they
leave the office now have another way for messages to follow them
around. Research In Motion, a wireless modem maker, and BellSouth
introduced a new e-mail ready pager called Blackberry this week.
Unlike other wireless systems, this one does not require a separate
e-mail account for messages.
</P>
<P>
   The software instantaneously forwards e-mail addressed to a
users' regular desktop computer account to the pager, which is
roughly the size of a credit card and the thickness of a AA
battery. Users can send replies which, in turn, are stored in a
sent items folder back in their office machine.
</P>
<P>
   But the pager's itty-bitty keyboard, however, will discourage
long-winded messaging. Also stuck in the pager are several personal
digital assistant functions _ calendars and the like _ that can be
synchronized with the big brother computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackberry sells for $399 and flat-rate monthly service
costs $39.99. The system works only on desktop computers connected
to a network running Microsoft Exchange software.

   Long Arm of the Law Shuts a Source of Lyrics &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The International Lyrics Server (www.lyrics.ch), a popular Web
site containing the words to more than 100,000 songs, was closed
last week after music publishers accused the site's Swiss operators
of copyright violations and police officers seized their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Pascal de Vries, a network consultant in Basel who started the
site in 1997, said the police responded to a criminal complaint
filed by lawyers for the licensing arm of the National Music
Publishers' Association (www.nmpa.org) in New York, which says it
``is dedicated to the protection of music copyright across all
media and across all national boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lyrics Server received an average of a million hits per day
from visitors seeking the words to chart-topping songs by bands
like the Rolling Stones and Aerosmith, as well as to show tunes and
obscure ditties. Most of the lyrics were contributed by the site's
users.

   Strange Bedfellows Join To Sue a Porno Group &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do Pamela Anderson, Dr. Laura Schlessinger and the
Archdiocese of St. Louis have in common? As of Jan. 8, 1999,
they've all sued Seth Warshavsky and his Seattle-based online
pornography company, the Internet Entertainment Group. The
archdiocese is suing IEG for posting sites tied to the pope's visit
to St. Louis next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the Internet's most thorough and complete site on the
pope's visit,'' Warshavsky said after a federal judge from the
Eastern District of Missouri shut down two IEG sites Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sites did look and feel like official church content,
complete with a biography of Pope John Paul II and detailed
information on his visit. But a closer look revealed one section
titled ``Unholy Sex,'' which described medieval sex scandals in the
Catholic church, plus links to IEG's more typical fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We quoted from a dozen scholarly works, including William
James,'' explains IEG executive editor Evan Wright, who says he has
a degree in Medieval and Renaissance Studies from Vassar College.
``It's really much milder than the history of the church I studied
in school.''
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese, of course, was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the goals here was to confuse people who thought it was
a legitimate site,'' says archdiocese spokesman Steve Mamanella.
</P>
<P>
   IEG intends to appeal the ruling and to relaunch the original
sites under a new address.

 &HT;    AS REPUBLICANS MEET, POLITICAL GHOST OF REAGAN HOVERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican Party's search for the next Ronald
Reagan begins anew Thursday with two important gatherings of the
GOP faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The nuts-and-bolts Republican National Committee begins its
three-day winter meeting with an eye toward victory in the 2000
presidential election. Private strategy sessions are expected to
focus not only on the White House race, but also on halting the
erosion of the GOP majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the party's most fervent conservatives, the
heart and soul of the GOP since Reagan, will get their first
up-close look at the most conservative presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pale pastels'' are invited to the annual conference of the
26-year-old Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC), warned
David Keene, its chairman. Only true Reaganites need apply for the
GOP's 2000 presidential nomination, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after he left office, ``the GOP is still looking for
the next Ronald Reagan, and no one has a lock on that,'' said
Dennis Goldford, a Drake University expert on political parties and
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Among those slated to address CPAC are former Gov. Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee, Family Research Council founder Gary Bauer,
magazine publisher Steve Forbes, House Budget Chairman John Kasich
of Ohio, former Vice President Dan Quayle and Sen. Bob Smith of New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The current front-runners for the GOP nomination, Gov. George
Bush of Texas and former American Red Cross President Elizabeth
Dole, declined invitations to appear before CPAC. So did Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, who is running a distant third in public opinion
polls of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions by Bush and Dole to forgo an appearance before
CPAC affords other possible candidates an opportunity to snipe at
them and their credentials as heirs to the Reagan legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect George W. Bush will run as a Bush Republican and
Elizabeth Dole will run as a Dole Republican,'' said Bauer, a
former Reagan domestic policy adviser who next week will announce
his decision whether to run for the GOP nomination. ``If I run, I
will run as a Reagan Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that the GOP, in gearing up for the next
presidential contest, is harkening back to the glory days of
Reagan, said Haley Barbour, the former RNC chairman who helped
mastermind the GOP's takeover of Congress after 40 years of
Democratic dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the spending proposals outlined by President
Clinton in his State of the Union speech, ``we may very well be on
our way to a great debate over the next couple of years on the
proper size and scope of the federal government,'' Barbour said.
``And if I were running for president, I'd be standing with Ronald
Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Democratic contest, which seems to be shrinking into
a one-on-one scrimmage between Vice President Al Gore and Bill
Bradley, a former U.S. senator from New Jersey and pro basketball
great, the Republican presidential primary is expanding in spite of
Bush's and Dole's high standings in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GOP race has no previously tested front-runner, and other
candidates think it is now or never for them,'' said Merle Black, a
political expert at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is the compressed calendar of presidential
primaries next year. By the end of March 2000, 35 states will have
held caucuses or primaries, selecting nearly two-thirds of the
delegates to the parties' nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The election calendar puts a premium on early campaign funding.
Many believe a candidate must raise at least $20 million this year
in order to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the invisible primary,'' said Ed Gillispie, who is
assembling Kasich's campaign apparatus.

CULTURE CENTER IS PLANNED FOR CONCERTS IN POCONOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (lb) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Poconos have been famous for decades for resort hotels with
heart-shaped beds and bathtubs, but if Elliot Rosoff and Nat
Gliserman have their way, those Pennsylvania mountains will soon
become as well known for culture as for kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   Rosoff, a concert violinist, and Gliserman, an engineer who has
designed food and housing areas for two World's Fairs and several
Olympics, are planning a kind of Tanglewood of the Poconos called
the Keystone Center of Music and the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The center, on 675 acres near Stroudsburg, Pa., is a two-hour
drive from New York or Philadelphia. It is scheduled to open on May
25, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rosoff, the president and artistic director of the venture, and
Gliserman, its general manager, have received a letter of
commitment from the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, which hopes to
make the center its summer home, much as the Boston Symphony
summers at Tanglewood and the Philadelphia Orchestra takes up
residence at Saratoga, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The Tisch School of the Arts at New York University has signed
on to stage student productions of musical theater works there as
well as cabaret shows and children's performances. Discussions are
under way with the New York Pops and the Northeast Pennsylvania
Philharmonic for concerts, and East Stroudsburg University has
agreed to open a culinary school on the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been after a summer home for a long time,'' said Gideon
Toeplitz, the managing director of the Pittsburgh Symphony. ``We
used to spend the summers at Ambler, a college outside Baltimore,
until state funding ceased. Then we went to Great Woods, Mass.,
which was wonderful for two years, until one of the owners decided
that they could make more money with rock concerts, and we were
phased out. Since then, we have been using part of the summer for
domestic tours, but our long-term project was always to find a home
for the summer, and we certainly hope this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the plan is for the Pittsburgh Symphony to be in
residence for four weeks and to offer four programs each week.
Rosoff is talking to other orchestras about filling the rest of the
summer weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Rosoff happily promotes the center's relationship
with the Pittsburgh Symphony, he says he is thinking in broader
musical terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole philosophy,'' he said, ``is that we are not an
elitist organization. We'll have all kinds of music there, and only
35 percent of it will be classical. We expect about 40 percent to
be Broadway and pop. About 12 percent will be country, and we'll
have jazz and dance as well. We have so many places to present
performances on the property that we can have several things going
on at once.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a certain amount of faith involved. Rosoff
and Gliserman have budgeted $20 million for the first phase of the
project, which includes the cost of the land for the center and the
renovation of its existing buildings and lawns. Another $15 million
is budgeted for the second phase, the centerpiece of which is a
4,000-seat concert pavilion with lawn seating for 15,000. Gliserman
expects the pavilion to be completed in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the center has been promised a $7.5 million state grant,
although bureaucratic squabbles _ mainly over funds for proposed
sports complexes for Philadelphia and Pittsburgh that are part of
the same grant package _ have held it up. But beyond the state
grant, the center's board has raised only $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rosoff points out that the center has just started seeking
donations, and indeed, he and Gliserman have accomplished a lot in
a relatively short time.
</P>
<P>
   They saw the site of the proposed center for the first time last
March. Since then, they have established the nonprofit corporation
that will run the center, assembled a board, negotiated the
purchase of the property and started negotiating with the
orchestras and schools that would be resident at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Rosoff, who lives in New York, has worked as a freelance
orchestra player and recording-session violinist and founded and
ran Opal, a recording studio, until he sold his interest in 1985.
He was drawn into the arts-center business almost by accident. Four
years ago, he became intrigued with a bridge partner's proposal to
start a summer arts complex in the Catskills, and became the
artistic director of the project.
</P>
<P>
   When the original plan fell through, Rosoff and his partner
began looking at land in Pike County, Pa. They were about to buy a
piece of land when the partnership split because of what Rosoff
describes as ``philosophical disagreements'' about the function of
the center.
</P>
<P>
   Rosoff and his former partner had been working with Gary Boam,
the executive director of the Pike County Industrial and Commercial
Development Authority, and when he called Boam to say the
partnership had been dissolved, Boam asked if Rosoff was interested
in restarting the project on his own. When they met last March to
begin searching for sites, Rosoff brought along Gliserman, also a
New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at four pieces of land,'' Rosoff said. ``This was
the fourth, and when we got there I took one look and said, `Wow,
this is it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gliserman added: ``You're looking at 675 acres, lawned and
wooded, with an 88-acre glacial lake and a nature walk. You know
that expression about contemplating one's navel? The lake is the
optimum place to do it; it has that kind of serenity. And over the
full area, you could have 10,000 people there, and they would not
be tripping over each other.''

<P>
   The property had been owned by the International Ladies Garment
Workers Union, which ran it as a retreat called Unity House. The
union stopped using the property in 1989 but had kept
groundskeepers on its payroll. The cost was $8.5 million _ $4.5
million in cash (Rosoff is currently negotiating a mortgage) and $4
million in free tickets to union members.
</P>
<P>
   Already in place was a handful of buildings that will become the
spine of the Keystone Center, as well as 33 cottages and other
buildings, 244 rooms in all, to house performers and the staff.
</P>
<P>
   A large administration building dating from 1973 will become the
Cultural Arts Center. It has a 1,500-seat dining room, a kitchen
and a vast food-storage area as well as a large performance space.
A separate theater built in 1959 will have 1,200 seats when it is
refurbished; it already has rehearsal space and full theatrical
backstage facilities. There is also a boathouse that would be
transformed into a theater for cabaret performances.
</P>
<P>
   A big lawn to the south of the Cultural Arts Center will be used
for outdoor chamber concerts and jazz, and a lawn near the lake for
children's concerts. The largest of the three lawns, west of the
Cultural Arts Center, will be the site of the concert pavilion,
planned for 2003. Until it is built, the center will hold concerts
in a large tent, like the one the New York Philharmonic uses for
its summer concerts in the parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the center at maturity _ say, five years out _ bringing
in upward of 600,000 people a year,'' said Boam of the Pike County
development authority. ``Currently we serve many millions of people
a year. As you know, the Pocono Mountains used to be characterized
as the honeymoon capital of the world, but now we have a more
diverse crowd, and it's difficult to get a handle on exactly why
they're coming. We see this as something that will bring people
into the market and provide entertainment for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Boam does have some concerns. Traffic, for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rural community,'' he said, ``and we want to support
the environment we have. We don't have massive four-lane
expressways, so moving 15,000 to 20,000 people in and out for
concerts will be interesting. But there are solutions. A bypass is
being built for other reasons nearby. And there is a proposal for a
rail line, in the next five years, to connect Scranton with points
in New Jersey and New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's neighbors seem to be fully behind the project: one
nearby resort, Tamiment, lent the board money to make its down
payment. Together, three resorts within 10 miles of the center _
Tamiment, Pocomont and Fernwood _ are undertaking about $50 million
of renovations. All told, there are 18,000 to 20,000 hotel rooms
within a 50-mile radius of the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be a place where people come at 7:30, go
to a concert and leave,'' Rosoff said. ``That's not the premise of
what we're doing. We're offering an environment, a destination.
It's an incredible piece of property _ you walk in there, and
you're in another world. That's very important to us. It's what
attracted me to it in the first place.''

   As a genre, the literary letter is like many a dramatic romance.
One always predicts that its soliloquy will end, but often it
doesn't. The form has survived the telephone and the typewriter and
the personal computer. Will it survive e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   The maxim for the literary letter was very likely set by Cicero,
whose craving for publicity was so consuming that he inadvertently
laid down the principle that has endured for more than 2,000 years.
It was the simple phrase ``a letter does not blush'' _ or anything
goes _ and it dates from the shameless request he wrote in 56 B.C.
to Lucceius not only to commence the writing of his biography
immediately but also ``to embellish,'' indeed ``to put aside the
rules of historical composition and grant a little more of your
love for me than the truth might allow.''
</P>
<P>
   From Cicero's time (he was a prolific letter writer) to now,
what has made the somewhat subterranean art of literary letter
writing important has been the intimacy and passion and sometimes
ebullient honesty that authors have felt free to express in their
letters. Stuff they often couldn't or wouldn't put into their other
work.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for instance, Emily Dickinson wrote to her sister-in-law,
Susan Huntington Dickinson: ``Dearer you cannot be, for I love you
so already, that it almost breaks my heart _ perhaps I can love you
anew, every day of my life, every morning and evening.'' (``Open Me
Carefully,'' Paris Press, 1998.) Or Simone de Beauvoir to Nelson
Algren: ``I work well, I wait for spring, I think of you first
thing in the morning when I open my eyes and last thing at night
when closing them. I kiss you as well as I can and as long as you
want.'' (``A Transatlantic Love Affair,'' the New Press, 1998.) In
neither collection are the pages reddening.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill left behind about 5,000 letters. Hemingway, Faulkner and
Steinbeck churned them out, Steinbeck often as a morning warm-up,
like a pianist's finger exercise, before starting the day's work of
story writing. Think van Gogh. After the paintings, it's the almost
nightly letters to his brother Theo that pop into your mind.
Raymond Chandler, writing to his publisher, described his letters'
importance this way: ``So I suppose in my letters I more or less
revealed those facets of my mind which had to be obscured or
distorted in what I wrote for publication.''
</P>
<P>
   For serious writers, nothing was too trivial or too personal for
their letters. Nothing else allowed for such joyous ego
exploration. And without such indulgences, future biographies would
certainly be patchy things at best.
</P>
<P>
   The latest presumed threat to the form is e-mail. For many it is
difficult to conjure someone's pouring out emotions to a recipient
who will almost certainly not save the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Carol Oates, a voluminous letter writer, said: ``I don't
know if I could write anything intimate on e-mail. I didn't grow up
with e-mail. My students at Princeton did, so it's intimate for
them.'' She added: ``I still type out a letter. I don't have a word
processor. I can sit and look out the window at the rain,'' she
said. ``It's easier psychologically than using a word processor,
let alone e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have written thousands of letters; if I haven't much to say
I send postcards to friends and editors,'' she said. ``John Updike
and I write letters to each other; he sends me postcards.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1961, Ms. Oates has had a prodigious correspondence with
Robert Phillips, author, poet and director of the creative writing
program at the University of Houston, whom she met when they were
undergraduates at Syracuse University. ``It's very old-fashioned
letter writing _ lots of gossip, literary information, personal
news,'' she said. ``He and I have written thousands of letters, and
we still mail them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have love letters because I married my first serious
love,'' she said. Phillips said: ``What we write about is mutual
friends, what's going on in our groups'' _ Ms. Oates teaches
creative writing at Princeton _ ``reviews of things we think will
interest each other. I send her poems. When I don't have a clear
writing project in mind, I use the letters for warm-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers feel often that their work is not real unless they can
touch it and see it on paper. ``My primary mode of communication is
the old manual typewriter,'' John Updike said. ``It has the breath
of life to it; it's not plugged in to something.'' He doesn't write
letters ``in the grand old sense of them,'' he said. ``Joyce writes
a very good letter, very old-fashioned sort. Mine are more terse; I
send a lot of postcards.''
</P>
<P>
   In at least one way, however, Updike is in the literary
tradition of letter writing. He most often communicated by letter
with Judith Jones, who edits him at Alfred A. Knopf, and William
Maxwell, who formerly edited him at The New Yorker. ``Those
letters, hundreds of them, have probably been kept,'' he said.
``They show me in a professional mode worrying about details. I
wouldn't say they are highly emotional or confiding. One's letters
sometimes creep into the public domain, and it makes one a little
uncomfortable to have them out there when you are still out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Updike's letters have been given by Maxwell to the
University of Illinois, where they can be read. (Writers, or their
estates or heirs, own the content of letters so they cannot be
quoted at length without permission, but the recipient owns the
physical objects and can show them.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Updike doesn't reveal much of himself in his letters,
he says he would be very sorry if e-mail wiped out the genre. ``It
is sad to think there wouldn't be things like the letters of Byron
_ his best writing was his letters _ and Keats,'' he said. ``Or
Henry James, dashing off letters just to keep his social life in
order.'' A phone call or e-mail could be used for this, ``but
there's something about the act of typing and seeing words on
paper,'' Updike said. ``It allows the writer to ever so slightly
preen and polish.''
</P>
<P>
   For the biographer, the threat of what e-mail will do to the
literary letter is too terrible to consider. Gioia Diliberto, whose
biography of the crusading Jane Addams will be published by
Scribner in July, said that much of the research involved letters.
``The collection of her letters comprises more than 75 reels of
microfilm, a great deal of it in handwriting that is illegible,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is not the same as mail; people don't use it for
contemplative purposes,'' Ms. Diliberto said. ``People used letter
writing to figure out how they felt about things. You usually use
e-mail for business purposes, not venting your feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters also tell history. Broadway Books had a recent trade
paperback success with ``Letters of a Nation,'' a collection of
letters by extraordinary Americans and obscure ones, and its sister
imprint, Dial Press, plans a book that will tell the history of
20th-century America through letters.
</P>
<P>
   So the loss of letters on paper can be a serious thing indeed.
And can anyone really imagine: sjohnson(AT)therambler.com?

<P>
   PHUM THMEI, Cambodia _ ``If I killed anyone, you can kill me
back,'' said Neang Kin, her hair matted and her clothes stained
reddish-brown from her work in the flooded rice fields. ``I swear
to God and swear to die in front of my children. I faint at the
sight of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Khmer Rouge personnel files at Tuol Sleng prison and Mrs. Neang
Kin's own confession 20 years ago tell a different story. According
to these records, she was one of many thousands of functionaries
who carried out the brutal policies that led to the deaths of more
than a million Cambodians from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Neang Kin, who guesses her age at 48, once confessed to
assisting in the torture of 300 people at the prison and even to
taking part in administering electric shocks. A subsistence farmer
now, she desperately denies that confession.
</P>
<P>
   As Cambodia and the outside world prepare for the possibility of
trials for perhaps a dozen Khmer Rouge leaders, a large unanswered
_ and generally unasked _ question is how to deal with the people
who actually took part in the torture and the killing, or even how
to think of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people like her on file,'' said Youk
Chhang, the director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, a
private agency that is collecting evidence of Khmer Rouge crimes.
His investigators have talked with Mrs. Neang Kin three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very classic case for the lawyers to
determine who should be responsible,'' he said. ``Even though I
personally believe only the leaders should be brought to justice,
we need to clarify this for the younger generation to understand.
This woman is like a first-hand killer. Why should only the the top
leaders take responsibility?''
</P>
<P>
   The documents show that Mrs. Neang Kin spent 18 months in prison
after her confession in 1979. She said the recent surrender of two
Khmer Rouge leaders has filled her with mixed emotions: anger at
their apparent impunity but fear that if trials are held, she may
once again be a target.
</P>
<P>
   She said she resented some former Khmer Rouge colleagues who
have done well for themselves in recent years, buying motorbikes
and televisions or emigrating to the United States. Abandoned years
ago by her husband, Mrs. Neang Kin grows rice, beans and corn to
support her parents and teen-age daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Her file at Tuol Sleng prison, in Phnom Penh, describes her as
having been a ``group chief,'' though it does not specify her
duties. Like similar files, it includes an expressionless portrait
that is indistinguishable from those taken of the 14,000 prisoners
who passed through the torture house en route to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Her confession to the Vietnamese-backed government that ousted
the Khmer Rouge says she assisted and sometimes administered
torture, including electric shocks. ``We used the shocks until
people died,'' she is quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The stories she now tells, in conversations last August and this
month in this tiny riverside village 30 miles south of Phnom Penh,
have become more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Though she admits setting up and cleaning the interrogation
rooms _ sweeping, arranging chairs, putting out glasses of water _
she stops short of her earlier confession that she took part.
</P>
<P>
   And though she insists on her personal innocence, she describes
in knowledgeable detail the nighttime departures of large dark
trucks, ``very quietly, with a small flashing light,'' that carried
the stripped and handcuffed prisoners to their deaths in a killing
field.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her actions, it seems clear that she, like many of even
the cruelest Khmer Rouge executioners, was a young, barely literate
farmer who was recruited, indoctrinated and terrorized into
unquestioning and even enthusiastic obedience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had political meetings, but I didn't understand anything
they said,'' Mrs. Neang Kin said. ``Wherever they asked me to go, I
went. They were OK, but they were brutal when you did something
wrong. Sometimes I spilled rice and the group leader hit me with a
flashlight. He hit, and hit, and hit.''
</P>
<P>
   She was asked the question that is key for those who have
performed atrocities throughout history: Why did she not simply
refuse?
</P>
<P>
   ``They would kill you,'' she replied. ``You would say one word
against them, and they would kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the leading pursuers of those responsible for the
Khmer Rouge atrocities, Youk Chhang wrestles with questions of
culpability, responsibility and humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just an uneducated peasant girl living on a farm,'' he
said. ``Suddenly she was working in the prison system, part of the
machine that was killing people. She was a human being caught up in
events, but what she was caught up in was inhuman. She is legally
responsible for what happened there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for ignorant people to understand what is humane and
what is inhumane. Her conscience was dulled by the government; who
was she to object?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, ``she still seems to be very proud of
her discipline, of her ability to carry out orders without
question.''
</P>
<P>
   He said cases like hers could challenge any tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all say they didn't kill anybody,'' he said of the former
cadres. ``But what if there is a living witness, a victim of hers?
What if someone comes forward and says, `I want you to arrest this
person; she killed my sister.' How will the court respond?''
</P>
<P>
   And how will the nation respond?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that even a carefully limited tribunal could set
off nationwide recriminations and score-settlings _ even fighting _
worries some.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Khmer Rouge are bad and are criminals, but there are
too many to convict, and some remain strong,'' Pin Sisovann, an
editor, wrote in The Cambodia Daily this month. ``The international
tribunal will never be able to make it fair and just.''
</P>
<P>
   To safeguard the living, he wrote, ``it is better not to find
justice for the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Youk Chhang's response is: ``If people begin pointing fingers at
their neighbors, perhaps that will be bad. But it will be to a good
end. To cure pain, you have to go through pain.''
</P>
<P>
   There are countless people like Mrs. Neang Kin all around
Cambodia, living quiet lives among their victims, their backgrounds
often well known to their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Neang Kin may simply have been, in Youk Chhang's phrase,
``a human being caught up in events.'' But she was one of the
thousands of people whose failure to say no made the atrocities
possible.
</P>
<P>
   She was the daughter of a peasant landowner with a high school
education. She said that despite her parents' pleas, she was forced
to work for the communist insurgents of the Khmer Rouge beginning
two years before they seized power.
</P>
<P>
   At first she was a laborer, working on irrigation projects and
carrying rice. When the Khmer Rouge seized Phnom Penh in 1975 and
expelled its 2 million residents, she said, she helped collect gold
and other goods from the abandoned shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of cakes and biscuits,'' she said. ``They
were delicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she said, she was assigned to prison work. ``I don't know
why.'' After a beating for some infraction, she said, she ran away
and returned home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got me and took me back to the prison even though I was
sick and my parents begged them not to,'' she said. ``They tied me
up in the sun for two days.''
</P>
<P>
   She learned to obey without question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever they put you, you stayed there,'' she said. ``You
didn't go searching into something that wasn't your business. You
didn't even tell your own relatives what you saw. Maybe for our
society today that is not a good system, but back then there was
discipline. And you have to live according to the rules of
society.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``They trained us to follow the path of the
revolution correctly. If you didn't believe, they killed you.''
</P>
<P>
   There were happy moments, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Neang Kin remembers with pleasure the New Year's parties
where the prison staff, dressed as always in spectral black, danced
the slow, traditional dances of Cambodia. They even had meat to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the guards were handsome, she said, but there was no
flirting as the men and women swayed their hips and hands in
separate dance circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't even ask permission to marry when you were
working at the prison,'' she said. ``You were afraid even to have a
feeling like that. The feeling could be seen and you could be
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   These are harsh memories to live with. So were Khmer Rouge
functionaries like Mrs. Neang Kin victims too?
</P>
<P>
   No, Youk Chhang said: ``They are not victims, but they are human
beings like us. They are not dragons or crocodiles or tigers. That
is what is so frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   One Cambodian-American researcher from his office said she was
charmed, and confused, by Mrs. Neang Kin and her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are wonderful people,'' said the researcher, Kalyanee
Mam, who visited them last summer. ``I just fell in love with the
family. She even cooked food for me. She didn't seem nervous or
hiding anything. She seemed very honest and direct. She said the
accusations were all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I said, `We have your photo from Tuol Sleng.' She said
she was forced to take the photo, that they just chose some people
for pictures so they wouldn't have to take pictures of the real
people. When I heard that, I didn't know what to say. I couldn't
just say: `You're lying.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She said: `Look at me. Do I look like a killer?''' Miss Mam
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same question the Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, asked
an interviewer shortly before he died in April.

 &HT;    Folk artistry of a maid from Vinings finds national recognition
17 years after her death
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nellie Mae Rowe's doctor told her to chew gum for
headaches. So she took her leftover wads of Wrigley's and Beechnut
_ ``I don't want nobody else's, just mine'' _ and molded them into
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   A widow with no children, she made dolls and set them out to
keep her company. Fashioned from old clothes, wearing wigs and
sunglasses and perched, sometimes, on little plastic lawn chairs,
they often bore a strange resemblance to Rowe herself _ portraits
of the artist as a young doll.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 20 years, the late Nellie Mae Rowe has become
something of a cult figure in Atlanta, revered by its community of
folk art aficionados, contemporary artists and museum officials.
Now, in a meticulously researched, lovingly assembled show at the
Museum of American Folk Art, the tale of this self-taught artist
from Vinings, who died of cancer in 1982 after a remarkable
two-year burst of creativity, is being revealed to a larger public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a long time in coming, but here she is, and I think
she deserves every bit of it,'' says curator Lee Kogan. ``She
should be recognized because she is, in her way, a genius. Without
qualification, she is a significant American artist of the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   All this week _ and at a reception Wednesday night attended by
dozens of Atlanta followers _ this city has fallen under the spell
of Nellie Mae Rowe.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, those chewing gum sculptures and bespectacled rag dolls are
amazing. But among the 96 works in this retrospective, it's the
pictures that really pop.
</P>
<P>
   Saturated with color, throbbing with sensuality and informed by
the accumulated symbols of Africa and America, Rowe's vision is
near-mythic in sweep. Yet this is not always self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   Using a deceptively simple vocabulary _ trees and flowers, fish
and fowl, men and animals _ she captures something that is both of
her time and beyond time's larger frame. Plugged into a primordial
subconsciousness, yet fully cognizant of her exterior world, Rowe
encodes her landscapes with icons of life and death, fertility and
barrenness, strength and vulnerability, pleasure and pain. She is
both mesmerized by the progress of man (TVs, freeways) and
terrified of it. She is eroticized by the lushness of the physical
world and seduced by the promise of heaven. Like Phoenix Jackson,
the character in Eudora Welty's ``A Worn Path,'' she is on a
metaphorical journey of life, with all of nature spread out in
front of her, creating both beauty and chaos.
</P>
<P>
   For some, Nellie Mae Rowe's big moment is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she is a major player in the field of self-taught art,
and I think she has not yet achieved the recognition she
deserves,'' says High Museum (Atlanta) folk art curator Lynne
Spriggs, who came to New York to see the show, which goes on view
at the High's downtown branch in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's always hurt me about Nellie Mae Rowe is that
she had to work so hard,'' says Atlanta artist Susan Loftin, who
traveled 22 hours by train to see the show. ``One of the greatest
artists we had in the country had to work as a maid for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta collector Marianne Lambert says that if you'd gone to
Rowe's funeral, you would have never known she was such a creative
force. ``They never once mentioned that she was an artist. They
just talked about her good deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   That's changing now.
</P>
<P>
   But the story of Nellie Mae Rowe might never have gotten out,
had it not been for Judith Alexander. After first seeing Rowe's
pictures in 1976, Alexander became her dealer, best friend and most
tireless advocate. By 1978, at Alexander's urging, Rowe had created
enough works to kick off the inaugural exhibit at the Alexander
Gallery, Atlanta's first folk art house.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe was 78, and her art career had just begun. Over the next 10
years, she would realize her preternatural impulse to make art,
turning out the wildly incandescent pictures that are now coveted
by museums.
</P>
<P>
   Born on a Fayette County (Ga.) farm to a former slave, Rowe was
possessed of a tenacious will to draw. Her father was a basket
maker, and her mother stitched quilts, so making things seemed like
her birthright. A bride at 16, twice widowed by the time she was
48, Rowe worked as a domestic servant. When she wasn't decorating
her own house and yard with her play pretties, she was rearranging
her employers' furniture. To her surprise, they liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she had this affinity for all living things,'' says
Lee Kogan, the show's curator at the Museum of American Folk Art.
``I think she really understood and believed in the unity of every
living thing. And you feel it _ you just feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander _ a visionary in her own right who opened Atlanta's
first abstract gallery in 1956 _ says she was drawn to Rowe's work
simply because it didn't bore her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It excited me,'' says Alexander, 67, sitting in her New York
apartment, which is hung almost exclusively with Rowe's art. ``This
was art that did not make me think of anything else. It did speak
to me, and it was amazing. It just delighted me. It nurtured. It
just made me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   As Alexander says this, she sounds like the Geraldine Page
character in the movie ``A Trip to Bountiful.'' It is the tiny,
wholly sweet voice of an old woman who is still a little girl at
heart, a quality that must have endeared her to Rowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Nellie's spirit lives on with her in a way,''
Spriggs says. ``She's just been an incredible advocate of Nellie's
work.'' Though Alexander closed her gallery in 1989, she has
continued as the keeper of the Rowe repository, dispensing pictures
only to those who meet her exacting criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Nellie Mae Rowe was fortunate in finding a
collaborator like Judith Alexander,'' says Gerard C. Wertkin,
director of the Museum of American Folk Art. ``This was a true
partnership based on mutual respect and affection. That
unfortunately is not always the case. . . . She (Alexander) has
nurtured the legacy and has gone about it with tremendous
commitment. I would even use the word `love.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Brown Sr., Rowe's nephew and closest relative, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people would come by here, and they would try to beat
her out of stuff, but Miss Judith didn't do that,'' says the
85-year-old Smyrna resident, who was too ill to make the opening.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander won't say how many Rowe works she owns, nor what they
are worth on the market. But she is clearly determined to see that
they get into the hands of careful custodians. She worries over
whether the paintings should stay in Georgia or be sent to museums
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so proud to have been given archival works and some
major works of Nellie Mae Rowe and hope in time that we may have
more,'' says Kogan, who traveled to Atlanta numerous times to
research the show. She dedicated the handsome coffee table volume,
the first major treatise on Rowe, to Brown and Eleanor Shropshire,
a Rowe niece from Fayetteville (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Brown says he's gotten the catalog and thinks the show is
wonderful. ``I know that Aunt Nellie would love it if she could see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the final pictures is one of a tiny, big-eared dog looking
sad and perplexed, as if it is nearing the end of a very long
journey. In Rowe's inimitable hand, she has scrawled the words: ``I
won't be back.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in these hauntingly beautiful images of joy and hope,
she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art of Nellie Mae Rowe: Ninety-Nine and a Half Won't Do''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Through May 16. Free. Museum of American Folk Art, Eva and
Morris Feld Gallery at 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th
Street, New York. 212-595-9533. The show travels to the National
Museum of Women in the Arts (June 3-Aug. 15) in Washington, the
High Museum of Art's downtown Atlanta gallery (Nov. 20-Feb. 26,
2000) and the African American Museum in Dallas (March 18-May 14,
2000).

 &HT;    Stars Allen, Richardson ask to pull plug on `Home'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Tim Allen says this is absolutely, positively
the last season for ``Home Improvement.'' The sitcom star, who
wants to work on his film career (``The Santa Clause''), says no
amount of money can make him return, even though there are reports
ABC might offer him $2 million per episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many ways I can say this,'' says Allen. ``I'm
not going to do this any more. As far as I'm concerned, it's the
end of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC programming execs are playing the decision close to the
vest, saying they'd like to have the show back if a deal can be
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about them, it's about us,'' says Allen, who says he
learned from Jerry Seinfeld and Michael Jordan how not to overstay
one's welcome. ``There is nothing ABC can do to bring us back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Improvement'' co-star Patricia Richardson, who also wants
to call it quits, said the stars and the producers have already
mapped out an approach to a finale that would run in May.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Taylor Thomas, who played their son Randy but has now
left the show for college, has been approached to come back for
that finale, but hasn't answered yet, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Although never on hipsters' radar, ``Home Improvement'' was one
of the biggest hits of the 1990s, earning hundreds of millions for
ABC and parent Disney in eight seasons, especially in syndication.

 &HT;    A brief bio of Nellie Mae Rowe
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  Personal: Born July 4, 1900, in Fayette County (Ga.). The
artist's father was an emancipated slave. She died of cancer in
1982 and is buried at the Flat Rock African Methodist Episcopal
Church, Fayetteville (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The playhouse: From 1937 until her death, she lived in a
four-room house at 2041 Paces Ferry Road in Vinings (Ga.). She
called it her playhouse and decorated it with dolls, drawings,
chairs, Christmas ornaments and all kinds of found objects. She
pruned the shrubbery to look like sheep, roadrunners, elephants and
ostriches. The site is now occupied by the Wyndham Gardens Hotel,
but there is a marker commemorating Rowe.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting recognized: Rowe was discovered by Atlanta collector
Judith Alexander in 1976. In 1982, she was one of 20 artists chosen
for a landmark exhibit on African-American folk art at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington. Her work is in the collections of
Atlanta's High Museum of Art, the Morris Museum of Art in Augusta
(Ga.), the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Museum of American Folk Art in
New York and the Studio Museum in Harlem, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Her legacy: Says Gerard C. Wertkin, director of the Museum of
American Folk Art: ``This is an artist who has risen above local
interest, to be sure. The interest is now national. I have a
suspicion that now after the exposure here in New York, it will be
international.''

<P>
   Even as their budgets and, occasionally, their aspirations have
ballooned, Broadway musicals give the impression of having grown
smaller in recent years, at least in part because of the
near-disappearance of dance from the American musical theater.
</P>
<P>
   Dance is still there, but it's either nondescript, as in
``Footloose,'' or solemnly obligatory, almost instructive, as in
``Ragtime.'' The sense of excitement and discovery has disappeared.
If you have any doubt about what has been lost or, better yet, if
you just want to have a terrifically entertaining night of Broadway
theater, then you can't afford to pass up ``Fosse,'' now at the
Broadhurst.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a very particular, epic-size musical revue. In its
consideration of the career of Bob Fosse as dancer, choreographer
and director on Broadway, in Hollywood and on television from the
late 1940s into the 1980s, it celebrates the art, high spirits and
dazzling inventiveness of a theater now known only through
revivals.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned, however. ``Fosse'' is an anthology composed mostly of
climaxes for which there are no build-ups. Some numbers are
presented in their entirety, while others are spliced into medleys
and not always easy to identify. Yet the elegant-looking production
is given cohesion by the dynamic character and the restless mind of
Fosse himself.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the pure exhilaration that comes only rarely these
days, when watching a cast of 32 talented performers dancing and
singing with an energy that, from time to time, threatens to raise
the roof.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Fosse'' looks back over approximately 40 years of dance in
theater and movies, it inevitably prompts the question: What
happened?
</P>
<P>
   It may be Jerome Robbins who forever confounded our expectations
for dance in the Broadway musical. His contributions still
astonish: think of his role in transforming ``Fancy Free,'' the
Robbins-Leonard Bernstein ballet, into ``On the Town'' (1944), of
his priceless Keystone Kops ballet for ``High Button Shoes''
(1947), of ``The Small House of Uncle Thomas'' ballet for ``The
King and I'' (1951) and of those balletic gang rumbles in ``West
Side Story'' (1957). He led us to believe that it would be the
classically trained choreographer, skilled also in modern dance,
who would bring new life and meaning to the American musical
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins was as much at home in a Broadway house as in Ballet
Theater. He brought a breadth of vision to musical shows that was
unique and, by comparison, called attention to what some people saw
as the limitations of such Broadway-bred choreographers as Fosse,
Michael Bennett and Gower Champion.
</P>
<P>
   An unfair comparison, really. Robbins was not just a great
choreographer. He was a genius. He was one of a kind, without
compare. He wasn't someone next to whom anyone else can be measured
without the help of a large footstool.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographers of the stature of Fosse, Bennett and Champion
were masters of their own class of entertainment. No wonder they
became directors: Broadway was then a dancing place.
</P>
<P>
   If you have seen the work of the choreographers from ballet and
modern dance who have recently been corralled by the musical
theater, you might have noticed that there haven't been any Jerome
Robbinses among them. You might also have realized that these
recruits can be even more limited in their vision than the earlier
generation of hoofers who went on to become superlative Broadway
choreographers. (The one possible exception: Garth Fagan, the
modern dancer and choreographer whose work is integral to the
success of Julie Taymor's vision of ``The Lion King.'')
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing contemporary Broadway choreographers is not
only training but also experience. As the number of musical shows
produced each year has dwindled, and as dance has come to look like
an afterthought in the operettas that have dominated the scene, the
choreographic gene pool has all but dried up.
</P>
<P>
   No more that opportunity for Broadway gypsies to move from one
show to several others within a single season, to survive flops,
hits and road tours, to be hired and fired and to know that there
is another show casting around the corner, if not this week, then
next. No time to acquire the itch, not simply to dance well but to
create one's own idiosyncratic dance vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   If you saw Fosse's film ``All That Jazz'' (1979), a gorgeous but
self-absorbed Fellini-esque examination of the life of a director
very much like himself, you already know that he was a man given to
excess. The air he breathed was filtered through his cigarettes. He
drank too much, ate amphetamines for breakfast, loved his wife and
mistress and was faithful to neither. The film's most flamboyant
conceit: Fosse's foreseeing his own death, which was to come in
1987 when he was 60.
</P>
<P>
   Except for his fine screen version of ``Cabaret'' (1972) and
``Lenny,'' his comparatively disciplined biographical film about
Lenny Bruce, all of Fosse's movies reflect the tendency toward
excess that marked his life, though not his shows. He went a little
mad in the movie studio, like the kid who decides he is able to fly
with a parasol.
</P>
<P>
   Note ``Sweet Charity'' (1969), the first film he directed. Among
other things, the manic cross-cutting from one image to the next
and the use of gigantic real-life locations, from Lincoln Center to
Wall Street and the Brooklyn Bridge, all but swamp the adaptation
of his hit Broadway show of 1966. He effectively upstages not only
Shirley MacLaine, the star, the book by Neil Simon and the Cy
Coleman-Dorothy Fields score, but also his own distinctive
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   There is something infectiously cheeky and bold about Fosse's
movies as well as his shows. Yet his singular strength is his
choreography, which, when seen in the theater at its best, cuts to
the quick. It can make us laugh, and sometimes, without warning, as
in the final moments of ``Chicago,'' it can become unaccountably
moving. These are the gifts of the man whose work is now being
recalled on the stage of the Broadhurst.
</P>
<P>
   As a choreographer, Fosse is a satirist. He is cool, spare of
detail. At his best, he is also a brilliant caricaturist, someone
who uses a minimal number of precisely drawn lines to express the
essence of a single character, of several characters, of a whole
raft of characters, in a specific time, place and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   I remember (I hope accurately) the initial image in the Broadway
production of ``Sweet Charity'': Gwen Verdon, seen alone in
silhouette against an orange-lighted cyclorama, her weight on one
leg, her hip thrust to the other side, one arm akimbo _ a Broadway
taxi dancer waiting for a customer and waiting, maybe forever, for
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet Charity'' provides ``Fosse'' with two of the show's most
elegant sequences: the marvelously comic ``Rich Man's Frug,'' in
which Manhattan nobs, as ferret-faced as Maurice Sendak characters,
sweep around a nightclub as if untroubled even by gravity (as
choreographed by Fosse, the dancers appear to float), and ``Big
Spender,'' wherein Charity's taxi-dancer pals stand at the bar and
face the audience, alternately wheedling and intimidating their
would-be customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other memorable numbers recalled: ``Steam Heat''
from ``The Pajama Game'' (1954), ``Mr. Bojangles'' from ``Dancin'
'' (1978), ``Take Off With Us _ Three Pas de Deux'' from ``All That
Jazz,'' in which three nearly nude couples, one heterosexual, one
homosexual and one lesbian, make love, going as far as a standard
modern balletic vocabulary allows, and the foot-stomping grand
finale, ``Sing, Sing, Sing,'' also from ``Dancin'.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   My favorite: a sly, spirited take on the old standard ``Me and
My Shadow'' from Fosse's last show, ``Big Deal'' (1986), in which
Eugene Fleming, Kim Morgan Greene and Dana Moore add a sexual
dimension to the song so languidly and sentimentally sung by Ted
Lewis from the 1920s into the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat less effective, in part because they can be seen in
context next door at the Shubert Theater where ``Chicago'' is
playing: Fred Ebb and John Kander's ``Razzle Dazzle'' and
``Nowadays.'' ``Shoeless Joe From Hannibal, Mo.,'' from ``Damn
Yankees'' (1955), also isn't helped by the fact that the number was
better done in the 1995 Broadway revival, choreographed by Rob
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Maltby Jr. is the director responsible for coordinating
the many talents involved, including Gwen Verdon, Fosse's widow,
the show's artistic adviser, and Ann Reinking, Fosse's companion,
who is the co-director and (with Fosse) co-choreographer. Note that
the spiffy production was initiated and is being presented by
Livent Inc., the bankrupt Canadian company (which is also
presenting ``Ragtime''), founded by the besieged, deposed
entrepreneur Garth Drabinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Note also two other expert performers who help to make this
enterprise work: Valarie Pettiford, who is both an accomplished
Fosse dancer and a singer to shake the rafters, and that superb
dancer Scott Wise, who also sings the elegant though abbreviated
``Razzle Dazzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing so much of Fosse's extraordinary work, in such a
condensed form, also provides clues as to the identity of those who
may have influenced him. Fosse himself acknowledged his debt to
Jack Cole, the Broadway and Hollywood choreographer sometimes
credited for having created ``jazz dancing.'' ``Fosse'' also brings
to mind Charlie Chaplin, an association I had never noticed before.
If Charlie Chaplin had been a choreographer, he might have created
dances like Fosse's.
</P>
<P>
   The resemblance is remarked on not because of Fosse's fondness
for derby hats and gloves. Rather, it's because the singular
fashion in which Fosse uses the dancer's body, at rest and in
motion, so frequently evokes Chaplin mannerisms, everything from
the way the Tramp walks and stands to the way he controls his
hands, even his elbows.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference: Chaplin depends on close-ups of the Tramp's
face to verify what has already been made clear. Fosse appreciates
the full figure. The costumes he favors for his dancers, including
black leotards, have a way of deflecting attention from individual
features to allow movement to become the principal expression of
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fosse,'' you should understand, is a rich, bewitching show. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Art,'' Yasmina Reza's superbly funny French play, is clearly a
theatrical phenomenon both in this country, where it is being seen
in Christopher Hampton's English translation, and abroad, where it
is playing _ or has played _ in more than 40 countries. It seems to
be unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   At the Royale Theater in New York, Judd Hirsch, Joe Morton and
George Wendt have replaced the English cast, which earlier replaced
Alan Alda, Victor Garber and Alfred Molina, who opened the show at
the Royale last March. That company has just opened at the Ahmanson
Theater in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Another company is at the Royal George in Chicago. London, where
the play opened in 1996, is on its ninth company. Meanwhile,
``Art'' continues in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other places it has been seen: India, Peru, Belarus,
Japan and Serbia. Remember, this is a comedy about three Frenchmen,
members of the bourgeoisie, whose longtime friendship is about to
dissolve in acrimony over the acquisition by one of the friends of
a white-on-white painting. Does wit suddenly sell like kung-fu
movies? In some places, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   A return visit to the Royale to see the new cast confirms my
original reaction: ``Art,'' directed in New York as well as in
London by Matthew Warchus, is an exceptionally wise and
sophisticated work. It succeeds in being stylishly contemporary
without ever dropping brand-names or references to any celebrity
born after Seneca. Further, it is a play that seems to fit with
ease any number of good if quite different actors.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt, who is still best remembered as Norm in the long-running
sitcom ``Cheers,'' easily slips his large frame into the role of
Yvan. It's a part actors might die for: the harried friend who
helps precipitate the crisis by becoming engaged and rebelling
against his position as the comedy relief for the two other men.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch is furiously, seriously comic as Marc, the full-time
control freak. Morton is splendidly condescending as Serge, the
divorced doctor who embarks on a life as a collector by buying the
painting for a price his pals find ludicrous, 200,000 francs, or
approximately $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art'' is a delight in the economy of its construction. Running
90 minutes and played without an intermission, it never seems to
hurry but, by the time it ends, a friendship has been analyzed in
the kind of minute psychological detail you are more likely to find
in a well-written short story or novel. ``Art'' breathes as if it
had a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   There is something mysterious about writing so firm and true: it
is infinitely adaptable. After watching each of the three casts I
have seen play it, I have been convinced that no one else did it
better, or even quite the same.

<P>
   ``You could hear the howling of caged wolves'' in the Moscow
zoo, says a character who is both describing a location and setting
the atmosphere at the outset of Robert Harris' powerful new
thriller, ``Archangel,'' which, like the author's previous novels,
``Fatherland'' and ``Enigma,'' makes clever imaginative use of an
actual historical detail.
</P>
<P>
   The character is Christopher Richard Andrew (Fluke) Kelso, a
former lecturer on Russian history at Oxford who was once described
by a newspaper as ``a battered Byron,'' which wasn't bad, the
narrator says: ``if Byron hadn't died on Missolonghi but had spent
the next 10 years drinking whiskey, smoking, staying indoors, and
resolutely avoiding all exercise, he too might have come to look a
little like Fluke Kelso.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelso is in Moscow to attend a conference on newly opened Soviet
archives. One night, after delivering a paper on Stalin, he is
approached by one Papu Rapava, an old NKVD officer who was once the
bodyguard of the secret-police chief Lavrenti Beria. In Kelso's
hotel room, over many bottles from the minibar, Rapava tells a
story about the night of March 2, 1953, when he accompanied Beria
on an emergency call to Stalin's dacha just outside of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   There they found the general-secretary lying in one of his
bedrooms, immobilized by a stroke. Making sure that he was not
conscious, they found the key that he always kept on him, drove
back to the Kremlin and from a safe in his office removed certain
personal papers, including an oilskin-covered notebook thought to
contain some testament to the Soviet people. They then took the
papers to Beria's residence on Vspolnyi Street and buried them in a
toolbox in the garden. Three days later, Stalin died.
</P>
<P>
   When Kelso tells Rapava the notebook could be worth a fortune
and asks him if he can produce it, Rapava slips away without
leaving Kelso any way of getting in touch with him, except for a
few personal details and a matchbook advertising a bar. Kelso's
colleagues at the conference assure him that Rapava's story is a
classic setup for a scam like Hitler's forged diaries, which the
author of ``Archangel,'' a former television correspondent for the
BBC and a columnist for The Sunday Times of London, happens to have
written a book about, ``Selling Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kelso, already an expert on Stalin, plays hooky from the
conference to check out the details of Stalin's death and learns
that Rapava's story is completely plausible. More ominously,
Kelso's research quickly attracts the interest of several
mysterious parties, including Vladimir Mamantov, an old KGB officer
who leads a broad extremist movement calling for the revival of
Stalinist communism. Kelso soon gets caught up in an intrigue that
delivers the thrills of a Graham Greene entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing ``Archangel,'' when you think about what
happens, you find it so outlandish as to defy credibility. But
Harris makes you believe it as it's happening. What he does
particularly well is evoke the atmosphere of contemporary Russia,
not only the physical sense of it but also its threat of violent
instability, the howling of its caged wolves.
</P>
<P>
   As one character, R.J. O'Brian, an American television
journalist, explains, parroting Kelso's own views: ``Weimar
Republic, that's how I see it. Like you see it. Six things the
same, okay? One: you have a big country, proud country, lost its
empire, really lost a war, but can't figure out how _ figures it
must've been stabbed in the back, so there's a lot of resentment,
right? Two: democracy in a country with no tradition of democracy .
. . Three: border trouble . . . Four: anti-Semitism _ you can buy
SS marchin' songs on the street corners, for Christ's sake. That
leaves two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All right,'' says Kelso.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic crash, and that's coming, don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it obvious? Hitler. They haven't found their Hitler yet.
But when they do, it's watch out, world, I reckon.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course what Kelso believes is that they haven't found their
new Stalin yet, the old one having been, in his view, ``the most
alarming figure of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   As he explains in a talk to the conference: ``I say this not
merely because Stalin killed more people than Hitler although,
clearly, he did _ and not even because Stalin was more of a
psychopath than Hitler _ although, clearly, he was. I say it
because Stalin, unlike Hitler, has not yet been exorcised. And also
because Stalin was not a one-off like Hitler, an eruption from
nowhere. Stalin stands in a historical tradition of rule by terror,
which existed before him, which he refined, and which could exist
again. His, not Hitler's, is the specter that should worry us.''
</P>
<P>
   In another talk to the conference, Kelso recalls an image that
always occurs to him when he thinks of Stalin. After finishing
work, Stalin would go to the Kremlin movie theater to watch a film.
``Often, it was one of the Tarzan series,'' Kelso says; ``for some
reason Stalin loved the idea of a young man growing up and living
among wild animals.''
</P>
<P>
   After the film he and ``his cronies in the Politburo'' would
drive out to his dacha at Kuntsevo for dinner, and after dinner he
would go over to his gramophone and put on a record. ``His
particular favorite, according to Milovan Djilas, was a song in
which howling dogs replaced the sound of human voices. And then
Stalin would make the Politburo dance.'' One night, Stalin's
daughter, Svetlana, ``drawn, we might speculate, by the peculiar
noise of grown men dancing to the baying of hounds,'' put her head
around the door, and Stalin, seeing her, ``made her start dancing,
too.'' When she got tired and protested, Stalin _ and here Kelso
says he is quoting Khrushchev's description _ ``grabbed her like
this, by the hair, a whole fistful, I mean by her forelock, as it
were, and pulled, you understand, very hard . . . pulled, jerked
and jerked.''' It is this image of Stalin yanking his daughter by
the hair to the sound of howling dogs that is the key to the secret
of ``Archangel.'' From that image Harris has fashioned an adventure
that will keep you on edge until its bizarre conclusion.

OPERA SUPERSTAR IS A MOM FIRST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American soprano Renee Fleming first came to Fort Worth on the
Cliburn Foundation's recital series three years ago as an
undisputed star of the operatic world.
</P>
<P>
   She has moved up a level, to superstar. Already a regular
performer at the leading opera houses in Europe and America, she
has added a whole new dimension of name recognition as the star,
last fall in San Francisco, of the premiere production of Andre
Previn's opera ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   She has become such a big name, in fact, that 60 Minutes filmed
her during a Fort Worth recital this week for a segment to be aired
soon. But for Fleming, 39, operatic superstardom is balanced with
her more treasured role of motherhood. Separated from her husband,
actor John Shore, Fleming has refocused her career around her
relationship with her two daughters, ages 3 and 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty wonderful,'' she said last week. ``The children
ground me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she often travels with both children _ ``They love
planes, and we have a wonderful time'' _ their entry into school
years will slow the travel for all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have modified my career,'' Fleming says. Because operatic
productions require several solid weeks of work at one site, while
a recital can be accomplished with an overnight trip, she'll be
doing more recitals and fewer operas.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleming is certainly not totally tied down: The family has a
live-in nanny at its Connecticut home, the children's father is
close, amicable and involved, and Fleming has a brother and sister
who live nearby, making for an active extended family.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of high school voice teachers, Fleming grew up with
intense musical training. She trained at the Eastman School of
Music while still in high school, which perhaps pushed her a little
early, she thinks. She returned to Eastman for graduate study after
completing a degree in music education at Potsdam College in New
York. Additional graduate study followed at Juilliard and in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleming's big break came in Texas in 1988, as the Countess
in a Houston production of Mozart's ``The Marriage of Figaro.'' By
1991, she was at the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mozart has been at the heart of her repertoire, she has
become well-known to Texas audiences for Slavic roles, including
Dvorak's ``Rusalka'' in Houston and Janacek's ``Jenufa'' and
Tchaikovsky's Tatiana (from ``Eugene Onegin'') in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming continues her own studies with Beverly Johnson in New
York; she believes that a singer can never really know what he or
she sounds like. As for her own daughters, who show musical talent,
Fleming is willing to let things take their course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't push them,'' she says. ``I want them to be able to
explore.''

AT 90, BORGE IS AS AMERICAN AS A CHEESE DANISH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (lb) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Victor Borge, who learned music at his mother's knee (the family
had no piano), wasn't always 90. Often he was younger. He gave his
first concert at 8 ``or a few minutes after.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was about 12 he saw a Russian pianist in Copenhagen,
Denmark, accidentally fall off the piano bench. That was for him,
marveled young Victor (which wasn't yet his name). ``Such a cheap
slapstick thing.'' He has been doing it himself almost ever since,
although his doctors have recently warned him against it. So, he
says, ``I still don't do it.'' But of course he does, in every
show.
</P>
<P>
   Borge, the long-reigning keyboard comic who lives on a 4.5-acre
waterfront estate in Greenwich, Conn., when he is not someplace
else, has been making audiences laugh for most of the century, and
the fact that he became a nonagenarian on Jan. 3 seems no reason to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   As he says in his recent book of the same name: ``Smilet er den
korteste afstand.'' In English: ``A smile is the shortest
distance.'' Meaning, between people. (This is Borge's third book
and the only one that doesn't have hundreds of footnotes.)
</P>
<P>
   Having entertained an estimated 12 million people, and still
performing about 60 shows a year, he is planning a Broadway reprise
almost 45 years after establishing the Broadway record for a
one-man show, 849 performances. The New York Philharmonic and
leading orchestras in London, Copenhagen, Boston, Chicago,
Cleveland and Los Angeles have fallen under his baton.
</P>
<P>
   He now makes $40,000 a night, and his seven videotapes and one
semiserious compact disc (half comedy, half recital) are carrying
his art to new audiences with sales of more than 3 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, on Borge's 80th birthday, Wolf Blitzer, the CNN
correspondent, said that the Iraqi foreign minister had requested
some Borge videotapes ``because Saddam is crazy about him.'' That
left Borge uncharacteristically speechless. ``I didn't know if I
should take it as a compliment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He grants that George Burns performed older and that Jackie
Mason also recently became a solo Broadway phenomenon, but Borge
said in an interview at home, ``Let's talk about me, do you mind?''
</P>
<P>
   It takes him a little longer now to get to his feet (``My
knees,'' he groaned, ``and my nephew''), and his eyes disappear
into crinkled crescents over his snowy mustache when he laughs, but
there is nothing wrong with his timing, as visitors to his 1909
mansion (redesigned by Edward Durell Stone) run the risk of finding
out.
</P>
<P>
   Would his guests like a cup of coffee? ``I'm not offering,'' he
said, nattily attired in a blazer with pocket square and a wool
tie, ``just asking.''
</P>
<P>
   When the coffee arrived nonetheless, he steered it away from the
piano. ``You want to spill it over there?'' he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a piano _ two of them back to back, a
Steinway and a Bosendorfer. ``When I do four hands, I run around,''
he said. ``Or, with two hands, I play it twice.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Piano Acquired Its Keys
</P>
<P>
   The piano has been Borge's chief accomplice since he began
performing in Denmark more than 70 years ago, and it remains the
focus of his best-known routines. With a handkerchief plucked from
his jacket pocket, he mimed one of his stage gags, painstakingly
measuring the distance from keyboard to stool, adjusting the seat
position, remeasuring, then adjusting again. Then he sat down,
pulling the seat closer.
</P>
<P>
   In his living room he threatened to narrate a history of the
piano _ ``It's quite uninteresting'' _ beginning with the invention
of one big white key. ``People stood and played it forever. It was
not until someone invented the cracks _ that changed everything.''
He recounted the death of Debussy, trailing off with ``I don't care
_ I have my own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be the only musician who ever rhymed Shostakovich with
``just a moment.'' He also once managed to kill an errant fly that
was buzzing between his fingers as he played onstage. Backstage,
when an admirer asked whether it was hard to get the fly to come in
on cue, Borge said: ``You have no idea. In rehearsal it was two and
a half minutes late.''
</P>
<P>
   At Radio City Music Hall in 1983, he accompanied Frank Sinatra
singing ``Autumn Leaves.'' Sure enough, leaves started drifting
down, coming thicker and faster until Borge rolled his piano out of
the way and finally cowered underneath as Sinatra dissolved in
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   And who else could stumble into a piano, sound a chord with his
backside and then announce, ``I play much better by ear, I can
assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   His co-performers, including a son, Ronald, his stage manager,
who is sometimes a straight man, were traditionally kept in the
dark about his gags. ``If you prepare a lot, it doesn't work,'' the
father said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it still didn't work. The singer Sergio Franchi once
grew noticeably impatient with Borge's unscripted clowning, and two
other televised segments, written by Mel Brooks, about the 1832 hit
parade called ``Schlagerparade'' and a toreador who fights a piano,
fell flat.
</P>
<P>
   Other writers have included Alan Jay Lerner, Henry Morgan and
Neil Simon, but Borge said he always preferred to write his own
material. What he comes up with, often spontaneously, can really
crack him up. Many of his favorite lines began as ad-libs that he
then worked into his act. Routinely he assures latecomers ``You
haven't missed anything'' and chides them, ``I came from Copenhagen
and I got here before you.''
</P>
<P>
   Borge, then named Borge Rosenbaum, grew up in a musical family.
His father, a violinist, played for 35 years with Denmark's Royal
Opera Orchestra, and when he came home, Borge said, ``my mother
didn't recognize him.''
</P>
<P>
   He studied piano with Frederic Lamond, a protege of Franz Liszt,
hung around the opera and ballet and joined a variety troupe. With
the act bombing, Borge came up with a Mozart parody that was a hit.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the Nazis and His Old Name
</P>
<P>
   He was a rising musical-comedy star and film actor when he ran
afoul of the Nazis. The confrontation was predictable, he said:
``They were Nazis and I was Jewish.'' He also had trouble keeping
his mouth shut. One of his jokes went: ``What is the difference
between a Nazi and a dog? A Nazi lifts his arm.'' With the Germans
occupying Denmark in 1940, he fled with his wife, Elsie, an
American.
</P>
<P>
   Settling in California with a new name that he thought sounded
more Danish, he won a regular radio spot on the Kraft Music Hall
with Bing Crosby and performed with leading acts like the Paul
Whiteman Band.
</P>
<P>
   After the war his career soared with live performances and
increasing television appearances. He and his wife divorced _ they
had two young children and remained on good terms _ and in 1953
Borge married Sanna Roach, an artists' representative in Chicago
who had become his manager. She had a daughter from a previous
marriage, and they had two children together.
</P>
<P>
   He was knighted so often in Scandinavia, he said, that ``I
became practically a weekend.'' Queen Elizabeth told him, ``I grew
up on your records.'' He was honored by Congress and presidents. He
has performed with the ``Sesame Street'' Muppets and conducted
(serious) performances of ``The Magic Flute'' for the Cleveland
Opera and the Royal Opera in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes so long to be 90 years,'' he said, ``but it goes so
fast.'' His tone turned darker when he reflected that with all his
honors and accolades, he had never won a theater or television
award. But the moment quickly passed as Borge contemplated lunch in
a favorite restaurant, the Homestead Inn. It provided a welcome new
audience and a chance to polish his repartee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shall I get you a glass of wine?'' asked a waiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can,'' Borge answered. ``But I won't drink it.''
</P>
<P>
   He perused the menu (feigning shock that it might be the bill)
and summoned the captain. ``Do you know any good restaurants?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Borge knew what he wanted to order. ``Last time I had the half
chicken,'' he said. ``Today I'll have the other half.''

TINY TOWN STONEWALLS ROCK CRUSHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHUACANA, Texas _ Small-town pride and the interests of a
billion-dollar corporation have collided in a hilly stretch of
Limestone County, triggering a legal match that has shaken this
Central Texas hamlet of 322.
</P>
<P>
   Vulcan Materials Co., which employs 6,697 people and does $1.57
billion in sales a year, is suing Tehuacana. The town has this on
its side: an abandoned 19th century college campus, a tiny post
office and a general store.
</P>
<P>
   When Vulcan was told that it couldn't blast limestone within the
city limits, it hired one of the state's most powerful law firms,
Fulbright &AMP; Jaworski, and sued in federal court for $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama-based Vulcan is the nation's biggest supplier of crushed
stone for road paving.
</P>
<P>
   Tehuacana (pronounced Tuh-WAW-kuh-nuh), once a contender as a
site for Texas' capital, is a residential community bounded by
farms, ranches and a cutting horse operation, about 40 miles
northeast of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take pride in being a quiet peaceful town, and the rock
crushing is breaking their hearts,'' said Betty Shelton, 44, owner
of the Tehuacana General Store. ``A lot of them have tears in their
eyes when they discuss Vulcan. It's like a schoolyard bully pushing
you around.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vulcan believes that it is the underdog and Tehuacana the
oppressor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a government entity here telling us we can't work,
can't use our property,'' Tom Ransdell, 56, Vulcan's Southwest
region president, said in a telephone interview from San Antonio.
``They're the government making the laws and using powers to put us
out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Vulcan accuses the town of violating its constitutional rights.
The corporation has sued under the Fifth and 14th Amendments, which
guarantee due process.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are 160 acres _ 50 within the city limits _ of quality
limestone that would fetch roughly double the price of medium-grade
aggregate stone, Ransdell said. Shutting down would cost the firm
$25 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ransdell argues that Tehuacana allowed quarrying in the 1960s
and that Vulcan for years has safely operated in small and large
Texas cities, sometimes just a few hundred feet from homes.
</P>
<P>
   He has swayed practically no one in Tehuacana.
</P>
<P>
   Vulcan bought the operations of Smith Crushed Stone in October
1997 and acquired its mining lease. At the time, Ransdell said, he
was unaware of written assurance by Smith's Dallas attorney that it
would not quarry within the city limits. Those assurances were made
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Vulcan wants to be a good corporate neighbor, Ransdell said,
adding that his firm has repaired roads and sponsored a Halloween
health fair.
</P>
<P>
   But Tehuacana's Community Action League, a grassroots group
opposed to Vulcan, organized a boycott of the health fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only two residents from town showed up,'' David McCartney, a
retired school superintendent, gleefully reported.
</P>
<P>
   The adversaries are expected to meet in federal court in Waco in
July.
</P>
<P>
   It may not help Vulcan's case that its lawyers misspelled
Tehuacana at every mention in its 10-page lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But then, if Tehuacana's own past is any guide, the outlook is
dim. Its history is littered with disaster and disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The town was first called Tehuacana Hills after the small
Tehuacana tribe, which lived in the area but whose members were
massacred by a rival tribe in the early 1830s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1849, the town finished third in balloting to be the capital
of Texas, after Austin and Palestine. Tehuacana nearly disappeared
after Trinity University moved to San Antonio in 1902 after 33
years. A Methodist school, Westminster College, moved in, but
closed in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   The high emotions of the new legal fight have transformed the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had factions before with petty politics, bitterness and
people butting heads,'' Shelton said, standing outside her store
after cooking chicken-fried steaks for noon diners. ``The town has
come together like you wouldn't believe _ like glue dropped on
Tehuacana. It's heartwarming watching them band together.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began Dec. 8, when city leaders voted unanimously
to prohibit mining and rock blasting inside city limits.
</P>
<P>
   The vote followed rock-blasting explosions by Vulcan, which
upset nearby residents such as Henry ``Banjo'' Johns, who lives
about a quarter-mile from the operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved here because it was a quiet place,'' said Johns, 80,
whose wife, Ruby, also 80, is recovering from two strokes. He said
blasts in October rocked their mobile home and deeply upset her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting so close we won't be able to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith held the mining lease, a May 1996 explosion sent
rocks the size of small boulders into a resident's yard and onto a
county road used by school buses. The community was outraged.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Vulcan indicated that it would extend operations into
Tehuacana proper, the town decided to take no chances, said its
attorney, H. Fred Neale of Mexia, who wrote the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, any city is entitled to pass an ordinance intended
to protect citizens from operations that could constitute a danger
to people or property, or constitute a nuisance to a residential
area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the $25 million in damages Vulcan is seeking, Neale said,
``I think they're confusing limestone with gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is that the figure was meant for shock value _ an
attempt to intimidate the city and the citizens,'' he said.
``They're so big they think they can just run over this little
city. But, frankly, they've bit off the wrong little town.''

RADIO ADS PRESS SENATE ON IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A battle in the airwaves and cyberspace between
pro- and anti-impeachment groups shifts into high gear Thursday as
the Senate resumes the trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way, a liberal public policy
organization here, plans a radio advertising campaign urging
senators to end the impeachment trial. The 60-second spot begins on
the third day of testimony from Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   This joins other recent advertising and Internet efforts in an
ideological tug-of-war over how senators should handle the Clinton
case.
</P>
<P>
   The People for the American Way said its new ad ``is designed to
give voice to the majority of Americans who oppose impeachment and
feel growing frustration over Congress' continued pursuit of a
partisan goal that is not supported by the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lux, the organization's senior vice president, said the
spot is targeted at Republican senators in Maine, Rhode Island,
Vermont and Washington state. The ads will run in the major markets
of those states and in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, Friday and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking people to call and get those senators to vote
yes'' when the Senate considers a motion to dismiss the case
against Clinton. Such a motion could be heard in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The same group last month waged an unsuccessful advertisement
blitz to sway the House against impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved two articles of impeachment against Clinton
Dec. 19. The president is charged with perjury and obstruction of
justice in trying to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a
former White House intern, during the course a sexual harassment
lawsuit brought by Paul Jones, a former Arkansas government worker.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Dart, a Republican who has advised Presidents Reagan,
Bush and Clinton on disability policies, also began airing
60-second anti-impeachment ads this week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``has made the same hurtful mistake as many presidents
and millions of Americans, including me, who were not impeached,''
Dart begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building on the good work of George Bush, Bill Clinton has
empowered people with disabilities as never before,'' Dart says in
the radio spot. ``But in spite of real gains, too many Americans,
including millions with disabilities, are still shut out of the
good life. We need Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Dart's spot ran for three days in the Washington area, and he
said the ad may soon run in other markets around the country.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum is Steve Vaus, a conservative
San Diego songwriter whose spots, while they don't expressly call
for the president's removal, are anti-Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One ad features the voice of a child caught fibbing who asks the
president for help. ``Mr. President, could you call my mom? Maybe
get her just to censure me? I know you can explain lying better
than anybody,'' the child says.
</P>
<P>
   An announcer then adds, ``If it takes a village to raise a
child, the leader of that village must lead by example _ children
must know that facts matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaus' spots have aired in Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, New
York, San Diego and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The spots follow a pro-impeachment radio campaign last month by
Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate and Republican presidential
aspirant, as the House deliberated charges against the president.
In those spots aired in major markets, Forbes said that ``turning a
blind eye to presidential felonies'' poses a grave danger to the
republic.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Rosenberg, a Forbes spokesman, said Forbes had not decided
whether he will renew the ads sometime during the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to radio ads, the Internet has become a favorite
tool of groups seeking to influence the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   An organization called Move On allows a visitor to sign an
on-line petition urging senators to ``censure President Clinton and
move on to pressing issues facing the country.'' The group also
warns senators that they will pay a political price at the polls if
the trial isn't ended.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Web site of the Christian Coalition, a
conservative political organization, lets visitors sign a petition
directing senators to press ahead with the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the President does not resign, Congress has a moral and
constitutional obligation to act swiftly and remove the President
from office,'' the petition says.

HOW AMERICA'S HOTTEST TALKING FUR BALL PUTS US ALL AT RISK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story in the newspaper last week came as a shock. Dateline:
WASHINGTON _ Warning: Furbys could be a threat to national
security.
</P>
<P>
   The National Security Agency banned this Christmas season's
hottest toy from its Maryland premises. The fear was that Tiger
Electronics' little fur ball, which contains a computer chip that
allows it to learn English, could carry home top secrets from the
toy-toting personnel at the nation's supersecret spy agency _ and
repeat those secrets to enemies of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The idea appalled me. It shamed me to the core.
</P>
<P>
   You see, I'd been working with my son's Furby for weeks,
diligently following the directives in the 12-page manual and the
accompanying Furbish-English dictionary. Despite my efforts, I had
yet to understand a word the thing said. The chance of me actually
teaching it English was nil.
</P>
<P>
   So when I read the news story, my first thought was, of course,
this: Who were these superagents who could master the Furby, and
why couldn't I? My next thought was more horrifying: How had Furby
become my problem?
</P>
<P>
   Furby wasn't the only computer-chipped character to join our
family this holiday season. He's just one of a new breed of
``interactive'' toys aimed at Generation Y-ers who, even in their
diaper-wearing years, hunger for the next leap in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of my baby boomer peers, I was initially drawn to the
word ``interactive'' on the toy boxes, perceiving it as a synonym
for ``educational.''
</P>
<P>
   Look, I thought, cruising down aisle 7B at Toys R Us last month.
This Microsoft Arthur doll will play alphabet games with my
5-year-old, Hadley, to help her learn her letters. He'll even help
her play with CD-ROMs. And here in aisle 9A, what about this Stop
My Hiccups Dil? Hadley will have to problem-solve to get the baby
to be calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interactive'' seemed like a good idea on the whole, right up
until Christmas Eve. That's when I realized it was a synonym for
``go get some batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Which I did, two times that day, and two times the next, until
finally, on the afternoon of the birthday of our Lord, my kids' new
friends were all fully charged.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I heard the voice. Plaintive. Pressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy? I'm hungry! I'm hungry now! I'm hungry now, Mommy!''
</P>
<P>
   Hadley? It didn't sound like her. I mean, sure, that's exactly
what my daughter says at least 136 times a day, but the voice
didn't sound like hers.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out it wasn't. Among the gift-wrapping wreckage, I found
her _ Mealtime Magic Baby, a foot-high, ponytailed prima donna who
can't get enough of the plastic cereal and ice cream on her little
pink highchair tray. And won't stop asking.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Arthur, who looked so smart in his
classic-nerd glasses and indeed seems to know a lot about important
issues such as Groundhog Day and Thomas Edison, but is also prone
to telling you completely inane things. ``Dog drool,'' he says.
``That's gross.''
</P>
<P>
   As the day went on, I learned what ``interactive'' really means.
It means ``interruptive,'' or even ``interminably annoying.''
Because the thing about these new smart toys _ of which Furby is
the unofficial poster child _ is that they don't just respond to
your child's actions, they keep responding long after your kid has
dumped them and moved on to other pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   They won't stop talking.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they nag.
</P>
<P>
   Furby wasn't the only nagger in our house, but he was by far the
worst. We began keeping him inside my bedroom closet, the darkest
part of our house, because if light hit his sensor-eyes, he'd start
talking, issuing a stream of Furbish nonsense that suggested he
wanted to play.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, 8-year-old Jack would eagerly try to decipher
the noise, abandoning his self-conscious, what-if-my-friends-saw-me
stance to cradle his black furry baby, feed it from a pink plastic
spoon that he borrowed from Meal Time Magic and smile expectantly
into the green, glassy eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ay-tay moi,'' Furby would say, as his ears bobbed up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Furby,'' Jack would reply, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   Then Furby would close his eyes. He'd start sneezing, or
snoring. And eventually Jack would give up.
</P>
<P>
   It went on like this for weeks, during the long days of
Christmas vacation. Jack was becoming increasingly disappointed
with his interactive toy's inattention.
</P>
<P>
   One night, I decided I couldn't stand these pathetic scenes any
longer. The little fur ball's time had come. Whether he liked it or
not, Furby was going to be fun.
</P>
<P>
   I scanned his instruction booklet for some interactivity ideas.
Hide-and-seek! That sounded simple. The book said to cover and
uncover Furby's eyes four times and then he would say, ``Hide me!''
Three minutes after one of us hid him, Furby would start making
sounds, giving clues to his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   On the sixth try, the game worked, which led us to the
inaccurate assumption that it might work again. The manual
suggested shaking him from side to side and asking him to pay
attention, which I regret to say, I did. Furby went to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Nine times.
</P>
<P>
   I tried clapping to make him dance. I tried patting his back to
make him purr. I kissed his plastic yellow nose when I thought he
might have said ``May-tay//kah.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked up and Jack was looking at me sympathetically. ``You
know,'' he said, ``my friend Jackson has a Furby, too. He says it's
a menace and keeps it in a corner of his room hidden by a bunch of
water bottles so he doesn't have to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when I read that news story last week, I thought this all
through. And the truth finally became clear.
</P>
<P>
   America's hottest toy may or may not be a threat to national
security. But Furby is, without a doubt, a threat to our national
sanity. .MDBR/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on

GREENSPAN TRASHES CLINTON PLAN TO PUT SOCIAL SECURITY IN STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Wednesday trashed President Clinton's plan to invest government
funds in the stock market in order to produce more revenue for the
Social Security retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the proposal could hurt the U.S. economy and it
was risky to allow government money to be invested in the stock
market because there was no way to insulate investment decisions
from ``political forces,'' raising the prospect that specific
investment decisions could be influenced by non-financial
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not support the investment of government funds in private
equity markets,'' Greenspan told the House Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Greenspan also:
</P>
<P>
   _ Opposed any major tax cuts, a cherished goal of congressional
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Called the U.S. economy's performance ``sparkling.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Warned that current high stock prices were unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Clinton
proposed investing 62 percent of the projected $4 trillion federal
budget surplus over the next 15 years in the stock market. Any
revenues from the investments would be used for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Workers would be able to set up individual retirement accounts
with government funds. Investors would have a choice of investing
in a handful of stock and bond funds along with adding their own
money to such accounts.
</P>

   Individual retirement accounts, or IRA's, allow people to save
money for retirement while receiving special tax treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the current Social Security system is changed it will run
out of money in about 2030 when the number of retirees is projected
to be greater than the working population. Social Security
recipients receive money from current workers, a system that
functions as long as there are more workers than retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he supports using federal budget surpluses to
strengthen Social Security, but suggested that the market for
government securities is a more secure place to invest public funds
because the government guarantees payment on its securities.
Historically, government securities have been less risky but slower
growing.
</P>
<P>
   He also voiced a philosophical objection to pouring federal
money into the stock market, arguing such a move could hurt the
economy by interfering with private market forces in deciding which
companies to fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve chairman agreed that the Social Security
System needed to be repaired but he offered few suggestions on how
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan chaired a federal task force in the early 1980s that
recommended a series of changes to Social Security, which helped
keep the system from going broke at the time.
</P>
<P>
   While the Social Security issue is expected to receive more
attention in Congress this year, Republicans are also eying the
budget surplus for tax cuts. A major component of their legislative
package is a plan to cut federal income tax rates by 10 percent.
This, for example, would lower the 28 percent tax bracket to 25.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this particular stage with the economy doing well...we
don't need a tax cut,'' Greenspan said. He said the best medicine
to ensure the long-term health of the economy is to use the budget
surplus to pay off a portion of the $5 trillion debt.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, if Congress can't keep its hands off the surplus,
the money should be used for tax cuts rather than new spending
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan called the U.S. economy's performance ``sparkling''
and said he has yet to see signs of any economic slow-down.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Greenspan said, ``some moderation'' in the economy
might be needed to bring the economy back to a point where it
doesn't threaten to spark inflation, or a rise in prices.
</P>
<P>
   A slowdown in the economy is likely if the stock market cannot
sustain what Greenspan called its ``unusual'' recent gains in the
face of weaker corporate profits. Corporate profits help determine
individual stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he doubted that the market could maintain its
current high level. A flattening or drop in the market would likely
dampen consumer spending, which has been the main force behind the
economy's recent strong performance.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street generally reacted positively to Greenspan as he
signaled that the Federal Reserve wasn't likely to change interest
rates any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up more than 75 points
after Greenspan's remarks but ultimately closed down 19.31 points
to 9,335.91. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 4.61 to 1,256.61, and
the Nasdaq composite index rose 7.32 to 2,415.49.

GREENSPAN TRASHES CLINTON PLAN TO PUT SOCIAL SECURITY IN STOCKS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Wednesday trashed President Clinton's plan to invest government
funds in the stock market in order to produce more revenue for the
Social Security retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the proposal could hurt the U.S. economy and it
was risky to allow government money to be invested in the stock
market because there was no way to insulate investment decisions
from ``political forces,'' raising the prospect that specific
investment decisions could be influenced by non-financial
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not support the investment of government funds in private
equity markets,'' Greenspan told the House Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Greenspan also:
</P>
<P>
   _ Opposed any major tax cuts, a cherished goal of congressional
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Called the U.S. economy's performance ``sparkling.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Warned that current high stock prices were unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Clinton
proposed investing 62 percent of the projected $4 trillion federal
budget surplus over the next 15 years in the stock market. Any
revenues from the investments would be used for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Workers would be able to set up individual retirement accounts
with government funds. Investors would have a choice of investing
in a handful of stock and bond funds along with adding their own
money to such accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Individual retirement accounts, or IRA's, allow people to save
money for retirement while receiving special tax treatment.

FIBER MAY NOT HELP PREVENT COLON CANCER, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass.) (lb) 
 By SHERYL STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been nearly three decades since Dr. Denis
Burkitt, a British missionary surgeon who studied the differences
in diseases between poor Africans and affluent Westerners,
postulated that the Africans' high-fiber diet protected them
against colon cancer. He spread his thesis as dietary gospel,
prompting millions to change their diets.
</P>
<P>
   Now the largest study ever to examine Burkitt's theory has found
that, at least when it comes to preventing colon cancer, all those
fruits, vegetables and cereals don't do any good.
</P>
<P>
   The research, conducted by a team from Harvard University and
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, tracked the eating habits
of more than 88,000 female nurses over 16 years and found that
women who ate a high-fiber diet were no less likely to develop
colorectal cancer or polyps, which can be a precursor to cancer,
than women who ate little fiber.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were, for the most part, the same no matter what
type of fiber the study subjects ate, or how fastidious their
habits _ whether they smoked or did not smoke, whether they dined
on fatty steak or lean tofu, whether they exercised regularly or
sat on the couch and watched TV.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers and others commenting on their findings noted
that the study had its limitations. For example, many scientists
believe that men and women respond differently from each other to
dietary fat and fiber, and the study group involved only women.
Still, the new study adds to research suggesting that when it comes
to colorectal cancer, the benefits of fiber have yet to be proved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really can't substantiate a protective effect of fiber on
the rates and risk of colon cancer,'' said Dr. Charles Fuchs, a
medical oncologist at Brigham and Women's and the lead author of
the study, which appears in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine. ``That is not to say that fiber is not a good
thing. It is still helpful, but not for colon cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, experts were quick on Wednesday to urge Americans to
continue to eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains,
primarily because those fiber-rich foods protect against the
leading killer in the United States, heart disease _ a fact widely
advertised by cereal makers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a high-fiber diet has been shown to prevent other
types of cancer, including cancer of the mouth, pharynx, larynx,
esophagus and stomach, according to Dr. Michael Thun, vice
president for epidemiology at the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   None of these, however, are as common as colorectal cancer,
which kills more Americans _ an estimated 57,000 in 1998 _ than any
type of cancer except lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While experts say the best way to prevent colorectal cancer is
to undergo regular screening, some interviewed on Wednesday were
unconvinced by the findings of Fuchs and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that Burkitt's hypothesis might indeed be true but
was difficult to prove through a study that relied, as the Boston
research did, on participants to accurately recall their own eating
habits. They also said that other factors, such as consumption of
sugar, which has been associated with an increased risk of colon
cancer, could have affected the results.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is an experienced group. It's a study with a strong
design. But it is by no means the last word on the subject,'' said
Dr. Arthur Schatzkin, senior investigator in the nutritional
epidemiology branch of the National Cancer Institute. ``It is
possible that there really is a true relationship between fiber
intake and colorectal cancer, but it is just that the epidemiologic
tools that we use are too crude to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The final word, Schatzkin said, will come after scientists
conduct controlled clinical trials comparing cancer rates in people
who eat fiber-rich diets against those of people who do not.
</P>
<P>
   He is conducting one such study: the Polyp Prevention Trial,
financed by the cancer institute. It began in 1991 and involves
2,000 people; half have been eating a specially designed high-fiber
diet, while the other half have eaten as they normally would.
Schatzkin said he is currently analyzing the results.
</P>
<P>
   The findings in the current New England Journal article were
drawn from the Nurses' Health Study, which since 1976 has been
chronicling the health and habits of 121,700 female registered
nurses. The nurses, who were 30 to 55 years old when the study
began, were sent detailed questionnaires about their eating habits;
the questionnaires were updated every two to four years.
</P>
<P>
   For their research, Fuchs and his colleagues divided the women
into five groups according to their median intake of fiber in 1980.
They then studied only those women who maintained a consistent
fiber intake for the next six years _ 88,757 nurses in all _ and
tracked them until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While the average American eats 13.3 grams of fiber per day, the
fiber intake among the nurses averaged 9.8 grams in the lowest
quintile and 24.9 grams in the highest. (A bowl of oatmeal contains
about 4 grams.)
</P>
<P>
   During the 16-year study period, 787, or roughly 0.9 percent of
the study population, developed colorectal cancer. An additional
1,012 women were found to have benign tumors among 27,530
participants who underwent procedures to detect them.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of patients who developed colorectal cancer was
relatively consistent among the five groups. But there was one
curious finding: When the researchers looked at the cancer rates
according to the type of fiber the women ate, it appeared that
those who ate the most vegetables actually increased their risk of
colon cancer by 35 percent. Fuchs, however, said this finding was
probably a result of chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect was small but statistically significant,'' Fuchs
said. ``I don't make much of it. I certainly would not tell anybody
to be concerned about vegetables.''

[HEAD MISSOURI LAWSUIT ACCUSES HOG PRODUCER OF POLLUTION KANSAS
CITY, Mo. _ Accusing Premium Standard Farms of a long history of
polluting Missouri streams, state officials on Tuesday sued the
company, which is the state's largest hog producer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in Jackson County Circuit Court, asks that
the company be ordered to cease its hog breeding operations until
the court approves a new system to manage hog wastes.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses the Kansas City-based hog producer, the
nation's third largest, of repeated hog-waste spills, failing to
report many spills and spraying excessive amounts of hog wastes
onto farmland.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asks for $10,000 in fines for each day that the
company operated in violation of state law. The facilities cited
for pollution are located in Mercer, Putnam and Sullivan counties.
</P>
<P>
   Premium Standard Farms ``has failed in its obligation to obey
the law, to not despoil the environment, and to be a good neighbor
to those Missourians whose families have been farming this land for
generations,'' said Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   A Premium Standard Farms' spokesman declined Tuesday to comment
on the specific allegations in the lawsuit but pledged to cooperate
with state officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premium Standard Farms accepts responsibility for our
environmental performance, and we're going to cooperate fully with
the attorney general and the Department of Natural Resources,''
said Charlie Arnot, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Arnot added that the company has initiated significant
improvements in its operations. The most important, he said, was
the recent decision to hire an outside engineering company to
conduct annual pollution audits of its operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company will respond in legal filings to the specific
allegations in the lawsuit, Arnot said.
</P>
<P>
   Premium Standard Farms has 18 hog farms and 131 hog waste
lagoons in north Missouri. By state permit, the company can spray
or inject each year more than 750 million gallons of hog wastes
over 45,000 acres of north Missouri farmland.
</P>
<P>
   If the court were to uphold the state on all counts and impose
the maximum fines, Premium Standard Farms could face hundreds of
thousands of dollars in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Sierra Club cheered the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company, a chronic and habitual polluter, has run out of
time,'' said Ken Midkiff, the Sierra Club's program director.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Christen, a Sullivan County farmer and director of Citizens
Legal Environmental Action Network, said his group was ``encouraged
that this action will bring about fundamental and lasting change in
the attitude and management of this corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Christen's group has filed federal lawsuits against Premium
Standard Farms and its majority owner, Continental Grain Company,
accusing the company of water and air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Several specific violations of Missouri law were cited in the
state's lawsuit filed Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   - Thousands of gallons of hog wastes were spilled into Spring
Creek in May and December of 1997. The May spill wasn't reported to
the state for more than 16 hours.
</P>
<P>
   - At least 11 other hog waste spills in 1996 and 1997 were not
reported to state officials until December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   - As recently as last year, the company was applying hog wastes
onto farm lands at rates in excess of what is allowed by its state
permits. Excessive rates, which can lead to pollution of nearby
streams, were applied on at least 145 separate sites.
</P>
<P>
   - The company's irrigation system is poorly constructed and in
violation of its approved construction permits, which may have led
to spills.
</P>
<P>
   - The company's nursery, known as Summers Multiplier, is in
violation of state permits, housing more pigs than the state
authorized. It also operated for two years without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that waste spills and the frequent and
intense odors from the Premium Standard Farms facilities constitute
a public nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   For their neighbors, Premium Standard Farms' hog operations have
produced a ``profound negative impact on the quality of their lives
because of the uncontrolled stench that comes from tens of
thousands of pigs whose manure and urine are unreasonably
handled,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's office had been negotiating with Premium Standard Farms
for at least a year. But talks broke down last month, Nixon said,
when his office learned that company had continued to spray hog
wastes on farmland in violation of its permits, even as
negotiations continued.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Missouri environmental leaders were gathering
evidence that they said showed that the company's facilities were
``an environmental mess,'' an allegation that Premium Standard
Farms disputes.
</P>
<P>
   After the Missouri Sierra Club and the Citizens Legal
Environmental Action Network gave state regulators copies of
videotapes made at Premium Standard Farms, state officials pledged
last week to inspect the company's facilities with a special team
of state experts, including engineers, geologists and biologists.
</P>
<P>
   That team's inspections are expected to begin soon, said Nina
Thompson of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Continental Grain Co. bought controlling interest in
Premium Standard Farms. The new operation, still called Premium
Standard Farms, includes Continental's farms in three other
northern Missouri counties.

[HEAD CHAPLAIN'S PRAYER CRITICIZING CLINTON CAUSES RUCKUS IN KANSAS
SENATE TOPEKA, Kan. _ A guest chaplain's prayer that criticized
President Clinton touched off a minor controversy in the Kansas
Senate on Tuesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the objections to the Senate prayer by Gene Price,
pastor of Word of Hope Church in Larned, came from Senate
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every citizen is entitled to express their opinions,'' said
Senate Democratic leader Anthony Hensley of Topeka, ``but a prayer
is offered to give spiritual inspiration, not political
agitation.''
</P>
<P>
   In his prayer, Price said: ``Lord, we stand before you, a nation
in need, with a president in need. I'm interceding to see the
floodgates of deception, unfaithfulness, lies, broken oaths and
covenants stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interceding on behalf of those disappointed, disillusioned
and discouraged: those destined to be future leaders of our land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely, the power and influence of leadership is our ability
to reproduce what we are in others. Heaven help us, as our children
become the mirror image of what we see in our land.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Dick Bond, an Overland Park Republican, did not
defend the content of the prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wouldn't have given that prayer,'' he said. ``It
sounded somewhat critical of the president. I'm not sure the prayer
is the appropriate place to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, however, added that he had no intention of prescribing the
day's Senate prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Salmans, a Hanston Republican, invited Price as a
guest chaplain. The Senate's regular chaplain, Fred Hollomon, will
return to his post today. Each Senate session traditionally opens
with a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Price said he had no idea his prayer would generate
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just asked to come and pray my heart,'' he said, ``and
my heart has been broken by the situation we find ourselves in.''

JUSTICES RULE STATES MUST GET FEDERAL APPROVAL BEFORE CHANGING
ELECTION METHODS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in a victory for civil rights
groups, ruled Wednesday that the Voting Rights Act requires
counties to get federal approval before changing their election
methods, even if the state has never run afoul of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The justices Wednesday also considered whether a panel of three
federal judges was too quick in ruling that North Carolina
legislators illegally redrew a voting district to give black voters
more clout. A lawyer for the state told an apparently divided court
that the district was drawn for legitimate partisan reasons and not
for unlawful race-conscious motives.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision marked a victory for Hispanic voters
in California who claim their voting strength was sapped when a
state law consolidated Monterey County's three judicial districts
into one about 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The state had successfully argued in a lower court that the
county did not need prior approval from the attorney general or a
federal judge, as the Voting Rights Act generally requires, because
the law's regulations do not apply to California.
</P>
<P>
   The Voting Rights Act prohibits states and local jurisdictions
from diluting the voting strength of minorities. States and
localities found to have discriminated against minorities are
considered covered under the law and may change their voting
methods only with the prior approval, or ``preclearance,'' of the
attorney general or a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, citing the Voting Right Act, said a county
like Monterey, which is covered under the 1965 law, must get
federal approval whenever it ``seeks to administer'' a change in
its election practices. In its decision, the high court rejected
California's argument that the constitutional framework of
federalism, which limits federal authority over states, prohibits
the U.S. government from questioning the election law of a state
that is not governed by the Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, the court said, the 15th Amendment gives
Congress the explicit authority to prevent discrimination in
voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have recognized that the act, which authorizes federal
intrusion into sensitive areas of state and local policymaking,
imposes substantial federalism costs,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
wrote in the court's majority decision. ``Recognizing that Congress
has the constitutional authority to designate covered jurisdictions
and to guard against changes that give rise to a discriminatory
effect in those jurisdictions, we find no merit in the claim that
Congress lacks 15th Amendment authority to require federal approval
before the implementation of a state law that may have just such an
effect in a covered county.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining O'Connor's opinion were Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter and John Paul
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Monterey County has been under the jurisdiction of the Voting
Rights Act since 1971, when the federal government concluded that
the county illegally required would-be voters to pass a literacy
test before they could cast ballots in the 1968 presidential
election. California was not implicated in the unlawful test, and
the federal government does not require that the state's voting
changes be approved prior to their adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's sole dissenter, noted the
law's distinction between covered and uncovered jurisdictions. He
said covered counties need federal preclearance only when the
voting changes are a direct result of the policy choices of county
leaders, not state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It follows that Congress intended to subject to federal
preclearance only the policy decisions made by jurisdictions that
it found to be the perpetrators of the evil'' of voting
discrimination, Thomas wrote. ``California has never been found to
satisfy the coverage test and therefore is not one of the
perpetrators that the law is designed to thwart.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, agreed that Monterey County needed federal approval
before changing its election method but disagreed with the court's
finding that California lawmakers initiated the change. Monterey
County leaders sought to alter its election method and then urged
the California legislators to give them the legal authority to do
so, not the other way round, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the county had discretion in the way it would change
its voting method and, as a result, needed federal approval first,
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   In the North Carolina case, the state's attorney argued that a
controversial 1997 redistricting plan was designed to preserve an
equal number of Democratic and Republican districts in the state.
The fact that black voters were highly represented in the 12th
congressional district, the voting area at issue in the case, was
an unintended result of that effort by Democrats, argued the
attorney, Walter Dellinger.
</P>
<P>
   But a panel of federal judges rejected that argument, ruling
summarily 2-1 that the state legislature, in redrawing the
district, violated the Voting Rights Act's prohibition on
race-conscious districts.
</P>
<P>
   Urging the justices to overrule the judicial panel, Dellinger
argued that District 12 is ``very sensible'' and that its unusually
narrow shape results not from an unlawful effort to increase the
number of black voters but from the region's dense population.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice Scalia said that federal judges, looking at the
odd shape of the district, could conclude the state ``goes too
far'' in saying that race was not a motivating factor in the
legislature's decision to redraw the district.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Robinson Everett, pressing the case of North Carolina
voters challenging District 12, urged the justices to uphold the
judicial panel's summary judgment in the voters' favor.
</P>
<P>
   Everett said state legislators were using ``code'' words when
they argued before the judges that the goal in redrawing the
district was to ensure Democratic strength. They really wanted to
preserve the voting strength of African American Democrats in an
effort to ensure the election of African-American candidates, and
the judges recognized that, Everett argued.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Souter suggested that the judges should have
conducted a trial before issuing their ruling because there is a
legitimate dispute between the state and the voters regarding
whether race was a motivation for the redrawn district.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is expected to render its decision in Hunt vs.
Cromartie by July.

   Some of the most obscure and most fascinating sites on the Web
can be found almost exclusively sticking to its soft underbelly, in
Web rings. Take, for example, Tales of Fur and Fiber
(members.aol.com/daknits/index.html), run by Rachel Hecht, which
includes a page of superstitions about knitting.
</P>
<P>
   With the Webmaster's Himalayan cat, Firkin, and Maltese dog,
Oliver, as guides, we learn: ``Knitting for children you may have
in the future, but before you are pregnant, is bad luck.'' ``If you
knit one of your own hairs into a garment, it will bind the
recipient to you.'' ``Don't knit a pair of socks for your boyfriend
or he'll walk away from you!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hecht, who lives in North Miami Beach, Fla., joined her site
with the Free Knitting Patterns Web Ring
(www.geocities.com/Paris/9197/knitring.htm), part of Webring.org.
It includes material from the Knit List, an online knitting group.
</P>
<P>
   Someone desperate to find superstitions about knitting (and
isn't everyone, at one time or another, during this brief time on
earth?) would be out of luck in all but one of the major search
engines. Alta Vista picks up the Fur and Fiber site. But other
search engines turned up uninspiring results or nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   The searches produced many hits on the ``Innuendo'' album by the
rock group Queen. The album includes ``knitting'' and
``superstition'' in its lyrics, and the occasional mention of
Madame LaFarge, the knitter from Dickens' ``Tale of Two Cities.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the Web Ring site, there was just one ring devoted to
knitting, and the superstitions were easy to find by browsing
through the list. So where else could one learn this crucial
information: ``Stabbing your needles through your yarn balls brings
bad luck to anyone who wears something made from that yarn''? Let
the wearer beware.

 &HT;    WITNESS: A MICROSOFT MONOPOLY WOULD CHARGE $2,000 FOR WINDOWS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If government theories about Microsoft's monopoly
power were on the mark, the software giant would be selling its
Windows operating system for 40 times its current price, or $2,000
a copy, an economist appearing for the company testified Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schmalensee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
made what he called ``this reasonable inference'' near the close of
a tough four-day cross-examination by Justice Department lawyer
David Boies at the Microsoft antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been retained to perform an economic analysis, and I'm
giving that estimate because I believe it,'' Schmalensee told an
incredulous Boies. ``I value my reputation very highly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really think that (estimate) makes sense?'' Boies
persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' the witness answered. ``But that's because
Microsoft faces long-term competition and isn't free to charge
whatever it wants for Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   When Boies asked the witness what share of Microsoft's profits
came from Windows' sales, the economist said the firm's accounting
system does not distinguish between the money it makes from Windows
and from its various applications programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since both software streams share lots of common costs,''
Schmalensee said, ``that data doesn't exist.'' Besides, he added,
``Microsoft's accounting system isn't all that modern. They enter
sales of their operating system by hand on sheets of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Boies had focused on how Microsoft limits the freedom
of personal computer makers to change how Windows appears when it
first boots up on about 90 percent of all machines begin sold
today. Windows licensees, for example, are barred from hiding or
removing access to Microsoft's Internet browser.
</P>
<P>
   If a computer maker ``gets unhappy with Microsoft, does it have
anywhere to go?'' Boies asked Schmalensee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run,'' the answer is no, the witness said. But he
added, ``I was just five feet away from Michael Dell a few weeks
ago when he said: 'We sell what our consumers want. And if
consumers don't want Windows, then we won't sell Windows.' ``
</P>
<P>
   But the benign view held by the founder of Austin-based Dell
Computer Co. wasn't reflected in an indignant e-mail to Microsoft
from an executive at Hewlett-Packard Co., the world's second
largest computer company, complaining about the licensing limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a choice of another supplier, based on your actions
in this area, I assure you you would not be our supplier of
choice,'' wrote John Romano, a manager at Hewlett-Packard. He
maintained that Microsoft's restrictions caused ``significant and
costly problems'' for his firm.
</P>
<P>
   Shown the message, Schmalensee called Romano ``clearly an angry
person.'' However, he said ``channel conflict'' is a fact of life
in the business world whenever a manufacturer's rule rubs a
distributor the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be surprising ... if Microsoft, in reducing the
freedom of action in some respects, didn't cause them upset,''
Schmalensee said.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony from Paul Maritz, Microsoft's vice president of the
platforms and applications group and a key decision maker in the
browser wars with Netscape Communications Corp., is now due to
begin Monday. Through e-mail messages entered into evidence
throughout the long trial, Maritz has already emerged as a key
figure in the proceedings.

COURT STRUGGLES OVER THE ROLE OF RACE IN DRAWING VOTING DISTRICTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court took up an issue Wednesday that
has bedeviled it several times in this decade: whether a state
legislature's redrawing of a congressional district was an attempt
at racial gerrymandering or merely an exercise in plain old
politics.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was North Carolina's 12th Congressional District,
containing parts of Winston-Salem, which critics have said was
drawn with racial factors as the predominant consideration _
something the high court has ruled unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A group of white plaintiffs filed a suit in federal court
alleging that the North Carolina legislature drew the district's
boundary lines in 1997 in an effort to get minority candidates
elected, violating the equal protection clause of the 14th
Amendment, which bans racial favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina argues that it was trying to draw a congressional
district where Democratic voters would be in the majority. The fact
that the new district was heavily African American was merely a
coincidence, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Last April a U.S. District Court ruled 2-1 that the 12th
District was unconstitutional primarily because the legislature had
excluded many adjoining precincts that were heavily Democratic but
not largely African American.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time in seven years that the high court has
examined the North Carolina district. Over the decade it has ruled
on similar cases from Texas, Louisiana and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th District case offers the justices an opportunity to
clarify their position on how large a role race can play _ or
whether it can play any role _ in drawing congressional districts.
State legislatures around the country will begin the process of
redistricting their states after the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the court has limited itself to saying only that race
cannot be the ``predominant factor'' in drawing a new district.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's oral argument, Robinson O. Everett, the lawyer
for the whites who claim they were discriminated against in the
drawing of the district, told the justices, ``If you look at the
precincts around the 12th district, it's obvious that race was the
motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The legislature drew a district where African
Americans would be elected and then gave reasons after the fact to
cover their real motivation,'' Everett said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David Souter asked him to explain why a top state
statistician in North Carolina concluded that statistically, the
legislature's decision was just as likely to be based on political
affiliation as race.
</P>
<P>
   Everett seemed perplexed at first, then said, ``I believe his
conclusions are beside the point, since I'm trying to argue that
the state is using politics as a cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Solicitor General Walter E. Dellinger, arguing for
the state of North Carolina, said, ``The 12th district wasn't drawn
on the basis of race but on fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the legislature was trying to create a
Democratic-leaning district in a ``sea of Republican'' voters.
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger also addressed Everett's contention that adjoining
Democratic precincts with white majorities were kept out of the
12th District. He said these precincts, while appearing heavily
Democratic because a majority of voters were registered Democrats,
were, in fact, evenly split between the parties and, at times, were
Republican strongholds. The reason, he said, was that in these
precincts, registered Democrats routinely voted Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Everett and the (U.S.) District Court relied only on
registered voter numbers, but if they had bothered to look at the
voting records of these areas, they'd know that they were not
Democratic precincts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department attorney James Feldman argued that the case
against North Carolina has little merit because the redrawn 12th
District is not majority African American.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how best to deal with past discrimination has
deeply divided the court's nine justices who remain at odds over
the role race and ethnicity should play in crafting remedial
measures ranging from affirmative-action programs in schools and
the workplace to efforts to create voting districts where
minorities predominate in order to help Congress better reflect
America's ethnic diversity.
</P>
<P>
   During much of the 1990s, the justices have often split 5-4 over
these issues in favor of more conservative approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The slim conservative majority, emphasizing the 14th Amendment's
equal protection of all Americans regardless of race, has ruled
repeatedly that if any race-based formula is used in redistricting,
it must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.
</P>
<P>
   In none of the major redistricting cases that the court decided
in this decade has a state met that standard.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's arguments, one of the court's most
conservative members, Justice Antonin Scalia, appeared to pushing
for an end to any consideration of race in redistricting. ``If a
legislature decided to keep a couple of black precincts out of a
district to make sure a white person was elected and then said,
`Well, race was just the final factor,' that wouldn't be allowed,''
Scalia said. ``That type of stuff isn't allowed in the workplace,
so why should it be all right here?''

 &HT;    Brazilian currency crisis causes earnings decline for BellSouth
Corp.
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. warned Wednesday that its earnings
will sag by about $172 million during the current quarter as a
result of the Brazilian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that first concrete sign the exchange crunch is hitting
home, BellSouth again vowed to stick with a multibillion dollar
strategy aimed at exploiting Brazil's huge economy as it
modernizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced our Latin American investments will continue
to be a growth engine for us as we enter the new millennium,'' said
BellSouth Chairman Duane Ackerman in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dramatic fall in the value of the Brazilian real is
making payment on a $1 billion debt much more expensive for BCP,
the Brazilian subsidiary that is 46 percent owned by $23
billion-a-year BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   With several Brazilian partners, BellSouth has licenses to offer
wireless service in two regions. The service has racked up more
than 1 million subscribers _ most in Sao Paulo, a city of
approximately 18 million.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth and its partners were lucky to have spent much of the
money needed to build those systems _ hundreds of millions of
dollars on switches and cell sites _ before the currency crisis
hit. Still, BellSouth estimates the currency crisis' impact on
first quarter earnings at 9 cents per share. An average of analyst
predictions made before Wednesday's announcement put first quarter
earnings at 45 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Marten, analyst at Edward Jones &AMP; Co., said the currency
crisis appears to be a short-term problem for BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real value of those investments is the high population
growth in Brazil and Latin America. What we are really looking for
are the earnings from ongoing operations, because that is more
indicative of operations going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, whose economy is twice the size of Mexico's, is seen as
the key to the economic health of the region. The country is also
the flagship of BellSouth's international strategy, which includes
eight other Latin countries, as well as several properties in
Europe. BellSouth and its partners spent more than $2.5 billion
just winning the licenses needed to provide service in Brazil,
betting it can recoup far more than that by satisfying a pent-up
thirst for telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   And while analysts expect Brazil to go through some rough months
_ perhaps even years _ few predict a calamitous downturn. Short of
a full-scale depression, analysts believe BellSouth's wireless
business will keep growing.
</P>
<P>
   A series of devaluations have barely slowed down BellSouth's
wireless business in Venezuela, said BellSouth spokesman Al
Schweitzer. ``What that tells us is to hang in there, provide
quality services, satisfy the marketplace and it's going to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth will report earnings Monday for the fourth quarter of
1998. An average of analyst projections puts those profits at 41
cents per share for the quarter and $1.63 a share for the year.

 &HT;    Atlanta ranks No. 3 on best place for high-tech workers,
magazine says
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service ATLANTA _ Atlanta is the third best
<TEXT>
place in America for information technology workers, according to
Computerworld magazine's annual ranking.
<P>
   ``It's booming with industry, growth and jobs, jobs, jobs,'' the
magazine said of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of technical support, help desk and response centers
and consulting firms in the metro area has created huge demands for
systems integrators, systems consultants, client/server software
developers and Internet and networking experts, the review said.
</P>
<P>
   And professionals in those kinds of jobs are commanding top
salary. Annual salary for a senior systems analyst in Atlanta?
About $75,000 to $80,000 in a town where the cost of living is
relatively low.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, with its plethora of universities such as Harvard and
MIT, was the best place for IT workers who can basically call their
own shots. Chicago ranked second.
</P>
<P>
   T E C H T O W N S
</P>
<P>
   Best cities for high tech job seekers:
</P>
<P>
   1. Boston
</P>
<P>
   2. Chicago
</P>
<P>
   3. Atlanta

 &HT;    Fortune looks at cause of 'finished at 40' culture
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Experience may be the best teacher, but if Fortune
(Feb. 1) is right it doesn't count for much any more in U.S.
business. ``Today, for many people, the longer you've been at one
company, the more disposable you are,'' senior writer Nina Munk
says.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on technology, on pressure to produce, on demographics
_ whatever the cause, ``in the new economy, experience and the
skills that come with age now count for less and less.'' One New
York employer is quoted as saying he can hire ``a smart, raw kid
right out of undergrad'' for $40,000 to $50,000, who will work
seven days a week for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, he says, is to pay twice as much money to
``some 40-year-old who does half the amount of work, has been
trained improperly and doesn't listen to what I say.'' This
attitude is creating what Fortune calls a ``finished at 40''
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund scorecards
</P>
<P>
   It's mutual fund analysis and ranking time in the business
press:
</P>
<P>
   Smart Money (February) reminds us 1998 was the worst year for
mutual funds in this decade, with just 12 percent of domestic stock
funds outperforming the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is that, like professional baseball, there are
so many more funds now than in 1990 there isn't enough management
talent to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Money (February) makes a case that 1999 may be the year that
funds come out of their slump and outrun the indexes. Analyst
Michael Sivy says managers will catch up with stocks of smaller
companies and emerging markets, which have trailed blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   Ho-hum, more stocks?
</P>
<P>
   Tired of those dull stocks, bonds and mutual funds? Why not add
some spice to your portfolio by investing in alpacas, llama-like
South American animals highly valued for their wool? That's a
suggestion from P.O.V. (February), which notes that conventional
investments are necessary, but just aren't as much fun as offbeat _
but profitable _ items.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggestions? Race horses, vintage wine, antique musical
instruments, Broadway (or off-Broadway) plays, classic cars.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ This is a good time for a career change, Working Woman
(February) says, listing 20 ``hot careers.'' The opportunities come
from recent cutbacks due to economic turmoil in 1998, which created
a shift in demand for labor.

HOLLYWOOD GETS READY TO SET OSCAR-MANIA IN MOTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't long ago that the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association's Golden Globe Awards were considered the most
irrelevant and tarnished of all the annual movie awards _ the one
prize that a shrewd producer could actually ``buy'' by wining and
dining the right journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But in the '90s, that has changed. Ever since some pundit first
noticed that the Globe nominations tended to be an uncanny
bellwether for the Oscar nominations, they've steadily grown in
credibility _ and importance. So when they take place Sunday night
at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, Hollywood definitely will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   And attending. Since the ceremony takes place five days before
the polls close for Oscar nominations, the Globes also have become
the major campaign platform for the Academy Awards. It's accepted
now that an especially gracious or charming showing by a winner _
or presenter _ on Sunday night can well be the deciding factor that
sways the vote of an undecided Academy member.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Globes also have come to unofficially mark the
opening of the 1999 Oscar campaign season: one that picks up speed
the next day, when the Screen Directors Guild announces its
nominations (which usually match four out of five of the Oscar
nominations); and on Tuesday, when the Screen Actors Guild and the
American Society of Cinematographers announce their nominations.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the Writers Guild of America nominations on Feb. 3,
the American Cinema Editors ``Eddie'' Awards nominations on Feb. 5,
and, of course, the Academy Awards nominations, which will be
announced at a nationally televised news conference on Feb. 9, at
the ungodly hour of 5:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Oscars really switch into high gear, and the
battalion of critics, pundits, soothsayers, Wall Street analysts
and Las Vegas oddsmakers who follow every beat of the competition
will be scrutinizing the results and readjusting their predictions
when the various guilds announce their awards: the writers on Feb.
20; the cinematographers on Feb. 21; the directors on March 6; and
the screen actors on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for the next two weeks, the television networks, CNN, E!
Entertainment Television and the various classic-movie cable
networks will all join in a frenzy of Oscar-mania and predictions
that will last right up to the moment the Oscar parties start and
the little gold statues of the 71st annual Academy Awards are
handed out at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   After all the analysis and backslapping, can there possibly be
any suspense left by the time Oscar night rolls around? And don't
we already know that ``Saving Private Ryan'' is going to be the big
winner? (As Variety quoted one Academy member last July, ``Should
we just FedEx the Oscars over to Spielberg's house now and save
everybody the trouble of voting?'')
</P>
<P>
   Actually, yes, there should be a considerable amount of suspense
nine weeks from now _ maybe as much as in any Oscar night of the
'90s. And no, while it's still the clear best-picture front-runner,
Spielberg's ``Ryan'' no longer seems to have the lock on the
evening that ``Titanic'' did last year or ``Schindler's List,''
``Forrest Gump'' or ``The English Patient'' did in their years.
</P>
<P>
   The year-end critics awards _ the most important pre-Golden
Globe Oscar indicator _ gave decidedly mixed signals this time. The
New York Film Critics and L.A. Film Critics handed their best
picture honors to ``Ryan,'' but the National Board of Review picked
``Gods and Monsters'' and both the Boston Film Critics and the
National Society of Film Critics chose the quirky caper picture,
``Out of Sight.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong critical showing and likely best-picture nomination
of Terrence Malick's ``The Thin Red Line'' (released in January but
officially a '98 film) also diminishes the Spielberg movie's air of
invincibility, based on the theory that Academy members inclined
toward World War II movies will split their vote between the two
very different epics.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, it could leave the door open to one of the underdog
pictures that will be fighting it out for the other three
best-picture slots, in the same way ``Chariots of Fire'' upset
``Reds'' in 1981. Based on the Golden Globe nominations, this could
be ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``Elizabeth,'' ``Gods and Monsters,''
``The Truman Show'' or perhaps even ``Bulworth'' (which was more
popular in Hollywood than it was in the rest of the country).
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Spielberg seem to have his name engraved on his second
directing Oscar. He won the L.A. Film Critics prize in that
category, but the New York Film Critics gave their directing nod to
Malick for ``The Thin Red Line'' (indicating another split could
occur here), and the National Board of Review gave the honor to
India's Shekhar Kapur for ``Elizabeth.'' Not to be counted out are
Steven Soderbergh for ``Out of Sight,'' John Madden for
``Shakespeare'' and Peter Weir for ``Truman.''
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner for the best-actor Oscar is no longer Tom
Hanks, who was blanked by the critic associations for ``Ryan,'' but
Ian McKellen, who took the L.A. and several other critics' prizes
for ``Gods and Monsters.'' Nick Nolte won the New York Film Critics
award for ``Affliction,'' and got the best notices of the all-star
cast of ``The Thin Red Line.'' So he has momentum, and a long track
record that deserves recognition. Also in the running are Jim
Carrey for ``Truman'' and Warren Beatty for ``Bulworth.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the best-actress race, for which ``Ryan'' has no
candidate, may be as wide open as it's been anytime in Oscar
history. Fernanda Montenegro (``Central Station''), Ally Sheedy
(``High Art''), Cate Blanchett (``Elizabeth'') and Cameron Diaz
(``There's Something About Mary'') have all won major
critic-association awards, and Emily Watson (``Hilary and
Jackie''), Gwyneth Paltrow (``Shakespeare'') and Meg Ryan (``You've
Got Mail'') also seem strong contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the air of suspense come March 21 is the fact that the
Academy is presenting an honorary award to director Elia Kazan,
who, despite his legendary career, has never been forgiven by much
of Hollywood for naming names in the McCarthy communist witch-hunt
era. When he won his last best-directing Oscar in 1954 (for ``On
the Waterfront''), he accepted it from New York. This time he'll be
in person. Will he be booed?
</P>
<P>
   There also is the matter of the Oscar-night host, an honor that
fell this year to Whoopi Goldberg after Billy Crystal turned it
down several weeks ago. In her two previous outings, Goldberg
proved to be competent but a pale second to Crystal, whose quick
wit and self-deprecating humor has made him the natural successor
to Bob Hope and Johnny Carson in the Oscar-host Hall of Fame. Will
this third time be the charm for Whoopi? Or the curse?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the greatest suspense of all about Oscar '99 may be
over how the public responds to its change of day, from Monday to
Sunday night. On the surface it seems like a great idea: allowing
an earlier start (5:30 p.m.), and a whole day for the networks to
build the audience with lead-in shows. ``But you never know,'' one
Oscar publicist confided to me. ``Since 1959, Oscar has been handed
out 32 times on Monday night. People have been programmed to think
Oscars and Monday and rush home from work. Let's just hope they
remember to turn back their watches.''

<P>
   A thermometer is a long, thin glass tube filled with mercury --
a simple device designed to give a reading of the temperature of
its surrounding environment. When the environment becomes warmed,
the mercury rises. When it becomes cooler, the mercury descends. At
a glance you can know how warm or cold the air is around the
thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many people operate like a thermometer. Instead
of mercury, their self-esteem may rise and fall according to the
``temperature'' of other people's opinions of them. When others
think highly of them, these people tend to feel good about
themselves. When they are criticized, their opinion of themselves
may drop to a low, cold level.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Roosevelt, former first lady in the United States,
stated an important truth to remember. ``No one can make you feel
inferior without your consent.'' Think carefully about these words.
You are under no obligation to let the world decide how you are
going to feel about yourself. You have the right and the
opportunity to discern the events in your life and judge yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism may take on many forms, the majority of which seem
petty and trivial. And criticism, whether directed toward us or
coming from us, can be a deterrent to progress and may lead us into
discord and trouble.
</P>
<P>
   By feeling confident and enhancing the positive qualities in
others we may actually be revealing our own fine qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us may have been raised giving others a great deal of
control over our feelings. But, as we grow, it's important to learn
that how we feel about ourselves, in spite of the opinions of
others, can be an essential ingredient of a happy life.
</P>
<P>
   If you allow people the power to set or adjust the thermostat of
your self-esteem, you may find yourself at the mercy of their
opinions. Your happiness could then seem to depend on many
conditions over which you have no healthy inner control.
</P>
<P>
   How you feel about yourself can determine, to a large extent,
your experience of life. You cannot afford to surrender control of
your feelings to the whims of others. If you know persons who seem
to be going through life constantly miserable, and for no apparent
reason, it may be likely that they have relinquished power over
their feelings. Like a thermometer, they simply reflect the world's
opinions. They have handed over to others the power to judge
themselves, and this state of powerlessness often creates a high
level of tension and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the thermometer, you can take your own ``temperature.''
You can feel good about yourself and your life, despite what others
think. No one knows you or your capabilities as well as you do.
Therefore, it is important that you be in charge of how you feel
about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Be open enough to learn from others, but make a commitment to
stay in control of your feelings about yourself and your estimate
of your worth. What works wonderfully well for a thermometer can
prove to be disastrous for you.
</P>
<P>
   If you find that you have put someone else in charge of your
self-esteem, begin making a simple statement like the following to
set you free: ``Today, I feel good about myself despite what others
say, think, or do. I am the master of my feelings and hold that
authority in my life today!''
</P>
<P>
   Self-knowledge may be difficult to obtain because the tendency
to self-protection may seem so great. But it is in looking squarely
at our own feelings and possible shortcomings that we may be able
to see the work that needs to be done to bring about transformation
in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Once the decision is made about a ``weak spot'' -- whether it be
a ``short-fuse'' temper, feelings of unworthiness, feelings of
being inferior, or whatever -- we can engage ourself in thinking
about the opposite quality.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you desire to curb feelings of inferiority,
think about the desirability of a pleasant disposition and feeling
confident of the spirit within you. You can give your thoughts and
feelings a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   When you live from the center of your own being, life can become
much more productive and joyful at the circumference.

   MUSICAL-MAKEOVERS (subslug) (New York) _ The birth of a new
musical: it's all so ``Act One,'' all so invigorating. Hey, hold on
a sec. Did I say new? The show in question is ``Annie Get Your
Gun,'' and while the frantic pre-Broadway preparations, with
Bernadette Peters as pistol-packin' Annie Oakley, are indeed
occurring in 1999, the date on the musical's copyright is 1946.
Although it was a critical and popular success in the 40s, running
on Broadway for 1,147 performances, the show, with music and lyrics
by Irving Berlin and book by Herbert and Dorothy Fields, has long
been considered unrevivable, in large part because of its
hopelessly outdated portrayal of Indians. The solution that the
show's producers, Fran and Barry Weissler, came up with for ``Annie
Get Your Gun,'' which begins previews on Feb. 2 at the Marquis
Theater on Broadway, is one that has become increasingly common in
musical theater: wholesale renovation. ``Basically, it's a new
book,'' said Peter Stone, the veteran librettist, with credits
stretching from ``1776'' to ``Titanic,'' who was hired to bring the
structure and sensibility of ``Annie Get Your Gun'' into line with
musicals of the late 1990s. By Peter Marks. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   STANDUP-COMEDIANS (New York) _ There's only one thing more
humiliating than being a stand-up comic. And that's trying to be a
stand-up comic. That's the lesson I learned after six months trying
to make it as a comedian. Ask Jerry Seinfeld, Rosie O'Donnell or
any successful stand-up: the bottom rung of the comedy ladder can
be uglier, crueler and more demeaning than in any other line of
entertainment _ be it actor, model, musician, writer or clown.
Sexism and racism run rampant, club-owners ask struggling comedians
to scrape gum off the bottom of tables to get a booking,
competition between comics is fierce, and newcomers have to pay to
perform. By Neil Strauss. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   DRY-CLEANING-FILM (Paris) _ Miou-Miou, 48, has appeared in good
films and bad, hits and flops, yet for 25 years France's affection
for her has not wavered. True, being loved has been no guarantee of
good screen roles or healthy box-office returns. Yet, for an entire
generation of French moviegoers, she remains reassuringly familiar.
Her very stage name, Miou-Miou, given to her by a lover when she
was barely 18, makes her sound like the gamine next door. Her
latest film is Anne Fontaine's ``Nettoyage a Sec,''or ``Dry
Cleaning,'' which was well received in France 15 months ago and
opens on Feb. 5 in New York. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-SEX-FILMS (Undated) _ When it comes to issues of sexual
identity, European films can be difficult for American viewers to
talk about or even understand fully. We assume that Europeans,
whose leaders can carry on extramarital affairs without falling
from grace, are more sophisticated, more laissez-faire about sex in
general and, specifically, about the blurring of hetero-, bi- and
homosexuality. But we can't quite figure out how they achieve this
nonchalance. By Will Joyner. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   BALLET-BRITISH-COLUMBIA (Vancouver, British Columbia) _ Back in
1985, when the latest of a series of West Coast balletic phoenixes
rose tentatively from the ashes of Pacific Ballet Theater, nothing
so ambitious as a passport appeared on the agenda for the new
Ballet British Columbia. It was to be a Vancouver-based company
with a regional mission, to bring ballet to the various centers of
its home province. Less than a decade later, the company was
dancing at Whitman Hall at Brooklyn College, where it was
characterized by Anna Kisselgoff in The New York Times as ``a
handsome group of 16 classical dancers whose bold demeanor evokes
the tough, frank manner of contemporary ballet troupes in Europe.''
In its return one-week New York engagement starting Tuesday at the
Joyce Theater, the program will consist of contemporary Canadian
works, according to its artistic director John Alleyne. By William
Littler. 9Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   AKALAITIS-THEATER (New York) _ Ms. JoAnne Akalaitis, 60, has
been called a theater radical whose work grows increasingly
distilled, profound and challenging, as well as a bloodless
modernist who disrespects Shakespeare, debases the Greeks and
shamelessly distorts Jean Genet and Tennessee Williams. The
symbolist gestures she favors _ sometimes her actors move in a kind
of slow-motion Kabuki style or fall to the ground as if pulled by a
demonic force _ have been celebrated as inspired and decried as
gimmicky. Fans say her penchant for updating classics makes them
see the works anew; critics complain that she has a narrow academic
vision and that her changes are gratuitous and distracting. Ms.
Akalaitis is currently working on the ``The Iphigenia Cycle.'' By
Nancy Hass. (Moved). Photo.

   GERMAN-SONGS-CLASSES (New York) _ At a lecture before a recent
lieder recital in Los Angeles, Graham Johnson made a case for
balkanizing Schubert, after a fashion. Johnson, a piano
accompanist, scholar and teacher based in London, suggested that
the six songs Schubert wrote to texts by Heine included in the
posthumous song cycle ``Schwanengesang'' be split off and viewed as
a free-standing work. The idea is vintage Johnson, unconventional
yet compelling. Monday, at the Juilliard School, Johnson begins a
series of five master classes for singers and accompanists focusing
on German song. By David Mermelstein. (Moved).

   POP-MUSIC

<P>
   VERNON-DUKE-MUSIC (Undated) _ There is something so improbably
consoling about the sadness at the heart of the best Vernon Duke
melodies. This redemptive afterglow could be a consequence of sheer
melodic sophistication; Duke knew how to construct a song,
elegantly, with surpassing craft and harmonic flair. An
aristocratic White Russian emigre turned Broadway songwriter, he
seems to have had a rather good time of it all, dressing with
notorious sartorial dash, charming in a polyglot of romance
languages chorus girls and theatrical producers alike. Among some
of his popular songs were ``Autumn in New York,'' ``April in
Paris'' and ``I Can't get Started.'' By Barry Singer.

   ART
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-INDIAN-ART (Undated) _ Thirty years ago, the Philadelphia
Museum of Art presented a ground-breaking exhibition titled
``Unknown India: Ritual Art in Tribe and Village.'' Organized by
the art historian Stella Kramrisch (1896-1993), it brought together
work from outside India's ancient classical traditions. Much has
changed since the 1960s. Qualitative distinctions between fine art
and folk art have been rethought. Vernacular art is taking its
rightful place in elite collections. Maybe that's why the small
exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum until Feb. 3, ``Threads of
Cotton, Threads of Brass: Arts of Eastern India and Bangladesh from
the Stella Kramrisch Collection,'' carries a thrill of delight
rather than a shock of surprise. The show is, in a sense, a reprise
of ``Unknown India'' three decades later and in miniature. By
Holland Cotter. (Moved).

   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   TV-DILBERT (Culver City, Calif.) _ If anyone in the television
industry is afraid of corporate downsizing, it is UPN. The
struggling four-year-old broadcaster is widely seen to be on the
verge of eradication after a string of hitless seasons and notable
public relations fiascoes, like last season's ``Secret Diary of
Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a very short-lived alleged Civil War satire.
For public consumption, network officials grit their teeth and deny
it, but it is widely believed in the industry that the success or
failure of ``Dilbert'' an animation show by Scott Adams, will be a
definitive marker of UPN's ultimate _ or, ominously, short-term _
viability. By Andy Meisler. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-FAMILY-GUY (Los Angeles) _ One of the things Seth MacFarlane
liked about animation when he was growing up was the way it
elasticized reality. Anvils dropped without consequence and skunks
sang in French, creating a sort of pluperfect pliability where he
could retreat from a world in which people treated him, shockingly,
like a child and enter one where he was in complete control. There,
in the manner of a visiting deity, he spoke for everyone, he had
all the money in the world, and a thought never entered anyone's
head that he didn't put there. This was, of course, perfect
training for Hollywood, where MacFarlane _ now 25, but still
growing _ remains in almost complete control of the new world he
has created: an animated half-hour comedy called ``Family Guy''
that will have its premiere on Fox next Sunday following the Super
Bowl. By Bruce Newman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-COMEDY (Moscow) _ It's not hard to make fun of what is
happening in Russia these days. New jokes about the new rich (now
the new poor after last summer's sudden financial crisis) are
posted on the Internet. President Boris Yeltsin's fumbling speech
is always an easy laugh. There may be more comedy routines about
bank failures than there are solvent banks in Russia. But real
humor _ the deep, biting, funny-sad satire that makes Russians
laugh, usually at themselves _ has become rarer, or at least so
says Mikhail Zhvanetsky, the country's premier stand-up comedian
and humor writer. By Celestine Bohlen. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NY-RUSSIAN-COMEDIANS (New York) _ Everyone's a comedian. Wander
along the boardwalk in Brighton Beach, as a team of young immigrant
comics does for their twice-monthly television show. Shove a
microphone at any ordinary-looking guy in a fur hat. Has he got a
joke for you? Has he got a joke for you! Humor, the elixir that
helped relieve the aches and pains of life in the former Soviet
Union, has survived the Russian immigrants' voyage to Brooklyn. Not
only are the streets filled with wags; the Russian newspapers are
filled with page after page of jokes. The Russian-language
television and radio station, WMNB, broadcasts two locally produced
comedy shows. Transplanted Russian comics work the private-party
circuit, while the most successful of the New York City immigrant
troupes, Kanotiye, fills the 600-seat National restaurant in
Brooklyn every time the group opens a new variety show. By Susan
Sachs. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   MEDIEVAL-ARCADE-ANTIQUES (New York) _ A few months ago, Ward and
Co., New York dealers of ancient and medieval art, sent out a
lavish, fold-out booklet of photographs to display some of the rare
objects from its collection. Most of the objects were from
prehistoric or classical times, but an arresting one was from the
medieval world: an arcade, or arch, from a 12th-century Romanesque
choir screen from the church of the Abbey of Cluny in Burgundy.
This architectural fragment was enticing because it conjured up an
entire structure yet stood on its own as a piece of sculpture. By

NASA REPORTS DELAYS IN SPACE STATION, OBSERVATORY SCHEDULE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ NASA expects an additional delay of at least two
months in Russia's scheduled late July launching of the third
component of the U.S.-led international space station, agency
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency also disclosed another round of difficulties
with its giant new Chandra X-ray space telescope, a setback that
will force at least a five-week postponement in the anticipated
April 8 launching of the observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the developments pose a significant disruption to
NASA's plans to launch a half-dozen space shuttle missions this
year, four of them linked to the construction of the new space
station. Three of the four depend on the Russian service module
launching first.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-foot-long service module is taking longer than initially
anticipated to complete ground tests of its hardware components and
computer software at its Moscow production facilities, said James
Hartsfield, a spokesman for NASA's space station program office.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian contribution to the station will furnish the
life-support equipment and living quarters for the first crew of
three astronauts and cosmonauts. They are expected to become the
first residents of the new outpost sometime in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's chronic financial difficulties since joining the United
States, Europe, Japan and Canada in the station project in 1993
have stalled construction of the module. It was initially scheduled
for launching in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The first components of the new station were successfully
launched by the Russians and Americans in November and December.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
arranged for an unscheduled $60 million payment to the financially
ailing Russian space agency to ensure it could complete the
assembly at the Khrunichev State Research and Production Center in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an issue of getting the module built,'' Hartsfield
said Wednesday. ``The schedule has been pretty aggressive. The
testing will require additional time in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers tentatively plan to ship the module to Russia's
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in March rather than February.
Additional launch site preparation will push the service module's
liftoff from late July to late September, though the schedule will
be reassessed by NASA in March.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled August launching of a U.S. shuttle crew to prepare
and equip the service module for occupancy will slip into the fall
of the year as well. It is too soon to judge how much shuttle
station assembly flights planned for October and December will be
affected, Hartsfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, newly discovered problems with electronic circuit
boards in NASA's $1.5 billion Chandra X-Ray Observatory will delay
plans for the year's first shuttle mission.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandra observatory had been scheduled for an August 1998
launching aboard the shuttle Columbia when computer software
difficulties forced a long delay.
</P>
<P>
   The four-story spacecraft appeared to have cleared those
obstacles earlier this month as TRW, its California-based
manufacturer, announced the observatory was ready for shipment to
NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida and an April 8 liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   However, late last week the company discovered faulty copper
circuitry in the electronics components of another satellite. The
circuit boards were similar to those installed aboard the Chandra,
said Ken Ledbetter, who heads the spacecraft development division
of NASA's office of space science.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency directed TRW to replace some boards and
evaluate others for potential replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This potentially was very critical to our mission,'' Ledbetter
said. ``We are very pleased we found this problem before we got any
further along.''
</P>
<P>
   Evaluations of circuit boards in six electronics components
aboard the observatory are under way. As of mid-week, one of the
boxes has two of the potentially faulty boards that merit
replacement. One box has been cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially, 22 boards in five boxes may require replacement,
warranting an even longer delay in the Chandra launching, Ledbetter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra is the third of NASA's great observatories, which
include the Hubble Space Telescope launched in 1990 and the Compton
Gamma Ray Observatory launched in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The new telescope was designed to give ground-based astronomers
their best views yet of the activities associated with mysterious
black holes and other high energy celestial objects.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member crew of the shuttle Columbia that will launch
Chandra is led by veteran astronaut Eileen Collins, who would
become the first woman of any nation to command a spaceflight.

   STATEOFUNION-SURPLUS (Washington) _ After a transition year in
which both parties struggled to shift from an era of crippling
federal budget deficits to an anticipated age of fiscal plenty, the
battle has at last been joined over how the country should allocate
the flood of excess money streaming into Washington. In short, the
debate is whether nearly all the surplus will be needed for the
twin pillars of the social welfare system, Social Security and
Medicare, as Democrats assert, or whether there is plenty to take
care of those looming problems and still return much of the surplus
to the people in the form of tax cuts, as Republicans say. By

   STATEOFUNION-REPUBS (Washington) _ Prominent Republicans around
the county said Wednesday that President Clinton's State of the
Union message was an unsettling reminder that the party cannot
compete with the president's political skills and that the
impeachment trial could only further endanger their electoral
prospects in competitive states. By Richard L. Berke. (850 words)
</P>
<P>
   STATEOFUNION-GREENSPAN (Washington) _ In testimony before a
House committee today, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said that he
supported the president's notion of putting 62 percent of the
government budget surpluses over the next 15 years into Social
Security reserves, but he said that the plan to have the government

Public Schools were considered the worst in the nation. But in
Tuesday's State of the Union address, President Clinton held them
up as a model. Specifically, Mr. Clinton singled out the school
system's elimination of the practice of promoting students even if
they don't meet their grade's academic standards, just so they can

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ President Clinton rebutted Republican criticism
of his Social Security rescue scheme Wednesday at a jubilant
campaign-style pep rally staged by a venerable Democratic machine
to buoy the embattled chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by Vice President Al Gore, first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Tipper Gore, the president touted the centerpiece of
his State of the Union address to an enthusiastic audience in an
industrial, working-class city that supported the Clinton-Gore
ticket in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this one hell of a party or what?'' Erie County Executive
Dennis T. Gorski shouted at the boisterous crowd of 21,790
ticket-holding guests in the hockey arena used by the National
Hockey League's Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton disputed GOP criticism of his Social Security plan that
he announced Tuesday night, cautioning Americans against GOP
suggestions that the projected 15-year, $4.4 trillion federal
budget surplus ought to be used for tax cuts rather than diverted
to bailing out the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound good if somebody says, `This is your surplus and
we ought to give it back to you,''' Clinton said. ``But you ought
to ask yourself ... how are families going to deal with the
retirement of the baby boom generation?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conceded his proposal ``is not as popular as what others
can tell you,'' cautioning: ``Others can say, `We've got this
surplus now, I just want a tax cut. I'll give it back to you,
you'll figure out what to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before a House committee in Washington, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan trashed the president's plan to
invest government funds in the stock market in order to produce
more revenue for the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the proposal could hurt the economy and said it
was risky to allow government money to be invested in the stock
market because there was no way to insulate investment decisions
from ``political forces.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton respected
Greenspan's concerns, adding: ``We are committed to working with
Congress to make sure that any Social Security investments are made
by independent, private-sector managers without political
interference.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said if the White House and Congress could strike a deal
to use $2.7 billion of the projected budget surplus for Social
Security, it would spare the next generation the burden of
underwriting the retirement of the 76 million Americans born in the
post-World War II baby boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to squander this moment,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his fellow White House travelers were visibly moved
by the enthusiastic reception in chilly Buffalo, the first
campaign-style rally in months that involved both the Gores and
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, praising her husband's focus on the nation's
challenges during his presidency, said she didn't care ``what the
weather forecasters say, there isn't any warmer place in the United
States than this community right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The president opened his 46-minute address, saying the audience
had gotten so excited that it had ``melted the snow for a mile
around this arena.'' Clinton thanked the audience at the conclusion
``for one of the great days of my presidency, here.''
</P>
<P>
   The president made only an indirect reference to his struggle to
combat threatened Senate conviction on two articles of impeachment
lodged by the House. He began speaking here in Buffalo about 25
minutes after White House counsel Gregory Craig who opened the
second-day of the president's three-day defense before the
100-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was ``flattered'' by Gore's suggestion that he
had deflected GOP proposals with the same knack that Sabres' goalie
Dominik ``The Dominator'' Hascek uses to turn aside shots.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``those flying hockey pucks in Washington,'' Clinton
quipped: ``I just wish one day they would give me a mask and a few
pads when I dodge that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton struck a wistful note at another point, noting that the
six years since his Jan. 20, 1993, inauguration ``have been _ to
put it mildly _ quite eventful.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the audience said they obtained tickets through ties
with the Democratic Party, Democratic politicians, labor unions and
political organizations with ties to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Clinton flew to Norristown, Pa., to address
another rally.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Buffalo audience left the arena with the same
opinions of Clinton that they came with. Gloria Elmer, a retired
kindergarten teacher from East Aurora, N.Y., who is active in the
League of Women Voters, said Clinton remains ``a great leader who
has done what's right.
</P>
<P>
   Added Elmer, who was wearing a straw boater hat wrapped in a
banner that said, ``The will of the nation is for Bill'': ``How
could people get so worked up about all that foolishness of a young
woman going after a married man? Nothing new about that!''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Kovaka, a homemaker from East Aurora, N.Y., who called
herself a Democratic activist, said Clinton has done more for women
than all the presidents before him. ``If Mr. Starr thinks that the
women of America could be fooled, he's wrong. Leave the president
alone. We love what he has done; we love what he wants to do. Let
him get back to the business of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   It was independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report on Clinton's
conduct that prompted the House impeachment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Judson, a computer analyst from Buffalo, said he attended
the rally to show his support for Clinton. ``This is where Buffalo
stands _ with the president,'' Judson said. ``An attack on this man
is an attack on the presidency. We're tearing down our country from
within.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sandra Schintzius, 54, a Georgia-born mother of five who has
lived in Buffalo for 31 years, said she was a Republican who
attended out of curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he did in his State of the Union was hand out lollipops _
how tough can that be?'' said Schintzius, who said she voted for
the Republican presidential candidates over Clinton in 1992 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Schintzius said she wanted Clinton to resign or to be removed
from office by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's clean house for the new millennium,'' Schintzius said.
``Our nation cannot afford not to make a statement about the
insidious spirit of lying from the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Clinton paraded their opposition outside the arena.
Several held signs aloft, demanding: ``Resign now.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights organizations, however, staged a large show of
support. An abortion doctor who was slain in his home last year
lived in nearby Amherst.

MARKET PLACE: NISSAN WELCOMES ALL BIDDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Japan, Germany)  (mk)

<P>
   TOKYO _ For sale: A piece of the world's sixth-largest car
company. Excellent engineering and technical capabilities. Some $20
billion in debt, but a fixer-upper with promise. Interested parties
may apply to Yoshikazu Hanawa, president of Nissan Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Hanawa has embarked on a sales campaign never before seen in
Japan and perhaps in the world. Nearly every day for more than a
week, Nissan's leonine president has been hawking his company,
welcoming one and all to make a bid.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly the subtle tap on the shoulder one would expect
from a Japanese executive, but then, these are not subtle times for
Nissan. The company's predicament _ carrying a staggering amount of
debt at a time when it has lost ground in its two major markets,
Japan and the United States _ is glaringly obvious, and the
stronger yen and rising Japanese interest rates have only increased
pressure on the company to act.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Renault SA, the rejuvenated French car company that is
reaping the fruits of a corporate overhaul, is the only potential
partner that has publicly acknowledged an interest in the company.
After Nissan's operation in Britain leaked news of the overtures,
Renault confirmed that it was indeed talking to Nissan _ and other
carmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Renault embarked on an extended fact-finding mission
on several Japanese vehicle manufacturers, according to bankers,
including Suzuki Motor Corp. and Fuji Heavy Industries, a Nissan
affiliate. ``Clearly, they're interested in Japan, but what in
Japan, no one knows for sure,'' one banker said.
</P>
<P>
   After subtracting debt, Renault has cash of about $1 billion,
according to analysts, which would buy it a little more than 10
percent of Nissan at current market prices. (Shares of Nissan here
have edged up 3.5 percent this week. In New York, its American
depository receipts _ each representing two shares of the company _
closed Wednesday at $7.25, down 25 cents.)
</P>
<P>
   Under Japanese law, a shareholder must own at least 33.4 percent
of a company to win board representation and veto power, and given
Nissan's well-documented history of foot-dragging, a potential
buyer would presumably want that kind of control at the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean a purchase is out of the question. Renault
could, of course, use new shares as currency, but that would not
help Nissan pay down debt and would dilute the holdings of
Renault's shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler AG and Ford Motor Co. have also been rumored to
have an interest in Nissan. Speculation that Juergen Schrempp,
chairman of DaimlerChrysler, is taking an offer with him to Tokyo,
where he is attending an exhibition of Daimler technology at the
end of this week, is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Neither DaimlerChrysler nor Ford has sought to dispel such
speculation, but Nissan has said it has yet to receive any offer.
Indeed, the company has quite directly said that it has as yet had
no concrete discussions about any kind of equity purchase with
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler clearly has designs on the global market, and
Asia remains a huge gap in its plans. Mercedes-Benz cars continue
to sell well in Japan despite the recession, and Chrysler has built
test models of slimmed-down minivans that would be perfect for the
Japanese market. Conceivably, some of Nissan's excess capacity,
currently at about 35 percent, could be switched to production of
Mercedes and Chrysler vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler has been negotiating with Nissan since May over
the disposition of Nissan Diesel Motor Co., a troubled truckmaker
in which Nissan owns a 39.8 percent stake. The negotiations have
dragged on and on _ first, because DaimlerChrysler wanted more
detailed financial information and, second, because the information
it obtained made it wary.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler is now more comfortable with the numbers, but it
has asked Nissan Diesel's bankers, led by Industrial Bank of Japan
and Fuji Bank, to forgive some of the truckmaker's debt. Debt
forgiveness is not unheard of in Japan, but it is unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is expected to hold a news conference on Friday, but it
has no plans at this point to announce a sale of Nissan Diesel to
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ford already has a relationship with Nissan. It produces some
Nissan vehicles in the United States in an alliance that has been
so-so for both partners, and it rents Nissan's shuttered Zama
production plant southwest of here and uses it as an inspection
site for its cars.
</P>
<P>
   But it also owns 33.4 percent of Mazda Motor Corp., a company
once caught in the same bind that now grips Nissan, but on a much
smaller scale. Ford won the right to install its own executives and
has managed to cut costs without layoffs, which are anathema in
Japan. Mazda has cut procurement costs, frozen wages and paid down
debt, making more gross profits per car now than it did a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone through such an exercise, does Ford now want to do
it again on a much grander scale? Does it need to?
</P>
<P>
   Hanawa has some goodies to sell that would be attractive to any
buyer. For starters, Nissan presents a golden opportunity to
establish a rather large beachhead in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   And despite its problems, Nissan is still respected for its
engineering prowess and technological skills. Nissan boasts some
150 alliances with carmakers around the world that have sought its
engineering expertise. Its strained budget has been most apparent
in the design of its cars, which has been, in a word, boring. But
their quality and performance is still among the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the company owns big chunks of real estate that
were acquired decades ago and are still carried on the books at
more or less their original prices. It also has a hefty stock
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Woodworth, an independent auto analyst, has scoured the
company's Japanese financial statements. He believes the company
values its total fixed assets and real estate at about $7.5
billion, which he regards as being well under their present value.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take a lot of sales to put a dent in Nissan's debt,
which ranges between $24 billion _ excluding potential leasing
liabilities _ and $39 billion if those liabilities are included.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Redl, an analyst who follows auto-parts makers at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo, has a novel suggestion for
potential buyers. ``If people are interested in Nissan's
technology, they should consider buying one of its parts makers,''
he said. ``That's where the technology resides anyway.''

<P>
   ECATEPEC, Mexico _ The priests of Our Lady of Fatima parish have
few resources, so they can offer friendship and faith but little
else to the glue-sniffing teen-agers, jobless fathers and battered
young women of this sprawling shantytown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life here is intolerable for those who don't have the
liberating power of religion,'' said the Rev. Salvador Vasquez, who
walks the dirt streets visiting bedridden parishioners who lie
coughing from the industrial smoke blanketing this settlement north
of Mexico City. ``We teach how Christ liberates mankind from sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when Pope John Paul II made his first trip to
Mexico, priests across Latin America were preaching another kind of
liberation _ liberation theology, a revolutionary creed that held
military dictatorships and capitalist exploitation responsible for
the region's poverty and injustice. It was so powerful a message
that it helped set off the revolutions that shook countries like
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   But when the pope returns to Mexico this week, liberation
theology is not on the agenda because its suppression has been a
central campaign of his 20-year papacy. Fighting one of the most
bitter religious battles of modern times, the Vatican has closed
seminaries, censored church texts and discredited hundreds of Latin
American church leaders who taught the insurgent interpretation of
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The church conservatives have asserted that liberation theology
boils down Christ's spiritual teachings to a crude sociological and
often socialist critique of the contemporary world, and in some
places incites the poor to class warfare.
</P>
<P>
   One symbol of the conservatives' triumph is Cardinal Norberto
Rivera Carrera, who as Mexico's 56-year-old primate will serve as
host to the pope when he arrives in this country Friday. The pope
promoted Rivera to head the Mexican church in 1995 after he shut
down a seminary specializing in liberation theology and dispersed
its students and professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope's attacks have greatly weakened Latin America's
church of the poor,'' said the Rev. Ernesto Cardenal, the Jesuit
priest and former Sandinista culture minister whose public scolding
by the pope during a 1983 visit to Nicaragua dramatized John Paul's
opposition to liberation theology. ``There's been an enormous
decline,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But as church historians review the tumultuous rise and decline
of liberation theology, they are finding that although only a
handful of bishops still espouse it, it has nonetheless left a
powerful legacy. Many of the human rights groups, poll-watching
groups and other civic organizations that are the backbone of Latin
American democracy today are led by Christians who a decade ago
learned to read and think critically in the thousands of
parish-level study groups that were the theology's basic
expression.
</P>
<P>
   And since ministering to the poor remains at the center of
church life across Latin America, at least some priests in slums
like Ecatepec still look to the texts of liberation theology, if
somewhat furtively, for guidance as they struggle to define what
Christianity means for the region's most desperate.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, conservative bishops gave their blessing to the
landowners and generals who ruled Latin America with feudal
repression. But that changed in the 1960s, when Pope John XXIII
admonished the church to concentrate its ministry on the poor, and
a 1968 church conference at Medellin, Colombia, urged bishops and
priests to battle the ``institutionalized violence'' of the status
quo.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, thousands of poor parishes reorganized themselves
into small groups of believers, known as grass-roots Christian
communities, that met in homes to read the Bible and analyze
exploitation and injustice in their societies. With most of Latin
American in the grip of military dictators, the church became an
outlet for free expression.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, poor Christians flocked into the rebel militias
set up by the Sandinista guerrillas to fight the dictator Anastasio
Somoza Debayle, and in El Salvador, a right-wing gunman
assassinated Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero in 1980 to silence his
revolutionary teachings.
</P>
<P>
   The liberation church was growing fast when Pope John Paul II
began his pontificate in 1978 and, in January 1979, traveled to
Mexico for a meeting of regional bishops that brought fervent
debate over these teachings. Initially, the pope seemed ambivalent,
but his attitude soon turned to open hostility. Many scholars
believe that the pope equated liberation theology with the
communism he abhorred in his native Poland.
</P>
<P>
   After members of Nicaragua's grass-roots churches drowned out
his homily with Sandinista slogans during his 1983 visit to
Managua, the pope mounted a full-scale counterrevolution. The
Vatican punished prominent liberation theologians like the Rev.
Leonardo Boff of Brazil, promoted conservative bishops like Miguel
Obando y Bravo of Nicaragua to head their national churches, and
closed dozens of radical seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in Mexico has been typical of other Latin countries;
with the recent deaths of several aging prelates who helped pioneer
liberation theology here, only two of Mexico's 117 bishops are now
closely identified with the radical church and many seminarians and
young priests are largely unfamiliar with its texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberation theology is today a bit like the teachings of St.
Augustine,'' said Jean Meyer, author of a classic history of
Mexican Catholicism. ``The texts are on the shelf, but nobody's
very interested in them.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But a historical re-evaluation has begun. Jose de Jesus
Legorreta, a professor at the Jesuit-run Universidad Iberoamericana
in Mexico City who has written a recent history of the grass-roots
Christian communities, concluded that they offered a rich education
for thousands of poor Christians, a forum in which illiterate
slum-dwellers learned not only to read but also to analyze their
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian communities' largest achievement lies in the
changes they wrought on those who participated in them,'' Legorreta
said. ``People grew.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the communities live on, out of the glare of the press
now, led mainly by middle-aged working-class housewives like Rosa
Maria Sanchez. A decade ago, she began to take part in a radical
grass-roots Christian group in her Mexico City parish and has since
helped establish a parish medical program and organize a human
rights watchdog group. During several of Mexico's recent elections
she has fought ballot fraud as a poll-watcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought life was just growing up, eating, reproducing and
dying,'' Mrs. Sanchez said. ``Now we live hard every day. You know
what? Women who attend our Christian groups stop watching soap
operas!''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty miles across Mexico City, the Rev. Leonardo Barragan
Solis, 30, works in Ecatepec's slums alongside Vasquez. Three years
ago, the local bishop forced the young priest to withdraw from a
seminary found to have assigned liberation theology texts.
</P>
<P>
   But the other day, after Barragan trudged through a warren of
crumbling shanties bringing Christian hope to despondent
parishioners, he returned to his parish desk to study an 800-page
volume of liberation theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``These texts present the historic Christ who broke bread with
the poor, but fail to emphasize the Christ of the Spirit _ and
Jesus' message wasn't just sociology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can't ignore these works,'' he said, ``because they
teach us to minister to the poor.''

JAIL SENTENCE SIGNALS CHINA'S WISH TO CURB INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ A court here sentenced a computer engineer to
two years in prison on Wednesday in a case watched closely by
people monitoring official efforts to control China's growing use
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Shanghai No. 1 Intermediate Court ruled that Lin Hai, 30,
committed a subversive act last year when he sent 30,000 Chinese
e-mail addresses to VIP Reference, an electronic publication based
in the United States that the Chinese authorities consider hostile
to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, who was arrested in March, ran a software company that set
up Web sites and offered other Internet-related services. Lin's
wife, Xu Hong, said her husband was not interested in politics and
had simply been exchanging e-mail addresses to build a database for
his online business.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors argued that the names provided by Lin had been
used to distribute ``large numbers of articles aimed at inciting
subversion of state power and the socialist system.''
</P>
<P>
   VIP Reference, one of many electronic publications that
distribute news about China, is compiled by Chinese democracy
advocates in Washington. Editors of the newsletter say they send
information to 250,000 e-mail accounts in China.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to restrict the exchange of political information on the
Internet, these editors contend, are fruitless because of the
volume and variety of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials formally embrace use of the Internet as a
necessary part of efforts to modernize their economy and society.
At the same time, special task forces monitor political content on
the Internet and block some Web sites carrying information that
Beijing deems unfriendly.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one knows the extent of Internet use in China
because many users share accounts, one recent official estimate
said 2.1 million people in China were on the Internet by the end of
1998, up from 670,000 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In such a fast-changing environment, the case against Lin looks
like a throwback to an earlier era, when Beijing had tighter
control of the spread of information. It may also reflect a
decision by the authorities to make an example of someone seen to
be helping a publication like VIP Reference, if only indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   Lin's two-year sentence, harsh by any international standard, is
relatively light for a charge of political subversion in China. In
a recent crackdown on efforts to set up a democratic political
party, three leading dissidents were given sentences ranging from
11 to 13 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where the official media offer dull versions of the
news, some Chinese online services feel freer to provide flashy
news accounts that do not go through the same official censors as
newspapers, television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   Although the communist authorities would clearly like to
maintain their once-firm control over access to information, they
are steadily becoming overwhelmed by the greater openness of
communication _ by telephone, fax and now by the Internet _ that
has come with efforts to modernize China's economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The official New China News Agency reported Wednesday that a
recent survey of young people, ages 14 to 28, found an overwhelming
hunger for access to the Internet. But 69 percent of those surveyed
said they had no way to get online.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3.4 percent of the young people said they surfed the
Internet regularly. At the same time, only 7 percent said they had
no interest in the Internet, and 6 percent said they had not heard
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a long way to go before the Internet becomes
truly popular among Chinese youth,'' the news agency concluded.

U.N. IS RELEASING FUNDS TO IRAQ FOR ELECTRICITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations is releasing more than $81
million to Iraq to buy equipment to increase its supply of
electricity, the director of the Iraqi relief program said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, which suffers frequent power shortages as power plants
fail and demand for electricity rises, had applied to buy the
necessary generating equipment last year, when the ``oil for food''
program was expanded to allow Iraq to begin rebuilding its
crumbling public services. Sanctions and a more limited oil-sales
program had earlier prevented the Iraqis from replacing old
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the purchases, $74.9 million in gas turbines, will
come from China, said Benon Sevan, director of all nonweapons
projects for Iraq. Last year Iraq bought $70 million in
power-generating equipment from a Russian company.
</P>
<P>
   Under a separate program, the Security Council sanctions
committee approved $6.5 million worth of contracts for oil-industry
spare parts to upgrade pumping equipment, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week President Clinton announced that the United States
would speed up approval of contracts for spare parts so Iraq could
pump more oil and be able to buy more food, medicine and other
goods for a civilian population that has lived under tight trade
sanctions since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, under pressure in the Security Council, opposes
calls from France, Russia and others for a lifting of the embargo
on Iraqi oil sales so Baghdad would be free to buy what it needs,
although with international supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has had difficulties in recent months raising enough money
through permitted oil sales, since the international price of oil
has plummeted. Money earned on oil sales goes into a
U.N.-supervised escrow account.
</P>
<P>
   Under the expanded oil-sales program, even with prices low, Iraq
has been able to buy equipment to repair its telephone system and
place computers in schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the Iraqis have not yet used $17 million set aside last year
for fortified biscuits and milk for malnourished children and
mothers, Sevan said Wednesday. And millions of dollars in medicine
remains in warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release on Jan. 14, Iraq did not deny that it was
stockpiling medicine, but blamed the United States for holding up
contracts for purchases, which must be approved by the Security
Council's committee on Iraq sanctions. U.S. diplomats deny this
allegation.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Iraq also repeated its accusations, for which
no evidence has yet materialized, that U.S. and British air strikes
in December destroyed ``Iraq's infrastructure, schools, hospitals
and grain warehouses.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Washington on Wednesday, the Clinton administration took
another step toward giving more support to Iraqi opposition groups.
In a report to Congress, the White House designated seven
organizations as permitted recipients of U.S. financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Among the groups is the Iranian-based Supreme Council for the
Islamic Revolution, led by Mohammed Bakr al-Hakim, a Shiite Muslim
clergyman. The organization is considered most influential in the
largely Shiite Iraqi south, where opposition to President Saddam
Hussein is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, U.S. administrations have been wary of backing
Shiite groups, because of their links to Iran. But relations with
Iran are beginning to thaw slightly, making a gamble possible.
Shiite Muslims account for about two-thirds of the Iraqi
population, although Saddam's government is dominated by Sunni
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups eligible for U.S. aid under a $97 million program
created last year by Congress are the Iraqi National Congress, a
coalition of opposition organizations; the Kurdistan Democratic
Party and the Popular Union of Kurdistan, both based in the
autonomous Kurdish north of Iraq; the Movement for Constitutional
Monarchy, led by the pretender to the Iraqi throne; the Iraqi
National Accord, and the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi Communist Party, long a foe of Saddam, was not on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday 47 exiled Iraqi opposition leaders _ but not the
major Kurdish parties in northern Iraq _ asked Arab foreign
ministers who are planning to meet on Sunday in Cairo, Egypt, to
lend their support to a campaign to overthrow the Saddam
government.

   DEFENSE-MISSILE (Washington) _ The Pentagon announced Wednesday
that the threat of a ballistic missile strike from enemy nations
like North Korea or Iran now justified building a limited national
missile defense system, despite prohibitions in the Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty with Russia. Defense Secretary William Cohen said
that while the United States would commence negotiations with
Russia to amend the 1972 treaty, he would not rule out unilaterally
withdrawing from the treaty if negotiators could not find a way to
permit a limited national missile defense system. By Steven Lee

   IMPEACH-TRIAL (Washington) _ A White House lawyer on Wednesday
dismissed the charge that President Clinton lied before a grand
jury as nothing more than ``arguments over semantics'' and accused
House Republicans of drawing conclusions more extreme than those of
Kenneth Starr. ``It is hard to take the charges seriously,'' the
White House special counsel, Gregory Craig, told the senators on
the second day of defense arguments. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   STATEOFUNION-GREENSPAN (Washington) _ Alan Greenspan, chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, objected Wednesday to part of
President Clinton's proposal to deal with Social Security, and
Republicans in Congress called the plan unacceptable. But while
some influential Republicans said the plan announced in the State
of the Union message on Tuesday night was so off base it left no
room for compromise, many others saw the president's offering as an
opening bid that could lead to fruitful negotiations. By David
Rosenbaum.

   CAMBODIA-WARCRIMES (Phum Thmei, Cambodia) _ As Cambodia and the
outside world prepare for the possibility of trials for perhaps a
dozen Khmer Rouge leaders, a large unanswered _ and generally
unasked _ question is how to deal with the people who actually took
part in the torture and the killing, or even how to think of them.
``Why should only the the top leaders take responsibility?'' said
Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, a
private agency that is collecting evidence of Khmer Rouge crimes.

since Dr. Denis Burkitt, a British missionary surgeon who studied
the differences in diseases between poor Africans and affluent

them against colon cancer. He spread his thesis as dietary gospel,
prompting millions to change their diets. Now the largest study
ever to examine Burkitt's theory has found that, at least when it
comes to preventing colon cancer, all those fruits, vegetables and
cereals don't do any good. By Sheryl Stolberg.

WESTERN DIPLOMATS SEEK CONCESSIONS FROM MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Russia)  (Eds: See also KOSOVO-U.S.) 
(mk)

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ While NATO tried to persuade Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that the alliance is serious about
using force against him, Western diplomats continued to flock here
Wednesday to urge him to defuse a crisis he himself created.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is back in the headlines after what the Clinton
administration is calling a mass killing of ethnic Albanian
civilians on Friday in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is a delicious moment for the Yugoslav leader,
some senior Western diplomats here concede. He has thrown down the
gauntlet to the West and is orchestrating anti-Western diatribes in
the Serbian press, accusing Western officials of being unfair and
too quick to believe propaganda from Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the United States and its allies are sending
him envoys, pressing him to make relatively easy concessions that
will allow them to avoid using force, which Milosevic doubts they
are willing to do in any event. Even American officials say they
have real doubts, as was the case with Iraq, of what policy would
follow any air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic sent away NATO's top military commanders with very
little after a seven-hour meeting on Tuesday. After the generals,
Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, and Klaus Naumann of Germany,
left on Tuesday, more envoys followed. Aleksandr Avdeyev, Russia's
first deputy foreign minister, has been here, as has a senior State
Department official, James Pardew. The American negotiator,
Christopher Hill, who is also the ambassador to Macedonia, is about
to arrive, and he will be followed by Knut Vollebaek, the Norwegian
foreign minister who is the current chairman of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is also leaving himself room to maneuver and back
down, the diplomats noted. The case of William Walker, the American
head of the group's monitoring mission in Kosovo, is one example.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Serbian forces of the killing of at least 45 ethnic
Albanians in the village of Racak, and in turn was accused by the
Serbian propaganda machine of partiality. On Tuesday he was ordered
to leave within 48 hours. That order was extended by another 24
hours after the organization, whose members include Russia,
demanded that Milosevic allow Walker to remain on the job.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Wednesday night that Milosevic would let Walker
stay, a senior Western diplomat said, at least as long as
negotiations with the West continued. ``As usual, if Milosevic
concedes, it will be on an issue that he created,'' the diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vollebaek on Wednesday ordered Walker to keep working despite
the deportation order. Walker returned to Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, Austria, on Wednesday, Vollebaek said: ``I am
convinced that Milosevic will allow him to stay. It would be an
outrageous provocation, which I do not expect from him, if he threw
him out forcefully.''
</P>
<P>
   But Serbian officials here echoed accusations made in the
government-controlled press that the West had rushed to judgment on
the issue of the 45 victims in Racak, arguing that they had been
killed in fighting, not in cold blood, and that ethnic Albanians of
the Kosovo Liberation Army later mutilated the bodies, changed
their clothing and dumped them in one spot to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   While such charges have been dismissed out of hand by American
officials, French officials say they are taking them more
seriously, while urging the kind of international forensic
investigation Washington also wants. The Serbs have agreed to allow
some Finnish forensic scientists to see at least some of the bodies
found in the village last week.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Helena Ranta, head of the Finnish team, told Reuters
Wednesday that she had urged Serbian authorities to halt autopsies
on the victims until vital X-ray equipment could be brought in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly for bodies of people killed by gunshots, the very
first thing to be done, according to internationally recognized
procedures, is to X-ray them,'' she said after meeting here with
the Serbian justice minister, Dragoljub Jankovic.
</P>
<P>
   In this matter, too, Milosevic has shown signs of cooperation,
the Western diplomats noted Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and the West are also insisting that Milosevic resume
full cooperation with international agencies in Kosovo, by living
up to the cease-fire agreement he signed with the American envoy,
Richard Holbrooke, last October, and by allowing the tribunal
investigating war crimes access to Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The chief prosecutor of the tribunal, Louise Arbour, arrived at
the Kosovo border without a visa, and was not allowed in. On
Wednesday she returned to The Hague, Netherlands. The refusal to
admit her is consistent with the general Serbian position that
there are no war crimes in Kosovo because there has been no war
there, the diplomats said. But the diplomats also noted that the
tribunal has been allowed to open an office in Pristina, and that
Ms. Arbour has previously visited Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The October agreement was negotiated under the pressure of
imminent NATO bombing, and even then was full of holes, American
officials have conceded. The deal saved many Kosovo refugees from
dying of the cold and had restrained the warfare, at least until
last week. But once the threat of bombing was withdrawn in October,
there was little leverage on Milosevic to give Kosovo the enhanced
political autonomy that now seems insufficient to satisfy the
ethnic Albanians, let alone the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enhanced autonomy within Serbia, which Milosevic doesn't want
to concede, is a nonstarter now,'' said a senior Western official.
``Enhanced autonomy within Yugoslavia, on a similar basis with
Serbia itself and Montenegro, is probably the minimum. Albanian
national consciousness has changed a lot.'' Milosevic agreed in
October to seriously negotiate a political settlement with the
ethnic Albanian majority, which is seeking independence from
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the renewed threat of NATO bombing will give
Milosevic more room to make necessary concessions to the ethnic
Albanians of Kosovo, short of the independence that the Serbs _ and
the rest of the world _ do not want Kosovo to have. But, a senior
Western diplomat said, a threat by NATO to bomb Serbia is a ``blunt
instrument for a delicate problem.''

QUELL THAT COUGH _ AND OTHER GUIDELINES FOR POLITE CONCERT-GOING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of the grand moments you look forward to all year.
</P>
<P>
   All evening long in Bass Performance Hall, the orchestra and
200-voice chorus had been building, irresistibly, through one grand
choral movement after another, to the final ``Amen'' of Handel's
``Messiah.'' Wave after wave of majestic counterpoint rolled toward
that ultimate climax, where Handel, that master of musical drama,
inserts a moment of silence _ just before the last ecstatic
cadence, bespeaking a universe at peace under the reign of
triumphal God.
</P>
<P>
   Well, except for that hacking cough.
</P>
<P>
   All human beings make a certain amount of noise just by being
alive. Your chair squeaks, you sneeze, you sigh or sniff when
Violetta dies. It's not those occasional small noises that are the
problem, says conductor John Giordano, the music director of the
Fort Worth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any extraneous noise can be disturbing to the performer,''
Giordano says. And, on occasion, he admits, ``There have been
instances when it was difficult to carry on.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he continues, it's not those little noises that are the
real problem. It's that insensitive, controllable noise that could
be stopped. The cougher who keeps coughing. The chair that keeps
scooting or creaking. The people with the noisy child who just
don't understand that they should leave.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rodzinski, executive director of the Cliburn Foundation,
grew up seeing his father, renowned conductor Artur Rodzinski,
conduct in the great opera houses and concert halls of America and
Europe. He says that Fort Worth audiences are noisier than those
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, and even in Moscow, where the air quality is very
poor and many more people smoke than in America, there is
absolutely no coughing during a performance,'' Rodzinski says. ``It
is considered as unacceptable as other offensive bodily sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   But even New York, the center of the classical music world,
takes its knocks. Anyone who listens to radio broadcasts knows that
New Yorkers are more apt to clap between movements of a large work
than Fort Worth audiences. Worse still, New York Philharmonic
conductor Kurt Masur recently stopped a performance and walked off
stage because of coughing from the audience, according to a report
from The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason that you may be more likely to cough in a
concert hall than, say, at a basketball game or a movie, where you
have more freedom to move around.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of other stimuli, the stimulus to cough becomes
more prevalent,'' says Jack Hardwick, a doctor who is also
president of the Fort Worth Opera Association and a devoted
concertgoer. Hardwick says that coughing is no more prominent in
Fort Worth than at any other place in the world, in his experience.
</P>
<P>
   However, the highly refined acoustics of Bass Performance Hall
make audience discretion even more important, simply because
individual audience noise is more obvious in this room.
</P>
<P>
   Don't go home and die of shame if you happen to cough or sneeze
during the slow movement of Mahler's Fifth. Music was written to be
performed for a live audience. Everyone knows the basics: Arrive on
time; wear decent, clean clothes; don't even think about taking
photographs or carrying food or drink into the concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it's really fairly easy: Just remember to mind your
manners, and Fort Worth can preserve its reputation as a center of
fine music and good home-training.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER RULES TO LISTEN BY
</P>
<P>
   1. In general, don't clap between movements of multimovement
works. Don't applaud while music is being played, even at the opera
or ballet; the experience is even better if you hear all the music.
Once the music is over, by all means, whoop, yell, whistle, stamp
your feet _ if the performance merits it. Booing is reserved for
those extremely rare occasions when a performer or stage director
has actually insulted the audience _ or for opera houses in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   2. If you have a bad, uncontrollable cough, stay home. If you
arrive at the concert and need to cough or sneeze, stifle it if
possible. Carry lozenges with you, but ``please don't rattle the
wrappers.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're at a concert and can't stifle your cough, be as quiet
as possible. Cough when the music is over; if you must cough, try
to do it between movements or, as a last resort, quietly during a
loud passage. Covering your mouth can help to soften the noise. If
the cough persists, leave. (At Bass Hall, you can watch the
performance on the TV screens in the lobby.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Small children, and adults who have developmental
disabilities that make it impossible for them to remain quiet for
extended periods, should not be brought to concerts. When in doubt,
follow the ``Moynihan Rule:'' Would you take this person to a
lecture by Daniel Patrick Moynihan and expect him or her to sit
quietly and listen? If not, he or she is not ready or able to
attend a standard classical music concert, opera or ballet.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, certain events that small children and
other people who may not be expected to be totally quiet may
reasonably attend _ such as special children's concerts, certain
park concerts and performances aimed specifically at family
audiences, such as ``The Nutcracker.'' A 5-year-old dancing with a
light stick at a symphony concert at the Botanic Garden has a
certain charm, so long as the urchin doesn't step in your potato
salad. One hopes that a 6-year-old might ooh and aah at ``The
Nutcracker,'' so long as he or she stays in his or her seat and
limits the exclamations to about 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   4. Any thoughtful person will think twice before wearing
fragrances in the close quarters of a concert hall. Many people are
sensitive to artificial and natural chemicals in perfumes.

The Tractors pull together a memorable CD 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In rock 'n' roll, four years is not a long time _ major bands,
such as U2 or Aerosmith, can take that long between releases and
nobody really thinks too much about it.
</P>
<P>
   In country, however, it's an eternity. The big acts, the Garths
and the Alan Jacksons, release a new CD (or at least a best-of)
every year, or at least every two.
</P>
<P>
   Then we get to the Tractors, Tulsa's finest
country/roots-rock/soul/New Orleans R&AMP;B outfit, the guys who scored
big-time with ``Baby Likes to Rock It'' way back in 1994. ``Rock
It'' won the band two Grammy nominations and a Country Music
Association award for Video of the Year, and ``The Tractors'' sold
2 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Then they went away _ right back to Tulsa and leader Steve
Ripley's studio. For months and months. And months.
</P>
<P>
   You'd never know it by ``Farmers in a Changing World,'' which is
the result of all those months, but which also sounds for all the
world like a bunch of guys batting out a handful of songs for
grins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's the idea,'' says Ripley, an amiable sort who
actually grew up driving a tractor in Oklahoma and went on to play
with Bob Dylan, J.J. Cale and Leon Russell, and build guitars for
Eddie Van Halen and Ry Cooder. ``That's the exact goal and that's
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Only _ not the way you'd think. The Tractors' recording process
is an odd one that says much about Ripley, who confesses a love of
the warmth and looseness of nailing down a song quickly (the way
guys like Elvis Presley and Hank Williams used to do it), yet a yen
for endless tinkering to get just the right guitar or drum sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony people might not believe is when I listen to Hank
(Williams), I'm astonished by the sounds and the recording as much
as the songs and the performances,'' he says. ``Also, there's a
thing about Tulsa musicians; we all live in the studio. If you
don't go to one, you've got one in your home.''
</P>
<P>
   What Ripley would do is lay down a guide vocal and guitar track
and then have the different players (keyboardist Walt Richmond,
guitarist Ron Getman, bassist Casey Van Beek and drummer Jamie
Oldaker) come in and lay down their parts quickly _ one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times it's `Here's the song, it's in G, here we go,' and
we roll the tape,'' he says. ``The first take is always the best.
That's as good as it's gonna get. The analogy I like is how movies
are made _ they're shot with one camera at a time, and then some
guy makes sense out of it and it ends up seeming larger than
life.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tractorland, that one guy is Ripley, who assembles the songs
out of the band's playing, stitching together their work into a
coherent whole.
</P>
<P>
   He says it's ``like putting together a jigsaw puzzle and making
it as you go.'' And there's where the years in the little room come
in.
</P>
<P>
   But the result _ well, the result was well worth the wait.
``Farmers'' shows the Tractors to be one of the very few even
semimainstream country bands whose members sound as though they'd
be as comfortable playing a smoky club in New Orleans or Memphis as
in Nashville. Snappy, sinuous horn lines grace several songs, as do
funky rhythms that would have sounded at home on a 40-year-old Ray
Charles record. Old pal Bonnie Raitt throws in some tart slide
guitar on several cuts, and former Presley sidemen James Burton,
Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana help out on Ripley's tribute to the
King, ``The Elvis Thing,'' which concludes with him throwing in a
snippet of the classic ``Mystery Train.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, both the long wait and the band's
country/roots/R&AMP;B hybrid sound have meant that ``Farmers'' has not
taken off like ``The Tractors'' did. It currently sits at No. 53, a
neither great nor horrible showing. A round of dates in the spring,
which Ripley has dubbed ``The Tractors' Great American Get Off Your
Butt and Dance Tour,'' may well help, but ``Farmers'' most probably
won't be the huge success that ``The Tractors'' was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in a way, because of course we'd like it to
be in the Top 10,'' Ripley says. ``You do have expectations. But
it's hangin' in there and sold about 3,000 copies last week, and
the company's happy with it. And really, we're beating a lot of
records. Things are actually great _ we're not getting impeached.''

BUSH, STILL UNDECIDED ABOUT PRESIDENCY, HAS EYE ON 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Wednesday that
his best shot at winning the Republican presidential nomination
would be in 2000, although he insisted that he had not decided
whether to run.
</P>
<P>
   A day after being sworn in for a second term, Bush faced another
barrage of questions about the upcoming presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   While he expressed some reluctance about dragging his family
into the national spotlight, he also spoke of ``moments in
history'' and ``windows of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I choose not to run for the presidency, I understand
the window probably will be closed, because one can't control their
fate in the political process,'' Bush told a news conference at the
Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that this could be a very unique moment. But
you've got to understand me: I didn't wake up when I was
14-years-old wanting to be president of the United States. When I
was 21, I didn't want to be president, and I don't wake up every
morning saying, `How can I position myself to be president?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is in the position of being the undeclared front-runner in
the Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential Republican candidate, New York Gov. George
Pataki, announced Wednesday that he had created a political action
committee to finance campaign trips.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush appears to be leaning toward running, he and his
wife, Laura, said they were concerned about the loss of privacy for
themselves and their 17-year-old twin daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reluctant, absolutely,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``I just think
it's a major life change. We have a very nice life in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the son of the former president, said that while he is
taking his family's feelings into account, the decision ultimately
is his to make.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 52, said he was not concerned about scrutiny of his life.
He has admitted he was ``young and irresponsible'' but learned from
his mistakes, which he has repeatedly declined to discuss in detail
except to say he drank too much alcohol and quit when he was 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had done anything in the past that would've disqualified
me for being in public office, you would have found it,'' Bush
said. ``When I put my hand on the Bible and swore to uphold the
laws of the land of the state, I also implicitly said I'd uphold
the dignity of the office that I was elected to, and I have done
so.''
</P>
<P>
   As he works his way toward making a decision, Bush has been
meeting with various policy experts and other interested parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't surprise you that I'm listening to policy people
because I intend to make an informed decision. It's not only a
decision of heart, which is the primary reason,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to meet Thursday with a group of national fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I decide to run for the presidency, I'm going to have
to raise a lot of money quickly, and it's important to listen to
the concerns of money-raisers as well as to listen to different
policy folks. And that's what's going to happen between now and
when I make my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to decide by the end of the state's legislative
session in May.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Alison Levy heard the word ``Republican'' and
her eyes narrowed and body tensed in one reflexive motion. ``It's
just so frustrating,'' she said, as she sorted titles at Phoenix
Books, the new and used bookstore she manages in this neighborhood
called Noe Valley. ``The Republicans are wasting all this time and
energy and money and resources for something they shouldn't. It
just shouldn't be happening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is the trial of the president on the charges of
impeachment, of course, and Ms. Levy, one disgusted Democrat among
many she knows, has barely been able to bring herself to watch it.
But like most of about 30 people interviewed in Noe Valley this
morning, she did watch President Clinton's State of the Union
address and she, like many others, thought it a brave, gutsy
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see him continue to do his job,'' she said.
``After all that is happening, he doesn't let it stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Noe Valley, a liberal Democratic neighborhood in a
liberal Democratic city, little that the house managers prosecuting
the president have said has mattered. The president's impeachment
and trial has been a political act. Period. The Conservative
Republicans have been out to get him. No question. Nothing that
happens in the Senate will convince them that the impeachment, or
even a conviction, is anything else.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the attitudes in Noe Valley, a diverse
neighborhood of long-time, working-class residents, struggling
artists, middle-class professionals and new, wealthier arrivals who
work in Silicon Valley, correlate with the national polls. But in
this bastion of political activism _where residents worried about
the gentrification of the neighborhood successfully lobbied for a
law banning new coffee bars and juice bars here _ people are even
more defensive of the president than the polls indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Only two people approached are registered Republicans, and both
of those said they plan to switch parties as a protest against the
president's impeachment. Only one person interviewed (a Democrat)
wants the Senate to remove the president from office _ ``for
lying'' _ while everyone else said the president's sex life is his
business and none of ours.
</P>
<P>
   Most people interviewed said they think the president's affair
with Monica Lewinsky was ``slimy,'' ``sleazy,'' ``plain wrong.''
But even those who have found the president's policies too
conservative for their liberal philosophy are rallying behind
Clinton against what they perceive as a politically driven vendetta
orchestrated by the right-wing. To people here, it's as if the
president is Bugs Bunny and the Conservative Republicans are Elmer
Fudd, throwing tantrums each time the wascally wabbit has slipped
past their traps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think going after Bill Clinton is stupid, idiotic _ and I
wish the whole thing was over,'' said Nancy Ford, a clerk at the
24th Street Cheese Shop, barely able to contain her venom. ``Bill
Clinton just keeps doing his job and the Republicans are trying to
keep him from doing anything. Just make them leave him alone and
I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bacik, co-owner of Accent on Flowers, a neighborhood
fixture for 29 years, said that while he is a life-long Republican,
he's ``tired of all this crap the Republicans have been dishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacik is re-registering as a Democrat. ``They're spending
millions of dollars prosecuting the president for his sex life,''
he said. ``That's something between him and Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tully's Coffee, four Clinton supporters talking over the
predicament in Washington, expressed unanimous contempt for the
Republicans spearheading the attack on the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just feel like throwing something at the television, or
leaving the country,'' said Phyllis Ehrenfeld, a New Jerseyan
visiting her sister here.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Sylvain Ehrenfeld, was just as disgusted. ``To me,
it's all highly politicized, just part of the culture war,'' he
said. ``The polls show that what they are doing to Clinton is
likely to hurt them but they still do it. Why would they continue
on a course that is so self-destructive?''
</P>
<P>
   Their friend, Harry Stern, who lives in Noe Valley, said the
whole course of events of the last year have a surreal quality.
``The whole thing is like a Norman Rockwell painting. It's all
technically correct but there's no there there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is one of total, absolute distate for what is
happening,'' said Eunice Rosenberg, the fourth member of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Disgust at the impeachment proceedings has not clouded Jan
Lagerhof's criticisms of the president. ``He's been too
conservative for me,'' said Ms. Lagerhof, a criminal defense lawyer
whose office is in Noe Valley. ``But the important thing is to
defend the office of the presidency. He hasn't done anything to
abuse the office of the president, which is what they're saying.
Make them stop. Make them stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Her views were echoed by Harriet Beinfield, a licensed
acupuncturist who is co-owner with her husband of Chinese Medicine
Works, an herbal pharmacy. Ms. Beinfield blames the president for
``doing in Welfare'' and for allowing crime bills to go forward
that she says demonized black youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, he wears the face of the people,'' she said.
``On the other hand he caves in to the will of the right.''

 HIGH COURT HEARS ABOUT BIZARRELY SHAPED CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The long and skinny North Carolina congressional
district that drew the Supreme Court's ire six years ago is barely
half as long now. Redrawn by the state Legislature after the Court
declared it to be an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, it no
longer has a majority of black voters, although it is still
represented by a black Democrat, Melvin Watt.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday about whether the
12th congressional district of North Carolina is still
unconstitutional. The court's answer and how the justices arrive at
it are very likely to set the ground rules for the next round of
congressional redistricting, after the 2000 census, when legal
challenges to districts drawn with race in mind are likely to pour
into the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time the North Carolina district has been
before the Supreme Court. In 1993, it was the subject of a case
called Shaw vs. Reno, in which a bitterly divided court held by a
5-4 vote that districts drawn with ``bizarre'' shapes for the
purpose of electing black representatives were presumptively
unconstitutional. A three-judge U.S. District Court in North
Carolina, applying the new standard, upheld the district
nonetheless, in a decision the court overturned by the same 5-4
vote in a 1996 case called Shaw vs. Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina Legislature then redrew the district, as part
of a state-wide redistricting, shaving off 89 of its 191 miles and
reducing its black population from 57 percent to 47 percent. The
primary goal, the legislators told the District Court, was no
longer racial but political, preserving the even split of six
Democrats and six Republicans in the state's congressional
delegation by insuring that reliable Democratic voters were carved
out of the Republican Piedmont region and bunched into an urban
district running along Interstate 85 from Charlotte to Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling last year in a lawsuit brought by white voters allied
with the plaintiffs in the original Shaw vs. Reno case, the
District Court in Raleigh rejected the legislature's explanation
and ruled that the district was still impermissibly ``race
driven.'' Granting summary judgment to the white voters, the court
found that race was still a predominant factor and declared the
12th District unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The argument on Wednesday, an appeal by the state, brought
familiar personalities before the Supreme Court, as well as
familiar questions and answers. But for the first time there was
some indication that justices who supported Shaw vs. Reno might be
growing concerned that the doctrine, at least in the hands of the
lower federal courts, has gone too far and been interpreted too
rigidly.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident from the response of Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, the author of Shaw vs. Reno and the critical fifth vote
in subsequent redistricting decisions, to the opening statement by
Robinson O. Everett, the lawyer who has represented the white
plaintiffs in all the North Carolina cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am back again with a map show,'' Everett said, referring to
the maps of the current and previous district perched on easels
behind him. Similar props had proved useful tools for him in his
previous arguments. ``Maps are very important,'' he observed this
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, they are,'' Justice O'Connor said. ``But at least
speaking for myself,'' she continued, ``there may well be enough
evidence here'' on the state's behalf to mean that the District
Court made a mistake in ruling at this point for the plaintiffs, by
awarding summary judgment without conducting a trial. The argument
then turned to the facts and theory behind Everett's case, and he
never referred to his maps again.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the question of whether the District Court
properly entered judgment for the state is a technical one, the
justices' interest in it suggesting that a ruling on the merits
might be put off until still another appeal. But it was evident
from the argument that the question of summary judgment is
inextricably bound up with how the court views the role of race in
legislative districting. What had the appearance of a technical,
procedural argument in fact approached the heart of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   A summary judgment is a ruling on the purely legal issues in a
lawsuit and is appropriate only if no relevant facts are in
dispute. But the dispute in this case, several justices suggested,
was the core question of whether the asserted goal of political
balance was just a pretext, with race actually the predominant
factor in drawing the 12th district's lines. At what point does a
factor become predominant, the justices wanted to know. Can a
legislature that once drew an unconstitutional district ever be
assumed to be acting in good faith?
</P>
<P>
   Walter E. Dellinger, an acting solicitor general earlier in the
Clinton administration, serving as counsel to his home state in
this case, Hunt vs. Cromartie, No. 98-85, told the justices that
maintaining a partisan balance was a ``constitutionally legitimate
goal.'' He said the ``overlap'' between including Democrats and
including black voters, most of whom vote Democratic, was not in
itself sufficient to invalidate the district. Political balance
``could have been a pretext, but there was no evidence that was the
case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That raised the question of which side in such a case has the
burden of proof: the plaintiffs, to show that the district lines
were impermissibly based on race, or the state, to show that,
despite some ambiguous evidence to the contrary, they were not. The
plaintiffs' lawyer, Everett, argued that once a district had been
invalidated on the basis of race, the state should have the burden
of proving that later modifications were untainted.
</P>
<P>
   While preserving an incumbent's district has often been accepted
as a valid purpose for drawing particular district lines, Everett
said this presumption should not apply when the incumbent was
elected from a ``race-based, race-skewed district.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Watt's election in 1992, there had been no black member of
Congress from North Carolina since 1901.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration argued in support of the state. While
``legislators are commonly aware of race,'' James A. Feldman, an
assistant solicitor general, told the justices, the court's
precedents did not go so far as to make a district unconstitutional
simply because it reflected the ``mere desire'' to take account of
its racial makeup.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to hearing this case, the court also decided a
redistricting case on Wednesday, ruling 8-1 in a case involving
state judicial districts in Monterey County, Calif. that local
jurisdictions must abide by the Voting Rights Act even when the
challenged district lines were drawn at the state level rather than
the local level.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Lopez vs. Monterey County, No. 97-1396, applied to the
obligation of jurisdictions covered by the law to seek advance
permission _ ``preclearance'' _ from the Justice Department or the
U.S. District Court in Washington before making a change that
affects voting. In California, as in New York, only parts of the
state are covered by this section of the law, raising the question
of whether actions taken at the state level are immunized from
Voting Rights Act review even when they affect a ``covered''
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. District Court in San Francisco had ruled that the law
did not apply in such a case. The court today disagreed, in a
majority opinion by Justice O'Connor. Justice Clarence Thomas
dissented.

HEBERT BACK IN FORM AFTER TOUGH YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Family life is agreeing with Guy Hebert, and so is
the current NHL season.
</P>
<P>
   After enduring a year of team and personal turmoil, the Mighty
Ducks goalie can't help but laugh and smile. Not even the pressure
of becoming an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season can
bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days, you take for granted what you do,'' Hebert said.
``Not every day is going to be rosy, but I wanted to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun isn't the word Hebert would use to describe the 1997-98
season. He and the Ducks struggled the year after the team had made
its first playoff appearance, and Hebert's wife, Sarah, suffered a
troubled pregnancy and required six weeks of bed rest.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Madeline, was born prematurely on Dec.22, 1997,
and she spent the first two weeks of her life in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps you set your priorities,'' said Hebert, who was on
the road when Madeline finally came home. ``We (have) a
high-pressure lifestyle and are under a microscope. But you see
something like that, see what my wife went through, and you step
back and say, `Well, it's a lot more enjoyable than you think, and
you should get back to thinking it's enjoyable.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far, this season has been enjoyable for Hebert. After last
Wednesday's loss to Calgary, Hebert was 14-14-7 with a 2.22
goals-against average, a .928 save percentage and had already
equaled his career high in shutouts with four.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has given us a chance every night to win games, and he has
won some by himself,'' Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said. ``It's
tough to ask anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   After suffering through a sub-par first half and not playing a
minute for the United States Olympic team in Nagano, Japan,
Hebert's 1997-98 season officially ended April 9, when he had
surgery on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But after a summer of rehab, the 32-year-old Hebert returned in
top shape. He is playing like he did when he led the Ducks to the
playoffs in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing as good as that, or maybe better,'' teammate
Teemu Selanne said. ``He's older, smarter, more confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, he's back to the same old keeper, and that's huge
for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert was not named to the North American All-Star team, but he
said it really didn't matter if he made it or not, even before the
squad was announced. There is little reason to doubt him,
especially now that he has a daughter waiting for him at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it changes everyone,'' Hebert said of becoming a
father. ``If it doesn't, I think there is something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to the rink and have a bad day, there is nothing you
can do. You go home, enjoy the family and show up the next day and
try to be better. Not every day is great, but so far, so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert said he is trying not to take himself so seriously
anymore, and he has become somewhat of a dressing room cutup, even
joking he was going to dye his thinning, dark hair blond, as
several players have done throughout the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert may not take himself as seriously as he once did, but
Hartsburg says he's serious once he is stationed between the pipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people underestimate how competitive he is,'' he said.
``When you talk to him, he's very laid-back and he's got a good
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've noticed, when he pulls that mask over him, there is a
competitive edge that comes over him as well. In a game, he fights
and battles and does everything he can to stop the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a trait his defensemen also have noticed. Hebert plays a
simple style -- he does not flop and dive much -- but Jason
Marshall said looks can be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can make the flashy save; I've seen him do it time and time
again,'' Marshall said. ``Even when it looks like an empty net,
he'll never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, the only Duck to play all six years in Anaheim, will be
able to shop himself on the open market after the season. He
insists, however, that he will not let himself get caught up
worrying about signing a big free-agent deal. He saw firsthand what
Curtis Joseph went through when they played for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``A contract is going to take care of itself,'' said Hebert, who
is making $2.6 million this season. ``But it became everything
every time he stepped out on the ice. I saw how miserable he was,
and I didn't want to be that miserable this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make great money. If I never make another dime, I'm pretty
lucky. If you play well, you'll be rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert has made it clear he'd like to finish his career in
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here six years and really put a lot of blood, sweat
and tears into trying to make the Mighty Ducks grow,'' he said.
``We've had our bumps in the road, but I think we are really taking
off now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it would end with me picking up the (Stanley) Cup
at center ice.''

SNUBBING WIDOWS AND HEROES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - An atomic bomb detonated in Rep. John Shadegg's face
about 30 seconds into the president's State of the Union speech
Tuesday night, and he didn't even flinch.
</P>
<P>
   It happened just after Bill Clinton said, ``Let me begin by
saluting the new speaker of the House, and thanking him for
extending invitations to two special guests who are sitting in the
gallery with Mrs. Hastert. Widows of the two brave Capitol Police
officers who gave their lives to defend freedom's house.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then _ as Lyn Gibson, widow of Special Agent John Gibson,
and Wei Ling Chestnut, widow of Officer Jacob J. Chestnut rose to
accept the wild applause of every person in the chamber _ Shadegg's
decision to boycott the event went up like a mushroom cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad there wasn't enough fallout to penetrate a politician's
hard ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stands by his decision not to attend,'' Shadegg's press
aide told me Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   By skipping the speech, the Arizona congressman wasn't there to
applaud the widows of two officers killed last July trying to
protect him and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg and other Republicans who refused to attend the speech
wrote a letter saying, ``The president is demonstrating his lack of
respect for Congress. We will not play a role in facilitating his
disrespect.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that what Capt. Jeffrey B. Taliaferro was doing? Facilitating
disrespect?
</P>
<P>
   Taliaferro is a pilot who flew B-1 bomber missions over Iraq
during Operation Desert Fox. He, too, was greeted with a standing
ovation after being pointed out by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   What about Ashley Dumas, the AmeriCorps volunteer working with
single mothers in South Boston? Or Loc Truong, the former
Vietnamese refugee who mentors boys in San Luis Obispo?
</P>
<P>
   They, too, were singled out by Clinton. Were they demonstrating
their lack of respect for Congress by agreeing to attend?
</P>
<P>
   Is that also true of Officer Chris Lonsford, who received a
medal of valor from the Fontana, Calif., police department last
March and was another guest of the president?
</P>
<P>
   Is it true of Suzann Wilson, whose 11-year-old daughter was shot
and killed by schoolmates in Jonesboro, Ark., and who now works to
keep firearms out of children's hands?
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows that the first objective of a State of the Union
address is making the president look good. Mostly, this is done by
having the big guy make promises he knows he can't keep. Nobody's
fooled.
</P>
<P>
   We put up with it because the State of the Union is also a pep
rally, a nationally-televised excuse to celebrate the country and
point out some of our best people.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the president finished Tuesday night, Shadegg was
on a Phoenix talk radio program saying Clinton has ``no class.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Sammy Sosa?
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs star attended the speech. The president praised
Sosa for helping to bring relief to hurricane victims in the
Dominican Republic. The crowd cheered.
</P>
<P>
   What about Rosa Parks?
</P>
<P>
   She was also there. When Clinton declared her a living icon of
the American civil rights movement, all of the Representatives and
Senators stood up and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Shadegg told me he meant no offense to anyone
honored by Clinton. ``My only concern here was, Is it appropriate
in the midst of the impeachment proceeding for this speech to go
forward?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I leveled that criticism both at our leadership, with a
letter I sent to the speaker before I made my decision not to
attend, and also by my decision not to attend. Which was a personal
decision of conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   You make the call:
</P>
<P>
   On one side are Shadegg and his buddies. On the other side are
the police widows, the young volunteers, the mother, the cop, the
bomber pilot, Sammy Sosa, Rosa Parks.

   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ When President Clinton on Wednesday gave his
folksy version of his State of the Union Message to the blue-collar
and middle-class residents of Buffalo and its environs, he got an
ardent response from people like Beverly Brigantia, for whom Social
Security, the centerpiece of the president's message, is no
academic matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be one of those women on Social Security that
he's talking about,'' she said, listening to Clinton's speech on a
small television propped up on a satellite truck outside the Marine
Midland Arena here. ``I'm single and currently unemployed and
there's $6,000 in my pension in the teachers retirement system. I'm
probably going to have to work until I drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brigantia, a 55-year-old former community college writing
instructor, said Clinton's plan to reserve 62 percent of the budget
surpluses over the next 15 years _ $2.7 trillion _ for Social
Security ``sounded reasonable to me,'' and at least put the issue
squarely on the national agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to generate excitement after his State of the Union
address, the president could scarcely have picked a more receptive
audience than the one in this heavily Democratic city of 325,000
people. Buffalo's mood Wednesday was as bright as the sunshine that
ended a week and a half of snow, with accumulations of 60 inches.
</P>
<P>
   This Lake Erie city, where Grover Cleveland was mayor in 1881
and where President William McKinley was assassinated in 1901, has
made a slow and somewhat mixed economic recovery since the 1970s,
when Bethlehem Steel closed its plant in neighboring Lackawanna and
chemical and automobile companies downsized. Unemployment is at 7
percent or 8 percent, said Vincent Lovallo, chief of staff to Mayor
Anthony Masiello. That is almost twice the national average, but
far less than the double-digit rates that Lovallo said prevailed
before Clinton's election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The president was delighted with the long ovation he received
after a fiery introduction by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got so excited you melted the snow for miles outside the
arena,'' Clinton told the crowd of 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The warmth was by no means unanimous. Fifty demonstrators stood
across from the domed arena, the home of the Buffalo Sabres hockey
team, with signs saying ``Jail to the Chief!'' and ``Can You Trust
a Liar?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the protesters, Andrea Tice, a 30-year-old mother of two
from the suburb of Marilla, said she had not watched Clinton's
speech Tuesday night _ ``I prefer to go to sleep at night without
rage in my heart,'' she said _ but she disliked his Social Security
plan anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security is fine, but he should give the hard-working
people a tax cut,'' Ms. Tice said, echoing a proposal made by
Republicans in Congress on Tuesday that called for a 10 percent
across-the-board cut in income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly the crowds outside and inside the arena seemed
impressed with a president spunkily going on with his job despite a
Senate impeachment trial that could remove him from office. Even
the baby boomers who doubt that the government will have surpluses
for the next 15 years were glad Clinton enunciated something to
shoot for that may protect them when they retire. And many were
simply tickled at glimpsing the president and his wife, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, and by his casual colloquial delivery Wednesday,
with lines about Social Security like this one: ``Seniors today
have no sweat unless they live to be 120 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Nellie King, who had trouble getting into the arena even though
she is superintendent of the Lackawanna City School District,
described the Social Security plan as ``excellent.'' She said she
did not want to end up in the kind of poverty she was born into as
a sharecropper's daughter in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am 56 and I hope to retire in the 21st century, and I hope
the Social Security system will be there for me,'' she said. ``It
was through education that I was able to rise above the poverty
level, and when I retire I don't want to go back into poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she liked the State of the Union picture of a President
``totally in charge.'' ''I think the president is a role model
because he's a caring president,'' she said. ``All have sinned, and
I don't think what he did should have been exposed to the American
people.'' Some of the approbation came from registered Republicans
like Beverly Huber sprinkled through the arena crowd who have been
disenchanted with their party's harping on scandal surrounding the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't vote for him in either of the last two elections, but
I don't like the lynch-mob mentality in Washington right now,''
said Ms. Huber, a self-described baby boomer from Tonawanda. ``I
think he's a good president. His policies are for the middle class
and the common people, and the Republicans seem to be for the upper
classes and the radical right.''

SNUBBING WIDOWS AND HEROES

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - An atomic bomb detonated in Rep. John Shadegg's face
about 30 seconds into the president's State of the Union speech
Tuesday night, and he didn't even flinch.
</P>
<P>
   It happened just after Bill Clinton said, ``Let me begin by
saluting the new speaker of the House, and thanking him for
extending invitations to two special guests who are sitting in the
gallery with Mrs. Hastert. Widows of the two brave Capitol Police
officers who gave their lives to defend freedom's house.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then _ as Lyn Gibson, widow of Special Agent John Gibson,
and Wei Ling Chestnut, widow of Officer Jacob J. Chestnut rose to
accept the wild applause of every person in the chamber _ Shadegg's
decision to boycott the event went up like a mushroom cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad there wasn't enough fallout to penetrate a politician's
hard ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stands by his decision not to attend,'' Shadegg's press
aide told me Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   By skipping the speech, the Arizona congressman wasn't there to
applaud the widows of two officers killed last July trying to
protect him and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg and other Republicans who refused to attend the speech
wrote a letter saying, ``The president is demonstrating his lack of
respect for Congress. We will not play a role in facilitating his
disrespect.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that what Capt. Jeffrey B. Taliaferro was doing? Facilitating
disrespect?
</P>
<P>
   Taliaferro is a pilot who flew B-1 bomber missions over Iraq
during Operation Desert Fox. He, too, was greeted with a standing
ovation after being pointed out by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   What about Ashley Dumas, the AmeriCorps volunteer working with
single mothers in South Boston? Or Loc Truong, the former
Vietnamese refugee who mentors boys in San Luis Obispo?
</P>
<P>
   They, too, were singled out by Clinton. Were they demonstrating
their lack of respect for Congress by agreeing to attend?
</P>
<P>
   Is that also true of Officer Chris Lonsford, who received a
medal of valor from the Fontana, Calif., police department last
March and was another guest of the president?
</P>
<P>
   Is it true of Suzann Wilson, whose 11-year-old daughter was shot
and killed by schoolmates in Jonesboro, Ark., and who now works to
keep firearms out of children's hands?
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows that the first objective of a State of the Union
address is making the president look good. Mostly, this is done by
having the big guy make promises he knows he can't keep. Nobody's
fooled.
</P>
<P>
   We put up with it because the State of the Union is also a pep
rally, a nationally-televised excuse to celebrate the country and
point out some of our best people.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the president finished Tuesday night, Shadegg was
on a Phoenix talk radio program saying Clinton has ``no class.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Sammy Sosa?
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs star attended the speech. The president praised
Sosa for helping to bring relief to hurricane victims in the
Dominican Republic. The crowd cheered.
</P>
<P>
   What about Rosa Parks?
</P>
<P>
   She was also there. When Clinton declared her a living icon of
the American civil rights movement, all of the Representatives and
Senators stood up and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Shadegg told me he meant no offense to anyone
honored by Clinton. ``My only concern here was, Is it appropriate
in the midst of the impeachment proceeding for this speech to go
forward?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I leveled that criticism both at our leadership, with a
letter I sent to the speaker before I made my decision not to
attend, and also by my decision not to attend. Which was a personal
decision of conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   You make the call:
</P>
<P>
   On one side are Shadegg and his buddies. On the other side are
the police widows, the young volunteers, the mother, the cop, the
bomber pilot, Sammy Sosa, Rosa Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Which group has no class? &QL;

WALSH GREAT, BUT MUST BE BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There is nothing new about Bill Walsh, believe
you me. He's been introduced, re-introduced, crowned, defrocked,
recrowned, analyzed, worshipped, annoyed, understood, misunderstood
and combed over until there is little new to say about him.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is his fault, necessarily. He is a 67-year-old man
who has been doing his work in the San Francisco area for nearly 40
years now, as public a figure as this neck of the woods has
produced in years. He sneezes, and a thousand people want to know
how it affects the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know. He sneezed, and the 49ers begin a new era. And
every 49ers fan is thrilled beyond measure by the very prospect.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good, then. Everyone gets what they want _ except
maybe for those wonderfully misguided souls who don't see the
wonder in a story about a front office that literally never ends.
</P>
<P>
   There is unadulterated worship for Walsh now just as there was
in 1992, when he was reintroduced at a news conference as the head
coach of Stanford University. The '92 press conference was a
combination pep rally and ``This Is Your Life'' episode, the likes
of which Stanford had never seen, nor will see again.
</P>
<P>
   The theme remains the same _ the master returns.
</P>
<P>
   There is, though, a fundamental difference this time. Walsh
returned in 1992 to do mortal combat with the idealized Walsh, the
one who sent Stanford to bowl games in 1977 and '78 and revitalized
the football operation, and the one who took the 49ers from
junkyard dogs to best in breed in almost record time. That he was
coming back to Stanford direct from a disappointing engagement as
NBC's lead NFL color man was irrelevant _ we knew he knew football
in ways that few men ever match, and even at 60, he would surely
maintain Dennis Green's standard of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   As we know now, he didn't. He won 10 games with Green's senior
class, then lost touch with his players and didn't replenish the
roster, put up two consecutive losing seasons, and resigned to
pursue his muse. He went into what can best be called private
practice, surfacing for the odd motivational speech and an
ill-fated tourlet being ignored by the deposed 49ers front officers
Dwight Clark and Vinny Cerrato, but mostly he was out of sight, if
not out of mind.
</P>
<P>
   People still longed for his leonine silhouette, his bright
silver hair, his erudition and his plain old Walshness.
</P>
<P>
   And now the image and its owner are back. He is in an unfamiliar
place _ general manager. He is working in an unfamiliar arena _ cap
ball. He is working for an unfamiliar owner _ Eddie DeBartolo with
cash concerns, as opposed to the sky's-the-limit Eddie he knew in
the '80s. Not only that, he comes back to confront a checking
account that is $28 million in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   This would cause concern to 49ers fans who have found as much
enjoyment in watching the organization go nuts this past year as in
watching them win 13 games without satisfying anyone. It should,
too, but it won't. Because the one thing that has endured when all
other things have not is Bill Walsh's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   He has outlasted DeBartolo, in concept and in execution. He has
outlasted Joe Montana, and Dwight Clark, and Ronnie Lott, and Fred
Dean, and Wendell Tyler, and George Seifert, and Carmen Policy, and
all the other 49ers who have come and gone since 1979 _ everyone
save, of course, John McVay, who puts a face on the dictionary
listing for ``survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Issues remain, of course. Will he succeed at re-ordering the
franchise on the old specs? If the old specs don't work, will he
have new ones ready? Will he stay on the job long enough for the
organization to be fully re-freshened? Will DeBartolo allow him the
freedom he did in 1985, and took back from him in 1988?
</P>
<P>
   Can he outdo the romanticized version of himself?
</P>
<P>
   Again, logic says no, because going home again is a lot harder
than it looks, especially in this racket. It can't be this easy,
can it?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes it can, the acolytes tell you, because he is Bill Walsh,
and Bill Walsh is enough.
</P>
<P>
   And there's nothing new about that, either.

HOW TO USE THE SURPLUS: THE GREAT DEBATE BEGINS

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a yearlong transition in which both parties
struggled to shift from an era of crippling federal budget deficits
to an anticipated age of fiscal plenty, the battle has at last been
joined over how the country should allocate the flood of excess
money streaming into Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In an immediate sense, the debate is whether nearly all the
surplus will be needed for the twin pillars of the social welfare
system, Social Security and Medicare, as Democrats assert, or
whether there is plenty to take care of those looming problems and
still return much of the surplus to the people in the form of tax
cuts, as Republicans say.
</P>
<P>
   In a broader sense, though, it is about the size and role of the
federal government, a familiar ideological issue but one that has
been seen for most of the last two decades through the prism of
deficit reduction.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton changed that on Tuesday night in his State of
the Union address. The headlines were about his proposal for
shoring up Social Security, but Clinton was setting out to do
something more than deal with the retirement system's future.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the government is going to take in $4.4
trillion more than needed to pay for current programs over the next
15 years, a previously undisclosed and staggeringly big windfall
that, if it materializes, would be unlike anything the country has
ever experienced. Roughly 60 percent of the money would come from
excess payroll tax revenues that are earmarked for Social Security.
The rest would be a true surplus, the difference between general
tax revenues and what the government would spend to maintain
current programs at their existing levels.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just repeating his demand from a year ago that the
projected surpluses be left untouched until Social Security's
future is assured, Clinton laid out exactly how he would spend the
money. Social Security was at the top of the list. But Clinton also
proposed using hundreds of billions of dollars for Medicare,
unveiled a plan under which the government would subsidize
retirement savings accounts for low- and middle-income workers, and
said he would set aside big sums for the Pentagon, education and
other domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   In setting out his priorities, Clinton was moving into a policy
vacuum that he had created last year with his ``Save Social
Security first'' strategy. But Republicans, who last year had been
shy about advancing any big ideas because of their well-founded
fears that they would be accused by Democrats of endangering Social
Security, immediately made clear that they would be far less
inhibited this year.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking an issue as potent as Social Security to claim as their
own, they turned to the one idea that unites their fractious party,
tax cuts, and proposed a plan that they say combines good economic
policy with strong political appeal, reducing income tax rates by
10 percent across the board.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that _ to the degree it is not consumed with
Clinton's impeachment trial _ Washington will see a wide-ranging
ideological debate this year over fundamentally different views of
how the country should capitalize on its good fortune.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The president essentially made the case that we should use
this period of extra resources and prosperity to invest in the
future and save to solve future retirement challenges,'' said Gene
Sperling, the White House economic policy director. ``The
Republicans seemed to respond by suggesting we should go to
across-the-board consumption. That's a good solid policy debate for
the nation to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's view of an activist government shoring up the social
safety-net programs played to the liberal wing of his party, but
with a twist: He portrayed himself as the champion of austerity,
dedicated to paying down the national debt to levels not seen since
World War One.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were energized to make the case for a
smaller federal government once again, a task they admitted would
be more difficult now that the discipline of reducing the deficit
can no longer be the backbone of their argument. They said tax cuts
would not only put more money back in the hands of the people out
of whose paychecks it is coming, but would help strangle the
federal bureaucracy and push power out of Washington back closer to
the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Ronald Reagan extended spending and borrowing a great
deal in the 1980s, the deficit was a forced limit on the growth of
government,'' said Rep. Nick Smith, R-Mich., who would once have
been known as a deficit hawk. ``Now that damper is sort of off, and
we're going to have to make an upfront philosophical decision
whether we want to reduce taxes and slow the growth of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're faced with a situation where there's still a political
advantage to coming up with programs that do new things for more
people and spend more money,'' he said. ``It's going to be a huge
challenge even in the Republican ranks not to take advantage of
spending some of that money on programs they think are important.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains unclear is whether the debate will lead to
bipartisan deals on issues like Social Security, or whether it will
simply allow the two parties to define what they stand for heading
into the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Having the debate serve as an electoral platform ``is the more
probable outcome, but that's not inconsequential by itself,'' said
Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. ``To frame the issue for debate and
consideration in the election is worthwhile, and maybe some
progress can be made toward resolving the issue in some way this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic scenario is that the surplus is so big, and the
options for dealing with issues like Social Security so fluid, that
there is plenty of room for a legacy-minded president and a
Republican leadership eager to prove it can pass legislation to
come to some accommodation this year.
</P>
<P>
   The pessimistic scenario is that the battle over Clinton's
impeachment has so poisoned the atmosphere in Washington that the
two parties will never trust each other enough to join together in
addressing politically sensitive issues. And without any consensus
on how to use the surplus, it could gradually be eaten away by
politically popular tax-and-spending programs from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have paid the price for running up huge deficits, and we
have finally, with the help of good economic times as well as hard
work by politicians, gotten past that,'' said Martha Phillips,
executive director of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog
group. ``Now we have to find a way for politicians to do their
thing without going too far.''

DISNEY, HONG KONG SAID TO BE NEAR AGREEMENT FOR THEME PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Walt Disney Co. may build a theme park in
China, but it's likely that at least a decade will pass before the
entertainment giant breaks ground in the world's most populous
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Disney and the Hong Kong government reportedly are near a
preliminary agreement to build an attraction that would open as
early as 2004, according to Bloomberg News, which cited an unnamed
person familiar with the discussions. Analysts believe talks
between the government and the suburban Burbank-based entertainment
giant have probably taken place but were dubious about the
timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is certainly a rich and fertile market, but it won't be
ready for a Disney theme park for another 10 years,'' said Dennis
Speigel, head of Cincinnati-based International Theme Park
Services.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant, who has been active in advising Chinese park
operators over the past decade, said China's economy isn't healthy
enough yet to justify a large-scale theme park. ``Everyone in the
world wants to have fun, but they have to be able to afford it,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Recent comments by Disney Chairman Michael Eisner undoubtedly
heated up rumors. ``I am completely confident that the Chinese
people would love Mickey no less than a Big Mac,'' he said in his
annual letter to shareholders. ``As evidenced by the popularity of
McDonald's, we could be getting close to the time for a major
Disney attraction in the world's most populous nation.''
</P>
<P>
   If Disney goes forward with a Hong Kong attraction, the theme
park would be its third in Asia: Tokyo Disneyland opened 16 years
ago, and Tokyo DisneySea is due to open in 2001. But Speigel warned
that many Hong Kong tourists are unlikely to visit theme parks
during their stays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong tourism is largely focused on the business
community, where people are in and out in for a day of meetings and
out the next day,'' he added. ``It's a different mentality than in
Tokyo.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg reported Disney could reach a deal within three
months. The Hong Kong Daily News said the park will open in early
2004 in Tolo Harbor, in the suburban New Territories, and will
provide 12,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Tom Deegan called the reports speculation and
cited Disney's policy of not commenting on rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Linda Bannister of Edward Jones &AMP; Co., who met this week
with Disney executives, said Disney would probably wait eight to 10
years before opening a Chinese theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal could be hampered by the high cost of land in Hong
Kong, she added, so Disney may opt for a scaled-down ``regional''
facility that could include attractions like Club Disney and
DisneyQuest indoor parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are definitely interested in that market, and there's a
huge opportunity in that part of the world, but I don't think
they're jumping in with both feet,'' Bannister said. ``You're
likely to see gradual introduction of Disney products.''
</P>
<P>
   Sha added that Disney is unlikely to own a Chinese theme park
outright, but rather would operate it as a joint venture or under a
licensing agreement that would pay it royalties. ``Disney's great
with Imagineering but if they find a local partner who understands
the culture, they're probably a lot better off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's theme-park business has been a solid performer for the
past decade, with Eisner pushing expansion through new projects
such as the $1 billion Animal Kingdom, which opened last spring in
Florida. Speigel believes Disney's discussions about Hong Kong are
designed both to lay the future groundwork for a project and to
dissuade rivals from entering the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is doing the exploration we all do in this business,''
he said. ``I think they're running the flag up the pole to keep out
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe Disney's efforts to expand into China were hurt
by its 1997 film ``Kundun,'' which focused on China's occupation of
Tibet. Last summer's release of ``Mulan,'' in which a young Chinese
woman helps turn away Mongol invaders, probably eased those
tensions.

 &HT;        PENNSYLVANIA STEEL WORKERS TRAVEL TO THE CAPITOL TO STAND UP
FOR STEEL   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 20, -- Laid-off steel worker Jeff Dellenbaugh
looked at his sleeping son before leaving in the middle of the
night on a bus with other steel workers to attend a rally Wednesday
at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to say I did this for him,'' said the
Washington County, Pa., resident. ``I did this to fight for my job
back and for his future in this steel town and steel family. My
father worked in a steel mill.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellenbaugh was one of nearly 3,000 steel workers and industry
officials from Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia who attended a
``Stand Up for Steel'' rally urging President Clinton to put an end
to a surge of cheap foreign steel imports. On the front porch of
the Capitol, steel workers heard speeches from lawmakers and
industry leaders calling for a curb on foreign imports. Most of the
workers traveled all night by bus from the headquarters of Weirton
Steel Corp., in the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The event was sponsored by the Ohio Valley Stand Up for Steel
Committee, which is made up of Weirton Steel Corp.,
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, and the Independent Steelworkers of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Steel industry officials say a flood of cheap foreign steel
imports have caused 10,000 layoffs and forced several companies to
make cutbacks or go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic steel officials charge that foreign companies are
``dumping'' their product - or selling it for below market value.
Companies and unions have lodged trade complaints against Japan,
Russia and Brazil, seeking to impose duties. ``We don't want
handouts, we just want a fair and level playing field,'' said
Dellenbaugh, who had worked for nine years as an overhead crane
operator at Weirton Steel. President Clinton recently proposed
giving $300 million in tax breaks for steel companies. But
Clinton's plan did not set quotas or force nations to adopt
voluntary limits on their exports, two measures backed by the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who chairs the Senate Steel Caucus,
and lawmakers from other steel producing states, announced
legislation to lower standards for proving injury in trade disputes
which would make it easier for the industry to obtain quotas and
broad tariffs against the dumping of foreign steel. At the rally,
Specter called upon the president to act further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has the power to put tariffs and duties today,''
Specter said, a comment which was met with cries from the crowd of
``Let's do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about Russia's economy, but I'm more concerned
about Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Johnstown, vice-chair of the House Steel
Caucus, co-sponsored a bill that sets up an import monitoring
program for steel.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha said it was his first priority in Congress to help the
nearly 2,000 steel workers who live in his district and commute to
steel mills.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha said he urged White House officials, whom he met with
Wednesday in a briefing, to take action that would have an
immediate impact on the steel crisis.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the Capitol police asked the rally participants
not to use blow-horns or whistles so they wouldn't disturb the
business going on inside the Capitol. The request was met with
little cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the people's business,'' yelled one woman,
referring to President Clinton's ongoing impeachment trial in the
Senate. ``This out here is the people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, workers streamed down Pennsylvania Avenue
holding white picket signs that said ``Stand Up for Steel,'' to
Lafayette Park, across from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked, West Virginia steel worker Bill Stephens, said he
feels like he has two jobs.
</P>
<P>
   One, said the 55-year-old, is working as a machinist at the
Weirton Steel Co. The other, is trying to keep that job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we made a point today,'' said Stephens, who had
left for the rally after finishing a full shift at the steel
company. ``Now I can go home and go to sleep knowing I did this.''

WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS ATTEMPT TO TEAR DOWN IMPEACHMENT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House lawyers on Wednesday challenged the
facts and legal interpretations undergirding the impeachment case
against President Clinton, hoping to convince senators that there
is enough doubt to warrant acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping up the second day of President Clinton's defense in the
Senate impeachment trial, White House lawyer Cheryl Mills gave an
emotion-laden appeal for exoneration, telling senators ``those
stubborn, stubborn facts'' favor the president.
</P>
<P>
   In a slow, deliberate voice, Mills invoked her status as an
African-American and a woman to attack the Republican case against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a lawyer, as an American, and as an African-American, (the
rule of law) is a principle in which I believe to the very core of
my being,'' she said. ``If you love the rule of law, you must love
it in all of its applications. ... If it is applied equally, the
rule of law exonerates Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, she sought to undermine the prosecution theory that
Clinton's actions were rooted in his effort to undermine Paula
Jones' effort to pursue justice in her civil rights lawsuit
alleging sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about civil rights because this president's
record on civil rights, on women's rights ... is unimpeachable,''
Mills said. ``The house of civil rights is strong because its
foundation is strong. And with all due respect, the foundation of
the house of civil rights was never at the core of the Jones
case.''
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Gregory Craig said Clinton ``has a strong
and a compelling case, one that is based on the facts, on the
record, on the law and on the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig took aim at the first impeachment article charging Clinton
with lying under oath during his Aug. 17, 1998, grand jury
appearance about his affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, as well as his testimony in his Jan. 17, 1998, deposition
in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the deposition, Clinton denied having ``sexual relations''
with Lewinsky under the terms of a definition handed to him by
Jones' lawyers. In his grand jury testimony, he acknowledged
``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Lewinsky, but defended his
deposition statement as technically accurate under the definition.
</P>
<P>
   Craig accused House Republican prosecutors of trying to pin
their perjury case on Clinton's deposition, even though the House
specifically rejected an impeachment article based on that
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you believe president crossed the lines in the Jones
case, you cannot conclude that he should be removed for it,'' Craig
said. ``He wasn't impeached for it. This case is about the grand
jury and the grand jury alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig also defended legal hairsplitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``In defending the president of the United States, we intend,
and we will use, all the legal defenses that are available to us,''
Craig said. ``Legalistic though some of these legal defenses may
be, these are the respectable and respected, acceptable and
expected defenses available to anyone charged with this kind of a
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of lying by Clinton are ``frequently trivial,
almost always technical, often immaterial and always
insubstantial,'' Craig said. ``We are the ones who must cry
`foul.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mills defended Clinton against the accusation that he obstructed
justice when he allegedly conspired with his secretary, Betty
Currie, to hide gifts he had exchanged with Lewinsky at a time when
they had been subpoenaed by the lawyers for Jones in her sexual
harassment lawsuit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors argued that in their final White House meeting
Dec. 28, 1997, Lewinsky and Clinton discussed the possibility of
Currie taking charge of the gifts. Clinton, Lewinsky testified,
replied ``I don't know'' or ``let me think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills argued that Clinton was unconcerned about gifts because he
gave Lewinsky new gifts during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those stubborn, stubborn facts,'' Mills said. ``They show that
this was not obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   She also defended Clinton's conversation with Currie on Jan. 18,
1998, the day after the Jones deposition, in which Clinton picked
Currie's brain about Lewinsky in what House prosecutors
characterized as an effort to enlist her backup in a false account
of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wasn't trying to coach Currie about what to say if she
were asked about his relationship with Lewinsky, Mills argued.
Rather, his intent was to ward off ``a looming media firestorm.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, a conservative Clinton critic, said
Mills' presentation had been effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone pretty much all the way through was riveted on what
she had to say,'' he said.

<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The White House case is expected to conclude its case Thursday
with Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall, addressing elements
of the second impeachment article alleging that Clinton obstructed
justice in hiding his affair with Lewinsky. Kendall will be joined
by former Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., an old political ally of
Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Senators then can submit written questions through Chief Justice
William Rehnquist to lawyers for the White House team and the House
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Senate is expected to take up a motion to dismiss
the case. If the motion fails, the lawmakers are likely to take up
the volatile issue of whether to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said there are ``still a lot of
conflicts members have questions about. My sense is it would be
helpful to have witnesses'' to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, suggested that momentum to call witnesses
was slowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be more fluidity than it appears,'' said Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass. ``I've had a number of conversations with
Republicans... some Republicans may be finding that witnesses may
not be helpful to their case.''
</P>
<P>
   To convict Clinton and remove him from office requires the votes
of 67 senators, a two-thirds majority. The Senate is divided 55-45,
with Republicans in the majority.

STRUGGLING NEWCOM TO LAY OFF 40 WORKERS, CUT EXECUTIVES' PAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- High-speed communications product maker NewCom
Inc. has announced a sweeping restructuring that includes laying
off nearly 30 percent of its employees, hiring an interim president
and a pay cut for executives.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of NewCom fell 56.25 cents, or 22 percent, to $1.96875 on
Wednesday on volume of 386,600 shares. That's about seven times the
30-day average volume.
</P>
<P>
   The changes at the suburban Westlake Village-based company came
five days after it reported a $15.7 million third-quarter loss.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Curran, an outside board member who was an executive at
IBM for 21 years, becomes NewCom's interim president. Meanwhile,
the company is looking for a permanent replacement for Sultan Khan,
who had filled that job.
</P>
<P>
   Khan will remain NewCom's chief executive officer and chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last two years at NewCom, I have greatly appreciated
Mr. Curran's expertise and support,'' Khan said in a statement.
``In this time of rapid change in our industry, his help will be
invaluable in providing me an opportunity to step back from the
day-to-day responsibilities and work on the strategic positioning
of NewCom.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty employees, most involved in manufacturing, will lose their
jobs in the restructuring, the company said. It now has 104
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Six senior managers at NewCom have taken a 10 percent pay cut,
which puts their compensation at 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
   NewCom also said Ed Stoltenberg, the company's chief financial
officer, resigned because his family did not want to relocate from
their Rhode Island home. He will provide financial consulting until
a replacement is found.
</P>
<P>
   NewCom said it is repositioning itself to take advantage of
emerging markets in the consumer field such as DVD digital cameras
and digital modes for high-speed Internet access and computer
networks.

NCAA A FINE ONE TO PREACH TO NEWSPAPERS

<P>
   An NCAA honcho named William S. Saum was minding other people's
business last week when he threw down a challenge to all
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Stop printing point spreads on games _ that's what Saum had to
say at the NCAA convention in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is one spread Mr. Saum won't be able to cover,
but it's a continuing theme for both him and the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only encouraging betting,'' Saum said. ``Unless a
newspaper is based in Nevada, where betting on sports is legal, a
point spread shouldn't be printed.''

   For credibility, be it moralistic or Jerry Tarkanian, the NCAA
is one of the last institutions that should be placing itself upon
a pedestal. From the top of the organization down to member
schools, there is the ongoing question of just how do-right these
people really are.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, of course, there has been an outbreak of college
basketball point-shaving scandals, and one in football, involving
student-athletes. As director of gambling activity for the NCAA,
Saum is highly concerned, and should be. He is also hardly alone in
his concern.
</P>
<P>
   But if certain NCAA schools are giving the wink to
student-athletes on everything from under-the-table cash, entrance
exams, grades, cars, etc., then the next logical step was probably
predictable. Meaning, what's the harm in my team losing by 10
points, instead of nine, if the spread is nine.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, gambling is a major industry in this country,
legal or illegal, and the quest for an edge brings out the bandits.
</P>
<P>
   But what the heck does that have to do with point spreads being
printed in basically every sports section in the country, including
this one?
</P>
<P>
   This is the truth. Honest. And upon request, reliable witnesses
will be produced to verify the following:
</P>
<P>
   It's been at least 20 years since I placed a wager on a college
sporting event. Or professional, either.
</P>
<P>
   At Lone Star Park, however, I do believe strongly in pounding
the windows. It's just that my long-standing rule is don't risk
money on the athletic endeavors of any two-legged creatures,
although the Falcons plus seven is extremely tempting.
</P>
<P>
   But as a nongambler on football, basketball or baseball, one of
the first things I look for in the sports section is the point
spread or baseball odds. I don't think I'm alone, either.
</P>
<P>
   For a fan, the best indicator we have of how one team ranks
against another is how ``the line'' is set in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the apparent Sun Bowl mismatch between TCU and
Southern Cal. I had no idea how to handicap that game, but personal
opinion would have had TCU over a three-touchdown underdog.
</P>
<P>
   When Vegas put the line at 16, it was like a compliment to the
Frogs. And TCU's massive upset will always be remembered as a
gallant 16-point 'dog coming through. Vegas gave us that number,
which provided the predicted difference in the two teams, even for
those of us who didn't bet.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the betting line has its quirks. Handicappers
put up a number based on their opinion of how the legal money in
Las Vegas will flow. In the Cowboys' glory days of this decade, if
Dallas was favored by seven, you could usually assume the Cowboys
were actually a five- or six-point favorite. Since the Cowboys were
a team that normally drew betting action, points might be added.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers print the line for entertainment, information, and
opinion. Gamblers who are going to wager large sums obviously know
the line without having to turn to the sports section.
</P>
<P>
   Saum was not in his Kansas City office yesterday, or else I
would have asked him this:
</P>
<P>
   In North Texas, there have repeatedly been scandals involving
religious leaders, including pastors and priests. Should newspapers
discontinue religion sections?
</P>
<P>
   The medical community keeps telling us there are too many fat
people in this country. Since being overweight is a health problem,
are newspaper food sections to blame?
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the NCAA backed down after threatening to
withhold Final Four credentials for any newspaper printing the
point spread. There is some thought the NCAA will try to use that
muscle again.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for a Bill Saum is certainly real. It's just that
his solution is not realistic. \Ntagtop:Randy Galloway's Sports at

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in Congress and Alan Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said on Wednesday that
President Clinton's proposal to have the government invest a
portion of Social Security reserves in the stock market would
endanger the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But while some influential Republicans said the plan proposed by
Clinton in the State of the Union message on Tuesday night was so
off base it left no room for compromise, many others saw the
proposal as an opening bid that could lead to fruitful
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee on
Wednesday, Greenspan, whose views on economic matters carry
considerable weight in Congress and on Wall Street, said he
supported the president's notion of putting almost two-thirds of
the federal budget surpluses in the next 15 years into Social
Security reserves. But he said the idea of having the government
invest part of the money in the stock market could threaten the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The most pessimistic of the top lawmakers interviewed on
Wednesday was Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, a Republican who is one of
the foremost authorities in Congress on Social Security. ``I was
profoundly disappointed in what the president proposed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said he feared that ``the whole thing is dead for this
Congress'' and that ``we may have to wait for a new president to
take office'' before the issue can be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   But asked about that view, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, chairman
of the Ways and Means Committee, replied, ``I'm not that
pessimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president's opening shot ducks out on facing up to
the real issues,'' said Archer, whose committee will have first
crack in Congress at writing a new law, ``but I'm not sure this is
his final shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's plan to address the potential insolvency
of the retirement system when the baby boom generation retires, 62
percent of the projected surpluses in the next 15 years _ about
$2.7 trillion out of total surpluses of about $4.4 trillion _ would
be used to bolster Social Security's cash reserves. The Clinton
administration calculates that this would extend solvency to 2055
from 2032, protecting almost everyone who is now working.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this money would be used to pay off the government's
debt. Economists believe that lowering the debt, now about $5.5
trillion, would reduce interest rates, generate private investment
and stimulate economic growth, all of which would make it easier
for the children of baby boomers to pay their parents' retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But the president would invest $700 billion of the $2.7 trillion
in the stock market, which over the long term has historically
produced substantially higher returns than the government bonds
where the Social Security reserves are now invested. The White
House says these higher returns would extend Social Security
solvency for about five years of the extended solvency, to 2055
instead of 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insist that care would be taken to make
sure the investments were insulated from politics. But Greenspan
and Republicans in Congress are skeptical of government
participation in private financial markets, and this is where they
take strongest issue with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, for example, said he supported the idea of using most
of the surplus to shore up Social Security reserves. But as for
government investment in the stock market, he said, ``I do not
believe that it is politically feasible to insulate such huge funds
from government direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Political pressures, Greenspan said, could lead to inefficient
investments that, in turn, would result in a lower rate of return
for retirees and a lower standard of living for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans took a similar stand. ``It amounts to
nationalization of American industry,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe of
Arizona. ``It's scary. They haven't thought it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, almost without exception, favor investing
retirement money in financial markets, but they would have workers
invest the money themselves in their own private accounts rather
than having the investments placed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, with the support of most Democrats in Congress,
believes that such individual investments could breach the social
safety net and result in unsophisticated workers' risking their
retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are not united behind any particular plan. Some,
like Kolbe, would allow workers voluntarily to invest a portion of
their payroll taxes. Their guaranteed Social Security benefits
would be reduced accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans would maintain the current Social Security tax
and benefit structure but would give workers an income tax cut if
they invested the money for their retirement. This would ultimately
cause the federal deficit to rise again if taxes were not raised or
government spending reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw of Florida, the new chairman of the Social
Security subcommittee in the House, said he was optimistic a
compromise could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has opened the door toward investing in the
private sector,'' Shaw said. ``Republicans don't support the idea
of the government doing the investing, but it's a good thing the
president has opened the dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire calculated the odds of finding
a consensus at 20 to 1. But before the president's speech, Gregg
said, he would have set the odds at 200 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, the Ways and Means Committee chairman, is retiring at
the end of this Congress, and he said that like Clinton, he would
like to leave a solvent Social Security system as a legacy of his
years in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do want to work something out and get this solved
during the last two years for Clinton and me,'' Archer said. Then,
referring to impeachment, he quickly added, ``Assuming he goes on
for another two years.''

SNOW BIKING X-TREMELY COMPETITIVE
</HEADLINE>

By MARK LANGTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. _ If you're an extreme-sports junky, the
last few days you have been glued to the tube, locked onto ESPN
much like a tongue to a frozen piece of metal. It's that time again
when the made-for-TV Winter X Games takes just-left-of-center
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Over the short life span of the Winter X Games, ESPN has
elevated ice climbing and snowmobile racing to almost cult status.
</P>
<P>
   Already established sports like snowboarding and skiing were
given twists that not only make them more fun to watch, but give
them that extra bit of danger necessary to keep you on the couch
and your fingers off the remote.
</P>
<P>
   Butthe most bizarre event has to be Biker X, in which six snow
mountain bike racers slalom through course at speeds exceeding 45
mph with a last-cyclist pedaling mentality. (Biker X airs tonight
from 5 to 7:30 on ESPN2 and 9:30 to 11 on ESPN; watch for terms
like potato chip _ a seriously bent wheel _ and wild pigs _ squeaky
brakes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``My neck still hurts from a bad crash in the dual slalom, which
ESPN featured again and again and again from three different
angles. That was nice,'' said Dan Hanebrink of Big Bear Lake, a
mountain bike pioneer and former Winter X Games competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Hanebrink been a seminal figure in mountain bike
design, from frames to suspension, he is also the brains behind
perhaps the most distinctive mountain bike available today, the
Extreme Terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Developed in 1994 to enable mountain bikers to ride the snow
drifts that descend each winter onto his home town nestled high in
the San Bernardino Mountains, Hanebrink's radical bike is designed
around the tires of all-terrain vehicles, or ATVs. The result is a
bike that can float over snow, sand and loose gravel like no
conventional mountain bike. He even has a design in which the front
wheel has been replaced by a pair of skis.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, snow biking was not born out of competition, but
rather practicality. As far back as the early 1900s, prospectors in
Alaska used bicycles to cross the tundra.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain bikes can traverse snow quite well, actually, depending
on the consistency of the surface. A crusty top works best, one
that has melted slightly and then been refrozen. It's best to have
slightly lowered tire pressure and the widest tire possible,
preferably studded, and a very soft touch on the front brake while
descending _ just in case you were thinking of finding some snow to
ride.
</P>
<P>
   But many recreational activities end up as sports, and snow
biking is not excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Even though mountain bike racing on snow might seem right out of
the ``Weird Science'' bin, downhill snow-bike racing has been going
on for almost 10 years at places like Colorado's Breckenridge and
Arapahoe Basin resort, and locally at Bear Mountain. The Winter X
Games' snow mountain biking events debuted in 1997 at Snow Summit;
this year's event was held for the second consecutive year at
Crested Butte in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The IditaSport, a 200-mile winter race in Alaska open to
mountain bikers, cross country skiers and snowshoers, is routinely
won by mountain bikes, some specially equipped with double-wide
rims and tires.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a movement afoot by the Alpine Snow Bike
Association to get snow mountain bike racing into the Olympics. As
the interest in mountain bikes escalates, it stands to reason more
people are crossing over to snow mountain biking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know the numbers, because we're really just
starting out,'' said ASBA chairman Dean Crandall. ``Currently there
are about 200 active snow bike racers, but it's probably a lot like
mountain biking in general. Look at mountain bike racing; there are
about 35,000 NORBA (National Off-Road Bicycle Association) members,
and 10 million mountain bikers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is probably a larger number of people snow biking
recreationally, we just don't know about them all yet. But we're
getting more and more people every day calling telling us that
they're snow biking.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanebrink has done his part to promote the recreation, which has
reverted to a practical mode of mountain transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my own personal Extreme Terrain bike that I commute to
work on,'' said John Keating, manager of Hanebrink's manufacturing
facility in Big Bear City. ``I can ride right out the door on a
fresh powder morning, pedaling past stuck motorists or people lying
on their backs putting chains on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanebrink has built nearly 2,000 Extreme Terrain bikes, with a
customer list that includes Joe Montana, Dustin Hoffman and Michael
Ovitz. Hanebrink also recently delivered two bikes that will assist
scientists from the Center of Astrophysical Research for the
Antarctic explore the dry valleys of the South Pole, where
temperatures can reach 130 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an enormous interest in the idea of riding bikes on
snow. That's what got me started,'' Hanebrink said. ``But it turns
out that regular mountain bikes really don't do so good on snow;
they're very limited. I've tried every scheme to ride on snow (with
regular mountain bikes) _ studs, low-pressure tires _ but you're
really at the mercy of the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that reason, I totally designed the Extreme Terrain bike
for people like myself _ serious mountain bike racers who lived in
ski resorts,'' he said. ``But what I found was that racers weren't
interested. It was everybody else, plumbers, doctors, lawyers, even
the guy who doesn't have a bicycle. It appeals to the non-racer
more than the racer.''
</P>
<P>
   At 58, Hanebrink can still go wheel-to-wheel with the best in
gravity biking.
</P>
<P>
   While he didn't medal at the inaugural Winter X Games two years
ago, he certainly got ``air time,'' as his was the most spectacular
crash of any of the runs, bouncing and cart-wheeling down the speed
course (since eliminated from the Winter X Games) and giving new
meaning to the term ``the agony of defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Hanebrink is going for a more practical
application for his Extreme Terrain bikes _ adapting them for use
on golf courses as an alternative to walking or using an electric
cart. So as you're watching cyclist hurtle themselves down the
slopes, just remember that you don't have to be extreme to ride a
bike on snow. &QL;

<P>
   BUFFALO _ President Clinton took the blueprint for the remainder
of his term on the road Wednesday and got a thunderous expression
of heartland support from the Democratic faithful in this
working-class town near the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   As his lawyers rolled out day two of his defense in the Senate
impeachment trial, Clinton fled Washington, marking his sixth
anniversary in office with a visit among the snow-covered fields
and factories of western New York and eastern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches in both places, Clinton asked Americans of all ages
to get behind his plan to invest $4 trillion over the next 15 years
preparing for an aging population. He took aim at Republican plans
to use much of the money for an across-the-board income tax cut,
saying the country needs to harness its current prosperity to
confront future challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot afford to squander this moment,'' Clinton told some
21,000 supporters gathered at the Marine Midland Arena, home of the
Buffalo Sabres hockey team. ''We have to make the most of it. We
have to look at the long-term challenges facing America.''
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday,
Clinton called for investing $2.7 trillion over the coming 15 years
to shore up the financially-ailing Social Security program, which
provides retirement benefits to one American in every six; some
$600 billion to help bolster Medicare, the federal health care
program for retirees; and another $500 billion to set up subsidized
savings accounts for lower-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Those proposals, Clinton said, could be paid for out of federal
budget surpluses projected to top $4 trillion over the coming
decade and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans regard the surplus as indicative of
over-taxation, not an opportunity to increase spending. They called
for a 10 percent cut in income taxes, an idea Clinton assailed on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have a big argument about this...and I hope it
will be a good debate,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned his supporters, however, against being tempted by
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I said last night is not as popular as what others can
tell you,'' Clinton said. ''Others can say 'We've got this surplus
now; I just want a big tax cut; I'll give it back to you, you'll
figure out what to do with it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He further admonished his backers to gird themselves for
arguments against government spending, saying his plan is to set
aside the projected surplus to deal with the aging of America, a
demographic shift that will begin to kick in 15 years from now,
when baby boomers begin to retire en masse.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to have everybody say that government doesn't
know how to spend this money,'' Clinton warned. ''Look folks,
Social Security and Medicare work. I'm not talking about spending
this money, I'm talking about saving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President
Al Gore and his wife Tipper, the president was greeted by
thunderous applause from the largest crowd he's addressed since his
post State of the Union speech a year ago in La Crosse, Wisc.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was more campaign rally than policy discussion, with
handmade posters endorsing Gore in 2000, and one calling on Mrs.
Clinton to seek office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary for New York Senator,'' read one sign. Clinton
directed his wife's attention to it, and she smiled broadly.
</P>
<P>
   She has not commented publicly on speculation over whether she
would run for the seat to be vacated in two years by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. She looked positively like candidate
material, though, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't _ I don't care what the weather forecasters say _
any warmer place in the United States,'' Mrs. Clinton told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   After speeches by both Gores and both Clintons, all four shook
hands. At one point, Mrs. Clinton was handed a bouquet of fresh
roses and mums by 8-year-old Peter Narby, a third-grader from a
Buffalo suburb. Appearing genuinely moved, Mrs. Clinton leaned over
a crowd-control rail and kissed the boy on the cheek, then told
autograph seekers to ''write me at the White House and I'll write
you back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was clearly energized by the response.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank you for one of the great days of my presidency,'' he
said, as his lawyers _ hundreds of miles away _ argued before the
Senate to save his office.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, though, Clinton's backers were clear about their
views on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to tell those people that the people down in the
heartland don't want the president impeached,'' said Brian Grassia,
owner of Evergreen Construction, a home remodeling and repair
business in nearby Amherst, N.Y. ''That's pretty obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoed Darlene Boykins, a Buffalo mental health therapy
assistant: ''He's done a good job, leave him alone. His private
life is his private life. That don't have anything to do with us.''

REPUBLICANS USE `RAPID RESPONSES' TO COUNTER CLINTON'S DEFENSE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When White House Counsel Gregory Craig took a short
break in his testimony at the Senate impeachment trial Wednesday,
his GOP adversaries sprung into action.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Craig stopped talking, several members of the
House Republican prosecution team were in front of the microphones
set up outside the Senate chamber trying to punch holes in the
White House argument.
</P>
<P>
   And later as Craig and his colleague Cheryl Mills were making
their case before the senators, staffers for the House managers
were roaming the Senate gallery where reporters work, passing out
response sheets, detailing where they believed the president's
attorneys had erred.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to influence lawmakers and shape public opinion during
the senate trial, Republicans may have stolen a page from President
Clinton's public relations machine.
</P>
<P>
   During his two presidential campaigns Clinton perfected a
rapid-fire response to his opponents accusations, often ensuring
that media coverage included both charge and countercharge.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the House managers, said the
Republicans had not modeled their approach after Clinton's or any
other campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The managers want to be very quick to respond to what they
perceive as the mischaracterization of their positions,'' McNulty
said.
</P>
<P>
   Each day the House Republicans and their staffs prepare the
responses, which are not only passed out to media but to the
senators.
</P>
<P>
   One typical response:
</P>
<P>
   ``White House claim: White House counsel Gregory Craig today
stated that the articles of impeachment are unconstitutional
because each article contains multiple charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Truth: The articles do not improperly charge multiple
offenses in one article. Mr. Craig's arguments are factually
deficient, ignore Senate precedent and procedure, and are
constitutionally flawed.``
</P>
<P>
   However, the quick rebuttals have irritated some Democratic
senators, who believe that the House managers should be talking to
them, not the media.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said that
Democratic senators were ``generally grousing about'' the
Republican press conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have something to present they ought to present it to
the senators on the floor,'' said the aide.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when the Republican managers were making their case
before the Senate, White House officials opted to release a short
statement at the conclusion of each day.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had considered putting together a ``rapid
response'' effort to counter the presentations, but Democratic
lawmakers, including Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, cautioned
against such an approach.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also considered having Democratic House members
who are on the Judiciary Committee respond to their GOP colleagues.
But that idea was also nixed.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign style response strategy is just one more way in
which the Senate procedure differ from courtroom proceedings, where
jurors are barred from considering evidence not presented during
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But most senators have long ago abandoned any pretense that they
are similar to jurors. While they pledged to be impartial and fair,
the senators have been eager to appear on television talk shows and
regularly grant interviews to reporters during breaks in testimony.
</P>
<P>
   They even joke about their new strange roles.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, walked by
Democratic colleague Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, who was
chatting with a half-dozen reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't believe a word'' she joked to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As she walked away, Dodd, laughed and responded, ``nice jury we
have here.''

CEREMONY DEDICATES BACKBONE TRAIL ADDITION
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The newest addition to the Backbone Trail was
officially dedicated last week, bringing the total of the proposed
70-mile trail to about 63 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.7-mile section, known as Zuma Canyon, heads northwest from
the Backbone Trailhead parking area off Kanan-Dume Road, located at
the first tunnel north of the Pacific Coast Highway (1).
</P>
<P>
   It's a beautiful course that meanders past numerous streams and
a waterfall in a lush riparian-oak habitat, connecting with Zuma
Ridge Motorway fire road, seven-tenths of a mile south of Encinal
Canyon Road.
</P>
<P>
   One of the marquee attractions in the National Park Service's
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, the Backbone Trail
_ which traverses the mountain chain from Point Mugu to Will Rogers
State Historical Park in Pacific Palisades _ was elevated to star
status by some of those in attendance at the Jan. 14 ribbon
cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SMMNRA is a much better attraction than Disneyland or
Universal City,'' said Bob Chandler, president of the National Park
Foundation, a nonprofit organization that raises funds for national
parks. Of course, Chandler harbors a certain amount of bias, having
been the recreation area's first superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, workers and volunteers have removed brush to
clear the track and install two bridges, several drainage culverts
and retaining walls to control erosion.
</P>
<P>
   The dedication ceremony was attended by National Park Service
and State Parks representatives, as well as U.S. Congressman Brad
Sherman (D-Woodland Hills). Sherman's efforts have resulted in
several million dollars in funding for completion of the Backbone
Trail by acquiring more private land in its proposed path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no biologist, but I can be certain that procuring funds
for the Santa Monica Mountains is as complex as any ecosystem on
the planet,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Completion of the trail was largely possible because of a
$40,000 grant provided by American Airlines through the National
Park Foundation. Through a unique program called ``Miles for
Trails,'' American Airlines travel members can donate their
frequent-flyer miles to trail projects around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of generous support from corporate sponsors... the
National Park Service, along with other agencies and nonprofit
organizations, has been able to move forward in closing a critical
gap in the Backbone Trail,'' said Art Eck, superintendent of the
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, the federal government allocated $6.5 million
for the completion of the entire trail. Costs include purchase of
private property needed to connect the Backbone Trail, or BBT, from
Zuma Ridge to the next areas of public open space to the west, the
closest being Circle X Ranch and Point Mugu State Park. Funds are
also earmarked for construction of the trail itself.
</P>
<P>
   In September, then-Gov. Pete Wilson rejected a bill that would
have taken more than 160 acres of the former Frank Capra estate to
help bridge the six-mile gap in the BBT.
</P>
<P>
   The Zuma Canyon section of the Backbone Trail effectively
extends the popular Solstice and Latigo canyons section of the BBT,
which heads eastward 6} miles from Kanan-Dume Road to Corral
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   As for future projects, additional construction is slated for
the northwest advancement of the BBT from Zuma Ridge, but exact
dates are not yet known.

IN NEW YORK, UPSTATE PROSECUTORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK DEATH
PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Iowa, Texas)  (fe) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The return of capital punishment has reinforced the long-held
suspicion that New York is not one state but two. There is New York
City and its suburbs, with the bulk of the state's murders but a
fraction of its death-penalty cases. And there is the rest of the
state, where prosecutors seek the death penalty twice as often as
their downstate counterparts, and homicide defendants have been 10
times more likely to face possible execution.
</P>
<P>
   This striking imbalance accounts for what may be a more
surprising trend. Some opponents had worried that under the new
law, enacted four years ago, death sentences would fall
disproportionately on minority defendants. But because most upstate
counties are predominantly white, a defendant in a New York
death-penalty case is far more likely to be white than black.
Though whites make up only 21 percent of the state's murder
defendants, they are 55 percent of the defendants in capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the death penalty usually concentrates on
whether it is a useful and appropriate tool to reduce crime. It is
hard to measure what impact, if any, capital punishment has had on
New York's murder rate, which has declined sharply for nearly the
entire decade. But it has changed the criminal justice system, in
ways both subtle and startling and often unforeseen.
</P>
<P>
   The most pronounced disparities involve geography and race.
There have also been an unexpectedly small number of capital cases.
Thirty-four murder defendants _ less than 2 percent _ have faced
possible execution. Only two have been sentenced to death, and no
one has been executed. Proponents had predicted that prosecutors
would seek the death penalty in 15 percent to 20 percent of murder
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these trends underscores the ultimate source of power on
the death penalty in New York and other states: local prosecutors
who have broad discretion in deciding who will face execution and
who will not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death penalty in America is made by local officials,''
said George H. Kendall, a staff attorney at the NAACP Legal Defense
Fund, who works on capital cases around the country. ``Some
district attorneys use it, and some don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Geographic distinctions have cropped up in many of the 37 other
states with the death penalty. ``What you're seeing in New York is
typical, though not usually so stark,'' said David C. Baldus, a
professor at the University of Iowa School of Law. ``What you
usually see is that, in center city, there is relatively little
interest in capital punishment in the prosecutor's office.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government and most states do not keep detailed
death penalty statistics, including the racial breakdown of those
who become capital defendants, but academic experts have studied
geographic disparities in selected states.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Baldus examined all murder cases in which the
defendant was eligible for capital punishment in New Jersey between
1983 and 1991; he found that 10 percent of the potential capital
cases resulted in death sentences in the state's urban areas, while
24 percent resulted in death sentences in rural and suburban areas.
Political differences between urban and rural cultures account for
many of these distinctions, Baldus said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all states follow this pattern. In Texas, prosecutors in
Harris County, which includes Houston, have brought many capital
cases in the 1990s, while prosecutors in Dallas have brought
relatively few.
</P>
<P>
   And in Florida, prosecutors brought proportionately few capital
cases between 1973 and 1991 in Dade County, which includes Miami;
Palm Beach; Sarasota, and Broward County, which includes Fort
Lauderdale. But prosecutors in rural, northern counties and in some
Florida cities, including Pensacola, Daytona Beach, Orlando and
Tampa, sought the death penalty much more often, according to a
study by Michael Radelet, the chairman of the sociology department
at the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   While no two murder cases are exactly alike, there are enough
similarities to illustrate prosecutorial discretion in New York
state. In Buffalo, for example, Jonathan Parker was accused in 1997
of fatally shooting a police officer who was trying to question him
on a city street. District Attorney Frank J. Clark of Erie County
sought the death penalty. A jury convicted Parker last October but
rejected execution in favor of life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau did not
seek the death penalty against Scott Schneiderman, who was accused
of killing a police officer as he fled from a botched attempt to
rob his own father in a Chelsea apartment in 1996. Morgenthau
instead pursued a sentence of life without parole and, like
virtually all prosecutors, would not discuss his reasons publicly.
A jury convicted Schneiderman last month, and he was sentenced last
week to life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reasons for the disparities between upstate and
downstate _ which includes New York City and the counties of
Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland _ are obvious. Four of
New York City's five district attorneys personally oppose capital
punishment. Two of them _ Morgenthau and Robert T. Johnson &UR;  &LR; of the
Bronx _ have never brought a death penalty case.
</P>
<P>
   But neither have two district attorneys who support the death
penalty: Jeanine F. Pirro of Westchester and William L. Murphy of
Staten Island. Nor has District Attorney Denis Dillon of Nassau,
who is opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pirro said the state's death penalty law was so restrictive
that very few murders qualify. ``There is not a lot of discretion
in the law,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many other prosecutors and defense lawyers said that while
prosecutors had limited discretion in seeking first-degree murder
indictments, they had broad powers to decide which first-degree
murder defendants should face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In reinstating the death penalty, state legislators expanded the
definition of first-degree murder to include 12 categories. Among
them are multiple murders, the killing of police or corrections
officers, contract killings, those that involve torture and those
that take place during the commission of another serious crime like
robbery or rape.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,500 people have been arrested on murder charges
statewide since September 1995. About 190 people were indicted on
first-degree murder charges, and only 34 _ one-sixth _ have faced
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate prosecutors have brought 24 of the 34 capital cases,
with 10 sought by downstate prosecutors. More than 80 percent of
the state's homicide arrests occurred in the city and its suburbs.
That means that someone arrested for murder upstate had a 5 percent
chance of becoming a capital defendant, while someone arrested for
murder downstate had a chance of one-half of 1 percent of becoming
a capital defendant _ making an upstate person arrested for murder
10 times more likely to face execution.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Many factors are part of the death penalty equation.
Prosecutors, for example, must decide if there were mitigating
factors in a defendant's background, like child abuse or serious
emotional problems, that could make it inappropriate to seek
execution. They must weigh aggravating factors, like the
heinousness of a homicide.
</P>
<P>
   District attorneys declined repeatedly to discuss how they had
decided individual cases. But speaking generally, many prosecutors
said they had created panels of senior aides to sift through
first-degree murder cases and weigh whether to seek execution. The
final decisions, the district attorneys insisted, were their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will never be a science, and quite frankly I think it
shouldn't be a science,'' said Clark, the Erie County district
attorney. ``That's why we're elected, to use our judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he had no formal committee to advise him, but often
conferred with senior aides. The first consideration in a potential
capital case, he said, is whether there is enough proof to win a
conviction..
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think about the impact on the community, whether or not
I feel this is the kind of case the Legislature had in mind when it
passed the statute,'' Clark said. ``Does this case really shock the
conscience of the community?''
</P>
<P>
   He also talks with the victim's family, he said, ``but in the
end I make the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said these decisions were difficult and personal. ``I
suppose there are a lot of different philosophies that people might
have or considerations they have to make in deciding which way to
go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result statewide has been a strange hodgepodge. In Queens,
George Davis Bell was accused of killing an off-duty police officer
and a businessman as they were opening a check-cashing business in
1996. Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, sought the
death penalty against Bell, who is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Across the East River in the Bronx, Michael Vernon was charged
with killing five people in a shooting rampage in a shoe store in
December 1995. But Johnson, the Bronx district attorney, decided
not to pursue the death penalty. Vernon was convicted in 1997 on
five counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison
without parole.
</P>
<P>
   And in Rochester, Angel Mateo faced the death penalty in two
separate cases. Mateo was accused of having kidnapped a mentally
ill man on the street while on a frenzied search for his estranged
girlfriend. When the man could not help find her, Mateo shot him in
the head and suffocated him with a plastic bag, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicted Mateo last month and sentenced him to die,
rejecting arguments that his life should be spared because he had
been physically abused as a child. Mateo is also awaiting trial in
an unrelated capital case, in which he is accused of killing three
people.
</P>
<P>
   The repeated decisions by Johnson, Morgenthau and other
downstate prosecutors not to seek the death penalty have been
harshly criticized by proponents of capital punishment, including
the relatives of some murder victims. In the most hotly disputed
case, Gov. George E. Pataki intervened two years ago when he became
convinced that Johnson would not seek the death penalty against
Angel Diaz, who was charged with killing Officer Kevin Gillespie.
Diaz committed suicide in jail before the case could be tried.
</P>
<P>
   After Diaz's death, a divided state Court of Appeals upheld the
governor's authority to intervene, ruling that legislators had not
intended to allow any of New York's 62 district attorneys to
sidestep the law by adopting a ``blanket policy'' against the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson insisted that he was following the law by exercising his
discretion case by case. ``There is no civil disobedience here,''
he said. ``We're complying with the law, and we're allowing other
people to go forward with what they've had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some defense lawyers have seized on the governor's stand in the
Diaz case and the court's ruling, saying that the state's goal
appears to be that the death penalty should be applied uniformly
and that there should not be counties where it is never invoked.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Doyle, the state's capital defender, who runs the office
created by legislators to coordinate the defense of capital cases,
has hinted broadly that he would like someday to challenge capital
punishment in New York on the basis that it has been applied
arbitrarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is the earliest prophetic voice on that issue,''
Doyle said. He was referring to Pataki's comment, after the Court
of Appeals upheld his intervention in the Bronx case, that he would
not ``allow certain areas of the state to become death penalty free
zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have raised legal challenges to death penalty laws in
at least four states by arguing that geographic imbalances show
capital punishment to be arbitrary and, thus, unconstitutional.
None of the lawsuits succeeded, said Baldus of the University of
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, most capital cases involve felony murders and
multiple homicides. Thirteen of the 34 capital cases have been
settled through plea bargains, with nine of the 13 defendants
getting life sentences without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Six death penalty cases have gone to trial; two defendants were
sentenced to die and three were sentenced to life without parole.
The sixth trial is in progress in Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, the Diaz case ended with the defendant's suicide.
In another case, in upstate Schoharie County, the prosecutor
withdrew his intention to seek the death penalty before trial.
Thirteen capital defendants are awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a great revelation to people to see how few
times district attorneys have chosen the death penalty,'' said
Charles J. Hynes, the district attorney in Brooklyn. ``There is an
awesome responsibility connected to this thing.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prominent Republicans around the country said
Wednesday that President Clinton's State of the Union Message was
an unsettling reminder that their party cannot compete with the
president's political skills, and that the impeachment trial could
only endanger their prospects in competitive states.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Washington attacked Clinton's plan to channel
some of the budget surpluses to domestic programs, asserting that
tax cuts were more important. And some Republicans were skeptical
about the president's proposal to invest Social Security money in
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But, without disagreeing, Republican governors and party
officials in several states focused their comments _ and their
concerns _ more on Clinton's ability to win over the public than on
what they viewed as flaws in his programs. They sounded almost
awestruck by his political prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``He touched on every subject except his dog and the homeless _
and he promised everybody something, so you've got to like it,''
said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson. ``He sounded like a super
governor up there, hyping all these individual programs. But over
all, you'd have to give him a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the speech made clear that his party faced quite a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have to compete by coming up with a very
aggressive agenda, a very aggressive position on Social Security;
they have to have a tax cut and pass it, then have an HMO overhaul
bill,'' the governor said, adding, ``The only thing he missed was
talking about tax cuts _ that's what Americans really want.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Republican state chairman Rusty Paul said: ``He gives a
doggone good speech. It's extremely difficult to counter. And I
don't know that you can directly counter it. The great thing about
Clinton is the ability to finally buy into our ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   After the president's speech and the generally positive
reception to it, Paul said, he was even more worried about how the
impeachment trial could damage Republican chances in the 2000
elections. ``I don't think the country or the Republican Party
benefits from a protracted, long trial in the Senate,'' he said.
``People are going to get more and more frustrated and angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, the chairman of the Republican
Governors' Association, said Clinton's speech was a ``candy store''
for lawmakers that offered ``caramels for conservatives,'' in the
form of initiatives to bolster education, and ``lemon drops for
liberals,'' with a pledge to increase the minimum wage. Keating
added: ``There was something for everyone. The only person who was
missing was Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans who remarked on Clinton's speech were so
effusive in their praise that they sounded as if they were
Democrats backing their leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president should receive high marks for his style and
presentation of the remarks,'' said Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. ``He
lived up, as he typically does, to an expectation of a polished
presentation. He embraced a lot of congressional proposals that
have been part of the Republicans' agenda for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Racicot did have a few misgivings, such as with Clinton's
proposals about Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a concern about the investment of funds in the stock
market and involving the government to a significant degree in
making decisions in what could be a fairly dominant presence in the
stock market,'' the governor said. ``And we didn't hear as much as
I would have liked to hear about tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Republican chairman Henry McMaster , said he
worried about the electoral consequences of the president's
popularity, which is underscored by his successful speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in a popularity contest with someone who's giving
away money, it's hard to win _ and that's all he does,'' McMaster
said. ``But he makes a great speech for the type of thing he's
trying to do. He very carefully says all the right things. It's so
obviously patronizing and attempting to appeal to folks who want to
feel good. It's a lot of spending more of our money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Republicans said Clinton's speech sounded like a
return to big government.
</P>
<P>
   ``More programs, more bureaucracy, more expenditures _ binding
our future generations to government costs _ and that is the
most-focused thing that we saw come from the president's speech,''
said Gov. North Dakota Edward Schafer. He described Clinton as the
``great deliverer _ he said something for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Goodman, a Republican speechwriter who helped draft the
response to Clinton's speech by Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington,
said the good news was that the battleground between the parties
Tuesday night was over an agenda, and not impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Republicans stray into uncharted territory, as they
are with this trial, and they come off message, it hurts them more
than it hurts Democrats,'' Goodman said. ``When there's a sense of
inertia, Republicans more than Democrats take the brunt of that.''

COMMENTARY: THE WITNESS ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface words should be italicized) 
(bl) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It all depends on what you mean by the word
 &UR; depose &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Rooted in the Latin  &UR; pausare &LR; , ``to put down,'' the meaning in
English in 1300 was ``dethrone; to put down from high office.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of some confusion in the Middle Ages with  &UR; deponare &LR; ,
``to deposit,'' the verb  &UR; depose &LR;  developed a second meaning: ``to
give evidence under oath; to make a deposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if by  &UR; depose &LR;  you mean ``should President Clinton be
removed from office?'' the answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   But if by  &UR; depose &LR;  you mean ``should Clinton be invited to tell
the whole truth at his Senate trial?'' the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the House managers presented a persuasive case that
the president of the United States had systematically lied under
oath to support an obstruction of justice. Though his removal by
the Senate gained little ground, the impeachment by the House
gained respectability. Hutchinson, Graham, Rogan and Barr are
future senators and governors.
</P>
<P>
   This week the president's lawyers _ whose contemptuous answers
to 81 House questions triggered Clinton's impeachment _
demonstrated that artful lawyering can cast doubt on any set of
facts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lead counsel, Charles Ruff, was at his most effective
in countering the charge that Vernon Jordan's sudden burst of
activity in getting Monica Lewinsky a job was caused by a Jones
court decision that could have required her to testify.
</P>
<P>
   He was least effective, however, in pressing Clinton's claim
that he was ``not paying attention'' when his Jones deposition
lawyer, in his presence, unwittingly misinformed a federal judge
that no sex had been engaged in ``in any way, shape or form.'' The
prosecution's videotape of Clinton, his eyes first riveted on his
lawyer, then switching to the judge, proves him to be lying about
``inattention'' on a central matter.
</P>
<P>
   In necessarily coming to grips with the House's charges, the
president's lawyers were forced to defeat their own aim of avoiding
the calling of witnesses. When grand jury testimony is in conflict,
as Clinton defenders insist some to be, the Senate must decide for
itself who is telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   That means that next week the Senate will have to deal with the
Witness Issue. And that brings us to the second meaning of
 &UR; depose &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Before any witness is brought to the well of the Senate, he or
she would be examined under oath in private. Each side would see
the other's depositions. That would speed the public testimony and
disappoint the lascivious.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Jordan will explain the cause of the sudden urgency to
get Monica employment, and she will be asked to verify or confront
the president's denials of tampering. Betty Currie will explain how
the subpoenaed gifts got under her bed, and with whom she discussed
her story while on the president's Africa trip. And if undue
pressure on House members during December is suspected, that could
be quietly explored.
</P>
<P>
   What about Clinton as witness? Believers in the separation of
powers properly recoil at compelling his testimony (just as they do
at the notion of censure). But the Senate should ask for a
deposition, the transcript to be released before the trial ends. If
he gutsily agrees, that would be a pleasant surprise, but he'll
decline, as is his right.
</P>
<P>
   What's the purpose of depositions, if the accused is unlikely to
be deposed from power? To what end is a full trial when the end
seems sure?
</P>
<P>
   It's not a waste of time. The White House threat to call a
parade of witnesses and drag this out through the summer is pure
bluster. The Senate won't allow it; and even if it did, the public
would soon put the blame for shutdown on the filibustering
president. That threat is idle.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of depositions is to let lawyers on both sides
cross-examine witnesses at length in private. An ineradicable
record is being made. A hundred years from now, scholars will be
poring over these depositions to understand the man, our times, and
why this generation gave a pass to perjury and obeisance to
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Punish the president? The House impeachment was strong censure;
the adversarial process in the Senate to get at the truth is itself
serious chastisement. In a few weeks comes the vote to acquit or
depose. And then it should be over, except for the fully documented
judgment of history.

BUSHES SAY PERSONAL CONSIDERATIONS PLAYING ROLE IN POSSIBLE
PRESIDENTIAL RUN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Laura Bush expressed reluctance Wednesday to
surrender her privacy to a national political audience, while her
husband, Gov. George W. Bush, said he views a possible bid for the
2000 GOP presidential nomination as a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on Bush to run continued to build as Republican-elected
officials in California and Massachusetts praised him Wednesday as
a possible national party leader and president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reluctant. Absolutely. It's a major life change,'' Mrs.
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not particularly worried about safety. Privacy. I'm very
worried about privacy. That's really the main theme of it,'' Mrs.
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush expressed similar fears, but said he also believes that if
he does not run next year, history will pass him by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand there are windows of opportunity and there are
tides of history and moments of history,'' Bush said. ``Should I
choose not to run for the presidency, I understand the window would
probably be closed.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after being sworn in for a second term of office, Bush and
his wife were surrounded by state and national reporters during a
news conference at the Governor's Mansion. Only a few questions
dealt with state policy instead of his possible presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said if he does not rule out a presidential bid he will
take some action, such as forming an exploratory committee, before
the Legislature ends May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bushes said personal considerations are playing a major
role in whether to take the next step. Bush's father is
ex-President Bush, and both said they know what a presidential run
does to a family's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very nice life in Texas,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``I have
a really great time as first lady of Texas traveling around our
state. I see wonderful programs in every town, all over our state.
To do that on a national basis is just a step beyond. It's a much,
much bigger step.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush said she is worried about giving up her privacy as
well as that of her twin 17-year-old daughters, Jenna and Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   The governor added, ``Our daughters are normal. They don't want
to be put through the meat grinder of national politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is moving forward with personal explorations. He has
met with policy advisers in the past several weeks and Thursday has
a meeting scheduled with potential money-raisers from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't surprise you that I am listening to policy
people, because I intend to make an informed decision,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I decide to run for the presidency, I'm going to have
to raise a lot of money quickly,'' Bush said. ``It's important to
listen to the concerns of money-raisers as well as to listen to
different policy folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci, the only U.S. governor to
attend Bush's inaugural Tuesday, returned home praising Bush as a
potential national Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party needs the kind of leadership that he's
demonstrated in Texas,'' Cellucci said. ``He's shown he can get
things done. He's also put a very high emphasis on high standards
in the classroom, on ending social promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   And in California, a majority of the Republicans in the state
legislature sent Bush a letter urging him to run for president. The
letter was signed by 22 of 32 Republicans in the state Assembly and
three of the 15 Republican senators signed the letter, including
all four Hispanic Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask for your favorable consideration to lead America as our
president, and we commit to you our support,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was considered to be a reproach to California Gov.
Pete Wilson, who is considering a White House run himself after an
unsuccessful try in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans believe Wilson cost the party support for
fostering racial divisiveness with his stands against aid to
illegal immigrants and against affirmative action. Bush has argued
against Republican rhetoric that is racially divisive.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked whether he thought there should be any kind of
limits on raising money for presidential campaigns. His father's
1988 campaign set up a system to funnel large contributions through
the Republican National Committee. Campaign finance scandals grew
out of the 1996 election when President Clinton all but turned
large donations to the Democratic National Committee into an
extension of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we ought to have full disclosure on campaign
contributions. If I choose to take a large contribution, you need
to know about it, and I can pay the political price if there is one
to be paid,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed criticisms from potential presidential rivals Dan
Quayle and Lamar Alexander about his use of the term
``compassionate conservative'' to describe his philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, who was vice president under Bush's father, recently
sent a letter to the staff of his presidential exploratory
committee banning the use of the phrase ``compassionate
conservative.'' Quayle called it a ``silly and insulting term that
was created by liberal Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander called the term ``weasel words'' and said Bush should
just call himself conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people choose to campaign based on what they believe, and
some people choose to campaign talking about the other person,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I choose to run for the presidency, I will talk about
what's in my heart and what I believe.''

BOTTLERS BECOMING RIVALS TO VENDING-SALES MERCHANTS

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One morning in October, Mike McGee stopped to inspect the
Coca-Cola vending machines that he had installed in a new student
recreation center at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To his dismay, he found a brand-new one standing there, too _ a
machine installed by Coca-Cola Enterprises, the world's biggest
Coke bottler and the supplier to the $5-million-a-year McGee &AMP; Sons
family business. And the rival machine was charging 45 cents for a
12-ounce can of Coke _ 10 cents less than McGee was charging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the old days, they came around here saying, `Sell our
product,''' McGee, whose father started the business in 1961,
recalled. ``Now that we need their product, they say, `We'll still
sell it to you, but we're also going to be in business against
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, McGee pulled his machines from Harvey Mudd,
just as he took machines out of nearby Scripps College and two
accounts serving California city buildings a few months ago.
``There's just no way I can compete,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vending machines, a highly profitable market, have become an
important new battleground in the soft-drink business, and
Coca-Cola Co., through its bottlers, is by far the biggest and the
most aggressive competitor. ``We're in a period of intense
competition between bottlers and full-line vending operators for
the control of soft-drink vending machines,'' Elliott Maras, editor
of Automatic Merchandiser, a trade magazine, said.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the battle has led to greater availability of
soft drinks at somewhat lower prices. But many Coke-vending-machine
owners and distributors across the United States complain that the
fight is not fair. They say that Coca-Cola, which owns 44 percent
of Coca-Cola Enterprises and all the rights to popular brands like
Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Sprite, is using its dominant position to
take business away from them.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Coca-Cola bottlers over distributors, they say, is
further enhanced by a 1980 federal law that gives local bottlers
exclusive rights to sell soft-drink brands in a certain territory.
More often than not, in Coke's case, the local bottler is Coca-Cola
Enterprises, which did $3.2 billion worth of business last year,
according to an earnings report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints have led to investigations and lawsuits in
several states, people involved in the inquiries said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Coca-Cola Enterprises said the company played by
the rules. ``We deal with our customers in a fair and equitable
manner,'' said the spokesman, John Downs Jr., ``creating value for
them and satisfying the refreshment needs of our consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It is our policy to fully comply with all laws and
regulations applicable to our business operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Distributors who are accustomed to selling Coca-Cola products _
which have a 43.9 percent market share in the United States _ but
are troubled by the presence of Coca-Cola Enterprises as a rival
say that they cannot simply switch to selling other brands: Their
investments, market demand and other competition prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they have no choice but to buy from the local
bottler because Coca-Cola will penalize any bottler that sells to
customers from outside its designated territories. As a result, say
many smaller vending-machine owners and distribution companies, a
bottler can raise prices at will and otherwise dictate the terms of
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is, they overprice us in order to keep us in a less
competitive position than they have,'' said Ladd Little, who runs
L.C. Vending, his family's company in San Antonio. Like McGee, he
is a customer of Coca-Cola Enterprises, which controls the Coke
bottling business in most of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Little says that the price Coca-Cola Enterprises charges him is
higher than what he can find elsewhere. ``I buy a truckload a
week,'' he said. ``I can buy it for less at the grocery store. But
they won't allow that grocery store to sell it to me in quantity,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Several New York distributors say they are trying to organize to
resist the competition from Coca-Cola Enterprises. ``We just want
them to sell us the product for the same prices that they sell it
to themselves,'' one distributor, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said of the bottler. ``There's got to be something wrong
with being the wholesaler, and the retailer, and being protected by
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises declined to comment on its pricing.
</P>
<P>
   While Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Enterprises are separate
companies, many analysts and accountants have said that their
business is essentially united. The bottler was spun off in 1986
from Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent annual report, Coca-Cola describes the
vending business as crucial to its sales growth. ``We're putting
ice-cold Coca-Cola Classic and our other brands within reach,
wherever you look,'' the report states, ``at the supermarket, the
video store, the soccer field, the gas station _ everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The investment in vending machines is costly, as debt-heavy
Coca-Cola Enterprises' fourth-quarter earnings statement shows. The
company reported a loss of 9 cents a share, in part because of
``capital and infrastructure investments,'' the chief executive,
Henry Schimberg, said in a statement. At the same time, though,
cash operating profit and case volume grew, mainly in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts applaud the company's push into vending
machines. ``It's really what I call the entrepreneurial spirit of
Henry Schimberg, that three or four years ago CCE recognized the
need to diversify out of lower-margin channels,'' said Andrew
Conway, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola and Pepsico, the nation's No. 2 soft-drink marketer,
have long flirted with the vendingbusiness, but both now seem
smitten with its potential. In Pepsico's prospectus for the initial
public offering of its bottling division, issued earlier this
month, the company calls vending ``one of the fastest-growing and
most profitable segments'' with ``gross margins that are
significantly higher than those from sales of products for
consumption at home.''
</P>
<P>
   As sales of 20-ounce bottles increase, they offer more reasons
for bottlers to pursue vending sales. They can charge more per
ounce. For example, according to one vending-machine owner, a
12-ounce can costs 22 cents apiece wholesale in one area of
southern California, while the 20-ounce bottle costs 53 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The big bottlers' drive for new business is being helped by the
unusual protection that Coke, Pepsi and other national brands
enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s the Federal Trade Commission argued that exclusive
bottling territories were illegal, because they inhibited
competition. But the Soft Drink Interbrand Competition Act of 1980
affirmed the rights of soft-drink companies to grant their bottlers
exclusive rights to sell a brand in a certain area, as long as
``substantial and effective competition between products of the
same general class'' exists.
</P>
<P>
   No other industry has a similar statute. Moreover, the
soft-drink companies essentially enforce the law on their own.
Citing the law, companies like Coke can charge bottlers a penalty
of $5 a case or more if their products turn up in bulk outside
their designated areas _ a breach of contract known as
``trans-shipping.'' The effect is to prevent distributors and
vendors from buying their soft-drink products from anyone but the
local bottler.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the legislation was being considered, proponents
said that a law was needed to protect bottlers from having their
business picked off by nearby rivals. The law also protected the
public interest, said Gordon Spivack, a partner at the law firm of
Coudert Bros. in New York who argued on behalf of Coca-Cola before
the Federal Trade Commission and on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every witness we called testified that the result of exclusive
territories was increased output and lower prices and better
quality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1980, the local bottler was probably a small,
independent, third-generation family business. Today, local
bottlers tend to be part of a conglomerate spanning many markets
and states. Industry consolidation has been in high gear for the
last several years. Coca-Cola Enterprises has acquired dozens of
smaller bottlers in the last few years, and now Pepsi is seeking to
match the Coke system.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the law shields small businesses hardly applies
anymore, said Allen Vestal, a professor at Washington and Lee
University Law School, who specializes in corporate issues and has
written about the soft-drink law.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say other arguments put forth in 1980 to support
the law, including the environmental benefit of refilling glass
bottles to the protection of a bottler's investment in those
bottles, have also lost their relevance.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those conditions gone, it's pretty hard to justify the
law,'' Vestal said. ``There are some natural constituencies who
ought to be interested in getting it repealed. Retailers could get
a better price if they had more than one person to deal with, and
so could Kmart and Wal-Mart.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises referred questions about the law to the
National Soft Drink Association, the industry's chief trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Davis, vice president for federal affairs at the
association, said that regardless of consolidation, the law remains
relevant for the industry. ``Size is a relative term,'' he said.
``You could have the smaller, efficient folks wanting to prey on
the larger bottlers' big accounts in certain areas.''
</P>
<P>
   And a spokesman for Pepsi-Cola, Brad Shaw, said, ``The law is
every bit as pro-competitive and relevant today as it was 19 years
ago.'' Trans-shipment ``is not a problem for us,'' he said, adding
that it amounts to ``a tiny fraction of our sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the law has been beneficial to consumers. The
territorial franchise system, said John Sicher, editor of Beverage
Digest, an industry newsletter, ``has enabled bottlers to make
products more widely available and at better prices than in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   That system, however, and the role that Coca-Cola Enterprises
plays in it, is drawing increased scrutiny. In addition to other
state investigations, the Ohio attorney general's office has begun
an investigation of its own, following a complaint from one
distributor.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman, Todd Boyer, said that the investigation was in its
early stages and added, ``We are aware that there are other states
that may be investigating similar allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Metzger, the Ohio distributor who complained, said
Coca-Cola Enterprises executives had pursued him after he told them
he thought he was being charged too much. He compared prices at a
nearby Sam's Club, owned by Wal-Mart Stores, and found that he was
paying 40 cents more per case than the giant retailer did; Metzger
sells about 170,000 cases of Coke products a year.
</P>
<P>
   When he complained to Coca-Cola Enterprises, he said, his prices
were raised another 70 cents, and the company began demanding
immediate payment. Metzger said he could not pay the $160,000 he
owed them.

<P>
   Downs, the Coca-Cola Enterprises spokesman, said he was aware of
Metzger's complaint, but had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Boyer also said that Ohio investigators were ``keeping an eye''
on a federal lawsuit filed in Maryland, in which a distributor,
B.K. Miller Inc., accused Coca-Cola Enterprises of unfair pricing,
fraud and other illegal activities. Downs said that the allegations
in the B.K. Miller suit ``are false and totally without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as complaints mount, few expect the soda franchise system
to change its way of doing business. ``Every decision a bottler has
made has been predicated on the protection of territorial
integrity,'' said Drew Davis, vice president of federal affairs at
the soft-drink trade group. ``Without that certainty, your customer
could be anybody in America. Or it could be nobody in America.''

BUSH SAYS 2000 MAY BE HIS ONLY SHOT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush said Wednesday that the 2000
election is probably the only shot he'll get at capturing the White
House, but that his wife and children are reluctant to give up
their privacy for a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand there are windows of opportunity, and there are
tides of history and there are moments in history,'' Bush said
during a packed news conference at the Governor's Mansion. ``Should
I choose not to run for the presidency, I understand the window
would probably close.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was joined at the post-inaugural news conference by his
wife, Laura, who expressed reservations about a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reluctant, absolutely,'' she said. ``I just think it's a
major life change. We have a very nice life in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very worried about privacy. That's really the main thing,
I guess,'' she said in a rare extended exchange with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said the couple's twin 17-year-old daughters, Jenna
and Barbara, feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our daughters are normal,'' he said. ``They don't want to be
put through the meat grinder of national politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments from the governor and first lady are among their
most extensive to date.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will not decide definitively on a national campaign
before the 76th session of the Texas Legislature wraps up at the
end of May.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean he won't set up a federal exploratory
committee to allow him to raise money and lock up some key support
before spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the exploratory committee an option?'' said Bush. ``Yes,
it's an option ... should I decide to do so it will be set up prior
to the end of the legislative session.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently at or near the top in most presidential preference
polls, Bush has been meeting with policy experts and potential
donors in recent weeks to help him make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has a meeting scheduled Thursday with ``potential
donors, helpers.'' Neither he nor his office would release the
names of those attending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I decide to run for the presidency, I'm going to have
to raise a lot of money quickly, and it's important to listen to
the concerns of money raisers as well as to different policy folks
and that's what's going to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush raised about $18 million on his re-election effort and,
should he run for president, is expected to have a formidable fund
raising machine that taps into an extensive national network
developed over decades by his father, former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, Gov. Bush said the current limits on federal
fund raising should be raised. He said the Texas campaign finance
system, which has no cap on contribution size, works just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I choose to take a large contribution, you need to know
about it, and I will pay the political price if one needs to be
paid,'' Bush said. ``I'm for full disclosure, and I believe we
ought to raise the limits to give people a chance to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it would not be appropriate for him to talk about the
issues he would choose to campaign on, but he did find fault with
the GOP message on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have been great about saying let's roll back
welfare . . . which I thought was a good reform,'' Bush said. ``But
there is a corollary to that, and that is, we must do our own part
in our own neighborhoods in our own communities to help people in
need. That's sometimes part of the message that is missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush passed up an opportunity to criticize potential Republican
primary opponents, including Lamar Alexander and former
Vice-President Dan Quayle, who have been taking shots at the
``compassionate conservatism'' slogan the governor has used to
convey his philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I choose to run for the presidency, I'll talk about
what's in my heart and what I believe,'' he said. ``They can talk
about what they believe.''

GM REPORTS UNEXPECTEDLY ROBUST 4TH QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. announced Wednesday an
unexpectedly large increase in profits during the fourth quarter of
last year, as the very strong American auto market and the
company's continued recovery from last summer's strike more than
offset losses in Latin America and East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   GM's profits rose 7.7 percent, to $1.77 billion, during the
fourth quarter, but fell 53.2 percent, to $2.96 billion, for all of
last year, because of a 54-day strike in June and July at two
auto-parts factories in Flint, Mich. The strike forced the world's
largest automaker to close almost all of its assembly plants in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   The company's fully diluted earnings per share reached $2.61 in
the fourth quarter, up 12.0 percent. Excluding a long list of
one-time losses, GM's earnings were $3.25 a share, easily beating
the Wall Street analysts' average estimate of $2.65 a share,
according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of GM rose to an all-time high after the earnings were
announced. It closed at $88.9375, up 93.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   GM's robust fourth-quarter results reflected exuberant sales of
high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in the United
States and continued profits in Europe. Because Ford Motor Co. also
depends heavily on the American and European markets, GM's results
make it likely that Ford will also report healthy profits when it
releases its earnings on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regions of the world that are strongest happen to be where
we are strongest,'' J. Michael Losh, GM's chief financial officer,
said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The North American auto market produced $1.58 billion in profits
for GM in the fourth quarter, while European car operations
generated another $146 million in profit, allowing the company to
prosper despite economic troubles in emerging markets. By contrast,
GM's East Asian automotive division lost $213 million in the fourth
quarter while its operations in Latin America, Africa and the
Middle East, previously very profitable, lost another $212 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's strike reduced GM's full-year, after-tax profits
by ``at least $2 billion,'' Losh said. While GM had declared
strike-related losses totaling $2.5 billion during the second and
third quarters of last year, John Smith Jr., GM's chairman and
chief executive, had predicted in August that the company would be
able to reduce that to $2 billion by the end of the year by
building extra cars and trucks in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Losh said GM had not been able to catch up as much as
expected during the fourth quarter because Americans bought cars
and light trucks at a torrid pace. Indeed, last month had the
highest seasonally adjusted annual rate of new auto sales in the
United States since December 1986.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, GM factories in North America will continue to
produce cars and trucks at a brisk tempo in the first quarter,
usually a slow season, Losh said. Whether the strike cost GM $2
billion or even more, it still remains easily the most expensive
strike in U.S. history, before adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Maryann Keller, an auto analyst at ING Baring in New York, said
GM's strong fourth-quarter profits were likely to spill over into
the first quarter because GM will be catching up on full-size
pickup truck production, which is very profitable. Unlike in past
periods of prosperity, GM is also continuing to cut costs
aggressively, Ms. Keller said, adding that she had raised her
estimate of GM's 1999 profits to $8.75 per share from $8.25 per
share.
</P>
<P>
   GM earned $4.18 per share in 1998 and $8.62 per share in 1997.
GM's sales also fell last year, to $161.32 billion from $171.18
billion.
</P>
<P>
   GM, which had cash reserves of $14.1 billion on Dec. 31,
announced Wednesday that it would resume a $4 billion share buyback
program soon and finish it this year. GM had suspended the program
last summer because of the strike, after spending only a third of
the $4 billion. GM also said Wednesday that it would soon redeem
its Series B 9-1/8 preference stock, which has a face value of more
than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   GM's fourth-quarter earnings included $420 million in one-time,
after-tax charges. These mostly reflected early retirement
programs, but included a $97 million charge in GM's East Asian
automotive division that was caused partly by the need to replace
equipment at a new factory in Thailand. GM had planned to produce
one of its popular European car models there, but switched to van
production because of the economic problems in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi Automotive Systems, GM's wholly owned auto parts
subsidiary, earned $88 million in the fourth quarter, compared with
a $508 million loss in the period a year earlier, as smaller
one-time charges more than offset a deterioration in operating
results. Delphi plans an initial public offering of a 17.7 percent
stake in itself this spring, and to become completely separate from
GM by the end of this year through a distribution or exchange of
shares.

LAUNCHING OF WORLD'S LARGEST X-RAY TELESCOPE IS DELAYED AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.M.)   (sw) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NASA announced on Wednesday another delay in
launching the world's largest X-ray telescope, saying that the
discovery of possibly flawed circuit boards in the $1.5 billion
craft would delay its trip into orbit at least five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the flight of the Chandra X-ray Observatory, a
cousin to the Hubble Space Telescope that is to examine the
universe's X-ray emissions, will come no earlier than mid-May and
could be delayed further. The shuttle Columbia was to have lofted
the five-ton observatory on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said
during a telephone news conference on Wednesday that the potential
problem arose Friday, a day after the telescope's manufacturer,
TRW's Space and Electronics Group, of Redondo Breach, Calif., held
a ceremony to declare the craft ready for delivery to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandra observatory has taken more than 20 years to develop
and build. It was to have been launched last summer but was delayed
because of troubles during hardware testing and problems with
software.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth W. Ledbetter, director of mission development in NASA's
Space Science Office, said discovery of the circuit board problem
was disappointing, particularly with the craft so close to launch.
However, he added, ``We are very pleased we found the problem
before we got further along.''
</P>
<P>
   The circuit boards were made by an Albuquerque, N.M., company
acquired by B.F. Goodrich in 1997 and now part of its Davis Systems
Division. The company found during routine tests that copper
tracings that carry electrical current along the surface of some
boards were cracking and separating from the surface. Ledbetter
said delays over the past six months already have cost NASA an
additional $39 million, but he said he did not know what the latest
postponement would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra is named after the late University of Chicago
astrophysicist and Nobel prize winner Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.
It will examine X-rays, which are produced by the most violent
processes in the universe, including exploding stars, quasars and
black holes. They can be observed only from outside the Earth's
atmosphere.

THE TRUE MEANING OF FREE SPEECH IN THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.C., N.M.)  (Eds: See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-TRIAL) 
(mk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There was a certain pleasure for the few listeners
on hand Wednesday morning when senators began orating in the
chamber about absolutely anything they pleased a full two hours
before President Clinton's impeachment trial resumed.
</P>
<P>
   It was Senate morning business time _ noncombative potpourri
hours for individual lawmakers to reserve time and speak on the
record however they cared to _ before a nearly empty chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, as each senator entered for a scheduled
slot, then left without listening much to the next lawmaker, the
exercise resembled individual oratorical aerobics much needed after
all the flabby trial hours of having to listen in silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gifted man, gifted as few individuals are,'' Sen.
Richard Durbin, D-Ill., was saying at one point to the cavernous,
sparsely attended chamber, earning the ear of early wanderers as he
talked of the ``premature retirement'' of someone. (Of whom? Of the
president?)
</P>
<P>
   ``All net,'' the senator continued in a sports metaphor for
success. (The president's polling ``bounce'' after his State of
Union speech?) ``He developed a new fade-away jump shot,'' Durbin
went on and, of course, it was another tribute to Michael Jordan
the basketball master, not to the president and his patented
triangulation move in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, as the separate senators went about their talkative bits
of preferred business, the now familiar trial bustle began outside
the chamber. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., wheeled quickly around a
corridor corner in his motorized wheelchair and almost collided
with the hand-powered wheelchair of Charles Ruff, the White House
counsel arriving for another day of the momentous trial.
</P>
<P>
   Great mutual amusement ensued, as if at a friendly village
crossroads and the two went their separate ways. Just so, witnesses
could imagine ordinary life going on beyond the trial,
unimpeachable mishaps, small encounters, not grueling struggles.
</P>
<P>
   In the chamber, the speechmakers still went about their
non-impeachment workouts, promising fresh tax cuts and other boons
to the cameras and to the lone senator doing president pro tem duty
up in the chair.
</P>
<P>
   They did so to within a close few minutes of the arrival of
Chief Justice William Rehnquist and the resumption of the trial
with the ``Hear ye...'' and the rest of the new Senate routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to spend it all,'' Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., was
declaring in complaint of the president's clashing with Republican
tax-cut proposals for the budget surplus. The senator seemed
thoroughly delighted to be plainly talking of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In a minute the proceeding was gaveled closed. Free speech was
over, and Domenici metamorphosed once more into a member of the
impeachment court. Other senators hurriedly arrived, one wiping
lunch crumbs from his lips.
</P>
<P>
   The trial routine settled back in. David Kendall, the
president's personal counsel, once more neatly aligned and
realigned his two pens, red and black, at the defense table for
another day's careful note-taking.
</P>
<P>
   It was the turn of Gregory Craig, special counsel to the
president, to address the court and attack the charges of the House
Republican prosecutors. ``You will have had much more than 100
percent of your minimum adult daily requirement of lawyering,'' he
lightly apologized at the outset, drawing laughs from senators who
were in no position to debate the point.
</P>
<P>
   The court listened closely, taking notes, following the
exhibits, including a 14-minute clip from Clinton's videotaped
deposition in the Paula Jones suit. The man the senators studied
warily talking a year ago about his private life delivered the
State of the Union message only the night before, with all the
confidence in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, like the nation, seemed threatened by time warp, by
the oft-told tale of the president and the intern. During 15-minute
breaks in the trial the House prosecutors took to television to
offer counter-rebuttal, as if their case were in the hand of some
national jury rather than the Senate court. They admitted that, of
course, the public was hearing nothing new since both sides were
working from a now all too familiar record.
</P>
<P>
   In the corridors, the question in the air, as ever, was when
would this all end. The threat of a fresh, time-consuming muddle
was hinted at by some Senate staffers pointing to a complex series
of contentious votes and debates, some behind closed doors, to come
next week. After that, according to many expectations, a period of
witness deposing is likely to follow as something new is searched
for.
</P>
<P>
   Out beyond the debating chamber, sunshine bathed the Capitol as
the country moved inevitably closer to spring. Craig ended his
defense of Clinton with a simple narrative description of the
political event that projected him into the presidency, election
day when millions of Americans go to firehouses and schools to
personally choose their national leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing _ almost miraculous _ that so powerful and
transforming an event can occur so quietly in a great and populous
nation,'' said Craig, and the silent court of elected politicians
seemed to listen with professional savor. ``The act itself is
almost invisible to outside eyes,'' the president's defender gently
noted, pleading against removal of the people's choice.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former President George Bush, in a special lecture
to U.S. Senate members Wednesday evening, expressed concern over a
``deficit of decency'' that he said has engulfed the nation's
capital in the six years since he departed the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush continued to refrain from commenting on the
impeachment and Senate trial of President Clinton, his successor,
the former president lamented ``the lack of civility'' in politics
today as well as ``sleaze'' and ``excessive intrusion into private
lives'' of public figures.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed not only the politicians for the ``bitter rancor'' of
today but also the ``once great news organizations that seem to
resort to tabloid journalism, giving us sensationalism at best and
smut at the worst.'' He said ``the times cry out for more
credibility'' from the press.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged ``some of the ugly happenings'' of his own
presidency, including the Senate fights over the nomination of John
Tower as defense secretary and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme
Court. But for the most part, ``a spirit of compromise'' prevailed
between his White House and the Democratic majority in Congress, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting current events with Washington's preoccupation with
the mushrooming budget deficit of his administration, Bush said,
``All in all, it seems to me, that whereas the problems looming
over this town dealt more with budget deficits in times past, today
we're confronted with kind of a deficit of decency, one that
deepens by the day.''
</P>
<P>
   He made only a fleeting mention of the impeachment trial,
thanking the senators for attending his lecture during a ``terribly
traumatic time'' in their deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was the fourth person invited to address senators in a
special lecture series sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi. Bush delivered his lecture in the old historic
Senate chambers in the U.S. Capitol. Among the special guests in
the balcony was Colin Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff during Operation Desert Storm, the Bush-led war to expel
Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a brief review of his administration, said the narrow
52-47 Senate vote backing the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein was
``the key vote'' of his presidency. And while he insisted that he
was not obligated to seek such a vote, he noted it was important to
have the Senate's backing before sending U.S. troops into combat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recalled that after the vote, he received a warning from
Sen. Dan Inouye, D-Hawaii, that he might be subjected to
impeachment ``if things go wrong'' in the military intervention in
the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who resides in Houston, told the senators that while he
rarely visits Washington anymore, he is still interested in events
in the capital. But he said he did not want to involve himself in
those events because of the political careers of two sons, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas and Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``My politics today ... relate only to the two sons,'' he said.
``Time has moved on. And in our family, the torch is passed to two
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the lecture, Bush displayed his hallmark
self-deprecating humor. Noting, for example, that his lecture fell
on the 10th anniversary of his being sworn in as president, he also
pointed out that it was the sixth anniversary of his being ``sworn
out ... receiving what Winston Churchill called the order of the
boot.''
</P>
<P>
   Promising not to filibuster the senators, he added, ``speaking
of filibusters, Barbara is sorry she could be here this evening.''
The former first lady did not accompany the former president to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bush singled out former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole for
special praise. Despite their intense and bitter political fight
for the 1988 GOP presidential nomination, ``not once did he (Dole)
let me down'' during his presidency, Bush added.

 &HT;    Y2K glitches showing up in politics, too, but America `will go

 &HT;    By Tom Baxter

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Y2K glitches or no Y2K glitches, the nation is
working itself into a millenial mood.
</P>
<P>
   This is the season of broad visions and long reaches, of
inauguration and state of the state and nation speeches, when new
leaders take office with great hopes for the future and more
weathered ones try to put a fresh spin on their administrations.
The added incentive of being in office at the beginning of the new
millenium seems to have inspired those politicians who've had a
platform in the past week or so to stretch themselves in the vision
department.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, taking office for the second time,
called for ``armies of compassion'' to rise up and solve the
state's problems, while newly elected Gov. Jim Hodges of South
Carolina spoke of a 21st century ``children's crusade.'' Gov. James
Gilmore of Virginia vowed to make that state the Internet capital
of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In line with the millenial rhetoric, two things distinguish this
year's crop of speeches from those of recent years: a much stronger
itch for governmental activism, from the president on down, and a
sweeping acknowledgement of the nation's increasing diversity.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Bush spoke a sentence in Spanish and extolled values
``upheld by boot-tough old cowboys and brand-new immigrants.'' In
Alabama, civil rights attorney Fred Gray declared the ``line in the
dust'' drawn in 1960 by Gov. George Wallace had become ``the tie
that binds.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was the shift in the approach to government more evident
than Alabama, where former Georgia Gov. Zell Miller administered
the oath to Democrat Don Siegelman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone was any attack on big government and out-of-control
courts and any expressions of concern over a society gone haywire
that constituted nearly half of (Former Republican Gov. Fob) James'
1995 inaugural speech,'' wrote Tom Gordon of the Birmingham News.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman and Hodges are both exponents of Millerism, that
coinage being safe now that he's out of office: a sharp focus on
what Miller calls ``kitchen table issues,'' laced with the pizzazz
of a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Millerism is a style which has evolved in response to the
Republican Southern surge. To the GOP's critique of Big Government
at both the national and state level, Millerism concentrates on
government programs that demonstrate very obvious payoffs for
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The First Governor, Bill Clinton, has studied Millerism
carefully, but it would be too understated to define the agenda
described in his State of the Nation address as a litany of kitchen
table issues.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe kitchen table and kitchen sink. Beyond the mere fact of
his showing up to give the speech, what must have most galled the
Republicans who sat on their hands watching Clinton on Tuesday
night was his appropriation of huge chunks of the century they
thought was theirs. Clinton's plan to save Social Security would
lock the Republicans out of the chance for a surplus-produced tax
cut for 15 years, while his plans for Medicare would set policy for
that program out to 2020.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to this sweeping 21st-century horizon, the
Republican response began with Rep. Jennifer Dunn's cheerful
assurance that ``no matter what the outcome of the president's
situation, life in America will go on.'' True enough, but not very
Y2K.

 &HT;    Final arguments presented by Bumpers expected to be personal,
`entertaining'
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a lengthy interview with the Los Angeles Times
shortly before he left office, former Arkansas Sen. Dale Bumpers
predicted the House would never impeach President Clinton and, if
it did, the Senate would filibuster it to certain death.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the veteran Democrat will stand before his former Senate
colleagues to defend his longtime friend against charges that
Clinton lied and obstructed justice and should face the ultimate
consequence: removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers, who retired from the Senate last year after 24 years,
will deliver the final arguments in Clinton's defense. White House
lawyers haven't spelled out what Bumpers will say, but several
Democratic senators said they expect their former colleague to draw
heavily on his personal friendship with Clinton, understanding of
the Senate and deep knowledge of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the substance, senators on both sides of the aisle
predict a fiery summation from a man many consider to have been one
of the Senate's finest orators.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't get any better,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).
``He's one of those people who in this age of sound bites brings a
real dignity to the Senate body. It would not be possible to find a
better person on the planet to represent the president.''
</P>
<P>
   A liberal Southern Democrat who lived and fought through the
civil rights movement, Bumpers retired from the Senate at 73
feeling very much disillusioned. He is now the director of the
Center for Defense Information, a military policy organization in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He fought many losing battles in the Senate, but became known
for his persistence and dedication to the issues he believed in. He
fought funding for the NASA space station, a host of expensive
defense projects and legislation and regulations he believed tilted
too much in favor of mining companies.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Atlanta Constitution in October,
Bumpers said, ``The ordinary person in the coffee shop in Arkansas
will say I don't agree with old Dale, but at least he stands up and
does what he thinks is right. That is the quality, that people not
just in Arkansas, but all across the country are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion piece appearing in the New York Times earlier this
year, Bumpers lamented the ``meanspiritedness'' and loss of
collegiality that had infected Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is rarely consensus even on the most practical and
ideologically neutral matters,'' he wrote. ``And issues that go to
the heart of the values we hold as a nation have become so partisan
that the imperative to win subsumes the necessity of governing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers' former Senate colleagues invariably refer to his
captivating oratory when describing their former colleagues
</P>
<P>
   With his booming voice and penchant for roaming the Senate floor
while he speaks, Bumpers' oratorical style harkens back to the
``golden age'' of Senate oratory when senators spoke to real
crowds, not radio microphones or television monitors, said Ron
Ritchie, associate Senate Historian.
</P>
<P>
   Senators such as Daniel Webster, John Calhoun and Henry Clay
were seasoned orators, Ritchie said, who depended on the power of
their lungs and gesture of their hands to engage their listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly came out of that background,'' said Ritchie. ``He
could really speak to a crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers, the son of a hardware store owner in the West Arkansas,
honed his speaking skills as a Southern country lawyer in his
hometown of Charleston, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   He ran for governor in 1970, beating out seven other candidates,
including Arkansas' segregationist governor, Orval Faubus. He ran
for Senate in 1974 with the intention, later abandoned, of running
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he ran for governor, no one had heard of a country lawyer
from Charleston, but he was such a great speaker,'' said Ralph
Shelby, a boyhood friend from Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has had a remarkable ability to connect with the people,''
said Skip Rutherford, former chief aide to senator David Pryor,
another former Arkansas Democrat. ``He's one of these individuals
who is a scholar, but also a communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   A passionate constitutional scholar, Bumpers carries around a
copy of the Constitution in his pocket and frequently has copies on
hand to give away.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers also knows Clinton, who views the senior Democrat as a
mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have a grasp of what went on down there in Arkansas
and that would add to his credibility,'' said Sen. Ernest Hollings
(D-S.C.). ``It'll certainly be a lot of better than what we've
heard so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Hutchinson (R-Ark.) acknowledged that Bumpers was well
liked, but noted that he had also ``championed a lot of lost
causes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be very entertaining,'' said Hutchinson. ``There will be
a lot of stories. He'll be good.''

 &HT;    Senate divided on public coverage of trial
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's impeachment trial could vanish
from television screens as early as Monday if the Senate doesn't
change the 131-year-old rules governing the trial.
</P>
<P>
   When senators switch from passive audience to participants in a
debate, the rules require that they exclude the public. Any
proposal, or motion, to dismiss the charges, subpoena witnesses, or
vote on Clinton's fate can be discussed only in secret session,
although the votes themselves would be held in public.
</P>
<P>
   The trial schedule sets Monday as the day to consider a motion
to dismiss the charges against Clinton, followed by another
proposal to subpoena witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In a legislative body as fond of tradition as the Senate, there
is considerable support in both parties for retaining the secrecy
rule. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) spoke for many of his colleagues
when he praised the Senate's ability to work in a bipartisan
fashion, particularly when no television cameras are present.
</P>
<P>
   Senators ``are more reasonable'' in a private setting, McConnell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many senators said their private meeting in the old
Senate chamber nearly two weeks ago allowed them to agree on
procedures for the trial in large part because they did not have to
worry about how reporters would assess their comments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not all senators want to retain the old rule. Two
Democrats, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Sen. Paul Wellstone of
Minnesota have sponsored a proposal to open deliberations to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that unless we open this trial up, we are going to
sow the seeds of confusion, misinformation, suspicion and
unnecessary conflict,'' Harkin said Wednesday on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said senators would quickly tell reporters what had
transpired, but insist on not being quoted. Competing versions of
events would create conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's two senators, both strong supporters of open
government when they were state elected officials, said they likely
would be on different sides of the issue. Democratic Sen. Max
Cleland said, ``I tend to favor the Harkin resolution to open up
the deliberations of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell said he is leaning against
voting to open the proceedings to the public. Coverdell said he is
still working through the issue, but added that he fears open
deliberations could disrupt the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't know to what public good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Chief Justice William Rehnquist's ruling last week that
the senators are not, strictly speaking, jurors, Coverdell said
their debates on the articles of impeachment are akin to jury
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause and other government watchdog groups are working in
support of open deliberations. ``If the Senate deliberates in
secret, there will forever be lingering questions about what
happened and why,'' Common Cause President Ann McBride wrote
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin and Wellstone intend to modify their proposal so that it
would apply only to the initial motion to dismiss the charges. If
that motion fails, and senators see how painless public
deliberations are, they would support changing the rest of the
process, Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
   But he may be a tad optimistic. Rule changes require a
two-thirds vote, meaning 67 senators must vote for open
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to get two-thirds on anything,'' Coverdell said.
``I just don't see it.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
When Clyde Drexler retired from the NBA, he left some pretty big
shoes to fill. It was almost as if the Rockets lost three players.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They lost a guy who could play the point and distribute the
ball, a small forward who could post up and rebound, and a big
guard who could shoot from the perimeter and push the ball on the
break.
</P>
<P>
   Filling those gaps would require signing three players. Or they
could try to get the one player who could do all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Houston, Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler, now the basketball coach at the University of Houston,
can easily see the similarities between his game and Pippen's.
Getting him to admit that, however, is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for me what's different or what's similar,'' Drexler
said. ``I never compare myself to anybody or compare people to me.
I just think he's a good player, and he's been a good player for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Drexler can see where Pippen is a huge addition for a team
trying to milk another title or two out of Hakeem Olajuwon's last
three years in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to winning is that you need a real team,'' Drexler
said. ``The Rockets are trying to piece together a team. For the
last three years of Hakeem's career, the Rockets are trying to put
people around him that will give him a chance to go back and win
another title. That's admirable. By bringing in Scottie, I think
they're going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, signed by Chicago to a five-year deal that could be
worth up to $82 million with incentives before being dealt to the
Rockets for Roy Rogers and a second-round draft pick, won six NBA
championships with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, playing with Michael Jordan helped Pippen amass those
rings, and Drexler pointed out that by coming to Houston, he will
be playing in an entirely different system than the one to which he
was accustomed in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie was a good complementary player to Michael Jordan,''
Drexler said. ``He had a tremendous career. I like his game. He
plays hard, but I think that fitting into a new system, one with a
center, is going to be an adjustment for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he has to give the ball into the center, because that's
where your offense starts. That's different from the motion offense
he had in Chicago, or when they just gave it to Jordan and spotted
up. It's going to be an adjustment, but I think Pippen can make
that adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if the 6-8 swingman continues to play the kind of
game that made him so successful with the Bulls. Drexler feels the
reason Pippen flourished in Chicago was because he was content to
play a complementary role rather than try to upstage Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie never was the type of guy who wanted to put up big
numbers just to make you notice him,'' Drexler said. ``He just
tried to play the all-around game. That's probably good, because if
he tried to put up big numbers, we don't know if he could. That
year that Jordan was not there (the 1993-94 season), we saw that he
couldn't, basically. (Pippen averaged a career-high 22 points, but
it was far off the 32.6 Jordan put up the season before.)
</P>
<P>
   ``So Scottie just plays his game, and he does that very well.
He's going to have pretty much the same job description on this
team _ play the all-around game, distribute the ball and just do
what he's capable of doing. He's not going to be asked to do
anything special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the question becomes, Does he want to spend his whole life
being a secondary player? Is he happy with that? I don't know.
Those are issues he has to face. From what I've seen, Hakeem is
still the franchise player. If Scottie does what he did in Chicago,
they'll be in great shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Drexler hopes the same can be said of the Rockets when the
abbreviated season is finally finished. Because of the lockout, the
league is putting together a compressed schedule to squeeze 50
games into three months, which Drexler feels will be a challenge to
veteran-laden teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets fall into that category since they will feature
Olajuwon, 36; Barkley, 35; Pippen, 33; and Eddie Johnson, 39, all
of whom had surgery last season or during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question whenever you have a bunch of veterans like
Charles and Hakeem, and I'm just assuming they're going to re-sign
Charles, the question is that when they play three games in a row,
are they going to keep guys healthy?'' Drexler said. ``It's tough
enough to play two in a row, but now when you start talking about
playing three straight in a season where guys aren't really
healthy, that's when the veteran teams could get hurt. A format
such as this, where you have a lot of games in a short number of
days, hurts those veteran teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish them all the best,'' Drexler added. ``I'll be going to
a few of the games, but I'm just a casual fan right now. I have
worries of my own right here, but I wish them well.''

CLINTON SEEKS NEW GOVERNMENT ROLE IN SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's proposal to shore up the financially shaky
Social Security system leans heavily on a leading Republican plan.
He would grab trillions of dollars of general tax revenues and
invest at least some of it in the stock market. The plan is
attractive since neither Clinton nor the Republicans would need to
propose higher payroll taxes or reductions in retirement benefits.
On this feature, Democrats and Republicans easily agree.
</P>
<P>
   But under Clinton's plan, the government would own stocks. The
leading Republican plan, proposed by Martin Feldstein of Harvard
and backed by Sen. Phil Gramm and others on Capitol Hill, would
turn the general revenue over to individuals for deposit into their
own investment accounts. Therein lie profound political and
financial differences.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement of the baby boomers early next century combined
with their increased longevity will throw Social Security into
deficit. The administration proposes to balance the books by
tapping future federal surpluses that it expects will total about
$4.5 trillion over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aims to pump about $3 trillion of that amount into the
trust fund. About $650 billion of the $3 trillion would would be
invested in stocks. Under current law, the entire trust fund is
invested in low-yielding government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of new revenue and high return on stock
investments is expected to generate enough new revenue to eliminate
deficits in the program for the next 50 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has the political virtue of closing the deficit in
Social Security without cutting retirement benefits. And by
preserving the central feature of the current system _ paying
benefits entirely out of public funds _ the proposal avoids certain
pitfalls of private accounts. The plan would pay retirees a benefit
based on their lifelong earnings, not on the vagaries of stock- and
bond-market returns.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would preserve the ability to transfer money from high-
to low-paid workers. And the costs of administering a single public
fund are very low compared with those of setting up 150 million
individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan solves these financial problems by creating a
severe political problem. The administration estimates that
government would come to own 4 percent to 5 percent of the value of
shares on Wall Street. The danger is that Congress would meddle,
for example steering federal dollars into environmentally friendly
companies rather than tobacco companies, which were a target of
Clinton's speech on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board added his
weight to the critics on Wednesday. ``I do not believe that it is
politically feasible to insulate such huge funds from government
direction,'' he told the committee. ``I am fearful that we would
use those assets in a way that would create a lower rate of return
for Social Security recipients.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economist, shares
Greenspan's concern and rejects the Clinton plan as ``politically
naive.'' He said, ``Congress will simply not stand by and let huge
surpluses accumulate without spending them. Congress is much less
likely to tamper with private accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists point out that investing security revenue in stocks
would not in itself affect the nation's saving rate or raise future
living standards. It would merely shuffle stock out of accounts of
private investors and into a public account.
</P>
<P>
   But, as a recent report from the National Association of Social
Insurance pointed out, the shuffle would still have an important
impact. Wealthy families, the report observes, need not care if the
public trust fund invests their payroll contributions in stocks,
because they can invest their private savings in stocks, reaping
the high rate of return that stocks have historically yielded.
</P>
<P>
   Most families, however, save and invest very little. The only
way their retirement income can reflect the value of investing in
stocks is if the government does the investing for them. Clinton's
proposal to invest some of the trust fund in stocks would bring the
benefit of stock investing to a larger number of American families.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the financial merits, the administration is left
with Greenspan's political demerit. Here the administration has a
plausible response provided by two economists at the Brookings
Institution. Henry Aaron and Robert Reischauer, a former director
of the Congressional Budget Office, outline safeguards that they
say would insulate stock purchases from political interference.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea is to create a board that would turn the Social
Security money over to private managers of widely diversified
mutual funds. No government official would have any say over actual
purchase decisions. Boskin remains unconvinced. Congress can build
whatever fire walls Aaron and Reischauer want, he said, ``but in
the end Congress can tear them down.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton's Social Security plan was proposed in the context of
a larger budget plan that places other claims on future surpluses.
About $500 billion of the $4.5 trillion would be used to help
create individual retirement accounts that would be separate from
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The White House envisions contributing, say, $100 into accounts
for low- and middle-income families. Families that add more would
have their contributions partially matched by government.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious purpose behind the idea is to encourage families to
save more for retirement, the best way to boost future living
standards. But the administration also wants to use these
individual accounts to blunt the Republicans' fervor for setting up
private accounts as part of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The virtue of separate accounts, it believes, is that they would
not provide a ready excuse for cutting benefits under the Social
Security program, or lead to a cascading momentum to steer Social
Security increasingly away from a public plan to a private plan.

TAXES MAY STILL BE CERTAIN, BUT ON THE WEB IT'S   AT LEAST 
 EASIER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN E. BRIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Web sites that deal with tax information have become more
sophisticated and capable. Even the venerable Internal Revenue
Service web site has tax forms that can be filled out online and
printed, a far cry from the days when everything had to be
downloaded, printed and then filled out by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this change comes about as a result of the IRS e-file
program, in which tax returns can be filed electronically, whether
by telephone or through a computer. This has spurred an increase in
Web sites that can handle tax calculation and filing through a
browser, something unheard of just a few short years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, about 25 million returns were filed electronically,
about one in five according to the IRS. This year, the agency
expects that number to climb to about 30 million. This is a
significant change for the IRS, which still has its employees
retyping all the information that comes in on paper returns,
whether it was done by hand or computer _ and even if it comes in
on the 1040PC form. Every return that comes in electronically is
one less that has to be retyped and, according to the IRS, the
money saved will be redirected to customer service and upgraded
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   There is room for improvement. According to the IRS, half the
professionally prepared personal returns are prepared on computer
but less than a quarter of those are filed electronically. A paltry
28,000 of the approximately 9 million individual extensions
requests, seeking permission to file late returns, are filed
electronically. A picayune 1,000 of the 23.8 million payments that
accompany individual returns are received electronically, leaving
the IRS awash in a sea of paperwork and perpetuating a process that
is prone to error.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional tax software providers like Intuit and H&AMP;R Block
have jumped on the e-file bandwagon. They have been joined by
companies such as One Tax, Tax Act and Secure Tax that provide
information as well as software and online filing services. The
incentive for consumers to use such services is the promise of
easier filing, faster refunds and fewer contacts with the IRS
</P>
<P>
   The sites that have the Web-based tax programs uniformly offer
tax advice of high quality. H&AMP;R Block's Kiplinger Tax Cut,
www.taxcut.com, mple, offers a handy section titled ``50 ways to
cut your taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site put together by the Internal Revenue _
Servicewww.irs.ustreas.gov. _ contains tax forms, information
sheets and explanations of the many arcane rules of the tax
business. The tax rules are available on line in what the IRS
claims is plain language; it is offered on CD-ROM for tax
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has expanded its use of what it calls fillable forms.
The forms are based on Adobe Acrobat's Portable Document Format
(P.D.F.). Unlike the other forms, which must be downloaded, printed
and filled in by hand, these allow users to view a form with a Web
browser, type information in the appropriate fields and then print
or save.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the forms do not have a computation engine built
in, so it is still necessary to do all that troublesome math on
your own and carry the results from one field to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Younger taxpayers, or those who want the tax code explained in
English, may want to check out the Taxi, or Tax Interactive,
section of the site. This explains how the tax system works, where
tax money goes and what many of those obscure terms mean. The
explanations are a bit simplistic, but if you don't know the
language, Taxi is a good place to start. Another useful section is
the site's FAQ page. Like much in the world of taxes, it depends
heavily on numbers, but it still contains useful information.
</P>
<P>
   When tax time is past, some people may want to take a look at
the Statistics of Income section of the Web site. This contains
demographic information about taxpayers that may be of some use to
businesses that need to target their products or marketing or to
people trying to better understand their community. By the way,
people perusing the entire site can also rest easy, according to
the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't count visitors or individual users,'' said Linda
Wallace, the agency's chief of electronic information services.``We
feel everyone wants to be anonymous.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The undisputed king of the hill for personal tax software is
Intuit, with the various versions of Turbotax grabbing almost 50
percent of the market, according to PC Data of Reston, Va., a
market research company. Intuit also makes a Macintosh version,
Macintax, and several versions of the program to handle state
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Intuit is taking that background to the Web with Web
Turbotax.
</P>
<P>
   The Web offers advantages over desktop tax software. First, you
don't have to worry about software conflicts, running out of disk
space or any of the problems that arise when installing software.
Second, the program and data are available through any Web browser:
just take out your W-2 statement of annual earnings, open the
browser, go to the site and enter the information. The drawbacks,
as for any Internet service, are slow connections and concerns
about security.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit provides extensive notes about the security of its
encryption (128-bit secure socket layers) and about the penalties
the company would face if it misused tax data. Concerns over speed
are addressed by allowing users to do much of the work without
charge and requiring a fee only when it comes time to print, view
or send the return.
</P>
<P>
   The product will handle federal returns as well as those from
any one of the 44 states (and the District of Columbia) that have
income taxes. But you can't file in two states.
</P>
<P>
   The site charges $9.95 for a 1040EZ form or the state equivalent
and $19.95 for a 1040 or its state equivalent. Finished documents
can be printed to be mailed or sent electronically. Taxpayers who
earn less than $20,000 can use the program free under an IRS
program intended to encourage electronic filing.
</P>
<P>
   The information for the return is collected during Web
Turbotax's interview process.
</P>
<P>
   As the interview process proceeds, an outline down the left side
of the screen changes to let you know where you are in the process;
FAQ's appear on the right to answer questions relevant to that part
of the interview. Although helpful, these additions slow down the
process. Entering the assets needed for Schedule C was painful; a
single question was answered on each screen, with three or more
screens for each new asset. Users who have outfitted a home office
with a computer, television, scanner, fax, desk and related
equipment might find this too much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   When finished with the federal return, the program asks if you
wish to prepare a state return.
</P>
<P>
   Onetax.com is relatively new to the consumer market, though not
to tax and financial information. It is an offshoot of Thomson
Investors Network, which produces First Call financial earnings
estimates, software for professional tax preparers and other
financial products.
</P>
<P>
   Like Web Turbotax, One Tax allows you to do federal and state
taxes using a Web browser, limiting users to a single state. The
price is low, $9.95 &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Web Turbotax, One Tax takes more of a minimalist
approach.
</P>
<P>
   The site is designed for speed and for the average taxpayer.
``We don't do the business,'' said Jane Moynihan, a company
spokeswoman. ``We don't do Schedule C. We don't do multiple
states.'' &UR;  &LR;  Everything is clearly labeled, and every field has
either a Help button or a Tax Tip button next to it. A quick click,
and more information on that field is available. Another click, and
you are back at the form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a lot of time doing a robust help engine and making
help easy,'' Ms. Moynihan said. ``We also don't give out tax
advice. We do give advice like, `This is what this means.'''
</P>
<P>
   One Tax allows the user to switch between the standard ``guided
entry'' process and an ``independent entry'' system. Independent
entry allows you to click on a menu at the top of each page,
choosing items like W-2, 1099, dependents and similar items, and
then enter the information you happen to have at that time.

KENNY WALLACE WANTS ON-TRACK HEADLINES IN '99
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenny Wallace racked up his 15 minutes of fame last year with a
flippant remark about water and Turn 1 and Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   He can laugh about it now, and Wallace was doing exactly that
during the annual Charlotte Motor Speedway Media Tour last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said there was a lot of water gushing out of Turn 1 at
Texas,'' said Wallace, recalling an interview at Bristol Motor
Speedway that appeared in the ``Star-Telegram'' the Sunday before
the Texas 500 in Fort Worth. ``And of course, \RTMS owner\S Bruton
Smith and \RTMS general manager\S Eddie Gossage heard it and I
became the bad guy real quick. I called up and apologized that I
was sorry there was water gushing out of Turn 1. And Bruton chewed
my butt out, big-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny Wallace's tendency is to have shoelaces hanging out of
his mouth. But when the water came out and they canceled
\Rfirst-round\S qualifying, I just kind of walked back to my
motorhome.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, Smith and Gossage since have hissed and made up. And
Wallace is attempting to reinvent his so-called career. The younger
brother of 1989 Cup champion Rusty Wallace, Kenny Wallace believes
his alliance with longtime buddy Ken Schrader and team owner Andy
Petree will allow him to make headlines on the racetrack in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That would be different. Because the only stat Wallace led the
Winston Cup Series in during 1998 was the dubious category of DNFs.
Wallace logged a distressing 13 ``Did Not Finish'' results behind
the wheel of the No. 81 Square D Ford Taurus owned by Filbert
Martocci. Nobody grenaded engines with the panache of Wallace, who
announced in midseason that he and his primary sponsor planned to
join Petree's single-car Chevrolet Monte Carlo stable in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go on record that I don't have as much fun as I used
to,'' said Wallace, 35, whose highest finish last year was sixth at
the second New Hampshire International Speedway event. ``And I
think I see Mark Martin's and Rusty's point. They tell me how
miserable they are. Now I think I get it. To run up front, you have
to be a little bit ornery to get what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any ``little brother,'' Kenny Wallace wants to match his
brother's 15 minutes of fame on the racetrack. Kenny's career
to-date _ zero victories, two poles, one top-five and 17 top-10s in
151 starts _ is a bad joke when compared to his big bro's 48
victories and $18.7 million in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Winston Cup racing, the given things are your wins and your
poles,'' Wallace said. ``But that's not success in Winston Cup.
Success is being very competitive every week. If you're sitting
there running fourth through 10th and you blow up, then I was
successful last year. But the bottom line is the finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace acknowledged that both he and Schrader, who has not won
a Cup race since June 1991, will have to prove they are not just
the best comedy act in the garage area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny and myself, we know the best and worst parts about each
other already,'' said Schrader, who will return to the No. 33 Skoal
Bandit Chevy. ``I keep saying I'd give him five bucks _ but it'd
probably only be two _ if he'd keep his mouth shut for five minutes
when we're at a restaurant or something. He could never do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But forget about that I know him and really like him and
stuff. Kenny Wallace can drive the race car and he's got the right
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he and Schrader have tremendous chemistry, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing he's not a brother, because he's been family
friends forever,'' Wallace said of his fellow Missourian.
``Schrader races for a living and so do I. We're the first ones to
lay in bed at night with our gut tore out if we don't run good.
When business is done, we're probably the first ones to cut up a
little bit. 'Course, my loud laugh draws attention, and hell, I
can't help it. It's just the way I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've been real serious this winter. The biggest pressure
is that I promised Andy Petree that I would be successful with a
new team. I'm like anybody _ I'm a man of my word.''
THE BUZZ The 358-cubic-inch Ford V-8s run by Penske-Kranefuss
teammates Rusty Wallace and Jeremy Mayfield this season will be
provided by a new supplier _ Penske Engines of Concord, N.C. The
man in charge is Larry Wallace _ no relation to Rusty _ who built
some motors for the team last year. Rusty Wallace recorded only two
DNFs during 1998, a huge improvement from the nine engine failures
he experienced in 1997. ``I'm really excited about this year and
knowing that the engine company has been formed,'' said Rusty
Wallace, who posted the hottest hot lap during winter testing at
the Daytona International Speedway at 193.129 mph on Jan. 13. Team
co-owners Michael Kranefuss and Roger Penske each own 50 percent of
the engine shop. ...
</P>
<P>
   Pennzoil has announced a one-year contract extension with
National Hot Rod Association Top Fuel driver Eddie Hill of Wichita
Falls. The deal will allow Hill, the 1993 Top Fuel champion, to run
the entire 22-race schedule that begins with the AutoZone
Winternationals at Pomona (Calif.) Raceway on Feb. 4-7. Hill, 62,
was one of just six Top Fuel drivers to qualify for every national
event in 1998. ... Houston Raceway Park in Baytown is scheduled to
play host to the NHRA's Pro Stock Superbowl Challenge on Jan. 30.
The one-day nonpoints event begins at 8 a.m., with professional
trials at 10 a.m. and noon. Eliminations are set for 1 p.m. Tickets
are $18 for adults. Children $12-and-under will be admitted for $1.
...
</P>
<P>
   Pep Boys Indy Racing League team owner John Menard has announced
plans to field a team for Robby Gordon in the rival FedEx
Championship Auto Racing Teams series this season. Menard, whose
lone IRL driver is Greg Ray of Plano, is the first owner to become
involved with both the IRL and CART series on a full-time basis
since their split after the 1995 season. Menard and partner Mike
Held, who is Gordon's business manager, will field Gordon in a
Toyota-powered Swift for the 20-race CART schedule. Gordon also
will be Ray's teammate at the IRL-sanctioned 83rd Indianapolis 500
in May. ...
</P>
<P>
   Galles Racing and driver Davey Hamilton submitted a last-minute
entry on Jan. 14 for Sunday's IRL season opener at Walt Disney
World Speedway. Team owner Rick Galles originally planned to skip
the race to search for corporate sponsorship. ``We are still
searching for a major sponsor,'' Galles said. ``But we feel that
it's important to run Orlando and collect points and show support
for the series.'' Hamilton, who finished second to champion Kenny
Brack last year, will stand as the only driver to start in all 25
IRL events if he qualifies at the 1-mile oval. Hamilton shares that
distinction with former IRL champion Tony Stewart and two-time Indy
500 winner Arie Luyendyk, neither of whom is scheduled to run at
``The Mickyard.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The Joliet (Ill.) City Council has approved plans to add a
1.5-mile oval track just north of the year-old Route 66 Raceway
drag strip. That facility drew rave reviews when it played host to
the inaugural NHRA Fram Route 66 Nationals last summer. Dale Coyne,
chief executive officer of Route 66 Raceway, has put a $100 million
price tag on the oval, which will seat approximately 75,000. And
naturally, track management already is on its knees, praying to
land a NASCAR Winston Cup race for the schedule.

DEMOCRATS RALLY TO CLINTON AFTER DEFENSE PRESENTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democrats rallied to President Clinton's
defense Wednesday after White House lawyers launched a
point-by-point attack on the impeachment case against him.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling that they are ready to close ranks, several Democrats
said the White House presentation marked a turning point in the
Senate trial that will determine Clinton's fate. Their outspoken
support for Clinton is another sign that opinions are hardening
along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the last chapter is written on this entire impeachment
trial, I suspect that this day will be remembered as the beginning
of the end,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``Under no
circumstances is there going to be a vote of conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors dismissed the White House rebuttal as a
``Swiss cheese'' defense _ full of holes. But some Senate
Republicans acknowledged that White House lawyers did a good job in
arguing that Clinton should be allowed to finish his final two
years in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young lady at the end was very powerful,'' said Sen.
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, referring to deputy counsel Cheryl Mills.
``I think we made a mistake in not allowing for a rebuttal period
for the House managers.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, one of Clinton's harshest
critics, contributed to the sense that momentum had shifted in the
president's direction by declaring the impeachment battle over.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a public relations standpoint, he's won ... Clinton's
won,'' Robertson said on his 700 Club program. ``They might as well
dismiss this impeachment hearing and get on with something else,
because it's over as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said Mills' summation left some
Democrats on the verge of tears. The 33-year-old lawyer, the only
woman and the only African American on either legal team, concluded
her presentation by defending Clinton's civil rights record.
</P>
<P>
   In calling for the president's ouster last week, House
prosecutors said his deceptions in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case were, in effect, an assault on Jones' civil rights.
The president has acknowledged that he tried to hide his affair
with Monica Lewinsky from Jones and her lawyers, who felt that the
information would help their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand here before you today because Bill Clinton believed I
could stand here for him,'' Mills told the Senate. ``You should
acquit him on this record. And you must not let imagined harms to
the house of civil rights persuade you otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of the White House presentation focused on the
details of impeachment articles accusing the president of perjury
and obstruction of justice. Clinton's lawyers said prosecutors
strained to find criminal intent in the understandable actions of a
man trying to ``protect himself and his family from embarrassment,
even destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Special counsel Gregory Craig attacked the perjury allegations
as trivial, baseless and vastly overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you convict and remove President Clinton on the basis of
these allegations, no president of the United States will ever be
safe from impeachment again,'' he told the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said the perjury allegations boil down to ``a classic
oath-on-oath, he-says-she-says, swearing match'' that would never
hold up in court. The illicit relationship exploded into a scandal
a year ago Wednesday with a story in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Although Craig acknowledged that Clinton's sworn statement in
the Jones case was maddeningly evasive, he reminded senators that
the House rejected an impeachment article based on the civil suit.
Even some of Clinton's staunchest defenders have said that they
think he lied in the Jones case, which was later dismissed and
settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment article approved by the House is based on
Clinton's Aug. 17 testimony to a federal grand jury, when the
president admitted what he called an ``inappropriate intimate''
relationship with the former White House intern. In a reversal from
his previous testimony, Clinton also acknowledged that he had been
alone with Lewinsky on various occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you believe that the president crossed the line in his
Jones deposition, you cannot conclude that he should be removed for
it,'' Craig told the Senate. ``This case is about the grand jury
and the grand jury only.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills was equally scornful in challenging allegations that
Clinton obstructed justice by tampering with witnesses and trying
to hide evidence linking him to Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president had a relationship with a young woman. ... He
ended it not because he thought it would place him in legal
jeopardy. He ended it because he knew it was wrong. That is not
obstruction of justice,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to specifics, she said Clinton's secretary, Betty
Currie, helped Lewinsky hide gifts that Clinton had given her
without telling the president. She said Currie was motivated by
``motherly affection'' for Lewinsky, who feared that Jones' lawyers
would subpoena the trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Currie had no idea the gifts were under subpoena. And so
Miss Lewinsky's request hardly struck her as criminal,'' Mills
said.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors said Mills' account conflicts with Lewinsky's
testimony and demonstrates the need to call Currie and Lewinsky
before the Senate as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the lawyers say is not evidence. It is just the opinion
of lawyers,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The White House will conclude its three-day presentation
Thursday with closing arguments from attorney David Kendall and
former Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas. Senators will then have two
days to ask questions of both sides before opening deliberations on
the next step in the trial Monday.

VIEW FROM TV CRITICS' TOUR: TRASH THE NEWSMAGS, ADD MORE
ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ As dozens of cable channels scramble in these
final days of the winter press tour to impress (the critics) and
impeach (the viability of the commercial networks), it may be
worthwhile to remember the words of Dick Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Wolf always says something interesting at these
California conclaves. For another, he's been around long enough to
know what he's talking about.
</P>
<P>
   At a session to promote the 200th episode of his riveting series
``Law &AMP; Order,'' slated to air May 5, Wolf was easily persuaded to
talk about other things, such as network programming strategy as it
pertains to the attraction and retention of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that, on Sunday, Nov. 8, the four major networks
grabbed 68 percent of the television-viewing audience in prime time
_ a noteworthy achievement in light of all the hand-wringing over
the erosion of viewership from network to cable. (One of the shows
airing that night was Wolf's ``Exiled,'' a TV movie based loosely
on ``Law &AMP; Order.'')
</P>
<P>
   On bad days, of which there are many lately, the Big Four share
less than 50 percent of the viewing public.
</P>
<P>
   If Wolf were running the networks, his response to this downward
spiral would be a simple _ and maybe simplistic _ brave new world.
He would trash the newsmagazines and put on some more
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a viewer,'' Wolf said, ``I don't know why I would be that
loyal to a network that has a great deal of news on it when it's
available in so many other places. ... The economics are kind of
self-fulfilling. If you give people an excuse not to watch the
networks, they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf made his remarks the day after CBS unveiled its new
Wednesday version of ``60 Minutes.'' That brought to 12 the number
of newsmagazines now airing on the networks (five ``Dateline
NBCs,'' three ``20/20s,'' two ``60 Minutes,'' one ``48 Hours'' and
one ``Fox Files''). It's a number that has more or less held steady
for the past few seasons, but Wolf thinks it's completely out of
whack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The median age of a `60 Minutes' viewer is 62,'' Wolf said.
``This is not how you go to franchise products over the long term.
I think it really is a poison pill and I would love to see more
dramas on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   So would I, but most broadcasters want to be just that:
broad-casters.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Jamie Kellner at The WB, who enjoys
narrowcasting to a lucrative demographic with such youthful fare as
``Felicity'' and ``Dawson's Creek,'' every other programming
executive at the commercial networks believes in reaching the
widest possible audience with a balanced lineup. That means dramas
and comedies, movies and specials, news and newsmagazines, and,
sadly, even ``reality'' programming like ``World's Wildest Police
Videos.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's point about the newsmagazines, of course, is that the
balance is way off, and he's probably right. Just this week,
``Dateline'' wasted an entire show on a jewelry-theft story that
could have been _ should have been _ reported in 10 minutes, tops.
It was journalistic padding of the worst kind, and it led the
viewer to conclude that ``Dateline'' doesn't have enough stories to
cover five nights, so it inflated the importance of a 10-minute
segment to fill an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is on target when he says such newsmagazine bloat will send
viewers scurrying.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sassa, the new president of NBC Entertainment, probably
agrees, but he'd never say so in public. Instead, his answer to the
question about the proliferation of newsmagazines is appropriately
diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been some form of programming that was not a
sitcom or a drama that filled the schedule of networks,'' Sassa
said. ``Whether it was game shows or variety shows, there was
always something (else) out there.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether he'd like to see more or fewer ``Datelines,''
Sassa is coy. ``We view `Dateline' as a tremendous asset in the
entertainment division. It's a great brand that's been built. ...
Our job is to find the schedule that gets the highest ratings in
the highest demographic categories with whatever programming we
have available to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, we may all be complaining less about newsmagazines
and more about animation in a few months. Most of Fox's comedies
will soon be of the animated variety, and The WB and UPN will be
getting into the game as well. First out of the gate was Eddie
Murphy's ``The PJs'' on Fox. Next will be ``Dilbert,'' premiering
Monday on UPN.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, it's the way the networks do things. If one is
good, one dozen must be be better. It may be annoying, but, as
Sassa points out, the networks retain a huge advantage over cable.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they're not pulling in as many viewers as they did 10
years ago, a quality show like ``ER,'' the most-watched drama on
network TV, still attracts 12 times as many viewers as the
most-watched drama on cable, ``Pacific Blue'' (an average of 27.8
million viewers vs. 2.3 million). Moreover, Sassa said, the
least-watched drama on the Big Four, Fox's ``Brimstone,'' pulls in
twice as many viewers as ``Pacific Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that ``Pacific Blue'' is dreadful, and that
most network fare is considerably better.
</P>
<P>
   But what's most encouraging about this press tour is the sense
that network executives finally believe that allowing these shows
to build an audience is preferable to canceling them after six
episodes because of small initial audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Networks are the only beachfront, Class-A real estate out
there,'' said Sassa, who spent a decade at Turner Broadcasting
before joining NBC in 1997. ``While I was at Turner, the whole time
we were there we were trying to buy a network, start a network or
merge with a network.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as the broadcast networks factor quality into their
quest for balance, their best shows should have a long stay at the
beach. And, as far as this midseason's entries go, keep an eye on:
``It's Like, You Know ...'' (March, ABC); ``Family Guy'' (March,
Fox); ``The PJs'' (Tuesdays, Fox); ``The Sopranos'' (Sundays, HBO);
``Strange World'' (TBA, ABC); ``Futurama'' (March, Fox) and
``Turks'' (Thursdays, CBS).

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORRISTOWN, Pa. _ An exuberant President Clinton starred in two
foot-stomping rallies on Wednesday, where he amplified the themes
of his State of the Union address and attacked Republican proposals
for across-the-board tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by Vice President Al Gore, First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Tipper Gore, received a rock idol's
reception at the Marine Midland Arena in Buffalo on Wednesday
afternoon, where 21,000 residents of western New York waited for
hours amid roof-high snowbanks to enter the hockey arena to see
him.
</P>
<P>
   The president has attended few such mass events over the past
year of scandal and investigation, and he was rewarded with a
rapturous response, after the crowd had heard more than an hour of
introductions from local dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fairly glowed as speaker after speaker praised his good
works and glossed over his legal and political problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bennett W. Smith, in an invocation, said that Clinton
has been ``the greatest president for our people of all time.'' He
called on the Lord to ``comfort him with Your word, that no weapon
formed against him shall prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton got a huge ovation when she rose to introduce her
husband. Several in the crowd held signs boosting her imagined
candidacy for the U.S. Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who appeared energized by the crowd, bellowed, ``We can
have the future we deserve because we already have the president we
deserve!''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said that the State of the Union marked a
turning point for the country and called on the huge audience to
help fight for the president's expansive policy agenda. The crowd
rose to its feet and roared.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton made a swing through the Midwest after his
State of the Union speech , and the year before that he went south.
This year, aides said, he wanted to visit the Northeast. Further,
Clinton told his staff that he wanted to go to Buffalo because he
had not paid a visit there since 1996, when he did little more than
arrive at the airport before heading into seclusion to prepare for
an election debate with his opponent, Robert Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House saw a further benefit to picking these
spots, Clinton aides acknowledged. As relatively small communities
that rarely receive presidential visits, they were more likely to
respond to the appeals of advance staff for big crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could hardly match the passion the preacher and the vice
president. He noted that he and Gore had taken the oath of office
for the first time six years ago on Wednesday and marveled at how
quickly the years had passed. ``They have been, to put it mildly,
eventful.''
</P>
<P>
   But policy, not nostalgia, was on his mind on Wednesday. So he
delivered a half-hour dissertation on the aging of America and the
importance of shoring up Social Security and Medicare for the baby
boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   He said that today's prosperity must be used to ensure a
financially secure future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to squander this moment,'' the president
said. ``We have to make the most of it. We have to look at the
long-term challenges facing America.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his plan for reserving a large portion of the
federal budget surplus for Social Security and Medicare and argued
strenuously against Republican proposals to use the money for tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But 20 minutes into his remarks, people began pouring out of the
arena, an unusual spectacle at a presidential event.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who stayed were Tom O'Sullivan and his 8-year-old
son, Kevin. O'Sullivan, 39, an auto worker, said he came to show
support for Clinton. ``I think he's done a good job. And there's
not too many chances to see a living president.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan, who builds axles for light trucks, said the United
Auto Workers urged its members in the Buffalo area to attend the
rally. But he said he would have come anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky was
wrong, but that Republicans have gone overboard in bringing him to
the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with what he's done,'' O'Sullivan said, ``but
they should have censured him and been done with it. What people
fail to take into account was that we all have our faults. How many
people in the House and Senate did the same thing as he did and
just didn't get caught. Man's just trying to save his marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the overwhelmingly pro-Clinton crowd, Diana
Gaglia, 61, took a half-day of vacation time from her job at a
denture plant to attend the rally to show her support for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's being ostracized because of that stupid Linda
Tripp,'' Mrs. Gaglia said. ``I also feel, find me a man who hasn't
had an indiscretion. He didn't do right, but we shouldn't be put
through all this.''

OFFICIALLY AN OLD FOSSIL, BUT NOT FEELING THAT WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL RECORD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now I have a greater appreciation for why my Uncle Jim was so
sensitive about the use of the word ``elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Jim, I need to explain, was managing editor of the
``Star-Telegram'' for more than 40 years. That in itself was
remarkable. I don't think anyone could take the pressure of that
job for that many years today.
</P>
<P>
   James Robert Record was a formal man. He ceased to be ``Uncle
Jim'' from the moment I went to work for the newspaper as a copy
boy on July 3, 1944. For the rest of my life, I always addressed
him as ``Mr. Record.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was ``Mr. Record'' to two other nephews who worked for
the newspaper: my brother, Tony, and my cousin Phil North.
</P>
<P>
   My dear mother could never understand why we couldn't address
him as ``Uncle Jim'' at family gatherings. If you had worked for
James R. Record, you would have understood.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Record (I still feel much more comfortable referring to him
that way, even though he has been dead for more than two decades)
could get agitated when a reporter referred to anyone near his age
as ``old'' or ``elderly.'' The reporter or his/her supervisor was
likely to get a memo reading: ``Hardly appropriate. JRR.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Record never considered himself to be old or elderly. Many
of us who worked for him did, but he was the man who called the
shots.
</P>
<P>
   To be safe, staff members adopted an unwritten rule to use the
words ``old'' or ``elderly'' only to describe those who were at
least five years older than Mr. Record. He didn't know about this
rule, of course.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. We wouldn't be chastised if we followed the unwritten
rule.
</P>
<P>
   I said I had a greater appreciation for Mr. Record's
sensitivity. That's because I turned 70 last week.
</P>
<P>
   I certainly don't feel ``old.'' Nor do I feel ``elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't even feel like an ``old fossil,'' although that is the
way my oldest son, Chris, described me in an invitation he prepared
for a gathering to mark the end of my seventh decade.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation read, ``Phil Record is officially an old
fossil.'' I promise you, he would never have written that had he
been the son of James R. Record.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure some of those young whippersnappers down at the
newspaper probably had some age rule they applied to me before I
retired as ombudsman a year ago. That's OK. To anyone in their 20s
or 30s, someone over 50 is ancient.
</P>
<P>
   I've truly been blessed during the past 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't have had better parents. I endured the ups and downs
of newspapering with colleagues whose dedication to serving the
public frequently went unrecognized and unappreciated. I have been
accompanied to the mountaintops and the valleys of life with
supportive friends deserving of the title ``beloved.''
</P>
<P>
   And I have reached that stage when I realize that many of the
travails of life have in fact been blessings.
</P>
<P>
   I have stated previously in this space how much I admire the
renowned spiritual author Henri Nouwen. I begin each day reading
from his book ``Bread for the Journey.''
</P>
<P>
   He had some interesting words for me on my 70th birthday:
</P>
<P>
   ``... to be grateful for all of our lives _ the good as well as
the bad, the moments of joy as well as the moments of sorrow, the
successes as well as the failures, the rewards as well as the
rejections _ that requires hard spiritual work. Still we are only
truly grateful people when we can say thank you to all that has
brought us to the present moment. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not be afraid to look at everything that has brought us
to where we are now and trust that we will soon see in it the
guiding hand of a loving God.''
</P>
<P>
   Too many who have reached my age have been cast aside _
especially by businesses _ as being of little value. That was not
my lot at this newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   When I decided it was time to retire a year ago, Publisher Wes
Turner and Executive Editor Jim Witt said they wanted me to
maintain ties to the paper as a consultant and columnist. I now
realize that to have completely cut my ties to the newspaper after
an association of more than half a century would have been
devastating.
</P>
<P>
   And now another blessing from that ``guiding hand from a loving
God'': This week I begin a new career.
</P>
<P>
   I am joining the faculty of the Journalism Department at Texas
Christian University, thanks to department Chairman Anantha Babbili
and his colleagues, as a teacher of ethics and a coach of writing.
</P>
<P>
   What an exciting venture for one entering his eighth decade.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure I will be sharing some of this new adventure with you
in future columns.

TEXAS-BORN ACTRESS LOSES HERSELF IN CHARACTERS
</HEADLINE>
 HALL-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because she's so adept at character acting, to speak with the
real Irma P. Hall is a bit odd. It's almost hard to believe she
exists.
</P>
<P>
   Had this been a meeting with Minerva, the voodoo priestess from
``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' or Big Mama from ``Soul
Food,'' it would have been different.
</P>
<P>
   Those are people one can identify. Irma P. Hall isn't. And
that's exactly how she wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I know to work is to get into character as quick
as I can,'' she says. ``As soon as I find enough about the
character for me to assume it, I stick my feet in and I stay there
for the duration of the project.''
</P>
<P>
   She so embodies her characters that her macho, weight-lifter son
cried when Big Mama died in ``Soul Food.'' ``I cried, too,'' says
Hall, a woman who speaks in italics. ``Because it wasn't `me.' I
cried when `that lady' died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm Lena,'' she says, referring to her role in the
Dallas Theater Center's production of ``A Raisin in the Sun.'' ``I
mean, I know I'm Irma P. Hall, but not right now. I'm Lena.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall was born in Beaumont and grew up in Chicago. She returned
to Texas and attended Texas College in Tyler. She taught in Dallas
at Booker T. Washington, James Madison, T.W. Brown and Zumwalt
Sarah schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother said that when I was a kid, as soon as I'd learn
something, I'd run out to show someone else. They knew I'd be a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a buyer for Marshall Field's. I wanted to
travel all over the world, picking out fashions and bringing them
back,'' Hall says with a sense of marvel that often fills her deep,
dark eyes.
</P>
<P>
   She was a precocious child with a curiosity that has carried her
through life. Her love for learning and doing new things led her to
volunteer as a writer for the struggling minority newspaper The
Dallas Express. Before she knew it, she was the black culture page
editor and the sports editor.
</P>
<P>
   And this is when her life changed course. In 1971, she wrote an
article about actor/director Raymond St. Jacques, who was going to
film ``The Book of Numbers'' in Dallas. He was so pleased with the
story that he asked her to be his interim publicist and to audition
for a role in the film.
</P>
<P>
   She landed a supporting role, and it was just the fuel she
needed for her future career. She soon co-founded the Dallas
Minority Repertory Theater, thinking her only role would be fund
raising. Her title, however, was executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was plunged into it,'' she says. ``I had to learn to act,
write, hang lights, run lights, run sound, make costumes ...
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Her stage debut was in the play ``Happy Endings.'' During the
next decade, she balanced her teaching and acting, trying to give
each equal time. In 1984, she decided to devote herself fully to
acting, and three years later, she moved to assist her ailing
mother in Chicago, where she now resides.
</P>
<P>
   So, how does a schoolteacher just get up and immerse herself in
the flighty world of acting _ especially during midlife and with
two grown children? For Hall, it all came easily.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that her parents _ her father was a musician who
played regular gigs at Chicago's infamous Rhumboogie Club, her
mother a hospital admissions clerk _ reared their only child on the
arts and letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my home, someone was always quoting something,'' she says.
``I was in third grade when I first heard my father quote `Above
all, to thine own self be true' (from Shakespeare's ``Hamlet).''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew that Shakespeare was supposed to be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, delving into the theater without any knowledge of its
machinery is not easy. ``When I started, I didn't know upstage from
outdoors,'' she says with a chuckle. ``Plus, being ambidextrous, I
don't think of things as left and right. But I've learned a lot,
and am still learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was doing `Funny Girl' with Carol Lawrence at Dallas
Summer Musicals, the stage manager said, `Watch out for the scrims'
(the opaque backdrop used in theaters),'' she says. ``I had no idea
what a scrim was, so I just made a big wide circle around
everything to make sure I missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her big film break came with Richard Pearce's 1996 film ``A
Family Thing,'' in which she co-starred with Robert Duvall and
James Earl Jones. Her role as the blind, peppery Aunt T earned her
a Best Supporting Actress award from the Chicago Film Critics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, she appeared in five films: ``Midnight in the Garden of
Good and Evil,'' ``Soul Food,'' ``Nothing to Lose,'' ``Steel'' and
``Buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was a role in the Oprah Winfrey/Jonathan Demme
movie ``Beloved,'' and the role of Joletta, the lovable nurse who
falls for Patch Adams' unorthodox medical philosophy. She also
released a self-published poetry anthology, ``I Can Deal With Black
and Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   She has performed in Lorraine Hansberry's American classic ``A
Raisin in the Sun'' several times, first playing Ruth and later
Lena, or Mama, the matriarch who holds the Younger family together.
She said she jumped at the chance to reprise the role of Lena at
the Dallas Theater Center.
</P>
<P>
   At 63, Hall isn't shying away from new ventures. She next wants
to tackle cinematography, having long had an interest in
photography.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as her acting goes, she doesn't know _ or worry about
_ what's next. ``When I wake up in the morning and say my prayers,
I say, ``Give us `this' day. And at the end of the day I say `Thank
you.'
</P>
<P>
   Film ``is a nebulous thing _ `chicken and feathers' I call it.
Chicken one day and feathers the next. I'm surprised my chicken is
still here.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several ideas in her head. Her dream is to play the
yet-unborn role of her personal hero, Mary McLeod Bethune, founder
of Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Fla., and a friend of
Eleanor Roosevelt. ``I have put that (idea) out there in the
universe,'' she says furtively.
</P>
<P>
   She also makes no bones about whom she'd like to work with next:
``Don't you think I look like Whoopi Goldberg's mother?''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's her fantasy stage role. ``This is a far-fetched
thing, but I've always thought that a woman could play
Mephistopheles in `Faust,''' she says, thrusting her hands forward
and giving her fingers a mischievous wiggle. ``I could just see me
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering how Hall becomes the character she's playing at the
moment, that's a chilling thought.

ANHEUSER-BUSCH PREPARES NEW ICONS FOR THE SUPER BOWL  
 MILLER DUMPS DICK 
 (DW) 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mo., Minn., Calif., Ill., Texas)  By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like a tavern owner who feels expansive enough to buy
the house a round of drinks, Anheuser-Busch Inc. is spending a
record sum on the most commercial time it has ever bought during a
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch, the beer division of the Anheuser-Busch
Companies in St. Louis, has long been a mainstay Super Bowl
marketer, most notably with campaigns centered on mock football
games known as the Bud Bowl. For Super Bowl XXXIII, which the Fox
Broadcasting Company will show on Jan. 31, Anheuser-Busch, the sole
beer sponsor, plans to run 9 spots during 5 minutes and 15 seconds
of commercial time _ the most by far for any advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch executives outlined their extensive and expensive
Super Bowl strategy at a news conference Wednesday in Manhattan.
The Super Sunday spots will likely mark the beginning of the end
for the popular Budweiser beer campaign about talking frogs and
lizards, the executives disclosed, which may conclude in 6 to 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   As if not to be outdone, Anheuser-Busch's main rival, the Miller
Brewing Company in Milwaukee, made a surprising announcement of its
own later in the day: Fallon McElligott &UR;  &LR;  in Minneapolis, the
incumbent on the flagship Miller beer brand account, Miller Lite,
will keep the creative assignment _ with billings estimated at $150
million _ after a grueling two-month review that pitted the agency
against three other finalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Anheuser-Busch ad blitz for the Super Bowl comes as that
company, the world's largest brewer, celebrates 1998 as its best
sales year ever. Anheuser-Busch gained market share in an industry
that was otherwise flat to down as beer drinkers switched from
competitive brands and the so-called microbrew fad faded. Results
were paced by Bud Light, which outsells Miller Lite, with annual
sales increasing by a double-digit percentage for the sixth
consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tremendous year,'' said Bob Lachky, vice president
for brand management at Anheuser-Busch, adding that an estimated
sales increase of 4 percent for all brands was ``our best since the
early 90's.''
</P>
<P>
   While Budweiser, the Anheuser-Busch flagship brand, suffered
another sales decline, falling about 2.6 percent, ``we expect to
turn that around this year,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Anheuser-Busch, it seems, felt more positive about the
Super Bowl, regardless of which teams face each other in what has
become an annual midwinter festival of pigskin, parties and
pitching (not necessarily in that order).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl is the No. 1-rated TV show every year,'' Lachky
said, ``with 60 percent more households tuned in than for another
comparable big event, the Academy Awards'' and tens of millions of
``beer drinkers, primarily men, primarily 21 to 34 and above.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest audience we can reach at one time,'' he
added, ``and that's why we're there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a unit of News Corp., is charging a record average of $1.6
million for each 30 seconds of commercial time during the game.
Trade publications reported that Anheuser-Busch paid more _ perhaps
as much as $2 million for each 30 seconds _ to guarantee
exclusivity in the beer category.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pricey,'' Lachky said, ``but it's not too much money when
you're the leader in your industry.''

   Anheuser-Busch has been the exclusive Super Bowl beer peddler
since Bud Bowl I in 1989. ``We don't intend to ever give it up,''
Lachky asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Back in St. Louis, his boss, August A. Busch IV, vice president
for marketing, announced that Anheuser-Busch had secured the beer
category exclusivity for three additional years by signing
agreements with the ABC unit of the Walt Disney &UR;  &LR;  Company for 2000,
the CBS unit of the CBS &UR;  &LR; Corp. for 2001 and Fox for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Lachky and David English, group vice president for premium
brands at Anheuser-Busch, showed reporters finished and rough
versions of commercials being considered for the nine Super Bowl
slots.
</P>
<P>
   Two spots definitely in the lineup are new installments in the
Budweiser swamp-creature saga created by Goodby, Silverstein &AMP;
Partners in San Francisco, a unit of the Omnicom Group. In the
first spot, Louie the lizard tells the three croaking frogs they
all are ``canned,'' which causes the frogs to utter words other
than ``Bud-weis-er'' for the first time. In the second spot, the
frogs administer a tongue-lashing _ literally and figuratively _ to
Louie.
</P>
<P>
   The phasing out of the characters is attributable to a belief
that ``the lifetime of our icons is about two years,'' Lachky said,
rather than to widespread complaints by advocacy organizations that
they appeal to children.
</P>
<P>
   Four other Budweiser spots being considered for the game are by
DDB Needham Chicago, also part of Omnicom, as are two of three
commercials being considered for Bud Light; the third is by Fusion
Idealab &UR;  &LR;  in Chicago. Five commercials for Michelob and Michelob
Light are also under consideration, all by the Leap Partnership in
Chicago, a unit of the Leap Group.
</P>
<P>
   The final commercial being considered, about the role parents
can play in discouraging underage drinking, is by Kupper Parker
Communications &UR;  &LR;  in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Bud Bowl, the 11th annual edition will be played on a
Web site at www.budbowl.com during half time as part of a national
promotional giveaway of electronics gear.

   MILLER DUMPS DICK &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the Miller Lite review, Susan Henderson, a
spokeswoman for the Miller unit of Philip Morris &UR;  &LR; Cos., said that
the decision to keep Fallon McElligott, the creative agency since
December 1996, came after ``a thorough and disciplined evaluation
concerning the long-term vitality and performance'' of the brand,
which included consumer research.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon McElligott will replace its current campaign for Miller,
centered on unconventional vignettes meant to appeal to consumers
ages 21 to 27, with a revamped effort scheduled to start in early
March. Ms. Henderson declined to discuss how the ads would differ
from the current work, which has been widely castigated for
nontraditional imagery and jokes about the elderly, bodily
functions and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Miller executives had originally supported the campaign, which
was initially focused on an imaginary ad man named Dick. But last
fall, the ads were broadened somewhat and wholesalers were told the
overall approach would be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The other finalists in the review, which continued through
Tuesday with last-minute meetings in New York, were Publicis &AMP; Hal
Riney in San Francisco, a unit of Publicis &UR;  &LR; S.A.; Square One &UR;  &LR;  in
Dallas, and the New York office of Wieden &AMP; Kennedy. Media duties
for all Miller brands are handled by Starcom Media Services, a unit
of the Leo Burnett &UR;  &LR;  Co. in Chicago. &QL;

CLINTON'S U.N. NOMINEE ACCUSED OF ETHICS VIOLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON and DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department has accused Richard
Holbrooke, President Clinton's choice to be the top American
diplomat at the United Nations, of a civil violation of federal
ethics laws involving business contacts three years ago with the
American Embassy in South Korea, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Holbrooke said he had balked at paying a fine of
several thousand dollars demanded by the Justice Department because
he believed he had done nothing wrong. They said he was also
concerned that a financial settlement of the case might be seen as
an admission of wrongdoing that could derail his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department investigation began last year as a result
of allegations that Holbrooke had improperly lobbied officials at
the U.S. Embassy in Hungary in 1995. But officials disclosed
Wednesday that prosecutors had turned up no evidence of wrongdoing
by Holbrooke in that case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors later turned their attention to allegations
involving contacts in 1996 with the embassy in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said those allegations proved to be more
serious. They said that if Holbrooke refused to pay a fine to
settle those charges, the Justice Department would consider filing
a civil lawsuit against the veteran diplomat, delaying his
nomination to the U.N. post indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against Holbrooke involve contacts he had with
at least one former State Department colleague at the embassy in
Korea within months of his resignation from the department in
February 1996 to join the investment banking company Credit Suisse
First Boston in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Holbrooke would not describe the nature of the
contacts with the embassy in Korea but said they were
``ridiculously minor'' and offered no financial reward for
Holbrooke or his employer. Under federal ethics laws, former
government officials are barred from a variety of lobbying contacts
with their former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who is known for his accessibility to reporters, and
his lawyers did not return repeated phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official, speaking on condition that he not
be named, would say only that ``the case is in the process of
negotiation, and the negotiations hinge on a civil penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Justice Department and Credit Suisse First
Boston had no comment Wednesday on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Holbrooke, the architect of the Dayton peace
agreement of 1995 that ended the war in Bosnia, was initially
sidetracked last summer by the anonymous allegations involving the
American Embassy in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently while still employed at the State Department in 1995,
according to the allegations, he illegally contacted the Embassy in
Hungary on behalf of Credit Suisse First Boston. The company had
sought his help in securing a consulting contract with the
Hungarian government.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said none of the the evidence gathered against
Holbrooke by the Justice Department involving his business contacts
in Korea suggested criminal wrongdoing. Instead, they said,
prosecutors believe that the infractions were civil violations of
the law, and that Holbrooke should pay a fine to settle the issue.
</P>
<P>
   One official compared his situation to that of Anthony Lake, the
former national security adviser, who paid $5,000 to the Justice
Department in 1997 to settle a civil inquiry regarding his stock
holdings, an investigation that arose after he had been nominated
by Clinton to become director of central intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke might find the comparison discomforting, since Lake
withdrew his nomination only a few weeks after paying the fine,
which settled allegations that he violated federal ethics laws by
failing to sell energy stocks whose value could have been enhanced
by his decisions as national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Other government officials and friends of Holbrooke said the
comparison with Lake was unfair. While Lake may have withdrawn his
nomination in part because of the dispute over the energy stocks
and the Justice Department investigation, he also faced far more
intense criticism in the Senate over policy decisions made while he
was national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations between the Justice Department and Holbrooke's
lawyers come at an awkward time for Holbrooke, who remains a
special envoy to the White House on the Balkans and who has been
actively involved in shaping an American response to last weekend's
massacre of dozens of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say that despite the Justice
Department investigation, Clinton remained firmly committed to the
nomination of Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's giving up on this,'' said a senior official, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``The multiple crises at the United
Nations recently _ Iraq, the Balkans, Africa _ make clear why we
need someone of Holbrooke's stature and intelligence leading our
delegation at the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   A. Peter Burleigh, a respected career diplomat who holds the
rank of ambassador, has been leading the American delegation in the
interim. He will likely continue in that post for a number of
months. Even if Holbrooke is able to reach a settlement soon with
the Justice Department, his nomination must still be reviewed by
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and confirmed by the full
Senate, which is now consumed with the impeachment trial of
Clinton.

 &HT;    Steel workers protest cheap imports, lack of action by U.S.
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than 80 bus loads of angry Ohio Valley steel
workers spilled out onto the steps of the Capitol on Wednesday to
rally against cheap imported steel that has flooded American
markets and forced layoffs in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Jabbing the chilly air with placards, a mass of men and women
from Steubenville and Weirton, W.Va., protested what they consider
to be the federal government's inaction during this latest steel
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Ten thousand steel workers have lost their jobs in the last
year, and workers for Weirton Steel Corp. said they're expecting
another wave of cuts because Japan, Brazil and Russia have ignored
trade laws and dumped cheap steel in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (another layoff) does come, I'll be gone,'' said Gary
Dennis, a crane operator for Weirton Steel. ``I'm not very far from
the bottom. It gives me a lot of mental stress, the idea of going
to work and wondering whether it's going to be there tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mark Dotson, 33, tomorrow already has come. The plant
electrician has been unemployed since Weirton Steel laid off more
than 800 workers in the first week of November. Dotson held a sign
over his head that said, ``Unemployed Because of Unfair Trade!''
with a series of arrows pointing down at him.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether U.S. officials will quickly enforce existing
trade laws that prohibit dumping large volumes of inexpensive
steel.
</P>
<P>
   The chief offender is Japan, but the United States has been slow
to punish Japan because its economy is in shambles and must recover
if the larger Asian economic crisis is to be resolved, according to
a White House report on steel.
</P>
<P>
   But that report, released earlier this month, seemed only to
have enraged the steel workers at Wednesday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you read it and dissect it, he has done virtually nothing
for the American steel worker,'' said rally speaker Mark Glyptis,
president of the Independent Steelworkers Union at Weirton.
</P>
<P>
   The report outlines a series of efforts by the Clinton
Administration to stem the flow of import steel, but doesn't
specify any direct action against countries that violate existing
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The report says next year's budget will include $50 million to
help laid-off workers and their communities cope with the pain of
global competition.
</P>
<P>
   The workers felt the same way about Tuesday night's State of the
Union address, which included a single sentence on the steel issue.
``I have already informed the government of Japan that if that
nation's sudden surge of steel imports into our country is not
reversed, America will respond,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But for these workers, many of whom live in Steubenville and
cross the state line into Weirton to work, that's not enough. No
talking is enough. When Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-West Virginia) told
the crowd he was threatening to introduce legislation to establish
trade quotas in steel, Dotson had only one reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do it!'' he screamed.

CLINTON LAWYERS CHIP AWAY HOUSE PROSECUTORS' ARGUMENTS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH) 
(bl)  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A White House lawyer Wednesday accused House
prosecutors of resorting to ``word games'' and ``legal
mumbo-jumbo'' in their efforts to prove President Clinton guilty of
impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the charges as ``frivolous,'' often based on
``utterly meaningless'' conflicts in testimony and fundamentally
flawed from a constitutional perspective.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of the president's defense in his Senate
trial, the lawyer, special White House counsel Gregory Craig,
appealed to the senators not to ``throw our politics into the
darkness of endless recrimination'' and not to ``inject a poison of
bitter partisanship into the body politic which, like a virus, can
move through our national bloodstream for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If you convict and remove President Clinton on the
basis of these allegations, no president of the United States will
ever be safe from impeachment again.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig challenged every Republican accusation of perjury, which
forms the basis of the first of two articles of impeachment voted
by the House. Whereas Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, one of the
Republican managers, had urged the Senate to concentrate on ``the
big picture'' and not to lose the forest in the trees, Craig homed
in on the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule of law depends on the details, because it depends on
the facts,'' said another White House lawyer, assistant counsel
Cheryl Mills, who followed him. She began the rebuttal to Article
Two, which charges Clinton with having obstructed justice in an
effort to conceal his illicit sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Before the appearance of Ms. Mills, who is black, all the
arguments in the Senate had been conducted by white men _ two
lawyers for the president, and 13 House managers. She made a
striking presentation, dropping her voice to a melodramatic murmur
as she sought to demolish the case constructed by the managers last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those stubborn facts,'' she said, after describing
discrepancies in the account of presidential actions assembled by
the Republicans. ``They won't go away. They keep pounding, like the
telltale heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In his summing-up, Craig echoed the point made by the White
House counsel, Charles Ruff, in his address to the Senate on
Tuesday, arguing that only the most heinous of crimes could justify
steps ``to undo the result of a national election and remove the
man chosen by the American people to be their president.''
</P>
<P>
   But he went further, suggesting that such a step could be taken
only if the American people approved it, presumably through a
referendum or in a public-opinion survey. The Senate ``dare not''
convict the president, Craig insisted, ``unless the people who
spoke agree that such drastic action is justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Current polls show the American public strongly opposed to the
removal of Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   There was another unusual aspect to the presentation by Craig,
who has known the Clintons since their days together at Yale Law
School. Replying to months of charges that the president and his
lawyers have engaged in hair-splitting and tortured constructions
in an effort to wiggle off the legal hook, he commented:
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that we have relied on overly legal or technical
arguments to defend the president from his attackers, we apologize
to him, to you and to the American public. We do the president no
earthly good if in the course of defending him we offend both the
judges, the jurors and the American public. And Mr. Ruff had it
just right when he expressed his concern to members of the
Judiciary Committee that our irresistible urge to practice our
profession should not get in the way of a just result.''
</P>
<P>
   But allegations of crimes ``invite _ indeed, they call out for _
legal defenses,'' Craig added, and he and his colleagues intended
to use ``all the legal defenses available.''
</P>
<P>
   He himself surely did so. He mounted an across-the-board attack,
with each line of argument ending with the conclusion that no
perjury had been committed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Craig complained that the perjury article was much too loosely
drawn, ``with a stunning lack of specificity'' which had forced
White House lawyers to try to hit ``a moving target.'' It would be
thrown out of any federal court on that ground alone, he contended.
He also said that the House managers had improperly attempted to
revisit the president's statements in his deposition in the Paula
Jones case, even though an article covering that matter had been
rejected by the House.
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected by a vote of 229-205 the article dealing with
alleged perjury in the president's Jan. 17 Jones deposition. But
the House managers have included in their allegation that Clinton
committed perjury in testifying to the Lewinsky grand jury in
August a charge that he had lied when he said he sought to tell the
truth in the deposition. This is a technique known in legal circles
as ``bootstrapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff and Craig said that should not be permitted, but McCollum
argued last week that the House rejection of the Jones article
``does not keep you from considering the lies in that deposition.''
He went on to list many questionable statements made by the
president, notably his statements that he could not remember if he
had ever been alone with Ms. Lewinsky or exchanged gifts with her.
He testified much more truthfully on those matters before the grand
jury six months later.
</P>
<P>
   Craig made much of the fact that many of the charges voiced by
the House managers had not been included in the referral by the
special prosecutor, Kenneth W. Starr. And he made extensive use of
videotapes of testimony before the Judiciary Committee by two
former federal prosecutors _ Thomas Sullivan, a former U.S.
attorney in Illinois, and Richard Davis, formerly a prosecutor at
the Justice Department and Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   Both said that perjury prosecutions require two witnesses or
substantial corroborating evidence _ not, as in this case, evidence
from friends of Ms. Lewinsky who said she told them the same story
at the time as she later told government investigators.
</P>
<P>
   That point had particular relevance, Craig said, to one of the
conflicts in testimony on which the managers ``place great emphasis
and weight'' _ the disagreement between Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton as
to whether he touched her breasts and genitalia during their sexual
encounters. The counsel described it as ``a classic, oath-on-oath,
`he says, she says''' matter.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Clinton might be removed from office over
such a narrow disparity _ that his fate ``might hinge on whether
you believe him or her'' _ struck him as ``a staggering thought,''
Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the president himself, Craig insisted that Clinton had
never lied to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with Clinton's evasive behavior before the grand jury,
including his famous statement, ``It depends on what the meaning of
`is' is,'' the counsel said: ``The president makes a political
mistake here and gives in to his instinct to play his own lawyer,
to be his own advocate. You may find it frustrating, you may find
it irritating when you watched him do this. But he is not
committing perjury. He is committing the offense of nitpicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills' brief was narrower. She focused on two charges of
obstruction of justice, both dealing with Clinton's secretary,
Betty Currie. And she rebutted both of them in fairly short order.
</P>
<P>
   The first involves the box of gifts from the president that Mrs.
Currie hid under her bed for Ms. Lewinsky, and turns on the
question of who asked Ms. Lewinsky to give them to Ms. Currie. The
Republicans say it was Mrs. Currie, acting on the president's
suggestion, relying heavily on Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that the
president had told her he would think about what she should do with
the gifts and surmising that he had decided they must be hidden.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Mills brought out the fact that in only one of 10
accounts did Ms. Lewinsky quote the president as saying he would
think about the hiding plan or anything of the sort. The managers
had not cited the other nine versions, she argued, ``because they
weaken an already fragile circumstantial case.'' In fact, Mrs.
Currie testified five times that the whole thing was Ms. Lewinsky's
idea, Ms. Mills continued, and Mrs. Currie agreed ``because she's a
friend, and that's not obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The other incident was Clinton's discussion with Mrs. Currie in
which he seemed to some to be coaching her, seeking her agreement
to untrue statements, such as ``Monica came on to me and I never
touched her _ right?'' The Republicans said the president, who had
earlier said Mrs. Currie would be the ideal witness on some
important points, was trying to corrupt her eventual testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But after a quick review of the obstruction statutes, Ms. Mills
noted that Mrs. Currie had testified that she had felt neither
pressured nor intimidated by the president, her boss, during the
series of exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence whatsoever of any kind of threat or
intimidation,'' Ms. Mills said. ``And as we discussed, the U.S.
attorney's manual indicates that without a threat or intimidation,
there is no corrupt influence. Without corrupt influence there is
no obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills concluded with a spirited rebuttal to the idea that
Clinton had tried to deny a woman, Ms. Jones, her lawful civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about civil rights,'' she told the Senate,
``because this president's record on civil rights, on women's
rights, on all of our rights, in unimpeachable.''

CLINTON LAWYERS CHIP AWAY HOUSE PROSECUTORS' ARGUMENTS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH) 
(bl)  
By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A White House lawyer Wednesday accused House
prosecutors of resorting to ``word games'' and ``legal
mumbo-jumbo'' in their efforts to prove President Clinton guilty of
impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the charges as ``frivolous,'' often based on
``utterly meaningless'' conflicts in testimony and fundamentally
flawed from a constitutional perspective.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of the president's defense in his Senate
trial, the lawyer, special White House counsel Gregory Craig,
appealed to the senators not to ``throw our politics into the
darkness of endless recrimination'' and not to ``inject a poison of
bitter partisanship into the body politic which, like a virus, can
move through our national bloodstream for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If you convict and remove President Clinton on the
basis of these allegations, no president of the United States will
ever be safe from impeachment again.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig challenged every Republican accusation of perjury, which
forms the basis of the first of two articles of impeachment voted
by the House. Whereas Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, one of the
Republican managers, had urged the Senate to concentrate on ``the
big picture'' and not to lose the forest in the trees, Craig homed
in on the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule of law depends on the details, because it depends on
the facts,'' said another White House lawyer, assistant counsel
Cheryl Mills, who followed him. She began the rebuttal to Article
Two, which charges Clinton with having obstructed justice in an
effort to conceal his illicit sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Before the appearance of Ms. Mills, who is black, all the
arguments in the Senate had been conducted by white men _ two
lawyers for the president, and 13 House managers. She made a
striking presentation, dropping her voice to a melodramatic murmur
as she sought to demolish the case constructed by the managers last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those stubborn facts,'' she said, after describing
discrepancies in the account of presidential actions assembled by
the Republicans. ``They won't go away. They keep pounding, like the
telltale heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In his summing-up, Craig echoed the point made by the White
House counsel, Charles Ruff, in his address to the Senate on
Tuesday, arguing that only the most heinous of crimes could justify
steps ``to undo the result of a national election and remove the
man chosen by the American people to be their president.''
</P>
<P>
   But he went further, suggesting that such a step could be taken
only if the American people approved it, presumably through a
referendum or in a public-opinion survey. The Senate ``dare not''
convict the president, Craig insisted, ``unless the people who
spoke agree that such drastic action is justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Current polls show the American public strongly opposed to the
removal of Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   There was another unusual aspect to the presentation by Craig,
who has known the Clintons since their days together at Yale Law
School. Replying to months of charges that the president and his
lawyers have engaged in hair-splitting and tortured constructions
in an effort to wiggle off the legal hook, he commented:
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that we have relied on overly legal or technical
arguments to defend the president from his attackers, we apologize
to him, to you and to the American public. We do the president no
earthly good if in the course of defending him we offend both the
judges, the jurors and the American public. And Mr. Ruff had it
just right when he expressed his concern to members of the
Judiciary Committee that our irresistible urge to practice our
profession should not get in the way of a just result.''
</P>
<P>
   But allegations of crimes ``invite _ indeed, they call out for _
legal defenses,'' Craig added, and he and his colleagues intended
to use ``all the legal defenses available.''
</P>
<P>
   He himself surely did so. He mounted an across-the-board attack,
with each line of argument ending with the conclusion that no
perjury had been committed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Craig complained that the perjury article was much too loosely
drawn, ``with a stunning lack of specificity'' which had forced
White House lawyers to try to hit ``a moving target.'' It would be
thrown out of any federal court on that ground alone, he contended.
He also said that the House managers had improperly attempted to
revisit the president's statements in his deposition in the Paula
Jones case, even though an article covering that matter had been
rejected by the House.
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected by a vote of 229-205 the article dealing with
alleged perjury in the president's Jan. 17 Jones deposition. But
the House managers have included in their allegation that Clinton
committed perjury in testifying to the Lewinsky grand jury in
August a charge that he had lied when he said he sought to tell the
truth in the deposition. This is a technique known in legal circles
as ``bootstrapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff and Craig said that should not be permitted, but McCollum
argued last week that the House rejection of the Jones article
``does not keep you from considering the lies in that deposition.''
He went on to list many questionable statements made by the
president, notably his statements that he could not remember if he
had ever been alone with Ms. Lewinsky or exchanged gifts with her.
He testified much more truthfully on those matters before the grand
jury six months later.
</P>
<P>
   Craig made much of the fact that many of the charges voiced by
the House managers had not been included in the referral by the
special prosecutor, Kenneth W. Starr. And he made extensive use of
videotapes of testimony before the Judiciary Committee by two
former federal prosecutors _ Thomas Sullivan, a former U.S.
attorney in Illinois, and Richard Davis, formerly a prosecutor at
the Justice Department and Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   Both said that perjury prosecutions require two witnesses or
substantial corroborating evidence _ not, as in this case, evidence
from friends of Ms. Lewinsky who said she told them the same story
at the time as she later told government investigators.
</P>
<P>
   That point had particular relevance, Craig said, to one of the
conflicts in testimony on which the managers ``place great emphasis
and weight'' _ the disagreement between Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton as
to whether he touched her breasts and genitalia during their sexual
encounters. The counsel described it as ``a classic, oath-on-oath,
`he says, she says''' matter.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Clinton might be removed from office over
such a narrow disparity _ that his fate ``might hinge on whether
you believe him or her'' _ struck him as ``a staggering thought,''
Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the president himself, Craig insisted that Clinton had
never lied to the grand jury.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ President Clinton took the blueprint for the remainder
of his term on the road Wednesday and got a thunderous expression
of heartland support from the Democratic faithful in this working
class town near the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   As his lawyers rolled out day two of his defense in the Senate
impeachment trial, Clinton fled Washington for the snow-covered
fields and factories of western New York and eastern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches in both places, Clinton asked Americans of all ages
to get behind his plan to invest $4 trillion over the next 15 years
preparing for an aging population. He took aim at Republican plans
to use much of the money for an across-the-board income tax cut,
saying the country needs to harness its current prosperity to
confront future challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot afford to squander this moment,'' Clinton told some
21,000 supporters gathered at the Marine Midland Arena, home of the
Buffalo Sabres hockey team. ''We have to make the most of it. We
have to look at the long-term challenges facing America.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, addressing some 3,500 students, teachers and parents at
the Norristown Area High School in eastern Pennsylvania, Clinton
charged grown ups in the audience to look at the young people
present, ''and ask yourself, 'Do you really want to run the risk of
squandering this surplus?'''
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday,
Clinton called for investing $2.7 trillion over the coming 15 years
to shore up the financially-ailing Social Security program, which
provides retirement benefits to one American in every six; some
$600 billion to help bolster Medicare, the federal health care
program for retirees; and another $500 billion to set up subsidized
savings accounts for lower-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Those proposals, Clinton said, could be paid for out of federal
budget surpluses projected to top $4 trillion over the coming
decade and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans regard the surplus as indicative of
over-taxation, not an opportunity to increase spending. They called
for a 10 percent cut in income taxes, an idea Clinton assailed on
Wednesday in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have a big argument about this...and I hope it
will be a good debate,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned his supporters, however, against being tempted by
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I said last night is not as popular as what others can
tell you,'' Clinton said. ''Others can say 'We've got this surplus
now; I just want a big tax cut; I'll give it back to you, you'll
figure out what to do with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   He further admonished his backers to gird themselves for
arguments against government spending, saying his plan is to set
aside the projected surplus to deal with the aging of America, a
demographic shift that will begin to kick in 15 years from now,
when baby boomers begin to retire en masse.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to have everybody say that government doesn't
know how to spend this money,'' Clinton warned. ''Look folks,
Social Security and Medicare work. I'm not talking about spending
this money, I'm talking about saving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President
Al Gore and his wife Tipper, the president was greeted by
thunderous applause from the largest crowd he's addressed since his
post State of the Union speech a year ago in La Crosse, Wisc.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was more campaign rally than policy discussion, with
handmade posters endorsing Gore in 2000, and one calling on Mrs.
Clinton to seek office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary for New York Senator,'' read one sign. Clinton
directed his wife's attention to it, and she smiled broadly.
</P>
<P>
   She has not commented publicly on speculation over whether she
would run for the seat to be vacated in two years by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. She looked positively like candidate
material, though, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't _ I don't care what the weather forecasters say _
any warmer place in the United States,'' Mrs. Clinton told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   After speeches by both Gores and both Clintons, all four shook
hands. At one point, Mrs. Clinton was handed a bouquet of fresh
roses and mums by 8-year-old Peter Narby, a third-grader from a
Buffalo suburb. Appearing genuinely moved, Mrs. Clinton leaned over
a crowd-control rail and kissed the boy on the cheek, then told
autograph seekers to ''write me at the White House and I'll write
you back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was clearly energized by the response.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank you for one of the great days of my presidency,'' he
said, as his lawyers _ hundreds of miles away _ argued before the
Senate to save his office.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, though, Clinton's backers were clear about their
views on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to tell those people that the people down in the
heartland don't want the president impeached,'' said Brian Grassia,
owner of Evergreen Construction, a home remodeling and repair
business in nearby Amherst, N.Y. ''That's pretty obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoed Darlene Boykins, a Buffalo mental health therapy
assistant: ''He's done a good job, leave him alone. His private
life is his private life. That don't have anything to do with us.''

WASHINGTON: grand jury. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dealing with Clinton's evasive behavior before the grand jury,
including his famous statement, ``It depends on what the meaning of
`is' is,'' the counsel said: ``The president makes a political
mistake here and gives in to his instinct to play his own lawyer,
to be his own advocate. You may find it frustrating, you may find
it irritating when you watched him do this. But he is not
committing perjury. He is committing the offense of nitpicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills' brief was narrower. She focused on two charges of
obstruction of justice, both dealing with Clinton's secretary,
Betty Currie. And she rebutted both of them in fairly short order.
</P>
<P>
   The first involves the box of gifts from the president that Mrs.
Currie hid under her bed for Ms. Lewinsky, and turns on the
question of who asked Ms. Lewinsky to give them to Ms. Currie. The
Republicans say it was Mrs. Currie, acting on the president's
suggestion, relying heavily on Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that the
president had told her he would think about what she should do with
the gifts and surmising that he had decided they must be hidden.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Mills brought out the fact that in only one of 10
accounts did Ms. Lewinsky quote the president as saying he would
think about the hiding plan or anything of the sort. The managers
had not cited the other nine versions, she argued, ``because they
weaken an already fragile circumstantial case.'' In fact, Mrs.
Currie testified five times that the whole thing was Ms. Lewinsky's
idea, Ms. Mills continued, and Mrs. Currie agreed ``because she's a
friend, and that's not obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The other incident was Clinton's discussion with Mrs. Currie in
which he seemed to some to be coaching her, seeking her agreement
to untrue statements, such as ``Monica came on to me and I never
touched her _ right?'' The Republicans said the president, who had
earlier said Mrs. Currie would be the ideal witness on some
important points, was trying to corrupt her eventual testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But after a quick review of the obstruction statutes, Ms. Mills
noted that Mrs. Currie had testified that she had felt neither
pressured nor intimidated by the president, her boss, during the
series of exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence whatsoever of any kind of threat or
intimidation,'' Ms. Mills said. ``And as we discussed, the U.S.
attorney's manual indicates that without a threat or intimidation,
there is no corrupt influence. Without corrupt influence there is
no obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills concluded with a spirited rebuttal to the idea that
Clinton had tried to deny a woman, Ms. Jones, her lawful civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about civil rights,'' she told the Senate,
``because this president's record on civil rights, on women's
rights, on all of our rights, in unimpeachable.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Judith Silberpfennig Kestenberg, a psychoanalyst
specializing in child development and the emotional state of
Holocaust survivors and their children, died Saturday at her home
in Sands Point, N.Y. She was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Kestenberg headed Child Development Research, which she founded
30 years ago, and Holocaust Child Survivor Studies, both based in
Sands Point. With her husband, Milton, she started the research
center's International Study of the Organized Persecution of
Children.
</P>
<P>
   She and her associates traveled all over the world to collect
taped interviews with more than 1,500 child survivors of the
Holocaust and their children, as well as the children of Nazis.
Fluent in French, German and Polish, she wrote two German books
used to teach German children about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Silberpfennig was born in Tarnov, Poland, and trained in
medicine, neurology and psychiatry in Vienna. She came to New York
in 1937 and completed her training at Bellevue Hospital and the New
York Psychological Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband was born in Lodz, Poland, and became a lawyer there
before coming to the United States in 1939. He managed real estate
in New York and, after World War II, sued in German courts to seek
compensation for Holocaust victims and also organized aid for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   They were married in the mid-1940s and became a team in their
Holocaust pursuits when he started representing the victims,
especially children, before the courts and found that many of them
had only vague memories of their ordeals.
</P>
<P>
   Kestenberg, a professor emeritus at New York University Medical
School, taught generations of psychiatrists, psychologists,
psychoanalysts and other experts on development, mental health and
dance-movement therapy. She also was on the staff and faculty at
Long Island Jewish Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She published seven books and some 150 professional articles.
Most recently she edited, with Dr. Charlotte Kahn, ``Children
Surviving Persecution: An International Study of Trauma and
Healing'' (Greenwood, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Her other books in print include ``Sexuality, Body Movement and
the Rhythms of Development'' (Aronson, 1995); with Dr. Ira Brenner,
``The Last Witness: The Child Survivor of the Holocaust'' (American
Psychiatric Press, 1996), and, as editor with Dr. Eva Fogelman,
``Children During the Nazi Reign: Psychological Perspective on the
Interview Process'' (Greenwood, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Milton Kestenberg died in 1991. Mrs. Kestenberg is survived by a
son, Howard, of Foxborough, Mass.; a daughter, Janet Kestenberg of
West Chester, Pa., and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Her work at Child Development Research is being continued by Dr.
Fogelman and associates.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Not so long ago, Chicago's public schools were
considered the worst in the United States. But in Tuesday's State
of the Union message, President Clinton held them up as a model.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Clinton singled out the school system's
elimination of social promotion, the practice of promoting students
even if they do not meet their grade's academic standards, just so
they can stay with their age group. He praised Chicago's decision
three years ago to force students who do not have basic math and
English skills to attend summer school _ and to make them repeat a
grade if they do no better by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed to suggest that these policies accounted for the
fact that student test scores in the Chicago school system have
been rising for the last three years. But, as with most issues in
education, the reality is more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's ending of social promotion is only one part of a major
overhaul of the country's third-largest school system, something
the city has been able to accomplish largely because the state
Legislature in 1995 gave Mayor Richard M. Daley extensive control
over the schools.
</P>
<P>
   He appointed his budget director, Paul Vallas, as the school
system's new chief executive officer, and Vallas set about trying
to make the public schools work with the efficacy of a business.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Vallas and a school board, also appointed by
the mayor, have revamped the school system's budget, removed
principals from some failing schools, and put more resources into
programs like early childhood education. More than 100 schools were
put on academic probation and told to improve; now only 58 remain
on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Vallas, a former teacher, believes the elimination of social
promotion is another important part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social promotion kills an educational system,'' he said.
``When we came in, 9,700 of the previous year's 27,000 graduates
were reading at sixth-grade level or below. If you're a teacher,
what are you to do? You have to lower your standards. You have to
dummy down the curriculum. The children who are behind never get
caught up. The children at grade level get taught to inferior
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as other cities follow Chicago's example, experts say it is
still too early to rate the effectiveness of the policy against
social promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Begun with just eighth-graders in 1996, it now applies to
third-, sixth- and ninth-graders as well. If students do not score
above a cutoff on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills or, in ninth grade,
if they fail subjects like math and reading, they are required to
go to summer school. If they still don't pass, they must repeat the
grade and receive at least an hour of extra instruction each day.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of the students in these grades were required to
attend summer school last year _ about the same percentage as in
previous years. The results were not entirely encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10,000 third-graders who attended mandatory summer
school, 5,500 are now repeating third grade, said Blondean Davis,
the school system's chief of operations. Of those, 964 are
repeating third grade for a second time.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth and eighth grades, the results were a little
better, with just under 40 percent of the mandatory summer-school
students held back a grade. Davis said the eighth-grade results
were not quite as disappointing, however, because eighth-graders
had a higher minimum test score to shoot for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``the hopes have been that far larger numbers of kids
going through the summer school would move from scores that weren't
adequate up to the promotion level,'' said Alfred Hess, director of
the Center for Urban School Policy at Northwestern University. He
said that while the program seemed to have helped many students,
``larger proportions than any of us had hoped have not made it to
that level.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hess said it was not yet clear whether the policy had yielded
another hoped-for benefit: that the threat of going to summer
classes and being held back would force students to take school
more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago policy has its critics. ``It's a grossly
unsuccessful policy,'' said Suzanne Davenport, the acting executive
director of Designs for Change, a school reform, research and
advocacy organization in Chicago. ``Of all the things to quote
about improvements in the Chicago school system, this is not what
we would pick out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davenport said her organization does not advocate social
promotion. But she said some studies show that holding students
back a grade does not help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if kids show any short-term gains, they don't last very
long,'' she said. ``And secondly, students are much more likely to
drop out if they are held back.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, she said, was dramatically improving other aspects
of the schools _ curriculum, teaching, class size. Struggling
students should be promoted, she said, but given extra help in
their new grade.
</P>
<P>
   At one Chicago school on Wednesday, teachers said they supported
mandatory summer school and the end of social promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of older kids see retention as a reality, all of a
sudden, and it has lit a fire under a lot of them,'' said Julie
Hines, a computer teacher at Louis J. Agassiz Elementary School on
the city's North Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it took a lot of courage to do such a thing, but the
alternative is awful,'' said James Starzynksi, a reading specialist
and curriculum coordinator at the school. ``You can't have 16-,
17-, 18-year-old social and economic liabilities walking around the
streets of Chicago.''

   When President Clinton announced on Tuesday that the government
planned to sue cigarette makers, he shocked not only tobacco
producers but also some Justice Department officials as well as
outside lawyers who had been lobbying the government to bring such
a suit.
</P>
<P>
   Only last Thursday, Justice Department officials met with
several plaintiffs' lawyers and law professors who had been
involved in the state lawsuits against cigarette makers that ended
in settlements costing the industry $246 billion over the next 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, the lawyers and professors gave department
lawyers a 100-page document outlining the legal strategies that the
government could use to sue the industry for the recovery of
federal funds spent treating smoking-related ills.
</P>
<P>
   But participants at the meeting said in interviews on Wednesday
that Justice Department officials were undecided about what
specific legal course to pursue. Many had been caught off-guard by
the president's announcement in his State of the Union Message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was caught by surprise,'' said Richard Scruggs, a
plaintiffs' lawyer from Pascagoula, Miss., who had been meeting
with federal officials for six months in an effort to persuade them
to sue cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   The filing of a federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry is
not likely to come for months. Lawyers involved in the effort said
its aim would be to win concessions not included in the recent
settlements between the tobacco industry and the states. Those
would include measures like federal regulation of nicotine,
cigarettes' addictive component, by the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision by the administration to pursue the tobacco
industry in the courtroom comes after months of long and
contentious debate within the Justice Department over the wisdom of
such a suit and its legal prospects. Even on Wednesday, some
government lawyers expressed anger that the president would
announced a lawsuit well in advance of its filing.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce N. Reed, Clinton's chief domestic policy adviser, said he
believed the disclosure was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case of this scale where you are assembling a team of top
lawyers to take on a formidable industry it would be impossible to
wait until the minute you are filing to make such an
announcement,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Justice Department officials had considered
the possibility of suing cigarette makers to recoup federal health
care funds. But they had also been long concerned that federal law
did not give them the clear authority to do so.

THE PROFUSION OF TEJANO STYLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tejano music can mean just about anything and incorporate a wide
range of styles (from country to old Mexican ballads to jazz to
pop), as long as it's from Texas or by Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Tejano, anything is fair game,'' says J.B. Hernandez, who
produces a national radio show on the music from his home in San
Antonio and also helps produce the annual Tejano Music Awards.
``You can use any instrument. Basically, if it comes out of Texas,
it's Tejano, it's taken that name. And once it crosses the border
of Mexico, it's called Tex-Mex.''
</P>
<P>
   Confusing? Only a little. Hernandez and Marcelo Tafoya,
president of the Tejano Artist Music Museum in Austin, define
Mexican and Mexican-American music:
</P>
<P>
   Conjunto: Tejano roots music, produced primarily for a dance
audience. Based around four instruments: accordion, drums, ``bajo
sexto'' (12-string guitar) and bass, often with vocals. Progressive
conjunto uses accordion, but many groups feature keyboards and more
percussion. Ruben Naranjo and Jaime y los Chamacos do conjunto.
</P>
<P>
   Corridos: Mexican ballads, story-songs that can be about anyone
from Pancho Villa to local heroes or villains to musicians.
Currently popular are ``narco-corridos,'' stories about the
derring-do of cocaine dealers along the Mexican-American border.
</P>
<P>
   Norteno: A style of dance music from the northern part of
Mexico. It is more basic, with fewer chords. ``The arrangements are
more classical Mexican _ not too jazzy or progressive,'' Hernandez
says. Traditional norteno has no saxophone; conjunto norteno does
have sax, usually an alto. Ramon Ayala is a well-known norteno
singer and band leader.
</P>
<P>
   Cumbia: A more Latin form of the music, with elements of Cuban,
Puerto Rican and norteno rhythms and more percussion, such as
congas, cowbells and timbales. The lead instrument is usually
accordion or keyboard. And the arrangements are more modern and
progressive. Los Chamacos is a well-known cumbia band.
</P>
<P>
   Mariachi: A type of music that combines guitars, trumpets and
violin. According to William Gradante, who teaches mariachi at Fort
Worth's North Side Senior High School, the music began in
southwestern Mexico in the mid-1800s with harp, guitar, violin and
``vihuela,'' a precursor to the guitar. The large bands are often
dressed in black ``charro'' outfits. Mariachi is very popular at
weddings and other social functions.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchera: Of all the types of Tejano, this is the closest to
country music. One style of it is closer to a two-step, another is
closer to a waltz. Jody Farias and Increible are noted ranchera
acts.
</P>
<P>
   Polka: An instrumental with a ranchera beat, with a keyboard,
accordion or wind instrument, such as a saxophone or trumpet,
taking the lead. Ramon Ayala does some polkas, as does Jaime y los
Chamacos.
</P>
<P>
   La onda Tejana: The ``new wave'' of Tejano that began in the
late '50s. The music is smooth, reminiscent of the orchestras of
Guy Lombardo, and features a small orchestra of six or more
members. There is always saxophone and trumpet and most often
electric bass, guitar and keyboards but never accordion, according
to Tafoya. Leyendas y Raices, a Grammy-nominated supergroup of
veterans that includes Freddie Martinez, Carlos Guzman, Sunny Ozuna
and Augustine Ramirez, performs in this style.

PLOT TO BOMB U.S. CONSULATES IN INDIA IS ALLEGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The police here say they have foiled a plot
to bomb U.S. Consulates in Madras and Calcutta, with the arrest of
a Bangladeshi man and three men the police say were his
accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   A team of U.S. counter-terrorism experts arrived here Tuesday to
further investigate the case, a spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy
said Wednesday. Officials from the embassy have interviewed the
suspect, Sayed Abu Nasir, 27, who has been in Indian custody for
more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   No information was available on the other three men, Mohammed
Gulab, Mohammed Nawab and Aga Khan, who were arrested in connection
with the case in Siliguri in the Indian state of West Bengal on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're working with the police and we take it very
seriously,'' Donna Roginski, the embassy spokeswoman, said. ``How
credible it is _ that's all being looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said Wednesday at a
briefing: ``We obviously regard with grave concern, and take very
seriously, any threats to our personnel, both American and Indian.
With respect to the question of involvement of other intelligence
services, Indian authorities are continuing their investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian police did not make clear who it was they thought
might be behind any plots against U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials in Washington, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that the reports from India
were overblown.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence officials also made clear that despite some
press reports, there had been no threat to the U.S. Embassy in New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi police said they arrested Nasir on Jan. 7 at the New
Delhi railway station and charged him with waging war on India, an
offense punishable by life in prison or death. He was carrying more
than 4 pounds of RDX, an explosive, and five detonators, according
to the police.
</P>
<P>
   The police said he had other accomplices who remain at large,
four from Egypt, two from Sudan and one from Myanmar, formerly
Burma.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Nasir and his accomplices crossed the porous
border between Bangladesh and West Bengal last October and
subsequently traveled to Madras and Calcutta to survey the U.S.
Consulates there for possible openings for an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The police reported that Nasir offered them one particularly
tantalizing, though inconclusive, tidbit during his interrogation:
He said that he met Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. authorities have
blamed for the bombings of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, in
1995 at a terrorist training camp in Kunar, Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. intelligence officials said that there was no known
link between the arrested suspects and the bin Laden group.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that Nasir told them he had been associated with
organizations that proved to be involved in supporting terrorism.
He said that when he was in Afghanistan he was picked out by
Pakistani intelligence officials to be their agent, the Indian
police said.
</P>
<P>
   In Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, Zameer Akram, the senior
Foreign Ministry official for south Asia, told The Associated Press
that ``Indian authorities have not informed us about any arrests
and we don't have any information about the case.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pakistani diplomat in New York, speaking on condition of
anonymity, added, ``If this is a week old, why has the Pakistani
government not been informed?''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin of the State Department said, ``We have no knowledge of
the alleged involvement of Pakistan, and I don't care to speculate
on the various motives of an event that is being investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Nasir's account, late last year he and several
other men were sent across the Bangladeshi border into West Bengal
with the intention of blowing up the U.S. Consulates in Calcutta
and Madras.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian police did not make clear who sent the men or what
group they were working for. Nasir said he did not know why those
particular targets were chosen. The men spent a month in Calcutta
and then went on to Madras, but never carried out their plan, the
Indian police said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that while the other men stayed in Madras, Nasir
came to New Delhi with the intention of setting off some explosions
in public places but was arrested after he received explosives at
the railway station here.

 UNDATED: do so.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the issue was revived again by Scruggs and others after the
collapse last spring of a $516 billion Senate bill that would have
regulated nicotine and sharply increased the price of a pack of
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, tobacco litigation split in two directions. State
officials completed a round of settlements under which tobacco
producers agreed to pay out $246 billion over 25 years to resolve
lawsuits brought by a number of states to recover Medicaid expenses
spent treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The legal underpinnings of those lawsuits were never tested in
court. But the question still remained as to whether successful
claims could be brought to recover similar federal funds expended
by Medicare, the health care program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official, who spoke only on the
condition of not being identified, said that as part of the latest
plan, the White House and the Justice Department are considering
introducing new tobacco-liability legislation because of legal
impediments that make it difficult to beat the tobacco companies in
court.
</P>
<P>
   One major difficulty is a 1947 landmark decision by the Supreme
Court that sharply limits the ability of the federal government to
recover funds from any individuals or companies absent explicit
statutory authority.
</P>
<P>
   As a result Justice Department officials, when approached last
spring by Scruggs and others, were leery about the prospects of
taking on tobacco producers. Still, a round of discussions ensued
and advocates of such an action as a means of bringing added
pressure on the industry began to make headway
</P>
<P>
   In time, Justice Department officials also began to reach out
and seek the advice of plaintiffs' lawyers and law professors
involved in tobacco lawsuits filed by the states. Included in the
group were Lawrence Tribe, a law professor at Harvard University,
G. Robert Blakey, a law professor at Notre Dame University, and
Einer Elhauge, another Harvard University law professor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other plaintiffs' lawyers who worked for the
states also began promoting the idea with Justice Department
officials. Included among them were Fred Levin, a Florida lawyer
who helped that state's Medicaid lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, the White House official, also said he believed that
Justice Department officials contacted Michael Ciresi, a
Minneapolis lawyer who worked for Minnesota in its tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the months of sporadic talks that followed, the Justice
Department began to slowly shift ground from concerns about
bringing a suit to increasing consideration of the issue, said
participants in those talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several months ago, my sense is that they had grave doubts,''
said one lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``But
they had not done a lot of analysis. Eventually, the doubt was not
about whether to bring the lawsuit but the best way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, the White House official, said it was in December that
Attorney General Janet Reno made the decision to sue tobacco
producers. She communicated that decision at the time to him, Reed
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have kept this a secret if we had told everyone,''
Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   As for tobacco producers, an industry spokesman reiterated on
Wednesday that cigarette makers believed that Clinton's
announcement of the new lawsuit was a self-serving political
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a blatantly political move,'' said Scott Williams, the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The producers involved in the recent round of state lawsuit
settlements are the Philip Morris Cos.,; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a
subsidiary of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.; Lorillard Tobacco, a
subsidiary of the Loews Corp., and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a
subsidiary of BAT Industries.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Walt Disney Co. may build a theme park in
China, but it's likely that at least a decade will pass before the
entertainment giant breaks ground in the world's most populous
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Disney and the Hong Kong government reportedly are near a
preliminary agreement to build an attraction that would open as
early as 2004, according to Bloomberg News, which cited an unnamed
person familiar with the discussions. Analysts believe talks
between the government and the suburban Burbank-based entertainment
giant have probably taken place but were dubious about the
timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is certainly a rich and fertile market, but it won't be
ready for a Disney theme park for another 10 years,'' said Dennis
Speigel, head of Cincinnati-based International Theme Park
Services.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant, who has been active in advising Chinese park
operators over the past decade, said China's economy isn't healthy
enough yet to justify a large-scale theme park. ``Everyone in the
world wants to have fun, but they have to be able to afford it,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Recent comments by Disney Chairman Michael Eisner undoubtedly
heated up rumors. ``I am completely confident that the Chinese
people would love Mickey no less than a Big Mac,'' he said in his
annual letter to shareholders. ``As evidenced by the popularity of
McDonald's, we could be getting close to the time for a major
Disney attraction in the world's most populous nation.''
</P>
<P>
   If Disney goes forward with a Hong Kong attraction, the theme
park would be its third in Asia: Tokyo Disneyland opened 16 years
ago, and Tokyo DisneySea is due to open in 2001. But Speigel warned
that many Hong Kong tourists are unlikely to visit theme parks
during their stays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong tourism is largely focused on the business
community, where people are in for a day of meetings and out the
next day,'' he added. ``It's a different mentality than in Tokyo.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg reported Disney could reach a deal within three
months. The Hong Kong Daily News said the park will open in early
2004 in Tolo Harbor, in the suburban New Territories, and will
provide 12,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Tom Deegan called the reports speculation and
cited Disney's policy of not commenting on rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Linda Bannister of Edward Jones &AMP; Co., who met this week
with Disney executives, said Disney would probably wait eight to 10
years before opening a Chinese theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal could be hampered by the high cost of land in Hong
Kong, she added, so Disney may opt for a scaled-down ``regional''
facility that could include attractions like Club Disney and
DisneyQuest indoor parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are definitely interested in that market, and there's a
huge opportunity in that part of the world, but I don't think
they're jumping in with both feet,'' Bannister said. ``You're
likely to see gradual introduction of Disney products.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that Disney is unlikely to own a Chinese theme park
outright, but rather would operate it as a joint venture or under a
licensing agreement that would pay it royalties. ``Disney's great
with Imagineering, but if they find a local partner who understands
the culture, they're probably a lot better off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's theme-park business has been a solid performer for the
past decade, with Eisner pushing expansion through new projects
such as the $1 billion Animal Kingdom, which opened last spring in
Florida. Speigel believes Disney's discussions about Hong Kong are
designed both to lay the future groundwork for a project and to
dissuade rivals from entering the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is doing the exploration we all do in this business,''
he said. ``I think they're running the flag up the pole to keep out
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe Disney's efforts to expand into China were hurt
by its 1997 film ``Kundun,'' which focused on China's occupation of
Tibet. Last summer's release of ``Mulan,'' in which a young Chinese
woman helps turn away Mongol invaders, probably eased those
tensions.

ADDRESSING SENATORS, EX-PRESIDENT BUSH LAMENTS LOSS OF CIVILITY IN
POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Texas)  (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-TRIAL, IMPEACH-SCENE) 
 (bl) 
By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Addressing scores of senators who had just finished
another long afternoon at President Clinton's impeachment trial,
former President George Bush warned of the collapse of decorum in
political debate and an ``excessive intrusion into private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to say whether he believed that Clinton's
impeachment was warranted and what the president's fate should be.
He has long been reticent to bring up the issue while his son,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, considers a bid for the 2000 Republican
presidential nomination. The younger Bush has expressed concern
about invasion of privacy as it affects political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But his father's words, rendered in a grave voice, seemed to
signal a degree of sympathy for Clinton and a desire for senators
to move the country past this tense, uncertain moment as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confess that the lack of civility in our political debate
and official dealings with one another concerns me,'' said the 41st
president, who spoke in the Old Senate chamber as part of a lecture
series for senators. ``I worry, too, about sleaze _ about excessive
intrusion into private lives. I worry that once-great news
organizations resort to tabloid journalism, giving us
sensationalism at best, smut at worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all,'' he continued, ``it seems to me that, whereas the
problems looming over this town dealt more with budget deficits in
times past, today we are confronted with a deficit of decency, one
that deepens by the day.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who began the
lecture series last spring, said that the date for Bush's speech
had been set several months ago and that its timing in the middle
of the impeachment trial was coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-hour speech that constituted an extended political
reminiscence, Bush kept circling back to the observation that
Washington was a more civil place, and the political parties worked
together more harmoniously, when he was vice president from 1981 to
1989 and president from 1989 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democratic senators had different
interpretations of Bush's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said, ``He was trying to say to us,
`Calm down. You are the repository of deliberative thought.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said that Bush's appeal was the
kind almost any former politician, once removed from the fray,
tended to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they've lived through the process, they take a longer
view of things,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made a point in his speech of saying that the best
accomplishments of his administration were bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a certain civility, a certain honor, less rancor,''
he said, recalling his days in office. ``I wouldn't say kinder and
gentler, but, then again, maybe I would.''

MURDOCK OUT OF CLIPPERS PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Murdock only (begin ital)sounded(end ital) like
the name of someone who would be networking in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Murdock _ a Miami Heat free agent on the Clippers'
point-guard shopping list _ and the Nets reached an agreement
Wednesday that will return the five-year veteran to his native New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an agreement in principle,'' Keith Glass, Murdock's
agent, said on the day before such a deal can become official.
``Nothing is etched in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   And please continue to count the Clippers among teams have yet
to even scratch in this etching derby.
</P>
<P>
   With the Murdock option eliminated, New Jersey free agent
Sherman Douglas remains the favorite to land the role of Clippers
playmaker. But the Clippers may need the domino-delivery system to
bring Douglas to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   With his role of backup Nets point guard taken by Murdock,
Douglas only seems to be a lock for the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Washington Wizards free agent point guard Rod Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, don't expect this big-ticket item to become a Clipper.
According to a league source, Strickland has two offers on the
table from the Wizards, but had a deadline of midnight (EST)
Wednesday to accept one of them. If Strickland and the Wizards part
company, Douglas could be the answer _ and a starter _ in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Or he could sign with the Clippers and play for new coach Chris
Ford, who coached Douglas in Boston and Milwaukee. The Clippers
have played the Douglas issue close to the vest but may have tipped
their hand in dealing with Murdock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we really rejected the Clippers,'' Glass said.
``We really didn't get an offer from them. If we had, I'm sure
(Eric) would have been interested. Basically, though, it came down
to staying at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Fleisher, Douglas' agent, and Elgin Baylor, the Clippers'
vice president of basketball operations, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clippers don't sign Douglas, or trade for a point guard,
they may choose to re-sign their own free agent, Darrick Martin,
unless another team beats them to that punch.
</P>
<P>
   Two more alternatives are free agents Kevin Johnson of Phoenix
and Darrell Armstrong of Orlando. Johnson, in the twilight of an
All-Star career, figures to join one of the league's heavyweight
teams. Armstrong, who missed much of last season with a shoulder
injury, is expected to stay with the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Jolly Rogers: Clippers forward Rodney Rogers made an appearance
on the final day of voluntary workouts at Veterans Park Sports
Complex in Carson. Rogers, who appeared to be an onion ring or two
above his playing weight, spent most of his lockout time taking
care of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make sure I could keep living if we didn't have a
season,'' said Rogers, who has business interests in real estate
and trucking in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be funny the first couple of weeks,'' said Rogers,
commenting on how a less-than-ship-shape NBA might look. ``A lot of
laughs. Playing as many as four games a week means a lot of wear
and tear on the body. But that's what guys say they want _ more
games and less practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Six other Clippers attended Wednesday's workout. Missing in
action were Pooh Richardson, Keith Closs, James ``Hollywood''
Robinson and Maurice Taylor. The team expects its 10 signed
players, rookie Brian Skinner, and five mystery free agents on hand
when camp opens tonight at College of the Desert in Palm Desert.

 &HT;    Clinton lawyers argue ouster could set dangerous precedent
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The impeachment charges against President Clinton
are so frivolous, vague and politically motivated that to remove
him from office would set a dangerous precedent, White House
attorneys argued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers Gregory Craig and Cheryl Mills, in sometimes graphic
detail, told the president's side of how he concealed a sexual
affair with former intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you convict and remove President Clinton on the basis of
these allegations, no president of the United States will ever be
safe from impeachment again,'' said Craig, who concentrated his 3
1/2 hour presentation on the charge that Clinton lied to a federal
grand jury about his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to take the charges seriously when in each case
they boil down to arguments over semantics,'' said Craig.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is expected to conclude its defense of Clinton
today with presentations from Clinton's personal attorney, David
Kendall, and former Sen. Dale Bumpers. Senators will then have 16
hours to question attorneys on both sides before considering a
motion to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans alone already have compiled more than 70 questions,
although many of these will be consolidated or eliminated for
redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   Senators are also jockeying for position with several scenarios.
Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) want a motion
to open up all the deliberations, which would ordinarily be secret.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) also is pushing a motion that would
lead to an immediate vote on the articles of impeachment themselves
before any consideration of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors, meanwhile, continued to press for an
opportunity to rebut the president's defense arguments. They also
continued to wrangle over a final witness list, but without
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   To make his case, Craig played 14 minutes of a video of Clinton
during his deposition in August where he sits red-faced as
attorneys debate what constitutes a sexual relationship. The oddity
of hearing the definition of sex explored on the Senate floor was
evident, with some senators shifting in their seats, and others
focusing their eyes on the ground instead of the video screen.
</P>
<P>
   Craig argued that Clinton did not perjure himself.
</P>
<P>
   It made no sense for Clinton to lie about specifics to the grand
jury after making the ``painful, difficult admission'' of a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said prosecutors had embellished their case since the
House voted, largely along party lines, to impeach the president
Dec. 19. He said the case included new charges that had not been
part of the report issued by independent counsel Kenneth Starr in
September.
</P>
<P>
   To the allegation that the president falsely testified about the
nature and details of his relationship with Lewinksy, Craig said
that the president admitted during the grand jury that he had a
relationship of a sexual nature with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mills followed Craig's presentation on perjury by attempting to
cast alternate interpretations on two of the most damaging
allegations against Clinton: that he orchestrated the retrieval of
gifts from Lewinsky's apartment and sought to intimidate his
personal secretary, Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   Mills also sought to counter the argument, advanced by House
prosecutors, that acquitting Clinton will send a dangerous message
about the enforcement of sexual harassment laws and the ability of
someone such as Paula Jones to bring such cases against powerful
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had imperfect leaders in the past, and we'll have
imperfect leaders in the future,'' Mills said. ``But their
imperfections did not roll back nor did they stop the march for
civil rights and equal protection for all our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of the president's gifts to Lewinsky, which Currie
collected and kept under her bed, Mills suggested that it was
Lewinsky, not the president, who was concerned about them. She
cited Lewinsky's statements to the FBI that she was worried that
the Jones lawyers would break into her apartment and steal them and
other statements to the grand jury when she said it was she, not
the president, who raised the subject of gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``was not concerned about the gifts because he gives so
many gifts to so many people,'' Mills said. ``No one claims that he
ordered, hinted or suggested'' that the gifts be removed from
Lewinsky's apartment, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Mills also argued that House prosecutors introduced no evidence
to suggest that Currie felt intimidated by Clinton when he called
her to the White House the day after his Paula Jones deposition to
quiz her about what she knew about Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mills argued that obstruction of justice can't be legally proven
without some evidence of intimidation. Far from coaching Currie,
Clinton instead was seeking to find out what she knew about his
relationship so he could manage a ``media firestorm'' that he knew
was coming, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president was concerned that his secret was going to be
exposed,'' said Mills. ``He talked to her to see what she knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors were quick to fight back, issuing a series
of responses to the White House claims.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Craig said that it was insignificant that the
president said his relationship began in 1996, vs. 1995 when
Lewinsky said it began. Insignificant because the accounts differed
by a matter of months during which her age did not change.
</P>
<P>
   The president lied about the beginning of the date before a
federal grand jury in August, the House managers said, because he
had denied such contact with Lewinsky in an earlier deposition with
the attorneys for Jones.''To admit it in the grand jury would be
clear perjury,'' the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The date is also important because Lewinsky was an intern and
therefore, a federal employee, in the White House when the
relationship began in 1995, but not in 1996 when the president
testified the relationship began.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sum, the president's lawyers have presented a classic Swiss
cheese defense. It is full of factual holes, and twists the law
into contortions so strange they are scarcely recognizable,'' the
House managers said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers generally praised the White House
presentation but some scoffed at the notion that the charges
against Clinton were not supported by the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say there is no proof,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).
``What about the dress?'' One of Lewinksy's dresses was found to
contain DNA from the president, the FBI found.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators, however, said they found the arguments
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow is the way I felt when I left,'' said Sen. Max Cleland
(D-Ga.). ``Ms. Mills was, quite frankly, incredible.''

GREENSPAN HINTS RATE CUT IS UNLIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also STATEOFUNION-GREENSPAN, EDIT-GREENSPAN) 
(js) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said
Wednesday there is little evidence that the economy is slowing. But
he warned for the first time since the stock market's most recent
run-up that equity prices might be getting excessive.
</P>
<P>
   His comments, analysts said, suggested that the central bank
would leave interest rates unchanged for some time to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are risks going forward,'' Greenspan told the
House Ways and Means Committee, ``to date domestic demand and hence
employment and output in the United States certainly has remained
vigorous. Though the pace of economic expansion is widely expected
to moderate as 1999 unfolds, signs of an appreciable slowdown as
yet remain scant.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the risks, Greenspan suggested, is that stock prices may
again have become unrealistically high. One of the reasons that
Wall Street has rebounded so smartly from its brief but sharp dip
last summer is Greenspan himself, who engineered a series of three
interest-rate cuts in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of equity prices would appear to envision
substantially greater growth of profits than has been experienced
of late,'' the Fed chairman said, restating a theme he has sounded
on and off for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The markets, which have come to expect some low-key jawboning
from Greenspan, largely shrugged off his comments. The Dow Jones
industrial average, which had advanced well over points during the
day, retreated to end with a 19.31-point loss, at 9,335.91. Broader
market indicators closed modestly higher, including the Nasdaq
composite index, which set another record. Bond prices fell.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has not directly addressed stock market valuations in
public since the market tumbled and then recovered. But he has
warned in general terms about what happens when investors fail to
make appropriate judgments about risk, whether on Wall Street or in
emerging markets. And the minutes of the Fed's policy-making
meeting on Nov. 17, when Greenspan and his colleagues cut rates by
a quarter of a percentage point, show that some members of the
committee were worried that pushing rates down would send the stock
market to unjustifiably high levels.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have assumed for several months that the Fed is
likely to hold rates steady at least the next few months unless the
global financial turmoil that has unsettled markets and economies
flares anew.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan reinforced that view Wednesday, though he acknowledged
that Brazil's recent problems create uncertainty. He suggested that
the Fed is again concerned that stronger-than-expected growth could
rekindle inflation if the economy did not slow on its own. Growth
in the fourth quarter of 1998 may have been as high as 5 percent,
according to some estimates, ending a year in which the economy
grew nearly 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials and many economists expect growth to slow to a
range of 2 percent to 3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also discussed subjects including Social Security, tax
cuts and trade policy, saying that ``some moderation'' in growth
might be required to sustain the nation's long expansion. ``Through
the end of 1998, the economy continued to grow more rapidly than
can be currently accommodated on an ongoing basis, even with
higher, technology-driven productivity growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's testimony marked something of a return to his
customary views after the tumult of last fall, when the Fed cut
interest rates by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point
to calm anxious investors and insure that the financial upheaval
that began in Asia did not spread to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   As it has for most of the last three years, the economy is
cruising along, defying predictions of a slowdown. The stock market
is regularly setting new highs. But even though unemployment is low
and demand is strong, there are almost no signs of inflation,
leaving policy makers, including Greenspan, pleased but wary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A survey released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve System
provided much the same view of the economy's performance as
Greenspan's testimony. The survey found that ``most regions are
showing solid economic growth over all,'' with ``generally stable
or declining prices.''
</P>
<P>
   No element of the economy's performance draws more attention
these days than the boom in the financial markets, and Greenspan
used much of his prepared testimony Wednesday to explore the link
between Wall Street and the buoyancy of consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   He said there have been valid reasons for the jump in stock
prices over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lower inflation, greater competitiveness and the flexibility
and adaptability of our businesses have enabled them to take
advantage of a rapid pace of technological change to make our
capital stock more productive and profitable,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the Fed has not sought to use monetary policy
to move stock prices up and down to reflect its view of appropriate
market valuations, adding, ``We need to react to changes in
financial markets, as we did this fall, but our objective is the
maximum sustainable growth of the U.S. economy, not particular
levels of asset prices.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, referring to last fall's rate cuts, he said,
``We were not attempting to prop up equity prices, nor did we plan
to continue to ease rates until equity prices recovered, as some
have erroneously inferred.''
</P>
<P>
   But the markets have a direct if complex effect on the economy
that must be factored into monetary policy, Greenspan said. The
rise in stock prices, he said, had clearly affected the personal
savings rate, which declined from almost 6 percent in 1992 to zero
last year. Instead of saving through traditional channels,
individuals are accumulating wealth through the stock market. There
is evidence, he said, that all or most of the decline in personal
savings is concentrated among the wealthy, who benefit the most
from capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   The wealth effect _ the theory that consumer spending rises
along with increases in the value of investment portfolios _ ``has
been real and significant,'' Greenspan said. But the wealth effect
could also work in reverse, he said, since ``a decline in equity
values, especially a severe one, could lead to a considerable
weakening of consumer demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The markets have stabilized substantially since the fall,
Greenspan said, but the forced devaluation last week of Brazil's
currency illustrates the tenuous nature of that calm. And he noted
that global economic crises continue to have an effect in the
United States, not least in leading to a growing trade deficit as
foreign markets for agricultural and industrial products dry up and
other nations look to this country to import their goods.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Greenspan said, central banks had to be careful that
interest-rate changes did not unduly unsettle the financial
markets, given their fragility. Policy makers, he said, ``are going
to have to be particularly wary of actions that unnecessarily sow
uncertainties, undermine confidence and interfere with the
efficient allocation of capital.''

 By JANE PERLEZ c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is planning to push U.S.
allies for a NATO ultimatum telling President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia that he must back down in Kosovo or face air strikes
within days, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was feeling an urgency to ``do something,''
several officials said, to save NATO from appearing irresolute over
Kosovo as the alliance's 50th anniversary approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who rebuffed two top NATO military officials during a
tendentious encounter in Belgrade on Tuesday, was cornering the
alliance into proving its worth, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Of uppermost concern as it addressed the Kosovo crisis, the
officials said, was the ability of Milosevic to belittle the
celebration marking the West's triumph over Communism planned for
April in Washington and turn it into a ``Kosovo summit,'' one
Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, an American,
said in a telephone interview from Brussels Wednesday that he had
come away from his seven hours spent with Milosevic on Tuesday
convinced that the Yugoslav leader was totally non-cooperative
because he did not yet feel any realistic military threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community has learned through long years of
dealing with Milosevic that he is the most compliant when
threatened directly with heavy military pressure,'' Clark said.
``Since that seems what he primarily responds to, the international
community has learned that it must produce it.'' Clark was
referring to the air strikes that finally brought the Bosnia war to
an end in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the ultimatum and when it would be issued was not
yet clear, but it appeared that if Milosevic did not move to comply
with a cease-fire that the ultimatum would be issued in the coming
days. If Milosevic ignored the ultimatum and did not come into
compliance with the cease-fire terms that he agreed to with NATO
last fall, the 16 NATO countries would then vote to reauthorize air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the negative report Wednesday from Clark and his
colleague, Gen. Klaus Neumann of Germany about their standoff with
Milosevic, NATO started to prepare for possible military action by
sending warships to the Adriatic Sea and cutting to 48 hours from
96 hours its preparation time for air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Britain increased its contingent of Harrier ground attack
aircraft at the NATO airbase in Italy from four to eight.
</P>
<P>
   The hostile meeting in Belgrade between Milosevic and the two
generals deepened anger in Washington where officials have been
denouncing the Yugoslav leader for allowing his forces to massacre
more than 40 ethnic Albanians last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Because the credibility of the NATO alliance appeared at stake
over this latest crisis, the Pentagon was not as resistant to the
idea of military intervention in Kosovo as it was last year,
officials said. Last October, NATO voted to authorize air strikes
against Milosevic's military installations in Kosovo, which is a
province of Serbia, and in Serbia itself.
</P>
<P>
   The authorization was suspended after Milosevic agreed to the
cease-fire brokered by the U.S. envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration was working on the ultimatum
that could lead to possible NATO air strikes, officials indicated
that there was little appetite in the administration for NATO
sending ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The disinclination for involving U.S. troops _ which are part of
the peacekeeping force in Bosnia _ was clearly shown when a NATO
``extraction'' force was sent to Macedonia last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The force is made up entirely of French soldiers. If air strikes
were to proceed, the ``extraction'' force would be involved in
getting the 700 unarmed international monitors out of Kosovo before
the strikes occurred. A major concern of the allies is that the
civilian monitors, about 170 of whom are American, could be taken
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   An unanswered part of a strategy of NATO air power against
Milosevic is what would happen after air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions that Western diplomats said would have to be
addressed were how the resulting military and political vacuum in
Kosovo might be filled. There was no resolution on that question in
either Washington or among the other allies, a Western diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   In their meeting with Milosevic, the two generals met resistance
at every turn, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of the massacre, they said Milosevic insisted
that the agreement he signed last fall with NATO allowed him to
defend the sovereignty of his country.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement specified that in this defense that he could use
``adequate and proportionate'' responses, NATO officials said. When
challenged that the massacre last Friday involved
``disproportionate and overwhelming'' force, Milosevic insisted
that it was proportional to what the ``terrorists'' in Kosovo had
done against his Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's regime refers to the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army, who are seeking independence, as ``terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The two generals outlined to Milosevic how he had breached the
agreement by increasing the number of Serb forces in Kosovo beyond
the agreed level. He had promised that there would be no more than
three groups of 10 to 12 vehicles with Serb forces but there were
now 10-13 such convoys, the generals told him.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of allowing Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor
of the international war crimes tribunal into Kosovo to examine the
massacre site and the bodies, Milosevic said he would only
countenance her presence as a ``guest'' of the Serbian government.
This meant his government officials would dictate where she could
go.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arbour, who attempted to get into Kosovo at the border with
Macedonia on Monday but was turned back by border guards, flew back
to the Hague Wednesday.

 By DOUGLASS STINSON 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Mexico's Planned privatization of 35 airports, including the
country's main international facility in Mexico City, has been a
surprisingly quiet affair. A consortium led by local builder
Tribasa recently filed a winning bid of US$116 million for a
50-year concession to operate nine airports in the country's
Southeast - the first of four such auctions that some say could
earn as much as US$ 4 billion.
 &HT;    The recent privatization of Argentina's 33 airports caused a
stir, mainly due to the relief by airlines and passengers alike
that a private, world-class operator would finally address the
desperate need for financing and the desperate operational and
safety concerns. But Mexico's airports are safe and well-run,
earning a profit of nearly $190 million over the first three
quarters of 1998, 29 percent better than the previous year.
 &HT;    So why sell at all? ``Who flies into our airports? The rich, the
top 1 percent of our society,'' says Jorge Silberstein,
privatization coordinator for the Ministry of Communications and
Transport. ``Every dollar we spend on airports, is a dollar we
can't spend on health care or schools. Our resources are scarce.''
 &HT;    There is one thing privatizers are looking to fix: the way
corporations are owned and controlled in Mexico.
 &HT;    Mexico has had problems in this department, notably in the
privatization of state banks and toll-road projects. In both cases,
new owners failed to fully disclose many risky ventures aimed at
recouping inflated privatization bids. Ministry officials have
pledged that their privatizations will be different. ``The thinking
is that this is a company that should be public,'' says
Silberstein. ``We are paving the way for the idea of a diverse
shareholder base and the protection of minority shareholders'
rights.''
 &HT;    To that end, the sale of equity stakes in the airports are like
no other privatization of its kind in the world, designed to create
a transparent public-company management structure that will run the
airport and contract for needed construction and development in an
open, free-market fashion. ``The equity structure they are using
makes it less eventful,'' says Steven Steckler, the president of
Infrastructure Management Group, a U.S.-based firm that advises on
airport management. ``In Argentina, there was the feeling that they
were really handing over the airport.''
 &HT;    Normally, airport systems are given in concession over long
terms or outright sale to a group of partners that includes a
strategic operator. Mexico's airports have been divided into three
regional groupings, plus the Mexico City airport, the largest, as a
solo offering. But instead of granting total control through
concession or sale, the government is only offering the sale of a
15 percent stake and concession rights to the winning bidders.
Additionally, bidders must consist of a partnership between an
international operator and a local partner each owning a quarter of
the holding company. Additional investors must fill out the
remaining ownership.
 &HT;    The remaining 85 percent of each airport group is slated to be
sold through an initial public offering at a future date.
 &HT;    The uncertainty has not kept many bidders away. Major operators
like U.S.-based Ogden Corp. and Holland's Schiphol International
B.V. have entered the first round of privatizations, the
Southeastern Group of airports. But others are waiting to see how
the first auction and the final negotiations for the concession
contract turn out.
 &HT;    ``This is not a normal concession privatization. Instead, the
operator is investing in a holding company over which it does not
have total control. You choose your partners in a concession, but
with Mexico's IPO, you are getting into bed with strangers,'' says
Cody Plott, a vice president in charge of airport development for
Airport Group International. ``This one is so unique that we
decided to see how the first one goes.''
 &HT;    Observers expect the terms of the first concession contract to
dictate the remaining three sales, with winning bidders allowed to
own one regional system and also bid on the Mexico City airport in
the final auction schedule scheduled for the end of this year. The
unorthodox privatization of the airport system is expected to draw
major attention from operators, even though Mexico does not sport
the growth potential that Argentina offers. But with airport
operators expecting big contracts coming up for bid in Europe and
Asia, they are looking for any opportunity that will give them a
track record. ``This is portfolio-building time'', says Steckler.
``Operators are thinking, `If we're not there, the rest of the
world will be asking `why?'''

TOO MANY CHARACTERS, TOO LITTLE COHESION
</HEADLINE>
 BY HEART-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Certain directors _ Robert Altman and Woody Allen, to name a
couple _ have a gift for movies with large casts and multiple story
lines. At their best, the films are seamless, their characters
inhabiting one world so emphatically that the world becomes a
character itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing by Heart'' would like to be a movie like that, but it
suffers from having its screenwriter as its director. Willard
Carroll, whose best-known credit to date is 1991's little-seen
``The Runestone,'' appears to have been too close to his script,
and his possessiveness diminishes a promising premise. Other hands
might have corrected the flaws by smoothing the movie's flow,
trimming its excesses and filming it in such a way that the
dialogue doesn't call attention to itself.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the film plays like a collection of duet-acting
exercises. It's no wonder it attracted such a marquee-value cast,
all of whom get to flex their performing muscles. But the actors
aren't playing individual characters so much as couples.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of couples. Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands are a
long-married pair bickering about an indiscretion he almost
committed 25 years ago; Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart are
professionals embarking on a relationship but struggling with her
reluctance; Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe are bohemian club
goers who connect but struggle with his reluctance; Madeleine Stowe
and Anthony Edwards, each married to someone else, are having an
affair that she wants to keep simple and he wants to complicate.
</P>
<P>
   For wild cards, there are Jay Mohr and Ellen Burstyn as a dying
AIDS patient and his compassionate mother, and Dennis Quaid as a
guy who goes to bars and tells his life story to anyone who will
listen _ only it's a different life story every time.
</P>
<P>
   All the characters interconnect in a ``surprise'' climax that
most viewers will figure out well ahead of time. Miramax sent a
note to journalists asking that the ending be kept secret, and
we'll oblige, but the movie's straining toward the revelation is
its central problem. If the connection had been revealed from the
beginning, we could see the characters as part of that one world.
Instead, the couples inhabit their own little worlds; they're so
segregated from anything outside their romantic problems that they
don't even have friends, apparently relying on their many pets for
some kind of emotional connection. The movie is set in Los Angeles,
but it could just as well have been set in Fort Worth or Cincinnati
for all the city plays into it; the many interior scenes inspire
not a sense of place but a sense of dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the performances almost save the movie. Jolie steals the
film with a funny, touching performance as the disco dolly who, in
trying to break down Phillippe's walls, discovers that she has
walls of her own _ and that they're very fragile (it's tempting to
tag Jolie with the nickname Gepetto, because she's the only person
ever to make the wooden Phillippe appear to come to life). Her
theft is a bit by default, because the movie's best actors, Connery
and Rowlands, are wasted in their plot line; it's as if that's the
only conflict Carroll could possibly imagine older people having.
</P>
<P>
   Also good is Anderson, who gives an interesting, subtle
performance as the woman who has been so wounded that she can't
bring herself to look her charming suitor in the eye. And Quaid's
turn as the chameleonic barfly is his most confidently puckish in
years, but when his character's secret is revealed, the confidence
and puckishness vanish, because Carroll's screenplay has ceased
giving him anything to do.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's original title was ``Dancing About Architecture,'' a
phrase that Carroll borrowed and adapted from a Laurie Anderson
song, only in his case it's talking about love that's like dancing
about architecture (he's so fond of the metaphor, he uses it
twice). The inspired original title probably better represents the
heights that Carroll was aiming for; unfortunately, the more
mundane new title reflects the movie's reality. Except that these
characters talk so much about love, maybe it should have been
called ``Playing by Mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing by Heart'' is rated R for language and adult
situations.

SLEEPWALKING THROUGH A DYING WEST
</HEADLINE>
 COUNTRY-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sam Peckinpah wanted to adapt ``The Hi-Lo Country'' for the big
screen more than 30 years ago. The book's elegiac tone and mixture
of courtliness and explosive instinct would have been suited to
Peckinpah's abiding interests, as well as his compulsion to track
the codes of machismo and the hardheadedness that can kill
friendships. Director Stephen Frears gets the courtly part right.
His film is measured, rapt and not one iota less than beautiful.
But the rambunctious energy is missing. We're always aware that
Frears carefully deposits his feet in the prints of those who've
come before him. Curiously, ``The Hi-Lo Country'' seems to be
yellowing before your very eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It's another of those westerns about the end of the West, in
which we watch a way of life dying. It even seems to be narrated by
a dead man, Pete (Billy Crudup). After the bullying, wide-awake
performance Crudup gave in ``Without Limits,'' he apparently became
mesmerized by the gorgeous vistas and sunsets of ``Hi-Lo.'' It's as
good-looking as a movie can be. The picture starts during World War
II and gets going just after the war ends. That's when Big Boy
(Woody Harrelson), a big man with a heart big enough to tame a land
too big for most, brings his big passions home and wants to start
ranching. Yup, there's a lot of big in ``Hi-Lo.'' Mostly, it's like
watching kids in clothes too big for them carrying pillowcases from
house to house on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Pete harbors a love for Mona (Patricia Arquette), but so does
Big Boy. Mona is supposed to pass through the town Hi-Lo like a
sultry breeze, and her humiliated husband (John Diehl) follows her
around while she's turning the head of every man in town. Arquette,
with the baby fat burned out of her cheeks, looks the part. But
she, too, seems to be sleepwalking through the movie. Which, I
guess, explains what Harrelson is doing screaming at people and
grabbing them by their lapels. He's trying to wake them up. (He'd
have better luck in a cemetery.) He begins to seem like he's Kevin
McCarthy in ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' trying to wake
everybody up before the pods swallow 'em up whole. He's too late,
though. The striking Penelope Cruz, as the girl who loves Pete but
is never enough for him, is so badly used you'd think she never
acted before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi-Lo'' is peculiar because it's so dreary and moth-eaten that
it almost makes you forget the feel that Frears showed for American
low-lifes in ``The Grifters,'' and the brilliant way he handled
American actors in ``Dangerous Liaisons.'' He's not contemptuous of
the wild streaks in American actors; he revels in them. Not having
read the book, I can't say what attracted him to the material, but
movies like ``The Hi-Lo Country'' were made quite a few times
during the 1950s. ``(Giant'' was probably the peak.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi-Lo'' is supposed to be full of men who are men and sure
proud of it. It's certainly full of something. Harrelson works hard
to dominate the picture, but what he tries to force, Sam Elliott,
as the dastardly rancher who controls Hi-Lo, has by natural right.
Laconic and sure-footed, Elliott probably could have played Big Boy
20 years ago. Harrelson puts so much effort into the role that
we're not sure if we should take him seriously. Except the movie
seems to take him very seriously. It takes itself way too
seriously, too, dragging around its themes of doom and loss and men
hanging onto a way of life that's receding right in front of them.
A way of life isn't the only thing receding in this movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hi-Lo Country'' is rated R for adult sexuality, violence
(including a rape scene) and language.

 Por DOUGLASS STINSON 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    La privatizacion de 35 aeropuertos mexicanos, entre ellos la
terminal internacional mas importante, ha sido curiosamente
apacible. Un consorcio encabezado por la constructora local Tribasa
gano con su oferta de US$116 millones una concesion a 50 anos para
operar nueve aeropuertos en el sureste. Fue la primera de cuatro
subastas que, segun observadores, podrian aportarle al Estado hasta
US$4.000 millones.
 &HT;    La reciente privatizacion de 33 aeropuertos en Argentina dejo
una profunda huella debido al alivio que sintieron aerolineas y
pasajeros por igual de que por fin un operador privado de categoria
internacional resolvera la angustiosa necesidad de financiamiento y
las preocupaciones en materia de operaciones y seguridad. Pero los
aeropuertos de Mexico son seguros y estan bien dirigidos, con
ganancias de casi US$190 millones en los tres primeros trimestres
de 1998, 29 por ciento mas que en 1997.
 &HT;    Entonces, para que venderlos? ``Quienes usan nuestros
aeropuertos? Los ricos, el 1 por ciento de mas ingresos de nuestra
sociedad,'' dice Jorge Silberstein, coordinador de privatizaciones
de la Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transporte. ``Cada dolar que
gastamos en los aeropuertos, es un dolar que no podemos gastar en
atencion medica o en escuelas.''
 &HT;    Los privatizadores quieren arreglar el manejo de la propiedad y
el control de las empresas en Mexico. El pais ha tenido problemas
en ese aspecto, sobre todo en la privatizacion de bancos estatales
y carreteras con peaje. En ambos casos, los nuevos duenos no
revelaron completamente muchas de las apuestas arriesgadas que
hicieron en materia empresarial con el fin de recuperar el costo
inflado de las licitaciones. Funcionarios de gobierno han prometido
que sus privatizaciones seran distintas. ``La idea es que esta es
una compania que debe cotizarse en bolsa,'' dice Silberstein.
``Estamos allanando el camino a la nocion de una base diversificada
de accionistas y a la proteccion de los derechos de los accionistas
minoritarios.''
 &HT;    A ese fin, la venta de participaciones en los aeropuertos es
unica entre las privatizaciones de su tipo en el mundo, y esta
concebida para crear una estructura transparente de administracion
que dirigira el aeropuerto y hara los contratos necesarios para
obras de construccion y ampliacion de una manera abierta. ``La
estructura de capitalizacion que estan usando lo hace menos
importante,'' dice Steven Steckler, presidente de Infrastructure
Management Group, firma estadounidense de asesoria en
administracion de aeropuertos. ``En Argentina uno tenia la
sensacion de que en realidad estaban entregando el aeropuerto.''
 &HT;    Normalmente, los aeropuertos se dan en concesion por periodos
largos o se venden directamente a un grupo de socios con un
operador estrategico. Los aeropuertos mexicanos se han dividido en
tres grupos regionales, mas la terminal internacional Benito
Juarez, que es la mayor, como una sola oferta. Pero en vez de
otorgar el control total a traves de una concesion o venta, el
gobierno solo vendera una participacion del 15 por ciento y
derechos de concesion. Ademas, los licitadores deben estar
compuestos por una asociacion entre un operador internacional y un
socio local, cada uno con una cuarta parte de la compania holding.
El resto debe quedar en manos de otros inversionistas. El restante
85 por ciento de cada grupo de aeropuertos se vendera
posteriormente.
 &HT;    La incertidumbre no ha alejado a muchos licitadores. Importantes
operadores como Ogden Corp., de Estados Unidos, y Schiphol
International B.V., de Holanda, han entrado en la primera ronda de
privatizaciones. Pero otros han decidido esperar. ``Esta no es una
privatizacion normal. El operador invierte en una compania holding
que no controla completamente. Uno elige a sus socios en una
concesion, pero en el caso de Mexico, uno se asocia con extranos,''
dice Cody Plott, vicepresidente a cargo de desarrollo de
aeropuertos de Airport Group International. ``Este caso es tan
singular que hemos decidido ver como le va al primero.''
 &HT;    Los observadores esperan que los terminos del primer contrato de
la concesion dicte la forma de las tres ventas restantes, o sea,
que los ganadores reciban la propiedad de un sistema regional y que
ademas participen en la subasta del aeropuerto Benito Juarez en la
licitacion final.
 &HT;    Se espera que la singular privatizacion del sistema de
aeropuertos atraiga a los operadores, aunque Mexico no tiene el
potencial de crecimiento de que disfruta Argentina. Pero como los
operadores de aeropuertos esperan grandes licitaciones de contratos
en Europa y Asia, buscan cualquier oportunidad que les de un
historial. ``Este es el momento de crear una cartera,'' dice
Steckler. ``Los operadores piensan que si no participan, el resto
del mundo se preguntara por que.''

 &HT;    Scientists: No easy way to restore Everglades, Biscayne Bay
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Despite weeks of scrambling, scientists
working on a $7.8 billion Everglades restoration plan have found no
easy way to meet demands that they fully replenish Everglades
National Park and Biscayne Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they came up with proposed changes that could parch or
flood parts of the central Everglades and risk floods in some Palm
Beach County suburbs. The changes also would create a potentially
huge cleanup bill by steering billions of gallons of polluted
suburban drainage into otherwise unfouled sections of the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the likely results of the latest ``tweak'' of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers' Everglades rescue plan, state and federal
scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They said they're still trying to design a restoration that
helps the entire region _ or at least doesn't hurt anyone. But the
final details will probably remain unknown until well after
Congress receives the corps' blueprint in July.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest example of the conundrum facing the restoration
effort: How do you revive one part of South Florida's shrunken,
shriveled ecosystem without trashing something else?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to damage one part of the Everglades to solve
problems in another part,'' said biologist John Ogden of the South
Florida Water Management District, the corps' partner.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden said it's still unclear how the proposed changes outlined
Wednesday will be included in the corps' report to Congress. They
may wind up in an appendix of ideas needing further review.
</P>
<P>
   Corps officials have long said their plan will need repeated
changes over the next two decades, with Congress doling out money
in stages only after the engineers finish the details.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the specter of harmful side effects could make the entire
restoration hard to sell to a skeptical public, one state official
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a real marketing issue,'' said Mary Ann Poole of
the state Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The park also has yet to endorse any of the proposed changes,
but Superintendent Richard Ring said: ``We're really encouraged. We
want a final plan that does the best it possibly can for all of
South Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The $7.8 billion plan is supposed to replenish the Everglades,
which has suffered from decades of draining and development, while
providing water and flood control to farms and cities.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft that Vice President Al Gore unveiled in October, the
corps called for creating more than 300 wells and 251,000 acres of
marshes, reservoirs and deep quarries. They would store hundreds of
billions of gallons each year, capturing water that the region's
canals waste out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not enough, park officials said last month. They said
the plan would supply drinking water for suburban sprawl without
giving the park and Biscayne Bay the water they need to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for more water, scientists from the corps, water
district and other agencies turned to the urban drainage that
washes off lawns, parking lots, streets and rooftops along South
Florida's developed coast.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested corraling 89 billion gallons flowing out to sea
each year in Palm Beach and Broward counties. Pumps would move that
water into wells, reservoirs and filter marshes, much of it
ultimately entering the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Through that step and other drainage changes, the scientists
said they could pour an additional 112 billion gallons into the
park and Biscayne Bay each year.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes would have serious drawbacks:
</P>
<P>
   _ The change in drainage would flood parts of the central
Everglades during rainy seasons and parch them in dry times, game
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rerouting of water could overflow canals in suburbs west
of cities from Lake Worth to Boca Raton unless the canals are
widened, drainage managers say. ``We're kind of upset because
nobody has talked to us about this,'' said Bill Winters, executive
director of the Lake Worth Drainage District.
</P>
<P>
   _ Urban runoff contains a host of pollutants, including
fertilizers, pesticides, oil residue and heavy metals.
</P>
<P>
   Already, taxpayers are financing a $763 million project to clean
farm and suburban pollution draining into the northern Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning that pollution could add an untold amount of money to
the price and require enlarging some of the filter marshes.

 &HT;    Getting to the SuperBowl is a (long) snap
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All right, class, we're going to start today with a
little test. Multiple choice: A long snapper is (a) a lawn mower,
(b) a fish, (c) a turtle or (d) a football player who spends most
of his time with his head between his legs.
</P>
<P>
   If you picked (d), you win. In this case, what you win is a few
minutes of Adam Schreiber's time. Adam Schreiber is a long snapper.
That's his line of work. Nobody ever notices a long snapper until
he makes a bad snap, then he becomes a headline. Even his family is
vilified.
</P>
<P>
   ``But never,'' he wanted it pointed out, ``have I ever made a
bad snap that lost a game'''
</P>
<P>
   It is now on record that Morten Andersen kicked the field goal
and booted the Falcons all the way to Super Bowl No. 33, thus
becoming the most popular Dane around here since Victor Borge.
However, the science of football tells us that it takes three
people to kick a field goal, and nobody can kick anything until the
long snapper snaps the ball to the holder, who then places it so
the kicker can kick it between the pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Before Andersen kicked, Schreiber snapped, Dan Stryzinski
fielded the snap and placed the ball in position. Ergo, three
points. Falcons win, Falcons win, Falcons win!
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not one of my best snaps,'' Schreiber said. ``The laces
were a quarter to the right.'' Then he went into a technical
discourse on the science of the field-goal snap. ``Accuracy is
everything snapping for field goals. Snapping for punts, you just
snap as hard as you can.'' Let the punter track it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get nervous snapping for field goals,'' he said. ``We
work on it 20 minutes every day. We've done, I'd guess, over a
thousand practice snaps this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, what course does a player take to get into this upside-down
profession? We turn back here to his career as an offensive lineman
at Texas, where he was part of one of the most magnificently
crafted front five you ever saw. Tall, straight backs, flat
stomachs, lean and rangy as Texans are supposed to look. Schreiber
played a little bit of everything, but Casey Smith was the center.
The others were Mike Reuther, who once was a Falcon, Doug Dawson
and a stout one so square they called Gene Chilton ``The Coke
Machine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great team. We went 11-and-0, but the saddest part
was, we lost to Georgia in the Cotton bowl by one point,''
Schreiber said with a curled lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father got me into football. One afternoon when I was in
the 4th grade, he dropped me off at the practice field. We were
lined up going out for passes. I dropped a pass and started crying.
I was a mama's baby. I decided right then I wanted to be an
offensive lineman.''
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber took up snapping at New Orleans, anything to hang on.
``Joel Hilgenberg had been the snapper, but he turned up sick as a
dog one day, and Bum Phillips called on me. I'd been practicing,
just in case, and I took over.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been more to his career than playing upside down. In
the 15 seasons he has been in the NFL, twice he has started 16
games, last with the Minnesota Vikings -- yes, those guys -- in
1993. He got in a few licks at guard in preseason here, but Bob
Hallen, the rookie, came through and that cut him loose for pure
snapping.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcon connection dates back to the three seasons Schreiber
spent with Dan Reeves and the New York Giants. The telephone rang
during preseason last year, and it was Reeves again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted me down here, and I wanted to be wherever Dan Reeves
was. So we made a two-year deal, and here we are, on the way to the
Super Bowl. How's that for the end to a story of the 4th-grader who
dropped his first pass and cried?''
</P>
<P>
   He'll be 39 next month, but long snappers have a different view
of the game than the other players. They're in a world of their own
and always in demand. The Falcons are Schreiber's seventh team. He
has seen the NFL from coast to coast, but that's how he grew up.
His father was in hotel management and the family saw a lot of the
country. He was born in Galveston, though, and that makes him a
Texan forever.

 &HT;    Reeves talks about his pain in Denver
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves acted like a man who had left
the past behind when he was asked Monday the first of what will be
many questions about Broncos coach Mike Shanahan, quarterback John
Elway, and owner Pat Bowlen.
</P>
<P>
   When the subject came up again Wednesday, Reeves sounded like a
man who would never forget. He will meet them all face-to-face
again on Jan. 31 in Super Bowl XXXIII, when the Falcons (16-2) meet
Denver (16-2) in Miami. As coach of the Broncos from 1981-92,
Reeves occasionally had a strained relationship with Elway, fired
Shanahan after the 1991 season and was fired by Bowlen after the
'92 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I'll ever get over the full situation,''
said Reeves, who had a record of 110-73-1 in Denver, including five
AFC West titles and three losing trips to the Super Bowl. ``I think
any time you're fired and you've been in a place for 12 years and
had the success we had, that you really don't understand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed an awful lot of people's lives,'' Reeves said
during a 70-minute news conference Wednesday. ``Just like me making
the decision about Mike ... changed a lot of people's lives. I
don't know that Mike will ever get over the hurt from that, and
what it cost his wife and children. Well, the same thing with me.
It caused a lot of pain for my wife, my children. It's something
that won't ever go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway came first, arriving in Denver in 1983 as a remarkable
talent after a standout career at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   In his first NFL game, Elway took over for current Falcon backup
Steve DeBerg during the fourth quarter of a preseason game against
Seattle and rallied Denver to a comeback victory. He went on to
become the starter.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves benched him a month into the season, then made him
the starter again in week 10 after DeBerg injured a shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, they had their first sideline argument. A few days later,
Elway and Reeves met in the coach's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him we're bad for each other,'' Reeves told the Rocky
Mountain News many years ago. ``We're both impatient. We made a
pact after that game. I told him I'd remind him to be patient if
he'd remind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway played pretty well the rest of the season, then was
stunned when DeBerg got healthy, and was tabbed to start in an AFC
divisional playoff game against Seattle _ a 31-7 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point,'' Elway's wife, Janet, said, ``he talked to me
about forgetting pro football and becoming an assistant for his
father (Jack at Stanford). I don't think deep down he was serious.
But I knew he thought about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowlen purchased the team in 1984, and in training camp DeBerg
was gone, traded to Tampa Bay, where he backed up Steve Young.
Shanahan had been hired as an assistant out of the University of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, Shanahan was the offensive coordinator, although he
left in 1988 to become head coach of the Raiders, who fired him a
month into the '89 season.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was coaching his own quarterbacks at the time, a taxing
job for a head coach, and he couldn't talk backup quarterback Gary
Kubiak _ the current Denver offensive coordinator _ into being a
player-coach.
</P>
<P>
   So he and Bowlen hired Shanahan has the quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Raiders let Mike go, I was the first one to go to Pat
and say, 'This would be great if we could get him back,' `` Reeves
said. ``So I had tremendous respect for Mike. He was as good a
football coach as I've ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shanahan's relationship with Elway blossomed so much that
Reeves grew uncomfortable. Reeves didn't care for the idea of
Shanahan and his family vacationing with Elway and his family,
thinking that it wasn't what a professional relationship should be.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Reeves grew very upset with the relationship between
Shanahan and Elway. He started reading comments in the local papers
about Elway being unhappy with comments Reeves had made about him
in private. And there was talk of Shanahan and Elway scripting
plays without Reeves' knowledge. So Reeves fired Shanahan for
``insubordination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing to me was, the biggest problem I had (with Shanahan)
was,'If John Elway had a problem with me and you're coaching that
position and you know (it), why did I not know that prior to
reading it in the paper?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like if you were the position coach and you were
that close to the quarterback, why did you not say, 'Hey, this is
something you ought to sit down and talk about?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And you say things in a coaches' meeting as far as critiquing
a play of someone that you would never say to the player. If John
ever got any bad feelings about something that I said . . . it had
to be something coming from a staff meeting. Now, does that mean
Mike did it? You got a lot of people on your staff. Again, . . . as
I said, I have no proof of them, nothing. I did what I felt was
best for our football team. I didn't think Mike acted in my best
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Shanahan told the Rocky Mountain News in 1993, when he
was offensive coordinator of the 49ers, ``I think Dan is trying to
blame his relationship with John on somebody else. The fact is,
when I got there back in 1984, John and Dan weren't getting along
very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day our relationship soured was the day when (a column by
late Denver Post columnist Dick Connor in '91) came out with John
saying he and Dan didn't communicate anymore. Dan called me in his
office and said, 'Why did John go and do that?' And I said, 'Why
are you asking me? John's a big boy. Go and ask him.' Up until
then, Dan and I were fine. It all soured after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the distractions, the Broncos won the AFC West title
that year with a 12-4 record but lost in the conference
championship game to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The team went 8-8 in 1992, but Reeves already had begun to sense
that Bowlen was going to drop the ax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I coached in the Pro Bowl (after the '91 season) and was
promised a contract extension. I expected (Bowlen) to do it in
Hawaii,'' Reeves said. ``It never came up. I thought it was going
to happen in the offseason. It never came up. I didn't feel like it
was for me to go to him and say, 'When are we going to get this
done?' We went into the (1992) season, and he hadn't addressed
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Reeves was surprised and very disappointed that he
was fired, although he said he didn't argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay in Denver the rest of my career,'' he said.
``Pat was born about a month after I was, and he used to always
say, 'We're going to finish our careers together.' I didn't ask
questions. I've been on the other side of that desk, with Mike, and
with players over the years, and that's not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves underwent heart-bypass surgery last month, Shanahan
and his wife sent get-well wishes, and Elway and his wife made a
donation in Reeves' name to the Atlanta Youth Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves isn't about to invite Shanahan, Elway or Bowlen to
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have never been where we were without John Elway. I
always had a tremendous amount of respect for John Elway,'' he
said. ``And the whole thing with John is, I tried to address
everything we did, even in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of hurt that won't ever go away. You never
will forget those things. But am I a person that's not going to
speak to Pat Bowlen or Mike Shanahan or John Elway? I don't live my
life like that. I had a lot of great times with those guys. I can
be cordial to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play golf with them. I won't go out to eat with them, or
go socially to a function with them, but I would have no problem
carrying on a conversation. It' just part of our business.''

 &HT;    Before the big game, Miami battles image header

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Chamber of Commerce dream is perfect weather, 70
sunny degrees under a cloudless blue sky, happy dancers swinging to
a salsa beat in packed nightclubs while football fans spend gobs of
money.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare is Miami's other side, the one that gets more
headlines than the pretty weather: thugs smack tourist rental cars
in fake accidents to set up robberies, ethnic tensions boil over
and city blocks burn, corrupt politicians get carted off to jail in
handcuffs as the cameras roll.
</P>
<P>
   Which Miami Super Bowl fans will find is anybody's guess. Just
this week robbers killed a winter resident from Canada and shot a
Panamanian woman, while a top parks department official was
suspended after $300,000 worth of mahogany trees came up missing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, movie stars and gorgeous cover-girls cruise the
vibrant nightscene on South Beach, while smugglers traffic in drugs
and immigrants, dumping cargo that sometimes washes up on the beach
next to posh waterfront mansions.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the spice and hint of something taboo that gives the
place some of its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, for most visitors and residents, Miami isn't like
living in the netherworld of some bad TV mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the main thing Super Bowl fans can look forward to is
probably gorgeous weather, which is largely what put this place on
the map in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's magic skyline still shimmers on perfect winter days
under a 70-degree sun, the blue Atlantic lapping at wide white
beaches, residents and tourists alike sucking in the glorious balmy
air and wondering why it can't be like this all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Rent a convertible if you can find one. Head to the beach,
cruise the lushly-landscaped streets of Coconut Grove or Coral
Gables, sip a Cuban coffee while you watch old men playing dominoes
in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a one-day game,'' said Ginny Gutierrez, a
spokesperson for the Greater Miami Visitor and Convention Bureau.
``It's a whole week where you can take advantage of a wide array of
events. And mostly it's our weather. That's always been our number
one draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, you may want to keep your eyes and ears peeled for those
``Only-in-South-Florida'' gems that often make the news here.
</P>
<P>
   Last year it was the mayor's race. Xavier Suarez, dubbed ``Mayor
Loco'' by local pundits, was deposed from office after elections
officials found rampant absentee ballot fraud that included one
vote cast by a dead person.
</P>
<P>
   A city commissioner on the same ballot had been removed from
office on mortgage fraud charges, only to be re-elected by his
zealous supporters, only to be removed again weeks later for
alleged vote fraud.
</P>
<P>
   That pol now sits in jail, further humiliated by revelations
that his wife had an affair with his attorney during his trial.
</P>
<P>
   But political corruption is run-of-the-mill stuff, common, to
some extent, in many big American cities.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting are the characters who seem drawn to sunny
South Florida. The developer who wants to build an indoor
snow-skiing mountain so sweaty locals and visitors can trade beach
togs for the latest ski fashions. Airboat operators who like to
take tourists up-close and personal with toothy alligators. Or the
Indian gator wrestler who tried a dangerous trick one time too many
and had his face stitched up after the jaws of death clamped down
on his noggin.
</P>
<P>
   There's a tour of famous crime sites, including the South Beach
mansion where world-famous Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace
was gunned down two years ago. There's a police museum to warm any
Dragnet fan's heart. And even a live parrot show where trained
birds do tricks.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it does seem that South Florida gets more than its
share of headlines for crime. In the early 1990s, thugs were
targeting tourists, who could be easily identified by their
rental-car license plates. High profile murders of several foreign
tourists sparked an avalanche of page-one stories in Europe, and
tourism promoters felt the pinch.
</P>
<P>
   Officials responded by getting the license plates changed so
rental cars don't stick out, and by setting up a special police
task force that concentrates on the airport and tourism areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had our problems like any other big city, but we've
taken innovative steps that have reduced tourism crime by 86
percent,'' Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, local boosters shivered this week when a Canadian was
killed outside his winter home shortly after picking up a relative
at the Fort Lauderdale airport and a Panamanian woman was shot by
robbers outside a shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the height of the tourist season, with Super Bowl
coming,'' Miami-Dade County Manager Merrett Stierheim told local
reporters. ``Without question, this is a sensitive time for us.
We're concerned. We've been down this road before.''
</P>
<P>
   Police will work overtime shifts during Super Bowl week, looking
out for tourist-targeting bad guys. But the cops can can cause
problems, too, especially when they get pushy in poorer
neighborhoods: A police shooting in 1989 led to riots that marred
that year's Super Bowl. However, Super Bowl XXIX in Miami in 1995
was without serious incident.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope tourists won't be worried about crime, but also
won't take foolish chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visitors should bring their common sense just like they would
to any large city,'' Gutierrez said.

U.S. MAY BUILD ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEM, SEEKS TO AMEND TREATY WITH
RUSSIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration announced on Wednesday
that it was inviting Russia to begin negotiations to amend the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to permit a limited national missile
defense system. If necessary, the administration said, it might
back out of the treaty unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   The administration acted after concluding that the threat of a
strike from a country like North Korea now justified building a
series of ground-based interceptor missiles that could shoot down a
limited number of incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that Russia would react harshly to the idea, President
Clinton wrote to President Boris N. Yeltsin last week outlining
plans to move ahead in developing and testing a system, a senior
administration official said. In the letter, Clinton urged Yeltsin
not to view the development of a missile defense as a threat to the
strategic balance between the United States and Russia, the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House sought to reassure the Russians, Secretary
of Defense William S. Cohen said on Wednesday that the United
States would not rule out the possibility of unilaterally
withdrawing from the treaty if an agreement was not reached.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is scheduled to visit
Moscow next week, and the missile defense program will be a major
topic of her three days of meetings with senior leaders, including
Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov and Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction on Wednesday from Yeltsin's
government, but Russia has long opposed the creation of an American
missile defense, vehemently so after President Ronald Reagan
envisioned a space-based ``Star Wars'' program in 1983, to defend
the United States from an all-out nuclear attack by the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Cohen also outlined a series of changes
in the Pentagon's programs to build a national missile defense
system and more limited anti-missile defenses intended to protect
specific regions or troops in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still has not approved building any national missile
defense. But with more nations building or acquiring ballistic
missiles and with political pressure mounting from Republicans in
Congress, the administration has come much closer to a decision to
build a system.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing beside the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Henry H. Shelton, Cohen confirmed the administration's plans to
pledge $6.6 billion in the next six years to build a defensive
network of radars and interceptor missiles.
</P>
<P>
   That pledge _ sort of like earnest money put down by a home
buyer _ would increase the budget for a national missile defense
system to $10.5 billion between now and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's remarks also made it clear that the Pentagon considers
the possibility of a ballistic missile attack from ``rogue'' states
like North Korea, Iran or Iraq no longer a distant threat, which
was the Pentagon's official position only a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are affirming that there is a threat and the threat is
growing and that we expect it will pose a danger not only to our
troops overseas but also to Americans here at home,'' Cohen said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Capitol Hill have long advocated a more
aggressive effort to protect the United States from a strike by a
rogue state or terrorist group or an accidental launch in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans are shocked to discover that our country is
unshielded from the accidental or ruthless launch of even a single
missile over our skies,'' Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma declared
in the Republican response to Clinton's State of the Union message
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., and one of the strongest proponents in
Congress of a missile defense, welcomed the administration's
announcement but said he remained ``skeptical given the president's
continuing lack of a firm commitment to proceed with deployment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., introduced legislation on Wednesday
that again called for the deployment of a national missile defense
``as soon as it is technologically possible'' and called for still
more money to be spent on the effort. A similar bill failed in the
Senate last year by only one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran endorsed negotiating changes in the treaty but also said
the United States should consider withdrawing from it, if
necessary. ``The most important thing is doing what is in our
national security interests to protect American citizens and the
territory against ballistic missile attack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the Soviet Union signed the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty in 1972 to limit the number, type and placement of
missiles that could be used to counter enemy missiles. The treaty
has been amended in the past, most recently in 1997 to acknowledge
the breakup of the Soviet Union and to clarify the distinction
between national missile defenses and the more limited ``theater''
missile defenses permitted under the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty allows either the United States or Russia to withdraw
with six months notice ``if it decides that extraordinary events
related to the subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized its
supreme interests.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawing from the treaty would have profound diplomatic
repercussions for the United States. Such a move could be
interpreted as a lack of American commitment to other treaties, and
it could undercut efforts to get Russia's parliament to ratify the
second strategic arms reduction treaty, or START 2.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen emphasized that he believed it was in the U.S. interest to
continue to abide by the treaty, which he said served to deter a
resumption of a nuclear arms race. But he said the treaty needed to
make room for a national missile defense, which he added was
``focused primarily on countering rogue-nation threats and will not
be capable of countering Russia's nuclear deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   While amending or abrogating the treaty would complicate
relations with Russia, the deployment of a national missile defense
system could also anger China, which has only limited nuclear
ballistic missile capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   There are still enormous hurdles to overcome before the United
States could even field a defense system. Even with a pledge of
additional money, the program remains burdened by technological
problems, and some analysts doubt that a viable system can ever be
built.
</P>
<P>
   The system now being developed is a shadow of Reagan's grand
vision of using lasers in space to create an impenetrable shield
protecting the nation from nuclear attack. In recent years, the
Pentagon's researchers have instead concentrated on using missiles
_ perhaps based in Alaska or North Dakota or on ships _ to
intercept a handful of incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The system faces a pivotal test in June when the program's
developers, led by Boeing Co., will launch a dummy missile from
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to try to destroy a missile
fired from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon now plans four tests before next June. At that
time, Cohen said, the administration will decide whether to move
ahead with deployment. But Cohen signaled that the administration's
plan now envisioned building a system, if one proves feasible, in
2005, a delay of two years from the administration's previous
timetable.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration has not yet given final approval, the
nation's military leaders believe a decision to build a system is
now inevitable, a senior defense official said. ``In the
Pentagon,'' the official said, ``there's no question this is going
to happen.''

   There's no time like the first time
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Bradley
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is the first time. It might or might not be the
last time. It is absolutely the best time.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are going to the Super Bowl. Five months ago, five
days ago, who among us thought it possible? That's why this will be
the time of all possible times. No matter what happens 10 days
hence in Pro Player Stadium, no matter how many Super Bowls the
Falcons might _ or might not _ go on to win, this will be the one
we treasure, the one we highlight, the one that serves as our
psychic touchstone.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, by definition, comes once. The first time is all
innocence and bliss, all wide eyes and full hearts. Nobody is
jaded, nobody too consumed by what the outcome will be. (If the
Falcons beat Denver, great. If not, still great.) We're not yet
bottom-liners with these Dirty Birds. We're not yet where we are
with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   There was, you'll recall, another first time. The Braves won the
NL West in 1991, came from 3-2 down to beat Pittsburgh and thereby
qualified for _ the World Series! Hadn't happened before. For all
we knew, it might never happen again. And we, meaning all of us,
were, as they say, In The Moment. We bought our foam tomahawks and
grappled for tickets and thought of nothing else. Outside the old
stadium, guys took turns beating a tom-tom all day and all of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the time of our lives, and not just ours. ``Ninety-five
was great,'' Steve Avery said, meaning the year the Braves finally
won it all, ``but '91 was the best.'' The Braves lost Game 7 in the
Metrodome, but we didn't much care. Half a million of us turned out
for a parade to salute the gallant runners-up, a parade that so
overflowed with good feeling it nearly became a riot.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lemke was our scruffy idol, Terry Pendleton our fearless
leader, John Schuerholz our guiding light. The Braves had taken us
where we never thought they would, and for that we all gave
heartfelt thanks. But the heart hardens with time. Atlanta has
hosted six more baseball postseasons, each less momentous than the
one before. Remember last October and the unsold seats? Back in the
giddy days of 1991, did anyone believe we could become so blase?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have given us a second chance at a first time.
Through them, we get to live again what was supposed to happen only
once. The Falcons have given us new heroes, new amazements. The
Falcons have overridden cynicism and negativity, have reminded us
that sports can be about something other than grousing about Bobby
Cox's lineup card.
</P>
<P>
   But with First Time, Take 2, there comes the built-in caveat:
Wring every drop of enjoyment from it now. If they beat Denver,
we'll demand that they do it again. If they lose, we'll wonder what
strengthening moves will be made. Sure, we'll buy more tickets for
their games and pay attention in a way we haven't, but nothing the
Falcons do will ever seem so sweet, so pure, so uplifting.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days until Super Bowl XXXIII. Ten days to drink in the
elixir we thought had been guzzled. Ten days to feel like a
5-year-old on Christmas morning. Ten precious days.

 &HT;    Laettner is dealt to Pistons
 &HT;    By Jeffery Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA opens its doors at 2 p.m., but the Atlanta Hawks are in
desperate straits and apparently far from ready. They can't even
practice today.
</P>
<P>
   With the seven-year working agreement finally in place, player
signings can commence at 2 and teams can start practice at that
point. The 50-game schedule will be released today (NBA.com at 5
p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   But the Hawks have been turned down by important outside free
agents and are having a difficult time getting their own under
contract.
</P>
<P>
   When the bell rings they likely won't have enough players to
hold a scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks learned Wednesday that free-agent forward Rick Fox had
turned them down for the second time. His agent said he has elected
to remain with the Los Angeles Lakers with whom he will be eligible
for an early Larry Bird contract next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks had already lost forward Billy Owens, who goes from
Sacramento to Seattle in a sign-and-trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   They were foiled in a bid to complete such a maneuver with
Christian Laettner when he agreed to a three-year, $18 million deal
with Detroit. The Pistons must clear $2 million of cap room to make
that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the Hawks are making no progress with young power forward
Alan Henderson after two negotiating sessions between general
manager Pete Babcock and agent Bill Strickland, who returned to
Washington, D.C., Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have six players, including holdovers Mookie Blaylock,
Steve Smith, Dikembe Mutombo and Ed Gray, plus rookies Roshown
McLeod and Shammond Williams.
</P>
<P>
   They are expected to tender forward Tyrone Corbin an offer at
the $1 million minimum, but Corbin said Wednesday afternoon he
would like a two-year deal and had not heard from the team. Corbin
does not have an agent but has asked Steve Smith's representative
Dr. Charles Tucker to look around for him in case the Hawks do not
come through.
</P>
<P>
   One ray of hope came in the form of a teaser. Charles Barkley, a
free agent, said he would decide among Houston, Seattle and Atlanta
by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, general manager Pete Babcock and scouting director
Gary Wortman were working the phones to line up players for camp,
if only on ``make goods.'' One of these, Ivano Newbill, declined
and headed to Washington, the only team to make him a firm offer.
The Wizards expect center Georghe Muresan to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Corbin and Henderson, the Hawks will only have eight
players until recruits come to town. They can't practice today
because Life University's court isn't available, so they will start
two-a-days at 9:30 Friday morning with a public practice Saturday
at 5:30 at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks president Stan Kasten said Babcock was working to develop
a full roster as he attempts to bring in a contributing small
forward or power forward to fill the middle-class exception slot at
$1.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of Henderson, Kasten said, ``The important thing
is we want him and he wants to play here,'' but the two sides may
be as much as $3 million apart in salary for this season on a
six-or-seven year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a number of other teams have been doing business
successfully, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the important deals in progress:.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Conference favorite Indiana will sign free-agent
center-forward Sam Perkins for two years, $3.7 million and may also
add veteran point guard Derek Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent forwards Loy Vaught and Laettner are going to
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   New York has landed troubled Latrell Sprewell from Golden State
for John Starks and Chris Mills after acquiring young forward
Marcus Camby for Charles Oakley in June. Meanwhile, and power
broker agent David Falk was trying to find a way to gift wrap
free-agent point guard Rod Strickland for them.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando will pick up free-agent center Ike Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte will sign forward Derrick Coleman, but lost centers
Matt Geiger (Philadelphia) and Vlade Divac (still unsigned).
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is bringing in defensive center Jim McIlwaine from
Seattle where he was known as Wally's Folly after being signed to a
rich contract by general manager Wally Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle reportedly has agreed to a sign and trade deal for Owens
and, after going $3 million under the cap and could go $5 million
under, using that to land Divac.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has added free agent center Luc Longley, but has
apparently lost Antonio McDyess to Denver and is pursuing Tom
Gugliotta who wants to play there.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento wants Divac but would have to renounce power forward
Michael Stewart and forward Corliss Williamson to put a blockbuster
deal together.
</P>
<P>
   As for the agreement, the NBA yielded on one point Wednesday,
permitting six-year contracts for middle class exception players
after agreeing to three years. There was also disagreement over
several lesser details that were decided early Wednesday afternoon.

CUBA-ECONOMY-3-COX, 1-20 -- Bicyles dominate city traffic in the
Cuban capital due to fuel shortages. Forty years after coming to
power, President Fidel Castro appears to be putting the brakes on
economic reforms that marked the first years of this decade. The
shift is due, in part, to the financial meltdowns in Asia and
elsewhere, which Castro points to as proof that Cuba's socialism
remains the best model after all. (Rick McKay/Cox News Service)

DOW FALLS 19.31 AMID PROFIT-TAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Minn., Mass., N.J.) (lb) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shrugging off the latest caution by Alan Greenspan,
the Federal Reserve Board chairman, stock prices marched higher
during the morning on Wednesday but then faded in the final hour or
so and ended mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, technology stocks supplied much of the lift, spurred
by the surprisingly strong profits reported by Microsoft after the
markets closed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But with the quarterly earnings season in full stride, investors
seemed inclined to take profits on upbeat reports, with General
Motors a prominent example. The auto giant's shares jumped as much
as 4 points, to 92 _ practically double their low on Oct. 8 _ after
announcing a big jump in earnings, only to slip back to 88 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   And several Internet stocks, which have dazzled for so long,
fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.31 points, or 0.2
percent, to 9,335.91, after rising nearly 125 points during the
day. Nineteen of its 30 blue-chip components posted losses. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index
followed a similar pattern but hung on to small gains. Nasdaq edged
up 7.32 points, to 2,415.49, its second straight record, and the
S&AMP;P 500 rose 4.62 points, to 1,256.62.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market valuation level scares a lot of people,'' said
James Paulsen, chief strategist at Norwest Investment Management in
Minneapolis. Nonetheless, he added, the economy is strong and stock
prices relative to bond prices are still lower than they were last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was less blunt in his appraisal of the stock market,
the subject of close scrutiny by policy-makers these days. He told
the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday that current
valuation levels ``would appear to envision substantially greater
growth of profits than has been experienced of late.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan, confirming widespread belief, also seemed to rule
out raising interest rates despite an economy still growing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't have a global crisis, you'd be worried that the
guy is setting himself for a tightening stance,'' said Mark Lapman,
executive vice president of Independence Investment Associates in
Boston. ``But he can't do that at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that President Clinton's State of the Union
message, which included a proposal to invest Social Security money
in stocks, was a modest plus on Wednesday. Tobacco stocks, however,
tumbled because of the president's surprise announcement of a
federal lawsuit. Philip Morris fell 2 3/8, to 48 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft surged 7, to 162 5/8, while Dell Computer rose 3 3/16,
to 85 5/16. Texas Instruments rose 6 5/8, to 99 5/8, after
reporting improved profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong earnings seem to be carrying the market,'' Michael
Pendergast, managing director of HGK Asset Management in Jersey

 &HT;    Probe will find Atlanta bid was clean, Payne says
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's Olympic organizers say they would welcome an
investigation, if only to quash continuing speculation about what
misdeeds might have occurred in trying to get the 1996 Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be delighted to talk about the experience: the good, the
bad and the difficult,'' said Billy Payne, leader of the volunteer
bid committee and later president of the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games. ``We ain't perfect, and we ain't arrogant, but we
didn't bribe anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he is weary of the media barrage distracting him from
his current job as a top executive with Premiere Technologies. He
also said he hasn't heard the first word from any of the four
investigations into suspected wrongdoing by Salt Lake City Olympic
organizers. Although the International Olympic Committee said it
would expand its inquiry to other cities if presented with
evidence, Payne said no one has contacted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will talk to anybody,'' he said in an interview in his
sixth-floor office at Premiere headquarters near Lenox Square.
``Notwithstanding the fact that we all have other jobs now, and
this was 10 or 12 years ago, and it's hard to remember, we're still
put in a position where we have to explain the fact that we
competed under the rules, which is kind of regrettable. But we're
not stonewalling anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he responded to IOC inquiries in 1990 after Atlanta
won the Games. At that time, the IOC convened representatives of
all bid cities in Lausanne, Switzerland, and grilled them about the
bid process and any abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so euphoric, we didn't have anything bad to say about
the process,'' Payne said. He said he does not recall any losing
bidders citing specific problems. ``We would say what we already
said. We played by the rules. There was nothing untoward, nothing
unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Battle, a key member of Atlanta's bid effort and later
head of ACOG's international relations, said Wednesday, ``In some
ways I wish they'd just investigate us, because I don't think
they'd find anything. And then they'd give us a clean bill of
health, and we could get on with things.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle, now president of Central Atlanta Progress, a downtown
business group, is the most public member from the Atlanta Olympic
effort. He said he has fielded dozens of media calls from around
the globe since the Salt Lake influence-peddling scandal broke in
November. The interest in Atlanta will only intensify now that the
IOC has promised to look beyond the awarding of the 2002 Games and
reportedly has unearthed unethical activities in Toronto and
Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   A report authored by the IOC's Dick Pound, a Montreal lawyer,
details influence-peddling in the awarding of Olympics dating back
to the 1980s, according to the Wall Street Journal, which has seen
the report. Pound details activities of sports agents attempting to
sell IOC votes for millions of dollars in bribes. And it implicates
as many as 16 IOC members, who could face expulsion for violating
IOC ethics by accepting payments and gifts from Salt Lake City bid
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he was ``shocked'' when confronted with allegations
that Salt Lake officials provided scholarships, medical care,
lavish gifts and cold cash to IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salt Lake had the best bid on its merits to host the Winter
Olympic Games,'' Payne said. ``It was not necessary, given the
incredible impressiveness of their bid, to move outside at all the
permitted boundaries of the bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   While all bidding cities were required to provide first-class
airfare and accommodations for visiting IOC members, Payne said,
the scholarships, cosmetic surgery and expensive rifles and ski
trips supposedly offered by Salt Lake officials crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's inappropriate, clearly,'' Payne said, referring to the
$400,000 scholarship program that benefited relatives of at least
six IOC members. ``It is systematic. it is organized. It is
intentional. I even saw where a member of their board said, `Yeah,
we used the Atlanta model.' Well, we didn't have a scholarship
program. We didn't have a model.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne's close ally on the Atlanta bid effort, former Mayor
Andrew Young, said last week he thought the scholarship program was
acceptable, because it helped poor Africans receive an education.
Payne said he disagrees, but conceded that he understood Young's
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Andy espouses that there is nothing wrong with this
program, I know from the bottom reaches of his heart he sincerely
believes that,'' Payne said. ``In this particular context, as it
relates to the fact that relatives of these students were to later
cast their vote, I think it is inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Young recently admitted delivering athletic equipment and
apparel to Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC member implicated in the
scandal. The goods, to be distributed to African youth, were
delivered a month before Atlanta won the bid in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But Payne gave Young his unqualified support. ``You're talking
about the conduct of one of the greatest human beings that God ever
put on this earth,'' Payne said about Young, bristling when asked
if Young's activities were questionable in the context of the
current scandal. ``So, when Andy Young tells me and others that in
taking those balls and T-shirts to those kids he was doing it as a
part of what he considered his mandate in life, to help others,
then I would support that with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As for courting the IOC, Payne said, ``We were told that
first-class air fare was what you provide them, that gifts up to
$200 or $150 were permitted. Instead of taking them to fancy
restaurants, we took them into our homes. We felt it was just an
extension of Southern hospitality. I felt we were showing our city
in its best light.'' Payne said he did not know that some IOC
members habitually cashed in their first-class tickets instead of
using them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an obligation to reimburse them for first-class air
fare,'' he said. ``Whether or not we had an obligation to strap
them in a lie detector chair and ask them if they used it, I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he was never approached by any consultants seeking
bribes for votes and wouldn't have responded favorably if he had.
</P>
<P>
   As the IOC executive board convenes in Lausanne this weekend to
interrogate the indicted and discuss reform of the bid-selection
process, Payne and other former Atlanta Olympic officials debate
whether to hold a news conference here to manage what might become
a flood of inquiries. ``I have ultimate responsibility and
accountability for everything that happened during the bid,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he expressed disagreement with calls by Salt Lake
organizers and others for IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch to
take similar responsibility for the actions of IOC members. ``I'm
giving him the benefit of the doubt, primarily because I'm grateful
to him,'' he said. ``And I haven't seen any hard evidence to date
that connects him to this wrongdoing, and he's done so much for the
Olympic movement.''

 &HT;    Kirk gets help in BASS win
 &HT;    By Scott Benarde
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Danny Kirk needs to send a thank-you card to one of the
lockmasters on the Kissimmee, Fla., Chain of Lakes. Along with his
last-minute fishing ability, she was a necessary ingredient in the
Bartow angler's win last weekend at the BASS Master Florida Top 150
bass tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The lockmaster reopened the lock at the last minute after Kirk
had caught two fish in his final 10 minutes that were big enough to
lift him past local guide Terry Segraves and well-known pro Shaw
Grigsby and earn him the first-place check of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really need to send her a card,'' Kirk said Tuesday. ``But I
don't even know her name.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the chain of more than 10 lakes are linked by canals and
a series of dams and locks, Kirk needed to pass through a lock to
get back to the weigh-in in time to avoid any penalties. The
weigh-in was on Lake Tohopekaliga, two lakes away from Lake
Hatchineha, where Kirk was fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk, 41, had planned to leave his spot on Hatchineha at 1:30
p.m. to make the 2:30 weigh-in, but at 1:27, he caught his fifth
keeper _ the limit is five fish _ out of a large school of fish.
With more fish nearby, he pushed the deadline and caught two more
to replace two smaller ones and left his spot at 1:37. He caught
the final two fish on a Carolina-rigged chartreuse/pepper centipede
Zoom soft plastic bait.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Kirk hadn't reached the lock, the lockmaster gave
him an extra minute or two. ``They heard me coming,'' Kirk said.
``They knew how many of us were down there, so they waited.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk's four-day total of 20 fish weighing 41 pounds was seven
ounces heavier than fish caught by Segraves and Grigsby, who both
caught 40 pounds, 9 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first major win for Kirk, who hopes the win will lead
to a berth in his second consecutive BASS Masters Classic this
summer, and the first major win for a Georgian since Kim Carver's
win in the Red Man All-American last year.
</P>
<P>
   The win lifted Kirk to 36th in the trail's points standings with
three tournaments remaining. The top 25 points winners advance to
the Classic. Kirk has 377 points; 412 is 25th place. However,
because the worst finish is thrown out in determining Classic
qualifiers, Kirk's 112th place in season's first tournament in
Maryland could disappear and move him up in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Bruce of Buford also had a top-10 finish, placing fifth
with a 38-6 total, earning him $14,000. Bruce is 39th in the points
standings. Canton's Mark Hardin was 13th with a 25-5 total for
three days; only the top 10 fished in the final round. That finish
earned him $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   New licensing system
</P>
<P>
   The Wildlife Resources Division of the state Department of
Natural Resources is installing its new electronic license system
for 1999. Pilot sites for field tests should be open by the end of
the week. Sites include regional WRD offices, Bass Pro Shops in
Duluth and the Sports Authority on Northlake Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   Show a success
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill Williams' fishing show last weekend at the North Atlanta
Trade Center drew compliments from patrons, exhibitors and the
producer. Producer Bill Winzinger was happy because ``all the
asphalt in the parking lot was covered.'' Exhibitors such as West
Point Lake guide Ron Savage were happy because they were booking
fishing trips from a crowd that, while not close to being as large
as a Fisharama, was in a spending mood.

 Linking Up Several PCs At Home  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  My wife just got a new computer, so now we're a
two-computer household. The PCs are in different rooms. Is there a
simple way to link them so that we can easily move files back and
forth? How about a way that I can use her high-speed modem?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You're probably a good candidate for home networking.
Several products are available now that can connect multiple PCs in
a house without having to wire the computers together. One of them,
WebGear's Aviator ($150), uses radio-frequency technology to
connect computers as far as 125 feet apart. It works through walls,
ceilings and floors. A second option is a system such as the
soon-to-be-available HomeFree from Diamond Multimedia ($100). It
connects two or more PCs through the telephone lines in your home.
</P>
<P>
   Both Aviator and HomeFree let connected PCs share a single
resource such as a printer or modem. So yes, you'd be able to get
on the Internet from your PC by connecting via the modem in your
wife's machine. How's that for cool?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have so many promotional floppy disks, especially from AOL,
that I don't need to buy any. However, in order to erase and reuse
these freebies, I have to cover the extra square hole in the
corner. I have often done this with Scotch tape, but I wonder
whether I am risking glomming up my disk drive. Is this safe, and
is there a better way?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: It's safe, and in fact, it's a great idea. People do the
same thing with VCR cassettes all the time. The only problem would
be if the tape were to come loose and get stuck inside the drive.
If you use a taped floppy a lot, consider changing the tape now and
then to keep it fresh.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: My Windows 95 taskbar with the Start button on it has
vanished. How do I restore it? I have double-clicked all over the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Sounds like a mystery worthy of Hercule Poirot. The Case
of the Vanishing Taskbar. But there's no body, no motive and no
love subplot, so it probably wouldn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that you inadvertently dragged the top edge of the
taskbar downward with your mouse, which caused the bar to
disappear. You still should see a very thin gray line across the
bottom of the screen. Place your cursor on it, and with the left
mouse button pressed, drag upward a little. The taskbar should
reappear.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: I am a Windows 3.1 user and would like to upgrade to
Windows 95. However, all the stores I have gone to only sell the
Windows 98 upgrade. Will that program give me Windows 95 as well,
or do I need a different one?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: You're a little unclear on the concept. Windows 98 is the
successor to Windows 95. It's basically the same operating system
but with some improvements. You can upgrade directly from Windows
3.1 to Windows 98. So you don't need Windows 95. Think of it this
way: Why would you buy a 3-year-old car when you can get this
year's model for the same price?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of COMPUTIN (79043 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;   &LR; Q: My ISP is AT&AMP;T WorldNet. When I signed up, I used a CD that
installed special software on my hard drive and then guided me
through the sign-up process. (It's similar in that respect to AOL.)
Now I'd also like to use WorldNet on my laptop, but it doesn't have
a CD-ROM drive. Is it possible to use the Windows Internet
connection wizard on the laptop to add the WorldNet account? And if
so, where can I get the account information such as my password?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, you can use the Internet wizard to create a Dial-Up
Networking connection for WorldNet. All the information you'll need
is in a file called Account.txt, which is stored on the hard drive
of your PC. The latest version of AT&AMP;T's software puts it in a
folder called User, which is a subfolder of the main WorldNet
folder. The file includes your log-in name and password, the DNS
numbers for the Internet connection, and other useful stuff such as
the server names for mail and news.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; If you do a lot of downloading from the Net, consider a program
such as GetRight, which makes downloading a breeze. It lets you
pause anytime during a download and resume later on without having
to start all over. (This can come in handy if you're accidentally
disconnected during a download.) And if a download is going really
slowly, you can ask GetRight to switch to a faster site. You can
get this $17.50 shareware program at  &LR; www.getright.com. &LR;

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Spalding Gray &LR; , whose ``Morning, Noon and Night'' received
mixed reviews when it played here New Year's week, gives his own
mixed reviews to the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   When performing here, he says in the latest issue of Elle,
``People get what I'm doing, they understand it, they know what
irony is _ but they won't let themselves indulge. Last time I
performed in Berkeley there was a lag between the lines and the
laughter. I realized it was the audience's inner censor, reviewing
it all in their heads: Is this PC? Is this spiritually correct? Is
it all right to laugh?''
</P>
<P>
   He describes the difference between Cambridge, Mass., and
Berkeley, ``which are, to me, similar towns on different coasts. I
remember asking a married woman in Cambridge whether or not she had
ever had an extramarital affair. And she said: `I'm not gonna
answer that.' I said: `Why?' She said, `Because I live here _ and
you're leaving tomorrow.' This is good, I thought. She knows how to
make boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out in San Francisco the tendency would be to go into a really
detailed confession. A woman there was talking about how she was
trying to do an art piece. ... She was having a real problem with
it. I said: `Why?' She said: `Because they're all controlled by
men, and ... well, I've never told anyone this before, but I'm gay.
And I have my lover here in the audience ...' The trumpets were
blowing, the audience was cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   The interviewer asks Gray why there's that difference between
Cambridge and San Francisco, and he cites the old saw: ``Someone
tipped the United States on its side and all the smart people held
on. ... There's definitely a different race out there.''
</P>

<P>
   &UR; THE MAKING OF A HIT FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Actor &UR; Val Kilmer &LR; , profiled in the latest issue of W, has less
than fine memories of some of the films he's made. In ``Top Gun,''
for example, Kilmer played a smaller part than stars  &UR; Tom &LR; 
 &UR; Cruise  &LR; and  &UR; Kelly McGillis &LR; , who was a college friend from
Juilliard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any scenes together in `Top Gun,' '' he said,
``but we'd hang together and she'd come over and cry, `I'm four
feet taller than him!' Believe me, that movie didn't feel like it
looked. I don't know how much movie there is if you take out the
second-unit flying stuff and the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did an amazing job on all that stuff, but it just didn't
feel like we were really on  &LR; to something there. Then it made all
that money, and people still talk about it and revere it.''

he would ``leap to my feet in applause in the comfort of my living
room.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Still getting even for the president not having served in
Vietnam?  &UR; Steve Warren &LR;  forwards word that the movie broadcast just
before the State of the Union message by AFTRS, the Armed Forces

president's six-minute crossword record:  &UR; Jon Delfin &LR;  points out
that the crossword puzzle  &UR; Will Shortz &LR;  watched Clinton whiz
through in 1992 was not from the New York Times. It had been
specially prepared for the occasion.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Buoyed by the White House's impeachment defense and
hoping that Senate Republicans are starting to tire, several Senate
Democrats said Wednesday that they might propose voting on the two
impeachment articles early next week in another attempt to end the
trial without calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Democrats, according to their aides, think it is
possible to muster enough Republicans to win a vote on a motion to
proceed to the articles. But under the impeachment rules adopted
unanimously by the Senate, a single senator could block such a
move.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed highly unlikely that all 55 Republicans would agree to
bypass witnesses. Many Republicans have indicated they want to hear
witnesses, though not very many and not for very long.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats have argued that witnesses are unnecessary, and
would only prolong a trial that is already unpopular with the
public. Even if they lost a motion, however, to vote on the
impeachment articles and thus avoid witnesses, they could still
claim a political triumph by painting the Republicans as dragging
out the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many senators at that point of time will have serious
reservations about whether additional witnesses or any witnesses
are needed,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who is a leading
advocate of an early vote on the impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   Many Senate Republicans dismissed Democratic predictions that
calling witnesses would push a trial into March or April, and
consume all other Senate business. ``I don't think it has to be a
mob scene,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. ``They can do it
swiftly.''
</P>
<P>
   But some senior Republican aides acknowledged on the second day
of the White House defense that several senators were eyeing the
calendar and calculating how much time witnesses might take.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're sensing appropriate concern,'' said one top Republican
aide. ``The White House hasn't shifted anyone on the need for
witnesses, but the general fatigue of the process may be adding to
the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate agreement, senators are to debate and vote
early next week on whether to dismiss the case and whether to
depose witnesses. A separate vote would be required on which, if
any, witnesses would be called in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry's plan, which has the blessing of Sen. Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., the Democratic leader, would substitute the vote to dismiss
with a vote to proceed to a vote on the impeachment charges _
perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said he would offer Kerry's plan after
the vote on a motion to dismiss. ``If there are 40 or 45 votes on
the motions,'' he said, ``there is a clear indication there are not
sufficient votes to convict.''
</P>
<P>
   That would pave the way to a vote on the articles of
impeachment, Breaux said. But, again, under the Senate agreement,
any one senator could block such a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans prosecuting Clinton repeated their pleas
Wednesday that their case would be incomplete without calling
witnesses. The House managers want to call at least Monica
Lewinsky, Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president's version is correct, why is he so afraid to
allow these witnesses to come down and just simply take an oath,
stand before the bar of the Senate and tell the truth?'' said Rep.
James Rogan, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Off the Senate floor, the managers fiercely rebutted the White
House's arguments, issuing 14 news releases Wednesday using the
format ``White House Claim'' and ``The Truth.'' The managers
challenged the White House's facts and interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over witnesses intensifies, the House prosecutors
are sharply divided over whether to offer new evidence next week
that some managers say points to a pattern of obstruction of
justice by Clinton and his aides.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate would have to admit such evidence into the record by
a majority vote, and some Democrats and Republicans say they are
deeply skeptical of introducing material that is outside the scope
of the two impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the House prosecutors, or managers, should
offer unsubstantiated evidence about Clinton's alleged encounters
with several women, some of whom denied those allegations under
oath in affidavits filed in the Paula Jones civil case.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the obstruction of justice charge, House prosecutors
accuse Clinton of encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to cover up their affair
by filing a false affidavit in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the prosecutors feel they can buttress that charge by
giving senators examples of other allegations of sexual misconduct
in which, the managers claim, women might have been pressured not
to disclose the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no interest in getting into any of the sexual
aspects,'' said Rogan. ``What I am very interested in are the
potential facts that may relate to false affidavits being filed.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of the other 13 managers fear that bringing up the
salacious material, which was not part of the impeachment articles,
would distract senators from the prosecution's core case, and give
appearance the prosecutors are desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be going too far afield from the scope of our
presentation,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. ``It is important
we stay focused on our presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the lead manager, indicated in an
interview that he is cool to the idea of introducing new material
at this late stage of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors say they will not settle their internal debate,
which was first reported in Wednesday's editions of The Hill, a
Capitol Hill semiweekly newspaper, until they gauge the impact of
the White House's defense and questions from senators.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans and Democrats were preparing for the 16-hour
questioning period at the end of this week, by culling and
organizing queries submitted by lawmakers to avoid repetition and
put them in a logical order.
</P>
<P>
   Among the women the managers might want to introduce is Kathleen
Willey, a former White House volunteer who accused Clinton of
groping her outside the Oval Office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the House managers, Reps. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., met last week with Ms. Willey and her lawyer,
and came away divided on whether she could strengthen the
prosecution's case.

CUBA-ECONOMY-3-COX, 1-20 -- Bicyles dominate city traffic in the
Cuban capital due to fuel shortages. Forty years after coming to
power, President Fidel Castro appears to be putting the brakes on
economic reforms that marked the first years of this decade. The
shift is due, in part, to the financial meltdowns in Asia and
elsewhere, which Castro points to as proof that Cuba's socialism
remains the best model after all. (Rick McKay/Cox News Service)

 Linking Up Several PCs At Home  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  My wife just got a new computer, so now we're a
two-computer household. The PCs are in different rooms. Is there a
simple way to link them so that we can easily move files back and
forth? How about a way that I can use her high-speed modem?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You're probably a good candidate for home networking.
Several products are available now that can connect multiple PCs in
a house without having to wire the computers together. One of them,
WebGear's Aviator ($150), uses radio-frequency technology to
connect computers as far as 125 feet apart. It works through walls,
ceilings and floors. A second option is a system such as the
soon-to-be-available HomeFree from Diamond Multimedia ($100). It
connects two or more PCs through the telephone lines in your home.
</P>
<P>
   Both Aviator and HomeFree let connected PCs share a single
resource such as a printer or modem. So yes, you'd be able to get
on the Internet from your PC by connecting via the modem in your
wife's machine. How's that for cool?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have so many promotional floppy disks, especially from AOL,
that I don't need to buy any. However, in order to erase and reuse
these freebies, I have to cover the extra square hole in the
corner. I have often done this with Scotch tape, but I wonder
whether I am risking glomming up my disk drive. Is this safe, and
is there a better way?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: It's safe, and in fact, it's a great idea. People do the
same thing with VCR cassettes all the time. The only problem would
be if the tape were to come loose and get stuck inside the drive.
If you use a taped floppy a lot, consider changing the tape now and
then to keep it fresh.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: My Windows 95 taskbar with the Start button on it has
vanished. How do I restore it? I have double-clicked all over the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Sounds like a mystery worthy of Hercule Poirot. The Case
of the Vanishing Taskbar. But there's no body, no motive and no
love subplot, so it probably wouldn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that you inadvertently dragged the top edge of the
taskbar downward with your mouse, which caused the bar to
disappear. You still should see a very thin gray line across the
bottom of the screen. Place your cursor on it, and with the left
mouse button pressed, drag upward a little. The taskbar should
reappear.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: I am a Windows 3.1 user and would like to upgrade to
Windows 95. However, all the stores I have gone to only sell the
Windows 98 upgrade. Will that program give me Windows 95 as well,
or do I need a different one?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: You're a little unclear on the concept. Windows 98 is the
successor to Windows 95. It's basically the same operating system
but with some improvements. You can upgrade directly from Windows
3.1 to Windows 98. So you don't need Windows 95. Think of it this
way: Why would you buy a 3-year-old car when you can get this
year's model for the same price?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of COMPUTIN (79043 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;   &LR; Q: My ISP is AT&AMP;T WorldNet. When I signed up, I used a CD that
installed special software on my hard drive and then guided me
through the sign-up process. (It's similar in that respect to AOL.)
Now I'd also like to use WorldNet on my laptop, but it doesn't have
a CD-ROM drive. Is it possible to use the Windows Internet
connection wizard on the laptop to add the WorldNet account? And if
so, where can I get the account information such as my password?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, you can use the Internet wizard to create a Dial-Up
Networking connection for WorldNet. All the information you'll need
is in a file called Account.txt, which is stored on the hard drive
of your PC. The latest version of AT&AMP;T's software puts it in a
folder called User, which is a subfolder of the main WorldNet
folder. The file includes your log-in name and password, the DNS
numbers for the Internet connection, and other useful stuff such as
the server names for mail and news.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; If you do a lot of downloading from the Net, consider a program
such as GetRight, which makes downloading a breeze. It lets you
pause anytime during a download and resume later on without having
to start all over. (This can come in handy if you're accidentally
disconnected during a download.) And if a download is going really
slowly, you can ask GetRight to switch to a faster site. You can
get this $17.50 shareware program at  &LR; www.getright.com. &LR;

SPALDING GRAY SAYS WE AIN'T GOT BRAINS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Spalding Gray &LR; , whose ``Morning, Noon and Night'' received
mixed reviews when it played here New Year's week, gives his own
mixed reviews to the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   When performing here, he says in the latest issue of Elle,
``People get what I'm doing, they understand it, they know what
irony is _ but they won't let themselves indulge. Last time I
performed in Berkeley there was a lag between the lines and the
laughter. I realized it was the audience's inner censor, reviewing
it all in their heads: Is this PC? Is this spiritually correct? Is
it all right to laugh?''
</P>
<P>
   He describes the difference between Cambridge, Mass., and
Berkeley, ``which are, to me, similar towns on different coasts. I
remember asking a married woman in Cambridge whether or not she had
ever had an extramarital affair. And she said: `I'm not gonna
answer that.' I said: `Why?' She said, `Because I live here _ and
you're leaving tomorrow.' This is good, I thought. She knows how to
make boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out in San Francisco the tendency would be to go into a really
detailed confession. A woman there was talking about how she was
trying to do an art piece. ... She was having a real problem with
it. I said: `Why?' She said: `Because they're all controlled by
men, and ... well, I've never told anyone this before, but I'm gay.
And I have my lover here in the audience ...' The trumpets were
blowing, the audience was cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   The interviewer asks Gray why there's that difference between
Cambridge and San Francisco, and he cites the old saw: ``Someone
tipped the United States on its side and all the smart people held
on. ... There's definitely a different race out there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MAKING OF A HIT FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Actor &UR; Val Kilmer &LR; , profiled in the latest issue of W, has less
than fine memories of some of the films he's made. In ``Top Gun,''
for example, Kilmer played a smaller part than stars  &UR; Tom &LR; 
 &UR; Cruise  &LR; and  &UR; Kelly McGillis &LR; , who was a college friend from
Juilliard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any scenes together in `Top Gun,' '' he said,
``but we'd hang together and she'd come over and cry, `I'm four
feet taller than him!' Believe me, that movie didn't feel like it
looked. I don't know how much movie there is if you take out the
second-unit flying stuff and the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did an amazing job on all that stuff, but it just didn't
feel like we were really on  &LR; to something there. Then it made all
that money, and people still talk about it and revere it.''
</P>
<P>

 Golden West Profit up 20% In Hot Market  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Golden West Financial Corp., the giant Oakland savings and loan,
said yesterday its fourth-quarter profit rose 19.9 percent as it
took advantage of a sizzling housing market to make a record volume
of mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Golden West, which operates under the name World Savings,
reported net income of $112 million ($1.95 a diluted share) for the
quarter ended in December. In the 1997 fourth quarter, the thrift
earned $93.5 million ($1.62).
</P>
<P>
   The latest profit beat the average analyst forecast of $1.84 a
share, according to First Call Corp. The thrift's shares rose $1.50
to $89.50 on the New York Stock Exchange &LR;   &LR; yesterday. Golden West
specializes in adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs. It keeps ARMs in
its loan portfolio, and it originates fixed-rate loans and sells
them to investors on the secondary market.
</P>
<P>
   When interest rates are low, as they are now, borrowers
generally shun ARMs, instead favoring fixed-rate mortgages to lock
in cheap rates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this unfriendly climate for ARMs in the fourth quarter,
Golden West made $2.5 billion in mortgages, up 27 percent from the
comparable period the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Although Golden West made more fixed-rate loans than usual, the
thrift still was successful selling its staple product. Almost
three of every four mortgages it originated during the period were
adjustable.
</P>
<P>
   That was down from the 93 percent ARM rate in the 1997 fourth
quarter but still was one of the highest percentages in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Golden West posted big gains on
secondary-market sales of the fixed-rate loans that it did make.
That helped push up noninterest income 72.8 percent during the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a much better quarter than expected,'' said Caren
Mayer, an analyst with NationsBanc Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco. ``They showed a real ability to stick to their strategy
and generate great earnings in this environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden West's total assets fell 2.8 percent during the year to
$38.5 billion because of its sales of fixed-rate loans.
</P>
<P>
   Golden West also benefited from falling interest rates on
deposits, which went down faster than rates on its mortgages. The
wider gap between what Golden West collected from borrowers and
what it paid to depositors helped boost net interest income 5.7
percent from the year-ago period.

elsewhere, which Castro points to as proof that Cuba's socialism
remains the best model after all. (Rick McKay/Cox News Service)

 Apologetic Pac Bell Cuts Line to Telemarketing Firm  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Pacific Bell said yesterday that it canceled its contract with a
telemarketing firm that was misleading customers about Caller ID
blocking, and will call back everyone who got the telemarketing
pitch to see whether they have the service they want.
</P>
<P>
   The phone company terminated the contract after learning that
Business Response Inc. of St. Louis was doing things ``that
shouldn't have been done,'' Pac Bell spokesman John Britton said.
</P>
<P>
   The company hired BRI to call Pac Bell customers and recommend
that they drop a free service called complete blocking of Caller
ID.
</P>
<P>
   Caller ID is a box that attaches to a phone and displays the
number of an incoming call. Complete blocking prevents a caller's
phone number from appearing in the Caller ID box of the person
receiving the call.
</P>
<P>
   Some Pac Bell customers who got the telemarketing pitch said
they were told that complete blocking no longer existed and that
they would have to switch to selective blocking, which requires
callers to dial 67 each time they make a call in order to block
their phone number from a Caller ID box.
</P>
<P>
   Others were told that a new law would soon end complete blocking
and that customers who did not take advantage of selective blocking
now would have to pay for it later.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those assertions are untrue.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires that all phone companies, including Pac Bell,
offer complete blocking and selective blocking free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Pac Bell suspended the contract with BRI and began
an investigation after getting inquiries from customers and The
Chronicle about the misleading calls.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said the company met with BRI yesterday and found that
some telemarketers were telling customers wrong information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that there were some things a couple of agents did
that were outside the parameters of the scripts we provided,''
Britton said. ``This is a company that's highly respected, and
we're not condemning them at all, but we have acknowledged there
were some things done that shouldn't have been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Britton said he was not sure why the telemarketers were
misleading customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes things happen with employees,'' he said. BRI's
telemarketers work on commission, but Britton would not say whether
that was an incentive.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said this was the first time Pac Bell used the firm,
which came ``highly recommended'' from SBC Communications of San
Antonio, Texas, Pac Bell's parent company.
</P>
<P>
   The phone company has been pushing for customers to dump
complete blocking because it has hurt sales of Caller ID. About 44
percent of California customers have blocks on their lines, meaning
that their phone numbers will not appear in Caller ID boxes. Only
12 percent of customers have subscribed to Caller ID, according to
Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said BRI was supposed to ``recommend'' that a customer
drop the blocking, not force them to get rid of the service.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tyler, chief human resources officer with BRI, said the
company was ``working with Pac Bell on this very closely'' but
referred all inquiries about the contract back to Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler would not discuss the calls some Pac Bell customers say
they received.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of newspaper articles on the misleading
telemarketing calls, Pac Bell engaged in some damage control
yesterday, instructing its service representatives to assure any
customer who called that Pac Bell is not doing anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   According to a script obtained by The Chronicle, Pac Bell
service representatives are supposed to tell customers: ``I can
understand how you might be concerned after reading an article like
that.'' And, ``We only offer our products and services in (an)
ethical and legal manner.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PACBELL2 (79034 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Britton said Pac Bell wants to make sure customers know that the
phone company is sorry for any confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are committed to honest, ethical selling
relationships,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that at some point, Pac Bell may start calling
customers again to ``educate them'' about their blocking options.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell canceled the BRI contract just before today's hearings
at the Public Utilities Commission into whether Pac Bell engaged in
aggressive and misleading sales pitches in the past.

 PG&AMP;E Posts Glowing Profit  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
PG&AMP;E's earnings more than doubled for the fourth quarter, beating
stock analysts' expectations and signaling that the utility holding
company is learning how to capitalize on electric industry
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E Corp., parent of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and four
other subsidiaries, said it earned $196 million (51 cents per
share) on operating revenues of $5.5 billion for the quarter,
blasting past a lackluster profit of $94 million (22 cents)
recorded a year ago on revenues of $4.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1998, PG&AMP;E earned $719 million ($1.88) on revenues of
$19.9 billion, a 7 percent boost compared to per-share earnings of
$1.75 for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E stock rose $1 to close at $31.50 on news of the quarterly
earnings, which were one-third higher than Wall Street expected.
The company also announced yesterday that it will buy back 4 to 5
percent of its common shares, worth $570 million, on the open
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers were exceptionally good,'' said Daniel Tulis,
utility analyst for NationsBanc Montgomery Securities in New York,
who issued a ``strong buy'' recommendation on PG&AMP;E stock.
``Management is starting to get good results from the nonregulated
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to PG&AMP;E's future performance is U.S. Generating Co.,
PG&AMP;E's nonregulated power plant operator based in Bethesda, Md.
During the past year, while regulated utility Pacific Gas and
Electric has been selling off power plants, U.S. Gen has been on a
buying spree.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Gen logged revenues of $650 million for 1998, nearly half
of which came in the final quarter and stemmed from the purchase of
5,100 megawatts of generating capacity from the New England
Electric Sys tem. The fourth quarter was the first full quarter to
reflect revenues from that $1.59 billion acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PGE21 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Although U.S. Gen's contribution to corporate earnings still is
small compared with Pacific Gas and Electric's _ 28 cents per share
versus $1.82 per share _ it shows the dramatic growth made possible
by deregulation. Under deregulation, state and federal regulators
are requiring mainline utilities to sell off generating plants,
generally to multiple buyers, to prevent market dominance that
could permit price gouging.
</P>
<P>
   This creates opportunities for companies like U.S. Gen. Its 1998
profit looks especially good, analysts said, when compared with the
amount it lost in 1997, 10 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the unregulated operators are getting their
house in order,'' said Douglas Christopher, utility analyst for
Crowell, Weedon &AMP; Co. in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   There's the potential for even more striking growth this year.
Parent company PG&AMP;E wants to transfer Pacific Gas and Electric's
huge California hydroelectric system to U.S. Gen if it can do so at
the right price and is seeking regulatory approval from the state
Public Utilities Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The move _ being questioned by a growing consortium of consumer
groups, environmental organizations and water districts _ has the
potential to add another 3,850 megawatts of generating capacity to
U.S. Gen's system. In addition, U.S. Gen is expected to bid on
power plant divestitures by New York's Consolidated Edison and
others in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, U.S. Gen's generating capacity could approach the
amount held by Pacific Gas and Electric prior to energy industry
deregulation which began nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The key difference, both to consumers and PG&AMP;E Corp., is that
the electricity is no longer being priced by regulators, based on
annual utility costs. Instead, deregulation means that commodity
prices are being set by a new electricity marketplace where prices
fluctuate _ sometimes wildly _ by the hour, day and season. Whereas
profits of regulated utilities are capped by regulators at 9 to 12
percent, there are no limitations on the profits allowed
unregulated generators in the commodities energy market.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of PGE21 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Although its power generation business appears to be doing well,
PG&AMP;E still is losing money on the marketing side. PG&AMP;E Energy
Services, an unregulated energy marketer, reported startup losses
that depressed corporate earnings by 14 cents per share for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to narrow losses as we leave the startup
phase,'' said David Kaplan, spokesman for PG&AMP;E Corp. in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E Corp. hopes to get more money out of Pacific Gas and
Electric this year. For 1998, the regulated utility had a return on
equity of roughly 8 percent. That's far less than the maximum
return _ 11.2 percent _ allowed by state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The company is seeking a rate hike for 1999 of nearly $1 billion
that would give it a greater shot at earning its maximum authorized
rate of return. Like the hydro transfer, it is being challenged by
consumer groups. A decision is expected from the PUC this spring.

STUDY OF CANCER AND RACES IS URGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.) (lb) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Institutes of Health need to develop a
broader strategy for finding out why poor people and some ethnic
minority groups are more prone to certain cancers and less likely
to survive them than the rest of the population, an expert panel
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH, the federal agency that sponsors most of the medical
research in the United States, needs to expand the study of why
ethnic and racial groups are disproportionately affected by cancer
and make certain that minority groups are adequately represented in
research trials, the panel said in a report.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member committee of medical, health and research experts,
convened by the Institute of Medicine, said the effort to
understand the impact of cancer on subgroups in the population
would be helped by discarding traditional racial categories and
studying people on the basis of their ethnic and economic
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the term ``race'' is scientifically inaccurate because it
implies fundamental biological differences, which do not exist,
among groups and masks the influence of ethnic background and
lifestyle differences that could be big factors in cancer, panel
members said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alfred Haynes, former president of the Drew Postgraduate
Medical School in Los Angeles and chairman of the committee, said
studies within and between ethnic groups could not only help in
determining what affects their cancer risks but also provide
insights for the general population. Finding out why some ethnic
minority groups are less affected by certain cancers could lead to
ways to reduce risks for the majority, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This information will benefit all Americans and help the
medical community craft prevention strategies that work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said African-American men, for example, have unusually
high rates of prostate cancer, while Asians are more likely to
develop stomach and liver cancer than whites are. Cervical cancer
is higher among Hispanic and Vietnamese-American women, while
African-American women are less likely than others to develop
breast cancer but also less likely to survive it. And while Alaska
natives have high rates of colon and rectal cancer, low-income
whites in rural areas such as Appalachia have some of the highest
rates of lung cancer and other cancers in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Having people in cancer studies in traditional racial categories
_ white, black, Asian or Pacific Islander, or American Indian _
makes it hard to pinpoint factors affecting incidence of the
disease and its treatment within subgroups, the panel said. Asians,
the report noted, include Vietnamese and other Southeast Asians,
Koreans, Japanese, Chinese, Indians and others who are ethnically
and culturally very different.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Congress asked the independent Institute of Medicine, part of
the National Academy of Sciences, to examine the government's
efforts to understand and deal with cancer as it affects poor
Americans, with little insurance and limited access to care, and
ethnic minorities. The committee said the NIH and its National
Cancer Institute were trying to address these issues, but needed to
devote more money and develop a government-wide plan to deal with
them.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said the cancer institute spends about $24 million a
year, or about 1 percent of its budget, on programs specifically
addressing cancer among ethnic minority groups and the poor. These
groups also are included in more general research studies, it said,
but more resources need to be devoted to programs targeted to
minority groups and the medically underserved.

 &HT;    Falcons focus on basic plays
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons practiced later in the season than
ever Wednesday, as they gathered for their first preparation for
Super Bowl XXXIII January 31 in Miami against the Broncos (16-2).
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves and his staff didn't begin installing the game
plan, per se, but they focused on Denver. That means the offense _
minus quarterback Chris Chandler, who was with wife Diane as she
prepared for childbirth _ lined up against Bronco defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons defense, meanwhile, faced Bronco plays.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of concentrating on specific ways to defend those
plays, the Falcons worked on basic schemes. The offense ran its
basic plays rather than those the coaches think stand the best
chance of working against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the word ''concentrate'' is a poor choice.
</P>
<P>
   Players, perhaps distracted by three days of trying to take care
of ticket and hotel reservations for friends and family, had a hard
time focusing, and Reeves had to stop practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were times that we had things that didn't go the way
we'd like them to, and we . . . talked about it,'' he said. ''We
said, 'If we're going to be here . . . let's concentrate on what
we're doing.' We had a good practice after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, 0-3 as a head coach in Super Bowls with the Broncos in
the 1980s, is searching for the right formula to prepare for the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he has tried installing the entire game plan the
week of the game, and he's tried installing the entire game plan
two weeks before the game. This time, he's trying a middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Coaches) are working on the game plan,'' he said. We're not
giving them to the players to where they're going to have to learn
them specifically. We'll try to start next week like a regular
week.''
</P>
<P>
   That means that although the Falcons will get a little more
specific in practice today and Friday, earnest preparation will
begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday and Thursday will be the most important days from a
technical standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Other plans
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has decided players will be allowed to have their
families stay with them at the Miami Airport Hilton and Towers if
they choose. Also, there will be a curfew on some nights, but not
all.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl baby
</P>
<P>
   Diane Chandler gave birth at about 2:30 p.m. Wednesday at North
Fulton Regional Hospital in Alpharetta to the couple's third
daughter. The baby girl, whose name is unknown, was 20 inches long,
and weighed six pounds and 20 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, backup quarterback Steve DeBerg, who turned 45
on Tuesday, worked with the No. 1 offense, and second-year man Tony
Graziani got much more work than normal with the No. 2 and even No.
1 offense.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler is expected to return to practice today.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery Dec. 14,
said he continues to get stronger, but still can't work quite as
long without getting tired. He has no doctor-prescribed limitations
on the sidelines (although he continues to stand back on punts and
kickoffs).
</P>
<P>
   He also re-iterated plans to continue coaching after this
season. ''There is no thought in my mind that I won't continue,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Going home
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will practice next week at the University of Miami.
The only former Miami player on the roster, rookie wide receiver
Jammi German, won't participate because he went on injured reserve
in November with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got mixed emotions because I want to play so bad,'' he said.
''But going back to the facility I was at for five years is
extremely exciting. I've just told the guys to bring shorts,
T-shirts, and flip-flops and they'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight redux?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised to see rookie receiver Tim Dwight line up in
the shotgun against Denver, like he did last Sunday against the
Vikings. He had two rushes for 22 yards in that game, and earlier
this season, he completed a 22-yard pass to Chandler off a reverse.
</P>
<P>
   He had eight rushes for 19 yards in the regular season before
strained knee ligaments reduced his role at midseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we got ready to play Minnesota, and saw some of the
things they did with (receiver/return man) David Palmer, we kind of
said, 'We don't need to save (Dwight) for next week,' '' Reeves
said. ''He's very versatile because he can run with it, throw it,
and catch it, and he's fearless.''
</P>
<P>
   Morten's the man
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Morten Andersen, whose 38-yard field goal gave the
Falcons their 30-27 overtime win over the Vikings, has worked
several prior Super Bowls as a commentator for European TV.
</P>
<P>
   The main station in his native Denmark, however, was not going
to televise this year's game because ratings have gotten so bad.
</P>
<P>
   It will be televised now.
</P>
<P>
   ''The station, TV2, bought the rights from Norway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what current or former NFL great will do the commentary?
Former kicker Jan Stenerud?
</P>
<P>
   ''No,'' Andersen said. ''He's Norwegian.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Other than Chandler, the only player who did not practice was
left defensive end Lester Archambeau, who may not practice until
Wednesday because of a high ankle sprain. . . . Reserve safety and
nickel safety Devin Bush, who did not practice or play last week
because of a strained hamstring, practiced and said, ''It's good.
I'll be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Reeves opted to kick the game-winning field goal against
Minnesota on third-and-9 from the Vikings' 21 last Sunday in case
something went wrong. Atlanta could have called timeout, or, if the
snap was bad, holder Dan Stryzinski could have tried to recover the
fumble, down it, and then Atlanta would have lined up to try
another kick. . . . Also, the Vikings continue to be criticized for
having quarterback Randall Cunningham take a knee with 30 seconds
left in regulation rather than throw downfield on third-and-3 from
the Vikings' 27. Former Vikings offensive coordinator Brian
Billick, hired as the Ravens' coach Tuesday, said if he had it to
do again, he probably would have thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Strange questions
</P>
<P>
   You know the Super Bowl is coming when you hear questions like
those asked of wide receiver Tony Martin by a Denver TV station.
</P>

   He was asked who, between he and receiver Terance Mathis, who
would: Win a 40-yard dash? ''Me.'' A five-mile run? ''Terance.''
Fare better in a trash-talking argument with Denver tight end
Shannon Sharpe? ''Me.'' Win a comedy contest? ''Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember me?
</P>
<P>
   Reeves cut wide receiver Ed McCaffrey from the Giants in '94.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the 6-foot-5, 215-pound McCaffrey caught 64 passes
for 1,053 yards and 10 touchdowns and made the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I've ever made a mistake that bad,'' Reeves said
earlier this season. ''I've had guys go play somewhere else, but
not go on to the level where they could be an All-Pro and a major
contributor on a Super Bowl team.''

 Scrip Goes Electronic  &HT;       
 By Carolyn Said 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's a familiar sight to any parent of a school-age child: A card
table set up outside the cafeteria with PTA volunteers selling
scrip _ gift certificates to Safeway, Lucky's, Macy's, Costco,
Target and other stores _ as a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Now a San Mateo startup hopes to turn scrip sales into an
all-electronic transaction, eliminating the need for card tables,
paper certificates and volunteer time.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Scrip Inc. says it has signed up 120 California
school districts, half of them in the Bay Area, and a dozen
merchants for its program, which launches next month.
</P>
<P>
   It's also negotiating with many more merchants, but can't
identify them until contracts are signed. So far it's signed up
Andronico's, Draeger's and several smaller grocery stores; Payless
Shoe Source; Timberland; the Sharper Image; and Budget Rent a Car.
</P>
<P>
   Scrip is a big business. Schools and nonprofits buy about half a
billion dollars worth of the colorful vouchers a year from
merchants at a discount, usually about 5 percent. They resell them
at face value to parents and other supporters, who spend them in
stores just like cash. The schools keep the difference between
their purchase price and the face value.
</P>
<P>
   With the eScrip system, schools or other nonprofits sign up to
participate. Then, parents or other supporters register their
credit card and ATM card numbers with Electronic Scrip. Every time
they make a purchase at a participating vendor, a percentage of
their transaction is automatically donated to their designated
school.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Scrip, a 2-year-old profit-making venture, plans to
go national later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's electronic, we can spread it beyond just grocery
and department stores,'' said Ian Diery, Electronic Scrip's chief
executive and a former Apple Computer vice president. ``We intend
to reach to many types of merchants _ airlines, hotels, anywhere
you use a credit card. We can really enlarge the scope of scrip so &LR; 
 &LR; schools will have a tremendous opportunity to raise more money.``
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ESCRIP21 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The company ( &LR; www.escripinc.com &LR; ) sends monthly reports to
schools summarizing how much they've received, to parents showing
how much they donated, and to merchants showing how many eScrip
customers patronized their store, how much they spent and where
they shopped.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit for parents is that they don't need to buy scrip
ahead of time, tying up their cash, or have it on hand when they're
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks can still get frequent flier miles or other benefits
that exist on their credit cards,`` said Joanne Remillard,
Electronic Scrip's executive vice president. ``That's a big plus.''
</P>
<P>
   One drawback is that many will be reluctant to turn over their
credit and ATM card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   And parents who participate in eScrip must pay the company a $10
annual fee. They pay no fee with paper scrip.
</P>
<P>
   The National Scrip Center, a 10-year-old Santa Rosa nonprofit
that is the nation's largest clearinghouse for scrip purchases, is
planning its own electronic version of scrip. But Edward Phillips,
its chief operating officer, is dubious about Electronic Scrip.
``They're a for-profit company that will have to report to their
investors,'' he said. ``They're taking a lot of fees out so the
school gets less.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Scrip Center, which works with 8,000 schools and
nonprofits and 220 merchants, takes 1 percent or less of each
transaction to cover its expenses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Scrip wouldn't disclose its fees, but said they will
be offset by its broader reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'd get a lower percentage with eScrip than we do by
selling paper scrip, but they might have many more merchants than
what we carry. The wider selection would make up the difference in
the percentage,'' said Joan Donovan, scrip coordinator for the San
Mateo/ Foster City Community Education Foundation, which sells
$100,000 of scrip a month to supporters of 20 public elementary
schools in the district. Her organization plans to have a dozen
board members try eScrip for a couple of months to evaluate it.
</P>
<P>
   Budget Rent a Car contracted with Electronic Scrip to be the
only rental car company represented. With paper scrip, Budget gave
schools 8 percent of the money parents spent. With eScrip, it will
still give schools 8 percent _ on top of a 2 percent administrative
fee it pays Electronic Scrip.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of ESCRIP21 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Why is it willing to pay more? ``We think the revenue potential
is greater,'' said Beth Murphy, consumer marketing manager at
Budget. ``It could work out to be a significant amount of
incremental revenue for us, as well as a way to make our customers
feel good about renting with Budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Paper scrip is a huge hassle for schools, which have to front
the money to buy it, figure out a secure place to store it, and
employ an army of volunteers to sell and deliver it. It's also a
bother for merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a retailer, (eScrip) is far less work for me, because they
are using the standard electronic fund transfer network,'' said
Peter Draeger, chief financial officer of Draeger's Market, a chain
of food stores on the Peninsula that sells scrip.
</P>
<P>
   The eScrip system ``would be great for us because it would
release us from a lot of the manpower _ really womanpower _ of
selling scrip,'' said Linda Okamoto, who co-chairs the scrip
committee for two schools in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   But she hasn't yet signed on with eScrip because its merchant
selection is still limited. ``We would really want to have
Safeway,'' she said. ``They're going to have to get the big guys:
Target, Mervyn's, Macy's. If they get a whole lot of merchants and
they're widespread, then it would be great.'' She also said the $10
annual fee per consumer could be a stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Diery, who oversaw Apple Computer's launch of its Power
Macintosh line, said Electronic Scrip has taken every precaution to
safeguard consumers' privacy and their credit cards' security.
</P>
<P>
   But a big draw for merchants will be the opportunity to tap into
the millions of customers Diery hopes to sign up. ``We have the
opportunity to drive tremendous communication with the customer,''
he said. ``But we will be very sparing about things like doing
inserts with our (monthly reports to customers) because we don't
want to invade privacy.''

GUATEMALAN LAUREATE DEFENDS HER BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt.)  (mk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan Indian who rose
from a childhood of want and racist violence to be awarded the 1992
Nobel Peace Prize, dismissed questions Wednesday about a book in
which she described her life history, saying she had ``a right to
my own memories.''
</P>
<P>
   In meetings she organized with reporters here promising to ``lay
to rest'' doubts about the 1983 volume, which records her memories
of horrific violence, Ms. Menchu denied that it contained
purposeful inaccuracies but was elusive when pressed to clarify
specific points.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about the veracity of some episodes she recounts in the
book, called ``I, Rigoberta Menchu,'' were raised in a new study by
David Stoll, an anthropologist at Middlebury College in Vermont. A
Dec. 15 report in The New York Times, based on new reporting in Ms.
Menchu's home village, pointed to additional inconsistencies
between her version and the recollections of many neighbors and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Menchu said Wednesday that the central reality for her was
that her father, mother and at least two brothers were all murdered
by government security forces during the ferocious violence that
descended on Guatemala's Indian communities in the years before her
book was published _ all facts that have not been disputed. ``I
didn't find anything in these reports that changes the fact that my
people are dead,'' Ms. Menchu said. ``And that is my truth.''
</P>
<P>
   She was dressed in the bright purple embroidered blouse and red
headband that denote her origins in the highlands of central
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will change my mind and say I'm sorry the day I see my
father again full of youthfulness and health,'' she said. Ms.
Menchu's father was burned to death during a protest in a fire
started by government forces at the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala
City in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   She argued that her book remained a faithful representation of
the trauma suffered by Guatemalan Indians during a period of
violent military rule. She said she was reluctant to ``enter into
little details,'' explaining that she felt it would be undignified.
</P>
<P>
   In response to reporters' questions, Ms. Menchu said she had not
acknowledged in her book that she had received several years'
education at the Belgian-Guatemalan Institute in Guatemala City. In
the opening pages of the book, which is based on interviews
tape-recorded by a Venezuelan anthropologist, she said she had not
learned how to read, write or speak Spanish until a few years
before the text was published. But nuns who ran the school at the
time told The Times that she had been an exceptionally bright
pupil.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for the first time, Ms. Menchu said she had been
at the school for several years, but as a maid, not a pupil. ``It
was not work that I was ashamed of,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stoll said in a telephone interview that his research revealed
that the Nobel laureate had worked at cleaning the school to pay
her way while she studied there. Ms. Menchu acknowledged Wednesday
that she had learned literacy and Spanish as a girl at the Belgium
school and while on scholarship to another school in subsequent
years.
</P>
<P>
   In her book Ms. Menchu provided a heart-rending account of the
death by starvation of her youngest brother, who she said was named
Nicolas. But Nicolas Menchu proved to be alive and was interviewed
by The Times in Guatemala. This prompted Ms. Menchu to say
Wednesday that she had another, younger brother who had also been
named Nicolas.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nicolas Menchu who was interviewed by the Times said he
was a decade older than his sister and that the only brothers who
had died of hunger were all older than he.
</P>
<P>
   She had said that she witnessed the death of another brother,
Patrocinio, who she said was burned alive by army troops. According
to Stoll, in his book ``Rigoberta Menchu and the Story of All Poor
Guatemalans,'' Patrocinio Menchu was kidnapped by soldiers and his
body is believed to have been dumped in a mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Menchu, apparently conceding that she was not present when
her brother was killed, said she had only reported what her mother
told her of her brother's death. ``Show me where the mass grave is
where he is buried,'' she said. ``If someone will give me his body,
I will change my view. My truth is that my brother Patrocinio was
burned alive.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that her testimonial had come under criticism as
part of a racist campaign. ``If anyone thinks I'm going to say I'm
sorry because I was born Maya and am an ignorant Indian, they're
wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stoll said Wednesday that he had never intended to accuse Ms.
Menchu of lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be to dismiss her morally, and that is definitely
not my view,'' he said. ``You can understand and defend her
narrative strategy, of folding others' experience into her own,
making herself into a kind of all-purpose Maya. She was in an
emergency situation. She was trying to bring down pressure on the
government and the army. To do that, you have to make a complicated
situation seem simple.''

CLINTON EXPANDS ON STATE OF THE UNION THEMES BEFORE ENTHUSIASTIC
CROWDS
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Pa., Wis.) (Eds.: Subs for inserts and extensive rewriting throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORRISTOWN, Pa. _ An exuberant President Clinton starred in two
rollicking rallies on Wednesday where he amplified the themes of
his State of the Union message and attacked Republican proposals to
use the federal budget surplus for across-the-board tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President
Al Gore and Tipper Gore, received a rock star's reception at the
Marine Midland Arena in Buffalo on Wednesday afternoon from 21,000
residents of western New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, he addressed several thousand spirited
students and parents in a packed high school gymnasium in
Norristown, a suburb northwest of Philadelphia. The city is in a
moderate swing district whose seat in Congress has changed parties
three times since 1992. The Democrats won it back in 1998, after
two terms in Republican hands, with the election of Joseph M.
Hoeffel.
</P>
<P>
   The president has attended few such mass events over the past
year of scandal and investigation, and he was rewarded with a
rapturous response from campaign-style crowds drawn by White House
advance teams distributing thousands of free tickets through local
unions, churches, schools and political offices.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no mention in either of his appearances Wednesday
of the Senate impeachment proceedings, where two White House
lawyers delivered extensive rebuttals on Wednesday afternoon to
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice against the
president. No one in Clinton's entourage nor any of the local
officials who introduced them raised the subject of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, Clinton fairly glowed as speaker after speaker
praised his good works and glossed over his legal and political
problems. At the end of his half-hour speech, he called Wednesday
``one of the great days of my presidency.'' White House aides said
that Buffalo had been chosen for Wednesday's rally because it is a
Democratic stronghold of working-class families. Officials said the
Buffalo throng was the largest American crowd Clinton had addressed
since an appearance in LaCrosse, Wis., last January, the day after
his last State of the Union speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bennett W. Smith, who is black, said in an invocation
that Clinton has been ``the greatest president for our people of
all time.'' Smith called on the Lord to ``comfort him with Your
word, that no weapon formed against him shall prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton received a huge ovation when she rose to introduce
her husband. Several in the crowd held signs in support of her
imagined candidacy for the U.S. Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who appeared energized by the rally, growled lustily to
the crowd, ``We can have the future we deserve because we already
have the president we deserve!''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said that the State of the Union speech
marked a turning point for the country and called on the huge
audience to help fight for the president's expansive policy agenda.
The crowd rose to its feet and roared.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could hardly match the passion of the preacher and the
vice president. He noted that he and Gore had taken the oath of
office for the first time six years ago on Wednesday and marveled
at how quickly the years had passed. ``They have been, to put it
mildly, eventful,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But policy, not nostalgia, was on his mind on Wednesday. So he
offered a half-hour dissertation on the aging of America and the
importance of shoring up Social Security and Medicare for the baby
boomers.
</P>
<P>
   He said that today's prosperity must be used to insure a
financially secure future, not to satisfy momentary urges for
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to squander this moment,'' the president
said. ``We have to make the most of it. We have to look at the
long-term challenges facing America.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his plan for reserving a large portion of the
federal budget surplus for Social Security and Medicare and argued
strenuously against Republican proposals to use the money for tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I will say again, it may sound good if somebody says, this
is your surplus and we ought to give it back to you,'' he said.
``But you ought to ask yourself, what's America going to look like
10, 20, 30 years from now? How are all the families going to deal
with the retirement of the baby boom generation?''
</P>
<P>
   But 20 minutes into his remarks, people began streaming out of
the arena, an unusual spectacle at a presidential event. Many had
waited for hours amid towering snowbanks to enter the arena and
preliminary speeches lasted more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who stayed were Tom O'Sullivan and his 8-year-old
son, Kevin. O'Sullivan, 39, an auto worker, said that he came to
show support for Clinton. ``I think he's done a good job. And
there's not too many chances to see a living president.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan, who builds axles for light trucks, said the United
Automobile Workers had urged its members in the Buffalo area to
attend the rally. But he said he would have come anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky had
been wrong, but that Republicans had gone overboard in bringing him
to the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with what he's done,'' O'Sullivan said, ``but
they should have censured him and been done with it. What people
failed to take into account was that we all have our faults. How
many people in the House and Senate did the same thing as he did
and just didn't get caught. The man's just trying to save his
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the overwhelmingly pro-Clinton crowd, Diana
Gaglia, 61, took a half-day of vacation time from her job at a
denture plant to attend the rally to show her support for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's being ostracized because of that stupid Linda
Tripp,'' Mrs. Gaglia said. ``I also feel, find me a man who hasn't
had an indiscretion. He didn't do right, but we shouldn't be put
through all this.''

CLINTON LAWYERS CHIP AWAY HOUSE PROSECUTORS' ARGUMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS 7th graf, Ms. Mills ..., to drop reference to race.) 
 (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-BUSH, IMPEACH-SCENE) 
(bl)  
By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A White House lawyer Wednesday accused House
prosecutors of resorting to ``word games'' and ``legal
mumbo-jumbo'' in their efforts to prove President Clinton guilty of
impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the charges as ``frivolous,'' often based on
``utterly meaningless'' conflicts in testimony and fundamentally
flawed from a constitutional perspective.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of the president's defense in his Senate
trial, the lawyer, special White House counsel Gregory Craig,
appealed to the senators not to ``throw our politics into the
darkness of endless recrimination'' and not to ``inject a poison of
bitter partisanship into the body politic which, like a virus, can
move through our national bloodstream for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If you convict and remove President Clinton on the
basis of these allegations, no president of the United States will
ever be safe from impeachment again.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig challenged every Republican accusation of perjury, which
forms the basis of the first of two articles of impeachment voted
by the House. Whereas Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, one of the
Republican managers, had urged the Senate to concentrate on ``the
big picture'' and not to lose the forest in the trees, Craig homed
in on the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule of law depends on the details, because it depends on
the facts,'' said another White House lawyer, assistant counsel
Cheryl Mills, who followed him. She began the rebuttal to Article
Two, which charges Clinton with having obstructed justice in an
effort to conceal his illicit sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills made a striking presentation, dropping her voice to a
melodramatic murmur as she sought to demolish the case constructed
by the managers last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those stubborn facts,'' she said, after describing
discrepancies in the account of presidential actions assembled by
the Republicans. ``They won't go away. They keep pounding, like the
telltale heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In his summing-up, Craig echoed the point made by the White
House counsel, Charles Ruff, in his address to the Senate on
Tuesday, arguing that only the most heinous of crimes could justify
steps ``to undo the result of a national election and remove the
man chosen by the American people to be their president.''
</P>
<P>
   But he went further, suggesting that such a step could be taken
only if the American people approved it, presumably through a
referendum or in a public-opinion survey. The Senate ``dare not''
convict the president, Craig insisted, ``unless the people who
spoke agree that such drastic action is justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Current polls show the American public strongly opposed to the
removal of Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   There was another unusual aspect to the presentation by Craig,
who has known the Clintons since their days together at Yale Law
School. Replying to months of charges that the president and his
lawyers have engaged in hair-splitting and tortured constructions
in an effort to wiggle off the legal hook, he commented:
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that we have relied on overly legal or technical
arguments to defend the president from his attackers, we apologize
to him, to you and to the American public. We do the president no
earthly good if in the course of defending him we offend both the
judges, the jurors and the American public. And Mr. Ruff had it
just right when he expressed his concern to members of the
Judiciary Committee that our irresistible urge to practice our
profession should not get in the way of a just result.''
</P>
<P>
   But allegations of crimes ``invite _ indeed, they call out for _
legal defenses,'' Craig added, and he and his colleagues intended
to use ``all the legal defenses available.''
</P>
<P>
   He himself surely did so. He mounted an across-the-board attack,
with each line of argument ending with the conclusion that no
perjury had been committed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Craig complained that the perjury article was much too loosely
drawn, ``with a stunning lack of specificity'' which had forced
White House lawyers to try to hit ``a moving target.'' It would be
thrown out of any federal court on that ground alone, he contended.
He also said that the House managers had improperly attempted to
revisit the president's statements in his deposition in the Paula
Jones case, even though an article covering that matter had been
rejected by the House.
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected by a vote of 229-205 the article dealing with
alleged perjury in the president's Jan. 17 Jones deposition. But
the House managers have included in their allegation that Clinton
committed perjury in testifying to the Lewinsky grand jury in
August a charge that he had lied when he said he sought to tell the
truth in the deposition. This is a technique known in legal circles
as ``bootstrapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff and Craig said that should not be permitted, but McCollum
argued last week that the House rejection of the Jones article
``does not keep you from considering the lies in that deposition.''
He went on to list many questionable statements made by the
president, notably his statements that he could not remember if he
had ever been alone with Ms. Lewinsky or exchanged gifts with her.
He testified much more truthfully on those matters before the grand
jury six months later.
</P>
<P>
   Craig made much of the fact that many of the charges voiced by
the House managers had not been included in the referral by the
special prosecutor, Kenneth W. Starr. And he made extensive use of
videotapes of testimony before the Judiciary Committee by two
former federal prosecutors _ Thomas Sullivan, a former U.S.
attorney in Illinois, and Richard Davis, formerly a prosecutor at
the Justice Department and Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   Both said that perjury prosecutions require two witnesses or
substantial corroborating evidence _ not, as in this case, evidence
from friends of Ms. Lewinsky who said she told them the same story
at the time as she later told government investigators.
</P>
<P>
   That point had particular relevance, Craig said, to one of the
conflicts in testimony on which the managers ``place great emphasis
and weight'' _ the disagreement between Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton as
to whether he touched her breasts and genitalia during their sexual
encounters. The counsel described it as ``a classic, oath-on-oath,
`he says, she says''' matter.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Clinton might be removed from office over
such a narrow disparity _ that his fate ``might hinge on whether
you believe him or her'' _ struck him as ``a staggering thought,''
Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the president himself, Craig insisted that Clinton had
never lied to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with Clinton's evasive behavior before the grand jury,
including his famous statement, ``It depends on what the meaning of
`is' is,'' the counsel said: ``The president makes a political
mistake here and gives in to his instinct to play his own lawyer,
to be his own advocate. You may find it frustrating, you may find
it irritating when you watched him do this. But he is not
committing perjury. He is committing the offense of nitpicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills' brief was narrower. She focused on two charges of
obstruction of justice, both dealing with Clinton's secretary,
Betty Currie. And she rebutted both of them in fairly short order.
</P>
<P>
   The first involves the box of gifts from the president that Mrs.
Currie hid under her bed for Ms. Lewinsky, and turns on the
question of who asked Ms. Lewinsky to give them to Ms. Currie. The
Republicans say it was Mrs. Currie, acting on the president's
suggestion, relying heavily on Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that the
president had told her he would think about what she should do with
the gifts and surmising that he had decided they must be hidden.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Mills brought out the fact that in only one of 10
accounts did Ms. Lewinsky quote the president as saying he would
think about the hiding plan or anything of the sort. The managers
had not cited the other nine versions, she argued, ``because they
weaken an already fragile circumstantial case.'' In fact, Mrs.
Currie testified five times that the whole thing was Ms. Lewinsky's
idea, Ms. Mills continued, and Mrs. Currie agreed ``because she's a
friend, and that's not obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The other incident was Clinton's discussion with Mrs. Currie in
which he seemed to some to be coaching her, seeking her agreement
to untrue statements, such as ``Monica came on to me and I never
touched her _ right?'' The Republicans said the president, who had
earlier said Mrs. Currie would be the ideal witness on some
important points, was trying to corrupt her eventual testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But after a quick review of the obstruction statutes, Ms. Mills
noted that Mrs. Currie had testified that she had felt neither
pressured nor intimidated by the president, her boss, during the
series of exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence whatsoever of any kind of threat or
intimidation,'' Ms. Mills said. ``And as we discussed, the U.S.
attorney's manual indicates that without a threat or intimidation,
there is no corrupt influence. Without corrupt influence there is
no obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills concluded with a spirited rebuttal to the idea that
Clinton had tried to deny a woman, Ms. Jones, her lawful civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about civil rights,'' she told the Senate,
``because this president's record on civil rights, on women's
rights, on all of our rights, in unimpeachable.''

KNIGHT GLAD TO BE A LAKER AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He returns with a bulkier body and a fatter
wallet, and now, the chance to win a championship. Travis Knight is
a Laker once more, and how could things be any better?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting some sunshine, but I haven't gotten any of
that yet,'' Knight said Wednesday, looking at the clouds instead of
the silver lining. But, he quickly added, ``At least it's not ice
on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe he is leading a charmed life after all.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, a former San Diego resident, is back in Southern
California. He's playing again for the team he broke in with as a
rookie in 1996. And he's left the Rick Pitino rebuilding project
back in Fahrenheit-impaired Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And to top it all off, he has six years remaining on the
seven-year, $22 million deal he signed with the Celtics, the deal
that prompted him to leave L.A. in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Truly, things couldn't be much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real happy, I'm really excited about it,'' Knight said of
his return. ``Obviously this is a team that's going to be one of
the most dominant teams in the NBA for the next few years. It's
hard not to be excited about that.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked out with his old/new teammates Wednesday at Southwest
College, for the first time since he was swapped for Tony Battie.
</P>
<P>
   While he was not the low-post center the Celtics wanted, Knight
said he had no hard feelings about Boston or coach Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good experience in Boston, a learning experience,'' he
said. ``I don't regret my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   His return to L.A. also means a return to his preferred
position, power forward. And he's better equipped for the banging
now that he's bulked up from about 220 pounds his rookie year to
236 today.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a trade for a power forward, coach Del Harris expects
Knight to compete for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to plug some holes,'' Knight said. ``Whatever
coach Harris wants me to do is fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates were glad to see Knight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked even better to me,'' Eddie Jones said after
practice. ``It seemed like he got every loose ball, every offensive
rebound that came off, tip-ins, hitting the wide open jump shot,
defending.... I think as soon as he heard he was coming back here,
his confidence, it went up to the clouds probably.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying: Elden Campbell is still a Laker, and an option at
power forward and center. But Olden Polynice is ready to take those
roles at the drop of a hat, if the Lakers trade Campbell, as has
been expected.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice, a free agent entering his 12th NBA season, has been
working out with the Lakers and openly lobbying players and
management alike. He'll sign for the veteran's minimum ($1
million), and all they have to do is ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can make it happen, I'm theirs to lose basically,'' he
said. ``I want to be here. I think I'd be a good fit for this
team.... One thing I can do is play hard and bang and rebound,
which is something the Lakers have lacked.''
</P>
<P>
   And Polynice gave the best indication yet that the team could
still trade Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Lakers) just told me to hold on, don't make any
rushed decisions (about signing elsewhere),'' Polynice said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers don't sign him, Polynice said he has a standing
offer from division rival Seattle.

GALAXY HAS NEW ROSE BOWL DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- Galaxy and Rose Bowl officials confirmed Wednesday
that they have reached an agreement in principle on a new
three-year deal for the Major League Soccer team to continue to
play at the famed stadium and to build a practice field adjacent to
it.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the City Council and the Rose Bowl Operating
Committee, the agreement would ensure the Rose Bowl would retain
one of its major tenants and end the Galaxy's search for a new
training site.
</P>
<P>
   For its first three seasons, the Galaxy trained either at
Occidental College, Azusa Pacific University or in the parking lot
grass outside the Rose Bowl. The team had been looking at Azusa
Pacific University, Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut and Rio Hondo
College in Whittier as possible sites for a new training facility.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Bowl General Manager Dave Jacobs said he and Galaxy
president Tim Leiweke reached the agreement late last week
following a series of meetings. It includes an option for the
Galaxy to play at the Rose Bowl for a fourth year. The Galaxy's
current three-year deal with the Rose Bowl was due to expire this
month. The team held an option for the 1999 season, which begins
March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new agreement, the Galaxy will be able to build a
weight room at the Rose Bowl, new stadium offices for team
management, a permanent locker room, and a fenced practice field to
be constructed in parking lot K. Galaxy vice president David Bolton
estimated the total cost at slightly less than $400,000, and said
it would be paid for by Philip F. Anschutz, who purchased the
Galaxy in October for $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've decided to stay at the Rose Bowl and make that not only
our home for games but for training facilities and our entire
operations,'' said Bolton. ``We have begun construction on our
weight room for players underneath the stadium and have also
started upgrading and expanding our coaching offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have also made a commitment to build a regulation-size
field in parking lot K, which we're hoping to be able to break
ground on March 1. Right now, we're in the process of designing the
field and also doing all the environmental studies we need to get
that done. We're hoping to have that process ready for review with
the City Council and RBOC (Rose Bowl Operating Committee) by the
end of February to allow us to break ground in March.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs admitted he was concerned when the Galaxy began looking
elsewhere for a training site. At one point, Azusa Pacific
University officials believed they were on the verge of signing a
joint deal with the Galaxy to build a training facility near the
Azusa campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because there are a lot of benefits to keeping them
here,'' Jacobs said of the Galaxy. ``This will lock them in for a
long time and that's a great benefit to us. They're an important
source of revenue. We make about $200,000 a year off the Galaxy, so
that's a tenant we didn't want to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolton said the Galaxy-Rose Bowl contract has been agreed to in
good faith, but added there are some contractual points that need
to be finalized. ``If for some reason we build a state-of-the-art
stadium somewhere in L.A., it would give us the option to leave
after three years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said that all that remains for the contract to be signed
is for the new practice field to be approved. Jacobs said it would
cause the loss of up to 200 parking spots in lot K, but he said the
Rose Bowl could recover those spots in lot J.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Galaxy has received permission from the
RBOC to practice on the Rose Bowl turf. Training camp opens Monday.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Ann-Marie Villicana, whose district includes
neighborhoods west of Rose Bowl, held back from endorsing the
agreement, saying she wants to see the details first. But she said
she supports the concept of adding the practice field to the
stadium area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm supportive of keeping the Galaxy here,'' said Villicana,
who is running for mayor. ``There is no question that the Galaxy is
fulfilling a need in Pasadena. It's filling the Rose Bowl and
providing great entertainment for families and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the practice field will be built on public property, if
the Galaxy decides to leave, the Rose Bowl will take control of it.
``We would call it our contribution to soccer and the Rose Bowl,''
Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This training facility would provide a lot of benefits for
everyone,'' Jacobs said. ``For one, the Tournament (of Roses)
wouldn't have to rent out the Coliseum, this could be their
training site.
</P>
<P>
   ``But before we get ahead of ourselves we still need approval
from the Rose Bowl Operating Committee and the City Council. We're
trying to do this as expeditiously as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The new practice field will provide a place for Pasadena's
public high schools to play tournament or championship soccer
games, said Porfirio Frausto, a former Blair High School football
coach who serves on the Rose Bowl Operating Company.
</P>
<P>
   It will also allow Pasadena to attract more big-name soccer
events and offer the Galaxy a safer place to practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not right to send a million-dollar athlete over to Area H
after UCLA games -- there's glass on the field,'' Frausto said.
``You'd hate to see a guy get injured because it's a poor training
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano welcomed the news of the agreement
and new practice field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only think what could have been if we did not have to
deal with those conditions the past three years,'' Zambrano said.
``Now we don't have an excuse at all. Hopefully they can break
ground on area K and get that thing done for us.''

LAWMAKERS IN BRAZIL ADOPT STEP ON AUSTERITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ In an important advance in the government's
effort to cut its deficit and reduce market pressures that have
humbled the economy, the lower house of Congress on Wednesday night
decisively approved a change in social security benefits for civil
servants after four earlier attempts had been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The action is significant because it takes Brazil a step closer
to complying with a $41.5 billion rescue package that it signed in
November with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also sends a signal to foreign investors and
speculators that the political skills of President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and his Cabinet are sufficient to persuade a
divided and recalcitrant Congress to approve his costly austerity
program.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on Wednesday was the second in two days in which the
government succeeded in pushing through fundamental elements of
that policy, and it was taken after a long string of reverses that
led to the devaluation of the currency, the real, by more than 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the Senate resoundingly approved a measure that would
prolong and increase a tax on checks and other financial
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Several other steps remain, however, before Cardoso can proclaim
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The tax on financial transactions, for instance, would have to
to be passed by the 513-member lower house, which has a reputation
for recalcitrance. That measure requires a 60 percent majority
vote, because a constitutional amendment is necessary to enact it.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition for IMF assistance Brazil has to cut its deficit
almost in half this year.
</P>
<P>
   The government has proposed a package of $23.5 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts to be incorporated in its 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
   The social security tax approved by the lower chamber on
Wednesday was the central feature of that package.
</P>
<P>
   If the tax on financial transactions is renewed, it is generally
expected to add $10 billion to government revenues this year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed new social security tax would add less, $3 billion
over two years, but was far more controversial. It therefore grew
to be emblematic of Cardoso's entire program.
</P>
<P>
   In his election campaign last year Cardoso portrayed many of the
retired government workers who would be affected as a pampered
elite.
</P>
<P>
   That alienated many of them, including judges, professors and
other influential professionals who quickly demonstrated an ability
to lobby members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The government's last attempt to pass the measure was last
month, and the failure of the legislation then raised questions
about Cardoso's ability to deliver what he had promised the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in an indication of the controversy that the issue
has aroused, opponents again went to Congress to demonstrate and
had a pushing and shoving match with guards.
</P>
<P>
   That passion spilled over onto the floor of Congress, where
Cabinet members circulated among legislators in an effort to win
over fence-sitters and the arguments were heated.
</P>
<P>
   One backer of the bill cited President Clinton's State of the
Union speech on Tuesday in support of his position.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents accused Cardoso of selling out Brazil, which has
the largest economy in Latin America, and its 165 million people to
the IMF and U.S. banks and investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the government has asked for to calm the markets is the
blood of civil servants,'' said Walter Pinheiro, a leader of the
Workers' Party, the main opposition party. ``To please investors we
are being asked to massacre retirees and government employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The government overcame such opposition by narrowing the focus
of the tax on benefits to retirees and current government workers,
1.4 million people in all.
</P>
<P>
   A blanket exemption for retirees who earn less than $400 a month
was added to the bill, and sponsors included language that would
exempt all but a handful of retirees older than 70 from having to
pay anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   The measure moves to the Senate, where the government hopes that
a vote can be scheduled as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The term of Congress expires on Feb. 1, and any further delays
would undo much of the political effects of the vote on Wednesday
night and could lead to an intensification of speculation against
the Brazilian currency.

ROBINSON BLAMES HIMSELF FOR KINGS' DEMISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a season of many lows and few highs for the Kings, a
season of great expectations unfulfilled, and Larry Robinson
admitted Wednesday that his team's difficulties have shaken his
faith in his abilities as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often question whether I'm a good coach - a good head
coach,'' Robinson said Wednesday afternoon following the Kings'
practice at the Forum. ``There are certain qualities to being a
great head coach. There are a lot of things I think about, and I
don't know if I communicate them properly.''
</P>
<P>
   It is more than halfway through a season scarred by injuries and
marred by inconsistency. After a miserable start, the Kings
(16-24-4) hit a hot streak in late December and early January, but
recently have cooled off once again. They enter tonight's home game
against the New Jersey Devils with a 1-3-1 record in their last
five games.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star break begins after tonight, and the Kings will
enter the hiatus as few as three or as many as seven points out of
a playoff berth. After the break, the Kings face a difficult
four-game trip, and his team's precarious situation has tested
Robinson's ability to maintain a hopeful outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to stay as positive as I can,'' said Robinson, 47, in
his fourth year on the job. ``If you want to have sleepless nights
and ulcers and gray hairs, you do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the dye job early in the season that turned Robinson's
hair from gray to brown wore off awhile ago, and he said he's had
more than his share of sleepless nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them,'' he said. ``Ask me if I have any sleepful
nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Robinson was asked in what areas he felt he could
improve, and he replied, ``Reading people's personalities, being
able to take a guy aside and tell him exactly how I feel and maybe
the things he should be doing. My problem is maybe I care too much
about hurting a guy's feelings or telling a guy really what he's
playing like or what he should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to put myself in the same situation and how I'd like to
be treated. Maybe one of the qualities of being a great coach is
being (a jerk). There are quite a few of them around.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Robinson be as hard on his players as he needs to be? Is it
imaginable he would ever learn to make a point by throwing a skate
at a player's head? One former NHL player has said he saw
Vancouver's Mike Keenan do exactly that in 1993-94, the year Keenan
coached the New York Rangers to the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Detroit's) Scotty Bowman is probably the greatest coach of
all time, and (former Montreal Canadiens coach) Toe Blake was
great, too,'' Robinson said. ``But I've heard stories about them
that would make your hair stand up. I can't treat people like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though he questions whether he is tough enough with his
players, Robinson said he has little difficulty pondering his own
inadequacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm my own worst enemy, my biggest critic of myself,'' said
Robinson, a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame who played for the
Canadiens and the Kings. ``I was like that when I played. I never
thought of myself as a great player. That's what helped me become a
great player. What I hope will make me a great coach is that I am
hard on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson insists he wants to continue coaching the Kings beyond
this year, even though he declined to sign a contract extension
before the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I question myself and my ability doesn't mean I
don't want to do it,'' Robinson said, adding that he has put
contract discussions with the Kings on hold until after the season.
``There comes a time where you say, `Do I need it?' I don't think I
could totally get away from hockey. But eventually, I'd like to get
away from the travel and live in my home for more than a month. But
that's a ways away.''
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom an All-Star (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Mattias Norstrom was added to the World team for
Sunday's All-Star Game in Tampa. His partner, Rob Blake, will play
for the North American team.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first All-Star selection for the 27-year-old Norstrom,
who will replace injured New York Islander Kenny Jonsson. Norstrom
has only four points this season but is second to Nashville's Bob
Boughner among NHL defensemen with 122 hits. His blue-collar style
is the type that often is ignored when All-Star teams are put
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling,'' said Norstrom, a native of Sweden.
``I'm really surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said, ``I think it's wonderful. Matti deserves it. It's
great to see a guy with his work ethic get his just rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he is hopeful that right wing Glen Murray might be
able to play several weeks earlier than his targeted mid-March
return date. Murray, sidelined since Jan. 2 with a knee injury, has
progressed more quickly than expected, Robinson said, and is due to
undergo tests next week to determine whether his return date can be
moved up. ... Winger Craig Johnson was placed on injured reserve.
Johnson has missed two games with a rib injury. ... Stephane Fiset
is expected to start in goal tonight despite a shaky performance in
Tuesday's 5-4 loss to Colorado.

U.S. MAY BUILD ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEM, SEEKS TO AMEND TREATY WITH
RUSSIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.D., Wash., Alaska)  (Eds.: LEADS with 7 grafs to recast, raise background, ADD that

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said on Wednesday that
it was asking Russia to renegotiate the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty to permit a limited national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The administration acted after concluding that the threat of a
strike from a country like North Korea now justified building a
limited number of ground-based interceptor missiles that could
shoot down incoming missiles. The system is not designed to protect
the nation from an all-out nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has not approved the final project, but he
wrote to President Boris N. Yeltsin last week outlining plans to
move ahead in developing and testing a system, a senior
administration official said. Clinton urged Yeltsin not to view the
development of a missile defense as a threat to the strategic
balance between the United States and Russia, the official said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House sought to reassure the Russians that the
change would be limited, Defense Secretary William Cohen said on
Wednesday that the United States would not rule out unilaterally
withdrawing from the treaty if an agreement was not reached.
</P>
<P>
   With a growing number of nations building or acquiring ballistic
missiles and with political pressure from Republicans legislators
mounting, the administration has come much closer to a decision to
build a system than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is scheduled to visit
Moscow next week, and the missile defense program will be a major
topic of her three days of meetings with senior leaders, including
Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov and Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction on Wednesday from Yeltsin's
government, but Russia has long opposed the creation of an American
missile defense, vehemently so after President Ronald Reagan
envisioned a space-based ``Star Wars'' program in 1983, to defend
the United States from an all-out nuclear attack by the Soviet
Union. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Cohen also outlined a series of changes
in the Pentagon's programs to build a national missile defense
system and more limited anti-missile defenses intended to protect
specific regions or troops in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still has not approved building any national missile
defense. But with more nations building or acquiring ballistic
missiles and with political pressure mounting from Republicans in
Congress, the administration has come much closer to a decision to
build a system.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the Soviet Union signed the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty in 1972 to limit the number, type and placement of
missiles that could be used to counter enemy missiles. The treaty
has been amended in the past, most recently in 1997 to acknowledge
the breakup of the Soviet Union and to clarify the distinction
between national missile defenses and the more limited ``theater''
missile defenses permitted under the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty allows either the United States or Russia to withdraw
with six months notice ``if it decides that extraordinary events
related to the subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized its
supreme interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawing from the treaty would have profound diplomatic
repercussions for the United States. Such a move could be
interpreted as a lack of American commitment to other treaties, and
it could undercut efforts to get Russia's parliament to ratify the
second strategic arms reduction treaty, or START 2.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing beside the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Henry H. Shelton, Cohen confirmed the administration's plans to
pledge $6.6 billion in the next six years to build a defensive
network of radars and interceptor missiles.
</P>
<P>
   That pledge _ sort of like earnest money put down by a home
buyer _ would increase the budget for a national missile defense
system to $10.5 billion between now and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's remarks also made it clear that the Pentagon considers
the possibility of a ballistic missile attack from ``rogue'' states
like North Korea, Iran or Iraq no longer a distant threat, which
was the Pentagon's official position only a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are affirming that there is a threat and the threat is
growing and that we expect it will pose a danger not only to our
troops overseas but also to Americans here at home,'' Cohen said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Capitol Hill have long advocated a more
aggressive effort to protect the United States from a strike by a
rogue state or terrorist group or an accidental launch in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans are shocked to discover that our country is
unshielded from the accidental or ruthless launch of even a single
missile over our skies,'' Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma declared
in the Republican response to Clinton's State of the Union message
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., and one of the strongest proponents in
Congress of a missile defense, welcomed the administration's
announcement but said he remained ``skeptical given the president's
continuing lack of a firm commitment to proceed with deployment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., introduced legislation on Wednesday
that again called for the deployment of a national missile defense
``as soon as it is technologically possible'' and called for still
more money to be spent on the effort. A similar bill failed in the
Senate last year by only one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran endorsed negotiating changes in the treaty but also said
the United States should consider withdrawing from it, if
necessary. ``The most important thing is doing what is in our
national security interests to protect American citizens and the
territory against ballistic missile attack,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cohen emphasized that he believed it was in the U.S. interest to
continue to abide by the treaty, which he said served to deter a
resumption of a nuclear arms race. But he said the treaty needed to
make room for a national missile defense, which he added was
``focused primarily on countering rogue-nation threats and will not
be capable of countering Russia's nuclear deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   While amending or abrogating the treaty would complicate
relations with Russia, the deployment of a national missile defense
system could also anger China, which has only limited nuclear
ballistic missile capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   There are still enormous hurdles to overcome before the United
States could even field a defense system. Even with a pledge of
additional money, the program remains burdened by technological
problems, and some analysts doubt that a viable system can ever be
built.
</P>
<P>
   The system now being developed is a shadow of Reagan's grand
vision of using lasers in space to create an impenetrable shield
protecting the nation from nuclear attack. In recent years, the
Pentagon's researchers have instead concentrated on using missiles
_ perhaps based in Alaska or North Dakota or on ships _ to
intercept a handful of incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The system faces a pivotal test in June when the program's
developers, led by Boeing Co., will launch a dummy missile from
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to try to destroy a missile
fired from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon now plans four tests before next June. At that
time, Cohen said, the administration will decide whether to move
ahead with deployment. But Cohen signaled that the administration's
plan now envisioned building a system, if one proves feasible, in
2005, a delay of two years from the administration's previous
timetable.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration has not yet given final approval, the
nation's military leaders believe a decision to build a system is
now inevitable, a senior defense official said. ``In the
Pentagon,'' the official said, ``there's no question this is going
to happen.''

AMTRAK, FIGHTING RED INK, ADDS A VARIETY OF FREIGHT BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Mo., N.M., Mass.)  (js) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amtrak said Wednesday that to balance its books
before Congress eliminates its operating subsidies, it would haul
fruits and vegetables cross-country, United Parcel Service packages
across the Southwest, express packages on Metroliners between New
York and Washington, and more U.S. mail all over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The company, formally the National Railroad Passenger Corp.,
said it hoped for a huge expansion of nonpassenger business and had
also rented out space for fiber-optic lines on its
Washington-to-Boston corridor for $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are behaving in a businesslike way to squeeze every
conceivable dollar out of this asset, in order not only to survive
but to prosper,'' said George Warrington, who was named Amtrak's
president and chief executive last month and is preparing for a
permanent end to operating subsidies in 2002, as Congress has
mandated.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters to discuss the company's
plans, Warrington said that before Congress created Amtrak a
quarter-century ago, nearly half of railroads' passenger-train
revenue actually came from hauling freight.
</P>
<P>
   In adding freight cars now to its regular passenger runs, he
said, Amtrak will not allow any compromise in speed or reliability.
``There is no tolerance in this organization for passenger
inconvenience'' resulting from the new ventures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But independent experts said the relatively little freight that
Amtrak already carries had delayed some of its trains, including
the Southwest Chief, which makes a daily run between Chicago and
Los Angeles and which, Amtrak said Wednesday, will carry UPS
packages from Kansas City, Mo., to Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've already added so much time to the schedule of the
Chief,'' said Ross Capon, executive director of the National
Association of Railroad Passengers, ``and already had so many
horror stories.''
</P>
<P>
   But Capon said he took comfort in Warrington's concern for
passenger convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be putting on pressure that this be done well,''
Capon said, ``because if it isn't, it's going to be a fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel L. Biggs, general chairman of the Transportation
Communications Union's Amtrak division, which represents a variety
of the railroad's workers, said that he had misgivings but that
``basically if you point a gun at Amtrak and say, `You're supposed
to be operationally self-sufficient by the end of 2002,' it's not
at all surprising they are looking for revenue streams such as have
been traditionally associated with passenger trains.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they thought Amtrak could find a substantial niche
in carrying high-value freight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to show the customers that rail is not inherently
the low-service transportation mode,'' said Tom Murray, publisher
of Rail Stock Watch, an Internet newsletter. ``That is a message
that unfortunately they've gotten from most of the freight
railroads.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said that in fact the freight railroads had lost most of
the perishable-food business because they were not so fast or
flexible as trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak also said Wednesday that it would close its food
warehouses and hire Dobbs International Services, which already
provides food to airlines, to do the same with trains.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the arrangement with Dobbs, a subsidiary of Viad
Corp., about 300 Amtrak workers will be absorbed into other jobs or
take buyouts averaging $35,000 each, about a year's pay, said
Biggs, the union official.

READERS SHARE VIEWS ON CLINTON'S TRAVAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The caller wanted to make a confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he did, it happens all the time. In everyone's lives.
Even in mine. I cheated on my wife _ several times!'' he shouted
into the phone. ``But she took me back. She forgave me. And we need
to do the same to Bill Clinton. He's a good man. And he's a good
president. Life happens. Just leave the guy alone.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he hung up without leaving a name.
</P>
<P>
   Since I started writing this column on Jan. 9, hundreds have
called and written. People have been eager to share their personal
stories and sentiments _ and explain how those accounts affect
their views on President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   This is the pulse of some of the Americans in Arizona who sought
to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Like the man with the adulterous disclosure, many voiced their
support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has been good for the country. We have a
budget surplus,'' said one elderly female caller. ``So what about
the other stuff? We have to measure him by what he's gotten done in
office.''
</P>
<P>
   A self-described construction worker wrote: ``He's kept me
working. He's kept the economy running. That's better than a lot of
other presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   One offered continued support because he respected Clinton's
human flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us like Bill Clinton because he is the closest thing
to a human being we have seen in the White House in quite awhile.
He eats, he sleeps, he has sex and when he gets caught he misleads
people about it until he gets cornered and then he does what he can
to salvage the situation,'' James Lenfers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all called human nature. Personally, I used to not like
Bill Clinton. He came across as an obvious phony. But you know
what? The more sanctimonious people give him a hard time, and the
more he sticks in there and deflects it, the better I like him.''
</P>
<P>
   While some, like Lenfers, offered lengthy discussions, others
kept it brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeach the crook as soon as possible,'' one man said.
``Thanks and bye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop harassing the president,'' another wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One asked me to look at Shakespearian literature in evaluating
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to preface my remarks by saying I'm not a Republican
and I'm not a right-wing zealot. I feel the president and his wife
are very close and similar to MacBeth and Lady MacBeth,'' explained
this male caller. ``There's a line in Shakespeare's ``MacBeth''
that says, `Not even Neptune's great ocean can wash the blood off
my hands.' And I feel that that's a perfect phrase for the blood
that's on the hands of the president and his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were more visceral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one person they never polled. I hate Clinton. I hate
Hillary. They have done more harm than anything in the whole whole
history of the country,'' raled a caller who identified herself as
Ann Hess. ``He's trash. He came from trash. It's no wonder he knew
what to call Paula Jones, he came from it. You can tell I'm upset
by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Petro had this to say: ``I find it incredible that he's
still in office. That he can stand up there and look the camera in
the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disgusted by him. I am disgusted by all his people. It's
not just his sexual escapades, although that's a good enough reason
to get him out of there. He's a very sick man,'' she said, raising
her voice. ``As I said, it caused me to leave the Democratic Party
after being a lifelong Democrat from Chicago. I just think about
the amount of support he gets, some of it from people in my family,
and I don't know what they see in him. It's like we're looking at
two different human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Many offered their prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I are very concerned about the Senate trial. We
listen to reports on the radio, read the paper and watch coverage
on TV. We pray daily that the senators may have wisdom and courage
to find the truth and act accordingly. We have been concerned for
several years that President Clinton's vetoing of legislation that
upheld high moral standards was an indication of his inner life.
Unfortunately, this has proved true. Character does count. Now he
is trying to buy his way into greater popularity by his promises in
the State of the Union address. I could go on and on, but you have
other things to do,'' wrote Floyd and Barbara Torkelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``God help the president and God help all the elected officials
involved in this sad chapter of our country,'' one caller said.
</P>
<P>
   One offered this fear:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I do think Americans are concerned with the impeachment
of this president, and I think most of us are more concerned about
the fact that if he is impeached Al Gore will become president,''
wrote a man who identified himself only as Al. ``What we've got is
a bum, what we don't need is an idiot. Sorry, but that is how a lot
of folks feel.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, it wasn't about the president. But more about the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julie, I am not from the Valley, but from Tucson. I am
strongly opposed to the continual barrage of salacious material
from the House managers. This ridiculous episode of moral madness
has cost the country's standing in the international community
immensely,'' wrote Theodore Bundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party is telling the people of these United
States that they don't matter. It has become increasingly
obvious &UR; to all who pay any attention that this is a coup. And the
Christian Coalition and their allies in the so-called
`conservative' movement claim that they now control the country
through the Republican Party. It is shocking and sad to see a once
vibrant party dig their own grave so willingly and with such
gusto,'' Bundy said.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Bernstein shares this: ``Have you ever heard of the saying:
`Don't kick a man when he's down'? &UR; I have little sympathy with
President Clinton when I consider his personal behavior, which I
think is deplorable. However, I am convinced that he should never
have been asked such personal questions in the first place, and
that he is truly a victim of a long-running vendetta initiated and
perpetuated by Republican zealots and that inquisitor, Kenneth
Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, one woman is taken aback by America's reaction to
the Clinton trial and offered this poignant point to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm more sad for America. Because all I hear is people
saying `I, I, I.' We don't seem to care about anything but
ourselves anymore. What happened to the America that cared about
people and what's right and those kinds of things. I'm &UR; not sure
what I think about Bill Clinton. But it hurts to read that nobody
cares and that all they care about is themselves, money and
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Could she be right? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie
Amparano will be taking the pulse of people in the Phoenix area. Do
they care about President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed
from office? What does captivate Americans? She looks for the
answers. Amparano can be reached at 444-8394, or at

GOVERNMENT WIELDS DOCUMENTS AND E-MAIL AGAINST MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government presented documents and e-mail in
the Microsoft trial Wednesday as evidence for its allegation that
the big software maker had imposed contract restrictions on
personal computer makers to thwart competition.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts imposed strict limits on Windows' opening
``desktop,'' the screen that computer users see when they turn on
their computers. These limits clearly upset some manufacturers who
wanted to use the desktop to display their own brands or to feature
factory-installed software _ often made by Microsoft's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to Microsoft Corp., an executive at Hewlett-Packard
Co. complained about the restraints and concluded that if his
company had any alternative to loading Microsoft's Windows
operating system, ``you would not be our supplier of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft began imposing the restrictions in 1996, saying it had
the legal right to do so and adding that the curbs helped consumers
by insuring a ``uniform Windows experience.'' But 1996 was also
when Microsoft was struggling to catch up to the early leader in
the Internet software market, Netscape Communications Corp., which
pioneered the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in court Wednesday, the government also addressed
the fact that on Tuesday, Microsoft reported a 75 percent jump in
quarterly earnings, well ahead of expectations on Wall Street.
David Boies, the lead trial lawyer for the Justice Department,
mentioned the earnings report in his cross-examination of the
company's leadoff witness and asked if consistently high profits
were an indicator of monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Richard Schmalensee, an economist and dean of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management,
conceded that persistently high profits suggest ``some impediment
to competitive alternatives.'' But such a barrier, he added
quickly, could well be a very valuable asset, protected by
intellectual property rights, like Microsoft's industry-standard
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply cannot infer monopoly power from profits,''
Schmalensee said.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges that Microsoft's contracts were mainly
intended to unfairly damage Netscape, not to benefit consumers.
Microsoft used its monopoly power in the operating system market,
the government charges, to force computer makers to restrict how
they could promote Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   To make that point, the government cited a number of documents,
including a Jan. 5, 1996, e-mail memo in which Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates stressed that increasing the company's browser share was
a ``very, very important goal.'' He also complained that some PC
makers were displaying competing browsers on their machines ``in a
FAR more prominent way'' than Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Later that month, an executive review of Microsoft's sales to PC
makers during the previous six months noted that one of its missed
opportunities was a failure to impose ``control over start-up
screens.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet by May 1998, Microsoft was weighing dropping the contract
curbs on some major PC makers in response to their complaints, and
it later did. An internal e-mail written by Brad Chase, a Microsoft
executive, however, noted that the reaction from the company's
``antitrust team was negative.'' He continued, ``Changes like this
undermine our whole defense of Windows Experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says the Justice Department is selectively plucking
comments from the more than 3 million pages of e-mail and documents
the company has produced during the government's investigation. The
documents, taken out of context, may seem damaging but are not,
according to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his cross-examination, which began last week,
Schmalensee has held to his main themes _ that Microsoft's
contracts are mostly garden-variety business deals, that friction
and fights among business partners are to be expected, that
Netscape has been able to distribute many millions of copies of its
browser, and that consumers have benefited from Microsoft's
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday afternoon, Boies concluded his cross-examination
with the kind of diverting exchange that occasionally brings some
levity to the trial. Asked about Microsoft's profit margins on its
operating system sales, Schmalensee said that was difficult to
determine precisely and that the company's internal accounting
systems were not all that sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, he said, records ``operating system sales by hand on
sheets of paper.'' Since that struck many in the courtroom as odd
for a leading producer of database and financial-spreadsheet
software, people laughed aloud in the courtroom. Later, Microsoft
executives said Schmalensee probably misspoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you saw in there,'' said William Neukom, Microsoft's
senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, ``was a trial
lawyer looking for an exit line.''

<P>
   DirecTV, the high-power satellite television company, is in
talks to acquire Primestar, the medium-power direct-to-home
satellite company owned by several cable companies and the public.
</P>
<P>
   Stock in TCI Satellite Entertainment Inc., the publicly traded
part of Primestar, has been rising recently. On Dec. 14 it traded

of Primestar include Time Warner Inc., Cox Enterprises, Comcast, US

</P>
<P>
   Carl Vogel, president of Primestar, declined to comment.
However, Primestar is struggling and is expected to run out of cash
by March or April, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike DirecTV and its rival, Echostar, where consumers have to
buy their own high-power satellite dishes, Primestar buys
medium-power dishes and leases them to customers. It costs
Primestar about $800 to get a new subscriber and roughly 45 months
to recover its investment. Because the turnover rate for
subscribers is high, it is hard for the company to recover that
investment.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV, a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp., which is itself
owned by General Motors Corp., is considering a complex acquisition
that would include $500 million in cash for the company's 11
frequencies that could deliver high-power satellite service, a
person close to the negotiations said. DirecTV would acquire 2.3
million subscribers but would pay only as they converted to
high-power satellite. Reports that a sale was near were reported
Wednesday in Satellite Business News.

POTENTIAL OLYMPIC SPONSORS SAID TO BE UNEASY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Two prospective corporate sponsors for the 2002 Winter Olympic
Games in Salt Lake City have said they will not make their deals
final until all investigations into the unfolding corruption
scandal have been completed, a senior U.S. Olympic official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Krimsky Jr., the marketing director for the U.S. Olympic
Committee, would not identify the sponsors, but said their
decisions to hold off on signing formal sponsorship contracts
reflected considerable uneasiness among the many corporations whose
money is essential to financing the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Any growing reluctance on the part of sponsors to get involved
with the 2002 Games could have serious consequences for American
efforts to stage a full Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Olympic officials still have to raise $250 million in
sponsorship money in a joint-marketing agreement with Salt Lake
City to reach the proposed budget of $1.45 billion. Olympic
officials have said that the Games may have to be reduced in size
if the full budget figure cannot be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Word of nervousness on the part of corporate sponsors came as
the International Olympic Committee prepared to release a
preliminary report on the efforts by Salt Lake officials to win the
right to play host to the Olympics. Salt Lake officials have
already admitted to a range of inappropriate inducements made to
gain favor with members of the IOC during the selection process,
including cash payments, expensive gifts and college scholarships
for family members of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that a draft copy of
the IOC's preliminary report concluded that as many as 16 of the
114 IOC members may be implicated in the Salt Lake City scandal for
accepting more than $780,000 in payments and gifts during and after
the bidding process for the 2002 Winter Games. The report, The
Journal said, also concluded that such conduct had taken place
during previous competitions among cities.
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared by Richard Pound, an IOC executive, also
details the activities of agents, or middlemen, who sought money
from officials of different cities, claiming they could influence
votes, according to The Journal. Pound's report, which is scheduled
to be released this weekend in Lausanne, Switzerland, claims that
one such middleman told officials of the bid city of Sion,
Switzerland, that he could deliver 25 IOC votes for $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC's sponsorships have become radioactive,'' said David
D'Alessandro, the president of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance,
one of a dozen worldwide sponsors of the Olympics. ``All corporate
Geiger counters are going off the chart. They've got to find a way
to make sponsorships safe again.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro said that he had begun to wonder whether Juan
Antonio Samaranch, 78, president of the IOC, would or could remain
in his job if the scandal escalated and corporate sponsorship was
seriously imperiled. Hancock and other sponsors are eagerly
awaiting the IOC meeting this weekend in Lausanne to see how many
IOC members will resign or face expulsion and to see what changes
will be initiated in light of the burgeoning Salt Lake corruption
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether they can achieve reform with
credibility under the current leadership,'' D'Alessandro said.
``Only the IOC can answer that question. Can Samaranch go into a
boardroom and credibly sell a sponsorship? I don't know the answer
to that. I think he survives if his changes are extraordinary,
sweeping, and he shows enormous courage as a leader. And he takes
no prisoners and recognizes that all he has built is in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   While Samaranch, a Spanish marquis who became IOC president in
1980, stated emphatically last week that he would maintain his
position until his current terms ends in 2001, he has seemed to
qualify his remarks in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have the confidence of all IOC members, I go on,''
Samaranch told The Wall Street Journal. ``If not, I will be
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Leavitt, the governor of Utah, has called on Samaranch to
clean up the Olympic movement. A growing chorus, led by Robert
Helmick, a former IOC member from the United States, has been
calling for Samaranch's resignation, and news reports have linked
him to expensive gifts such as guns and a samurai sword sent by bid
cities such as Salt Lake City and Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But as of Wednesday, Samaranch still had his defenders. ``We are
facing problems, but I would say Samaranch is leading and in
control of the institution,'' Francois Carrard, the executive
director of the IOC, said in an interview. ``He's perfectly apt to
act as president. We see no reason for him to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Krimsky, the American Olympic official, also expressed support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical that the president move quickly to heal the
Olympic movement so it can be effective and productive in moving
forward,'' Krimsky said. ``We've got to get this behind us. I'm
absolutely convinced Samaranch is the president to do it. Any
change would be disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic marketing experts Wednesday said in New York that the
financial picture of the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, as a
whole, remained encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Payne, the IOC's marketing expert, said that the $615
million in corporate money raised by Salt Lake doubled the amount
raised for the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, and that the IOC
had received ``full and total commitment'' from its sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear any number of American sponsors have made clear
that the Salt Lake scandal has caused concern.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Deutsch, a spokesman for the longtime Olympic sponsor
Coca-Cola, which spent up to $250 million on the 1996 Summer Games
in Atlanta and is signed through 2008, said the company had had
``frequent dialogue'' with Olympic officials and had expressed the
need for change. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a process that needs to be in play so this won't ever
happen again,'' Deutsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Rosenberg, a spokeswoman for United Parcel Service who
said the company had previously been pleased with its Olympic
association, said the company had been monitoring the scandal. ``We
believe the Olympics are strong enough to take a hit,'' Rosenberg
said. ``People need to be held accountable. For the Olympics to
emerge from this, however, there needs to be more than pointing
fingers and holding people accountable. That doesn't set a
correctional attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound, a lawyer from Montreal who has headed a six-man
commission to look into the Salt Lake scandal, met Wednesday in New
York with lawyers retained by the Salt Lake City organizing
committee as the two bodies prepared to release their reports in
coming days.

IF IT COMES TO COURT, SALT LAKE'S NONPROFIT STATUS COULD BE
JEOPARDIZED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)  (With OLY-SCANDAL) 
(js) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The allegations are tantalizing: cash payments, college
scholarships, hotel suites, airline tickets, jobs and free medical
operations _ all exchanged to help Salt Lake City win the 2002
Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But finding criminal behavior to prosecute may prove tough,
lawyers said in interviews Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest violation for prosecutors to prove may be of federal
tax laws. By allegedly giving as much as $600,000 in gifts to
International Olympic Committee members, the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee may have violated its nonprofit status. If so, the IRS
could revoke the committee's status retroactively and demand
payment of back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a charity is that you give to legitimate objects
of charity,'' said Boyd Kimball Dyer, a professor of tax and
business law at the University of Utah. Referring to allegations
that as many as 16 foreign Olympic officials received gifts from
the Salt Lake committee, he added: ``You cannot support private
people, especially not people who are wealthy. That is not charity,
that is corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like the Al Capone story, the taxes are not the
central thing,'' Kimball Dyer added. Noting that whoever signed the
committee's tax return could possibly be prosecuted for filing a
false return, he said, ``But it is hard to link the people who did
the corruption to the people who actually prepared the tax
returns.''
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake, IRS investigators and a legal team from the U.S.
Justice Department are digging through records of the Salt Lake
committee. Headed by Richard Wiedis, a specialist on white-collar
crime, the justice team includes Peter Clark, an expert on the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   However, that federal law probably does not apply because the
alleged recipients of the gifts were not foreign government
officials, but members of the International Olympic Committee, a
charity, said E. Lawrence Barcella, a defense lawyer who
specializes in white-collar cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bribing a foreign government official to get business'' is the
core of the Corrupt Practices Act, Barcella said from Washington.
``It would become a significant stretch to include IOC officials
under the definition of government officials.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that prosecutors may be looking at possible money
laundering violations, the Justice Department investigation has
also been aided by the U.S. Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   But money laundering laws would not apply in this case, Barcella
said, if it was not illegal for officers of one charity, the Salt
Lake committee, to give gifts to officers of another charity, the
IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``For money laundering, you have to have an underlying illegal
activity,'' said Barcella, who is a former federal prosecutor. ``If
you are bribing an IOC member in Africa, in South America and the
bribe itself is not illegal, you may not have a money laundering
case.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents are also studying the books of a defunct Salt Lake
City escort service to determine the validity of news media reports
linking visiting IOC members to prostitutes. Prostitution is
illegal in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed as many as a dozen people
close to the Salt Lake committee. On Wednesday, prosecutors
interviewed Stephanie Pate, who worked for Tom Welch until he
resigned as president of the committee in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client engaged in no criminal conduct herself and she knows
of no conduct by others which we believe to be criminal,'' David B.
Watkiss, her lawyer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Max D. Wheeler, a lawyer for Welch and for David Johnson, a
former senior vice president of the committee, did not return
telephone calls Wednesday. But on Tuesday, Wheeler was quoted by
The Washington Post as characterizing Johnson's view of the
payments to IOC members as ``an effort to maintain friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before an independent state review panel, Johnson
apparently said that some of the cash was given to IOC members from
developing countries for their national Olympic committees and that
the money was often given in cash because members said it was
difficult to cash American checks in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Utah's attorney general, Jan Graham, announced that
her office would investigate possible violations of Utah law, once
reports are completed by the state panel and by an IOC review
panel. &QL;

JETS' FOLEY COULD BECOME A CLEVELAND BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glenn Foley has once again received stunning, disappointing news
from Jets Coach Bill Parcells. Foley, who never got over losing his
starting quarterback job to Vinny Testaverde after an early season
rib injury, is one of five New York Jets who will be available for
next month's expansion draft to stock the roster of the Cleveland
Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the message has been passed on to me that I'm no
longer part of their plans,'' Foley said Wednesday. ``I assume I'll
be going, but I guess there's a possibility I'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley admitted that he was confused by several aspects of the
move. He said Parcells had told him it was being made for
salary-cap considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that big,'' Foley said of his base salary, which is
about $1.5 million a year. ``That's what confuses me. I've got to
believe there's something going on, maybe a hidden agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   If Foley were taken by the Browns, then the Jets would probably
be looking for a proven backup quarterback. The inexperienced Ray
Lucas was the third-string quarterback this past season. He spent
the year learning how to be a quarterback while performing as a
special-team player. The kind of backup the Jets want is someone
who could step in and perform at a high level.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the established quarterbacks who will be available as
free agents include Scott Zolak, who played for Parcells at New
England; Tom Tupa, the Patriots' punter who is also a quarterback;
Scott Mitchell of the Detroit Lions; Steve Beuerlein of the
Carolina Panthers and Kerry Collins of the New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Gus Frerotte of the Washington Redskins and the Saints'
Heath Shuler _ both placed on the Cleveland list _ will probably be
cut if they are not picked up by the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns' president, Carmen Policy, has said he is interested
in taking University of Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch in the
college draft, so Foley's selection by Cleveland is not assured.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Cleveland would be interested in Foley could not be
determined. Policy did not return a phone call Wednesday. A Jets
spokesman said Parcells would not be available to explain his
decision to expose Foley in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Foley said he had enjoyed his five Jets seasons, and
believed the Jets could make another run for the Super Bowl.
``There's worse jobs than being a quarterback in New York,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if he did come back, there would not be a
quarterback competition on the Jets. ``Vinny's the guy,'' Foley
said. ``There's no question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley added: ``I've signed a contract with the Jets through next
year. I know a lot of people don't understand that, but I'd honor
the contract. As the backup, you're one hit away from starting.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his ability level remained high even though he had seen
no game-time action since Oct. 11. ``The way we practice, full
speed, game speed, your skills don't diminish,'' he said. ``That
New York Jets team of 1998 was a special team. There's not one of
us wouldn't want to be back. It was a great locker room. I'd have
to go back to college to find a locker room like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley had been named the Jets' starter in June once Neil
O'Donnell had been cut and Testaverde brought aboard. But Parcells
always had a disquieting question about Foley: his health. Thus,
Parcells said that Foley was being given ``the benefit of the
doubt'' as the starter. In other words, it was his to lose.
</P>
<P>
   That happened soon enough. In Game 2 against Baltimore he
sustained a rib injury. Testaverde replaced him in the next two
games, which the Jets won to even their record at 2-2. But Parcells
went back to Foley to start against St. Louis. He was benched
during the game, in which he completed only a third of his passes
and tossed two interceptions. He did not throw a pass the rest of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's three losses as a starter dropped his career won-lost
record to 1-7 and left him without a complete-game victory. He has
made 16 appearances since the Jets drafted him in 1994. He has been
hurt seriously enough to miss playing time on three occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' fears about Foley's durability seemed answered with
the rib injury, although the quarterback's two earlier problems
were freakish accidents. Against the Patriots in 1995 he was hit on
the final play of the game just as he was throwing the ball. He was
driven shoulder first into the turf. He spent the rest of the
season and off season rehabilitating from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Parcells' first season with the Jets, Foley replaced
O'Donnell midway through the season after starring in backup
victories. But this time he was injured at Chicago when he was
sacked and his cleats became caught in a Bears jersey. Foley
severely sprained a knee.
</P>
<P>
   One agent with access to the Jets' expansion list said that
Foley would join the former starting free safety Jerome Henderson,
the special teams star Chris Hayes, the long snapper John Hudson
and offensive lineman Mike Gisler.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion draft will be held Feb. 9, and the Jets can lose a
maximum of two players. However, once one player is selected, then
the Jets can pull back another.  &QL;

USIA SAYS HACKER KILLED WEB SITE AND DAMAGED COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An outsider breached the Internet security of the
U.S. Information Agency a week ago, knocking its Web site out of
action and forcing the agency to re-evaluate its computer
protection, a USIA official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site was invaded about 9 p.m. on Jan. 13 by someone who
diverted users to other locations and then dismantled the site,
according to James McGregor, a computer expert for the agency.
McGregor said the site might function again by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the sabotage, the second such incident in six months,
had caused ``a constant stream of phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency oversees educational and cultural-exchange programs,
including the Voice of America radio network and the Fulbright
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats abroad and foreign diplomats constantly use
the Web location for statements on American policy or texts of
official speeches not covered by news organizations, McGregor said.
</P>
<P>
   The new invasion of the site, created in 1994, is far more
serious than the first, McGregor said. The FBI is working on the
case, and anyone caught could face serious criminal charges, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor said there were similarities between the two break-ins.
The first crippled the site for several days.
</P>
<P>
   In each attack the invader left the message, ``Crystal, I love
you,'' and the signature ``Zyklon,'' McGregor said. Zyklon-B was
the poison gas widely used in Nazi extermination camps.
</P>
<P>
   The styles of sabotage, however, were different in the two
cases. In the first the hacker inserted his page into the site and
then destroyed some of the agency's electronic documents.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts at the agency said they thought that they had
repaired the damage, but the saboteur had planted a ``Trojan
horse'' that repeated the destruction hours later, McGregor said.
</P>
<P>
   The new assault resulted in basic hardware damage and the
destruction of the site, McGregor said. The invader's message was
also accompanied by a strange scrawl. ``Before, he was just into
text,'' McGregor said. ``Now he's into bad graphics.''
</P>
<P>
   Since news of the new invasion began circulating in computer
circles, the USIA has heard from people who call themselves hackers
but disassociate themselves from the tactics of the taunters,
McGregor said. People who consider themselves hackers affect a
Robin Hood-like code of honor and describe more malicious saboteurs
as ``crackers,'' McGregor said, adding that the distinction is
irrelevant to him.
</P>
<P>
   The invasion occurs as the information agency is about to pass
from the scene. The independent agency will become part of the
State Department on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor said the damage from the break-ins could not be easily
estimated. More significant than dollars, he said, has been the
time spent by employees and outside contractors to make repairs.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor said a more permanent cost would be tighter security at
the Web site. Users will not notice, he said, but employees will
see changes as they have to go through additional elaborate steps
to place items on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply can't have this happening every six months,''
McGregor said. ``People rely on us.''

JORDAN DRAWS A CROWD AND SOME LAUGHS

<P>
   LA QUINTA, Calif. _ As Michael Jordan prepared to tee off
Wednesday morning, Charles Barkley surveyed the throng of at least
5,000 spectators who surrounded the 10th tee. ``I want to thank my
10 fans for coming,'' Barkley said. ``Everybody else came to see
Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day for laughs, a day for golf and a day for Jordan to
bask in the newfound glow of his retirement from the National
Basketball Association. Jordan was one of the amateur celebrities
who competed in Wednesday's first round of the Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic, and his presence was the talk of Bermuda Dunes Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of all ages, including kids seeking autographs, senior
citizens screaming, ``Hi, Michael,'' and some who had never
witnessed a round of golf in person, followed Jordan's every move.
</P>
<P>
   For those keeping track of the professionals, Ben Bates, John
Huston and Tom Pernice Jr. ended the first round in a three-way tie
for the lead at nine-under par 63.
</P>
<P>
   Bates and Huston played at Indian Wells Country Club, and
Pernice played at the Arnold Palmer Private Course at PGA West. But
the majority of the gallery was interested in Jordan. David Duval,
considered by many to be the world's best golfer, played two groups
ahead of Jordan, yet Jordan's gallery was six times larger than
Duval's. Duval, who shot a two-under par 70, did not mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a golfer, you're used to seeing celebrities on the golf
course,'' Duval said, ``but Michael is at a whole different level.
This is great. Just watching people react to him is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan held his own with two birdies, eight pars, six bogeys and
two holes where he picked up without finishing. It was an admirable
performance, considering that Jordan will have surgery Monday to
repair a torn tendon in his right index finger. Jordan injured the
finger while cutting the tip off a cigar earlier this month, and
the surgery will prevent him from playing in the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am next month.
</P>
<P>
   The injury had no bearing on Jordan's decision to retire because
he had already made that decision. But even if Jordan had decided
to return to the NBA, he would not have been ready for the start of
the season. ``It's going to take about four or six weeks to
recover,'' said Jordan, who spoke briefly on the golf course but
generally avoided interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's team shot 11 under par, playing a two best-ball format.
Payne Stewart was the professional in Jordan's group, joined by
Barkley and Roy Green, the former National Football League star.
Stewart shot a 71 and showed patience with the frenzy surrounding
his partners. It figures to be another chaotic scene Thursday, when
Jordan and Barkley play in a group with John Daly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan is an icon, so I knew what to expect,'' said
Stewart, winner of the 1989 PGA Championship and the 1991 United
States Open. ``I was looking forward to the day, and it was a
blast. There was a lot of needling going on, and it was chaotic.
But I had a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Barkley and Jordan. Hope, the 95-year-old host of the
tournament, greeted Jordan and Barkley on the first tee, and the
threesome posed for pictures. Starting on the 10th tee, Jordan
looked relaxed and hit a strong first tee shot. He went on to par
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barkley struggled mightily. At No. 18, his approach
shot sailed over the green and over the grandstand. Jordan fell to
the ground in laughter. ``I've never seen a guy hit so many bad
shots,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart agreed with Jordan's assessment of Barkley's game.
``Charles flinches over the ball,'' Stewart said. ``I don't know
how to cure that. I tried all day, but I couldn't. I don't know if
there's any hope. It's pretty ugly. I don't think he hit anybody
today, so that's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's got a beautiful rhythm, he's an exceptional athlete,
and it kind of flows into his golf game. Charles might be beyond
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Barkley's difficulties did not stop him from talking. About
Jordan's retirement, Barkley said, ``I've got 500 channels on my
dish, and he was on every one of them.'' Asked about Jordan's golf
game, Barkley said, ``He's a better golfer than me, and a better
liar, masquerading with a 10 handicap. Michael's a lot better than
a 10, maybe about a three or four. He plays every day.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan's group reached its final hole, No. 9, the joking
didn't stop. Barkley looked at Green, by far the least famous of
the foursome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to figure out who you are,'' Barkley said
to Green. ``Anybody got a name tag?''
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan did not need a name tag, and he ended his day with
style, making a 30-foot birdie putt on No. 9, as the gallery
cheered. ``It was a lot of fun,'' Jordan said, leaving quickly
after his round. After one week, Jordan and retirement seemed to be
getting along just fine.

SPORTS COLUMN: SUPER SPITE: DAN REEVES VS. BRONCOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dan Reeves was recuperating from heart bypass surgery last
month, the Atlanta Falcons' coach got a get-well phone call from
Pat Bowlen, the Denver owner who had fired Reeves as the Broncos'
coach after the 1992 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both kind of chuckled,'' Bowlen recalled last Sunday, ``and
said, `What if?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning what if both the Falcons and the Broncos were to get to
Super Bowl XXXIII?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, that scenario has materialized with all its spiteful
subplots: Reeves, once dismissed by Bowlen and dissed by
quarterback John Elway, will be opposing Bowlen, Elway and the
reigning Super Bowl-champion Broncos, coached by Mike Shanahan,
once dismissed by Reeves from his Bronco staff for siding with
Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Only once before in the Super Bowl matchups has the coach of one
team opposed a team he previously coached: The late Weeb Ewbank,
the Jets' coach in their 16-7 upset of the Baltimore Colts in III,
had taken command of the Jets in 1963 after nine seasons (and the
1958 and 1959 National Football League championships) as the Colts
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' Ewbank told his wife, Lucy, after that Super Bowl,
``the most satisfying victory of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the most satisfying because it had stung Carroll
Rosenbloom, the Colts' owner who had fired Ewbank.
</P>
<P>
   But to listen to Reeves or Bowlen or Elway or Shanahan now, all
is forgiven, if not forgotten. Reeves insisted, ``We're not
enemies.'' When the Falcon coach was recuperating, Bowlen called,
Shanahan sent a card and Elway made a donation to the Falcons Youth
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't live in the past,'' Reeves said Monday at the Falcons'
complex. ``I teach my players to look at the next play, not the
last play. I look at life the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowlen insisted, ``I have a great relationship with Dan
Reeves,'' who coached the Broncos for 12 seasons before Bowlen
fired him after an 8-8 record in the 1992 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual,'' Bowlen said, ``that after 10 or 12 years
in one organization, coaches and owners can burn out with each
other. That's symptomatic of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Giants' coach before moving to Atlanta, in 1997, Reeves
and the Giants' owners burned out after only four seasons with each
other over Reeves' desire for more control.
</P>
<P>
   Elway and Reeves also had burned out with each other, but the
Broncos quarterback is quietly diplomatic about that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at what Dan has done in the last two years with
Atlanta,'' Elway said Sunday, ``it's just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Broncos' 23-10 victory over the Jets in the American
Football Conference championship game, that's about all Elway would
say, or wanted to say. But when Elway arrived at the Broncos'
training camp in 1993 after Reeves had been fired, he had much more
to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``These last three years have been hell,'' Elway said then,
alluding to Reeves' ball-control offense. ``I know I would not have
been back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't worth it to
me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and I got tired of
working with him.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Giants' training camp, Reeves responded, saying: ``Just
tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me either. One of these days
I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway had been Reeves' quarterback in each of the Broncos' three
losing Super Bowls _ to the Giants, the Redskins, and the 49ers (in
a 55-10 rout after the 1989 season). But even during that '89
season, Elway had grown disenchanted with Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do now is ball-control,'' Elway complained. ``I
think we've got to start looking for the big play more.''
</P>
<P>
   During that season, Reeves hired Shanahan, who had been
dismissed as the Oakland Raiders' head coach, as the Broncos'
quarterback coach. Including his years as the Broncos' offensive
coordinator from 1984 to 1987, Shanahan was on the Broncos' staff
for all three Super Bowl losses under Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 season, Shanahan was out; Reeves thought he was
too cozy with Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times Dan and I were great friends,'' Shanahan said Sunday.
``He's a great coach.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Dan Reeves is a Super Bowl opponent of Mike Shanahan,
John Elway and Pat Bowlen. And a victory on Jan. 31 in Miami will
surely be most satisfying for one side or the other. &QL;

SEATTLE HAS A RECORD NUMBER OF HEROIN DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.J., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle and its surrounding county recorded a record
number of heroin-related deaths last year, according to a
preliminary report compiled by local health officials that is
likely to solidify the city's unwanted reputation as a prime center
for heroin abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Along with its fame for high-tech innovation and cultural
vibrancy, Seattle has long battled a grim notoriety for its heroin
problem, one that was aggravated by the 1994 suicide of Kurt
Cobain, the grunge rock star and lead singer for the group Nirvana,
who had struggled with heroin addiction.
</P>
<P>
   One federal study of 1997 emergency-room admissions has
identified Seattle along with Baltimore, San Francisco and Newark,
N.J., as the top cities in the United States, on a per-capita
basis, for heroin-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   The data compiled here by the Seattle-King County Public Health
Department shows that the area had 138 heroin deaths in 1998, with
at least 12 other deaths believed to have been caused by use of the
drug, with toxicology test results still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ziegler, head of the prevention division for the
department, said Wednesday that the results, to be formally
released next month, already show that the deaths have surpassed
the 1996 total of 134, and that they represent only the ``tip of an
iceberg,'' since heroin is also a factor in many deaths that may be
officially attributed to heart failure or infection.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler said the deaths ``seem to reflect pretty generally a
cross-section of our community,'' buttressing the contention of
many drug-abuse experts that heroin abuse cuts across many
different age and socioeconomic groups. ``This drug is not a
problem just in the inner city, in the Bowery,'' he said. ``It's
all over.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little debate that the problem has long been
particularly severe in Seattle. Although final comparative figures
for 1998 are not yet available, Seattle has been at or near the top
of the list of cities for heroin deaths on a per-capita basis in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But why heroin abuse is particularly bad in Seattle is a matter
of some debate. Among the factors offered by experts are Seattle's
location as a port ``gateway'' for drug shipments, a reputation for
low prices and more potent forms of the drug here, and the
self-fulfilling nature of its image as a center for heroin use.
</P>
<P>
   Some have even found evidence of higher drug use in cities, like
Seattle, with a strong music scene. ``Nashville, for instance, also
has a serious cocaine problem, a serious heroin problem as well,''
said Joycelyn Woods, executive vice president of the National
Alliance of Methadone Advocates, a nonprofit group with chapters in
40 cities. ``You never hear about it, but it's there.'' But the
contention that drug use is a byproduct of the music world has, in
turn, angered many musicians, who say the connection is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Some drug-treatment advocates here say Seattle is hampered by a
lack of facilities for helping addicts. One study a few years ago
found that King County had at least 20,000 opiate addicts, with
only 1,750 slots available for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates have also faulted a state law that limits each
licensed clinic to treating no more than 350 patients. On Friday,
the state Senate will hold a hearing in Olympia on a proposed bill
that would lift that restriction and would also allow family
doctors, under state guidelines, to provide methadone treatment in
their offices.
</P>
<P>
   King County officials also say they hope to address the problem
with a mobile methadone clinic, for which they recently received a
federal grant.

SPORTS COLUMN: TALENT IS RESURRECTED ON BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BKN-NBA) 
 (af)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association lockout is officially over,
training camps open Thursday and the Knicks, of all teams, have
boldly jumped ahead of the pack before so much as a shot is taken.
Never in my wildest dreams did I think that Latrell Sprewell would
wind up on Broadway; now that he is on the way, I find myself
actually looking forward to this abbreviated season.
</P>
<P>
   There should be a loud amen from celebrity row, from all who
have watched _ up close _ these same ol' Knicks get bounced out of
the second round of the playoffs for four consecutive seasons. You
actors, actresses and film producers, aren't you tired of seeing
the same show?
</P>
<P>
   At worst, Sprewell is a jerk. At best, he is insightful and
distant. In any event, he is not Anthony Mason who, despite the
chapel services and accouterments of religion, had difficulty
extricating himself from the pull of the street. Sprewell's problem
was that he despised his coach. He snapped 13 months ago and
wrongfully attacked P.J. Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   The incident carried subtle racial undertones; the idea that
black-on-white crime always elicits harsher penalties _ the NBA
originally suspended Sprewell for a year, before an arbitrator
reduced the penalty _ or black players chafing under an old-boy
power structure that keeps recycling the P.J. Carlesimos.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I'll be surprised if Sprewell so much as sneezes the
wrong way during his tenure in New York. This unexpected run on
Broadway may well be the blessing of his life, let alone of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell will flourish in New York for a couple of reasons. The
first and simplest is that Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy is not
Carlesimo. Some coaches get ahead because they coach; some get
ahead because they know how to maneuver. Van Gundy worked hard for
everything, and he has earned it the traditional way: as an
assistant here, an assistant there. He stood in line and finally
got his shot.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo, whose father, Peter Sr., is an important figure in
college basketball, in particular the National Invitation
Tournament, never served as an assistant. He learned how to
maneuver. He could disrespect players and get away with it because
his daddy, or some facsimile thereof (athletic director, team
president) was standing by to bail him out. One day last December,
Carlesimo and Sprewell simultaneously crossed their respective
lines, and no one's daddy was there to intervene. Now we'll see who
will have the biggest impact: Latrell or P.J.? My guess is that
you'll see Sprewell in the winner's circle before you see
Carlesimo's Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was that bad, teams wouldn't be trying to get him,'' the
Nets' Chris Gatling said recently. ``He's definitely a good
professional. And they know that.''
</P>
<P>
   The second reason the 28-year-old Sprewell will flourish in New
York is that the veteran is coming to a city of the fallen and the
resurrected; a city filled with souls who have overcome
indiscretions and excess. Surely the sports media will cheer
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   This is the city of Don Imus, the popular nonsports sports-radio
disk jockey who overcame years of abusing alcohol and drugs to
become one of the most prominent personalities on the air. Marv
Albert had a humiliating fall when the sordid details of his
private life were revealed, and he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor
assault charges. Albert was rehired last July by the MSG Network.
In explaining the decision, the MSG executive producer Mike
McCarthy said Albert was too much of a talent to be sitting on the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it. Talent. In the end it is all about winning
and ratings. Radio needs Imus, television needs Albert, the Knicks
need Sprewell. Who would have thought the Knicks had the nerve to
make a bold move that could actually push the franchise out of its
second-round doldrums?
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' renaissance, the Yankees' stunning dominance and even
the Nets' aggressive Calapari-led attack, persuaded the Knicks to
dispense with nice _ whatever that is _ and get real. So the
popular Charles Oakley goes to Toronto, the popular but volatile
John Starks and the erratic Chris Childs go west to Golden State.
The question now is whether Van Gundy and his staff have the nerve
to tell Patrick Ewing that there must also be changes in his game
if the Knicks plan to steal a championship in this abbreviated
season.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Latrell Fontaine Sprewell is coming to Broadway,
and I'm excited. For a change, the news media _ which shapes,
colors and forms so much of the public's perception _ instead of
leading the attack, can remind fans that New York, after all, is a
city of second and third chances.
</P>
<P>
   For Sprewell, the Knicks represent a golden second opportunity.
For Ewing, Sprewell may well represent his last chance. &QL;

PHILIPPOUSSIS OUTLASTS CHANG IN A THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Let's get back to the tennis,'' Brian Tobin, the International
Tennis Federation president, said hopefully as the third day of the
Australian Open was getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   After a player meeting that turned contentious over Petr Korda's
drug case and after allegations of wider drug use in the sport by
Jim Courier, Tobin wanted a respite from controversy and a return
to the power game of forehands and backhands.
</P>
<P>
   There would be some fine ones Wednesday, many in the five-set,
second-round thriller between the counterpuncher Michael Chang and
the big puncher Mark Philippoussis. The larger man with a very
large crowd behind him would triumph, 7-6 (7-1), 2-6, 6-3, 5-7,
7-5, but not before the unseeded Chang had shown flash after flash
of the sort of scrambling, overachieving tennis that once had taken
him to No. 2 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be quite honest, I felt like he was getting a bit slower,
but it didn't seem like it out there,'' said the 14th-seeded
Philippoussis, now just one round away from a potential matchup
with fellow Australian Patrick Rafter, who beat him in last year's
U.S. Open final.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Philippoussis and Rafter both played Wednesday
helps explain why 50,871 fans descended on Melbourne Park for the
day and night sessions. It was the biggest one-day crowd in the
long history of Grand Slam tennis tournaments, surpassing the crowd
of 46,922 at last year's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The third-seeded Rafter, who won with relative ease against
countryman Mark Woodforde, is the highest-ranked player remaining
in the draw. No. 1 Marcelo Rios of Chile withdrew before the
tournament with a stress fracture in his spine. Alex Corretja of
Spain, who is ranked No. 2, lost in four sets to Christian Ruud of
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not God,'' said Corretja, who, with his big backswings and
high service toss, is even less ethereal on very windy days like
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Davenport of the United States, the top-seeded woman,
advanced with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Florencia Labat of Argentina.
After playing with elbow pain for the last six months of the 1998
season, Davenport said the elbow has not bothered her since she
underwent magnet therapy in California shortly before flying to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was like a big machine with a huge magnet,'' she said.
``And I had to sit there with my arm under this magnet for five and
a half hours. I thought, `If this doesn't work, I will be really
mad.'''
</P>
<P>
   While Davenport and No. 6 seed Venus Williams had no
difficulties winning, No. 8 seed Patty Schnyder of Switzerland was
upset by a Frenchwoman, Amelie Mauresmo, 6-7 (1-7), 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   But the most compelling five-setter of the day and best match of
the tournament thus far was Philippoussis vs. Chang. After an
injury-filled 1998, Chang is now 27th in the world, yet he chased
down Philippoussis' powerful ground strokes like the Chang of yore.
But with the match in the balance late in the final set, he
struggled with his first serve, and at 5-5, Philippoussis broke him
with a typically mammoth forehand and screamed and pumped his fists
in the direction of co-coaches Gavin Hopper and Pat Cash.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the first heated weeks of Israel's four-month
election campaign, it appears that an early loser may be the
tight-fisted anti-inflation policy once championed by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but now defended only by the
politically isolated central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, one of the proudest boasts of the Netanyahu
government was that in just two years it had nearly halved the
budget deficit and kept inflation in single digits for the first
time in three decades. But now Netanyahu has rattled some market
analysts and political rivals by saying that he may abandon
long-stated quests to slow inflation to 4 percent this year and to
cut the deficit still further, to 2 percent of the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the perception that fiscal discipline has succumbed to
electoral pressure, Netanyahu is now simultaneously a candidate for
re-election and his own finance minister. He took over the finance
portfolio when Yaakov Neeman faxed his resignation from a European
vacation last month, frustrated by the governing coalition's
failure to unite behind its own 1999 budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 budget remains stalled in Parliament, leaving Israel
without one for the first time. Netanyahu has proposed additional
spending not contemplated in his original $214 billion proposal,
including free schooling for 3- and 4-year-olds, and the
reinstatement of tax subsidies for the elderly that he had once
decided to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if I were handing out videocassette recorders,''
the prime minister said, dismissing accusations from opponents that
he is abandoning principle in an effort to buy back voters
disaffected by his dealings with the Palestinians and by his
personal style. He lost a functioning majority in Parliament and
called new elections, serving during the campaign now in a
caretaker role.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Netanyahu's critics nonetheless endorse his newly
espoused view that it is time to ``loosen the belts'' and embrace
more inflation and higher spending if it brings another point or
two of job growth.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the sole point of concord in the battle to form the next
government seems to be across-the-board opposition to the Bank of
Israel's steadfast refusal to prime the pump with lower interest
rates. The central bank's key discount rate is 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Meridor, who resigned as Netanyahu's first finance minister
in 1997 and now seeks the prime ministership in a new centrist
grouping, called current interest rates exorbitant. ``To get
inflation down is important, but this cannot be the only God we
worship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts warn that acceding to expansionary pressure
would impose costs of its own on an economy that succumbed to
hyperinflation a decade ago, but had recently seemed to be entering
an era of price stability and export-driven economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with unemployment rising to nearly 9 percent last year and
per-capita income declining 0.4 percent, to $17,178, politicians
across the spectrum are pushing hard for cheaper credit and more
state spending. The alternative, they say, with global markets
wobbling and local political uncertainties discouraging foreign
investment, could be a deep and prolonged recession.
</P>
<P>
   Avraham Shohat, who served as finance minister in the last Labor
Party government, said that Israel could not afford to combat
inflation at the cost of high unemployment. ``We have a very
expensive life, with our security problems, and with immigration,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a choice between 2 percent inflation and 12 percent
unemployment, and 5 percent inflation and 5 percent unemployment, I
would choose the latter,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, Netanyahu surprised rival politicians and
financial analysts by declaring his intention to raise the
government's official inflation target for 1999 to a range of 5
percent to 7 percent from the previously announced 4 percent _ an
increase he called ``not that significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for a government that had pledged to keep inflation at
levels of the leading industrial nations, the statement was seen as
a philosophical reversal _ and a transparent effort to force the
Bank of Israel to relax its tight money policies.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's president, Jacob Frenkel, now at the midpoint
of his second presidentially appointed five-year term, has
suggested that overt pressure by the prime minister may backfire,
making a rate cut even less likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets are impressed by the degree of commitment by
policy-makers to price stability,'' Frenkel said in an interview
last week. ``If this is put into question, it makes the job for
monetary policy even more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be an ``extraordinary mistake,'' he said, to raise the
inflation target at a moment when the central bank believes that
the annualized rate is already falling back to the 4-to-5 percent
range.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Netanyahu reiterated his intention to revise the
target upward, but did not say when the new figure would be
formally adopted. Though the central bank has almost complete
autonomy in setting interest rates and managing the money supply,
it is legally obligated to work within a government-determined
framework of inflation goals and other macroeconomic targets.
</P>
<P>
   Frenkel is worried that he may end up officially committed to a
higher target than the credit markets would dictate in the course
of trading. ``It would be an extraordinarily awkward challenge and
task for the central bank to reverse course and support higher
inflation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Netanyahu's announcement portrayed it as a simple
acknowledgment of economic reality. Prices last year jumped 8.6
percent, the central bank announced last Friday, up from 7 percent
in 1997. The 4 percent target for 1999 was no longer viable, they
argued.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, however, says that the inflationary surge of 1998 was
a short-term problem that has since been contained. The Russian
financial crisis that began in August reverberated locally with a
slight but jolting devaluation of Israel's currency, the shekel, in
September. Sharp price increases resulted for imports and other
dollar-pegged goods in October and November.
</P>
<P>
   Frenkel pushed up interest rates in a successful effort to stop
a continuing run on the shekel, which dropped to an exchange rate
of 4.4 in October from 3.9 in September, and has since rebounded to
4.049 to the dollar on Wednesday. The interest-rate spike worked,
but at the price of a virtual freeze in new lending to business.
</P>
<P>
   A University of Chicago economist and a former research director
of the International Monetary Fund, Frenkel is an unapologetic
defender of this bitter monetary medicine. His former IMF
colleagues are strong supporters, urging the government not to
raise the inflation target and praising the bank's tough
interest-rate stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This firm monetary-policy response, which occurred against the
background of uncertainty about the passage of the 1999 budget,
provided a strong signal that price increases beyond those stemming
directly from the depreciation of the shekel would not be
accommodated,'' the IMF noted approvingly last month.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic political reaction, though, was unremittingly
hostile, with members of Parliament from left, right and center
assailing the belt-tightening. Netanyahu's aides echoed the
criticism of Frenkel, and Shohat introduced a bill that would
transfer interest-rate authority to a new committee presided over
by the bank but controlled by appointees of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed its first reading last week. This politicization
of monetary policy would be preferable, Shohat said, to the present
system, ``where one man has the power to decide by himself.''

LARGEST STUDY YET RATES EFFECT OF FERTILITY DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass.) (lb) 
 By PHILLIP HILTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using fertility drugs increases a woman's chances of getting
pregnant, but the drugs should be used cautiously to avoid the
possibility of multiple birth, said a study and an accompanying
editorial in the current issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The report was the first large, well-controlled study to ask and
answer the question about whether using fertility drugs actually
improved chances of pregnancy. Some doctors have suggested that
conception would occur normally without drug treatment for couples
who were patient, and some have suggested that other treatments
without fertility drugs might work just as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the new study, carried out on 932 couples at 10 fertility
centers around the United States, showed that for couples with no
known physical bars to pregnancy who had tried to get pregnant for
three and a half years, on average, using fertility drugs and
injecting the husband's sperm directly into the wife's womb was the
most effective method.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of drugs and uterine injection used each month
for four months resulted in pregnancy for 33 percent of the women.
A second method, using drugs but injecting sperm onto the cervix,
had a 19 percent success rate. A third group, using no drugs but
with injection of sperm into the womb, had a success rate of 18
percent. Injecting sperm onto the cervix produced pregnancies in 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in an editorial accompanying the study, two Dutch fertility
experts, Dr. Egbert te Velde and Dr. Bernard Cohlen, both of
University Hospital in Utrecht, raised a caution about the study.
The doctors wrote that the data in the study supported the idea
that if patients were willing to wait another year and continue
with sexual intercourse alone, a result that was just as good might
be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting has the advantage of avoiding the possibility of
multiple births caused by fertility drugs. In this study, 24 of the
72 women who took drugs and became pregnant had multiple
pregnancies _ including three sets of quadruplets and four sets of
triplets. Without fertility drugs, about one in 90 pregnancies
might produce multiple births.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial suggested that couples seeking to have children
often were not given full information on their choices, and might
believe they no longer had a good chance of getting pregnant
without drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Guzick of the University of Rochester, the chief
author of the paper, argued that although 10 percent of the
patients in the study who did not take drugs still became pregnant,
that did not suggest that if the study were carried on for another
year or two, an additional 10 percent or 20 percent would get
pregnant. Some patients might have unknown problems that prevented
pregnancy, Guzick said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the fertility treatments studied were
generally not the first option. The women in the study took
gonadotropins, which induce women to produce more eggs than normal,
in conjunction with sperm injected directly into the uterus,
usually the third approach. The first two methods are carefully
timed intercourse and treatment with weaker drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Benjamin Younger, executive director of the American Society
of Reproductive Medicine, said that the editorial's suggestion that
couples wait for treatment was ``great in theory, but doesn't work
in practice,'' adding, ``People who have been trying for years are
very frustrated and don't want to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the authors of the study noted that they were paid
consultants for Serono, a Massachusetts company that makes
fertility drugs.

BUSINESS OF BASKETBALL NOW BEGINS IN EARNEST

<P>
   The gymnasium doors open at 2 p.m. Eastern time, and the
free-agent-signing floodgates will burst. Coaches will coach and
players will be gasping for air for the first time in six months
and every wild bit of speculation will either become reality or
remain rumor.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the season was rescued from cancellation, the
National Basketball Association is open for business. On Wednesday
night, the league and the players union completed details and
formally signed the new six-year collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The 29 teams will play a 50-game schedule beginning Feb. 5, and
a full complement of playoff series is expected to begin in May and
last until the final week of June.
</P>
<P>
   The lifting of the lockout, which lasted 204 days, means teams
can immediately begin talking to their players and give physical
exams both to those under contract and to potential free agents.
</P>
<P>
   It also clears the way for a bevy of signings, including the
deal that will take Latrell Sprewell to the New York Knicks and
send John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings to the Golden
State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   The league also announced the start of the exhibition season on
Sunday in Chicago, where you will need a program to identify the
six-time champion Bulls. In the first of 29 exhibition games
between neighborly franchises, Chicago will be host to Indiana at 3
p.m. Eastern time.
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Jordan retired, Scottie Pippen on a plane to
Houston to be introduced by the Rockets on Friday, Steve Kerr
headed to San Antonio and Luc Longley on his way to Phoenix,
Chicago will field a roster that will include Roy Rogers, Martin
Murrsepp, Bubba Wells and Mark Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio was scheduled to meet Houston on Saturday in the
first preseason game, but the delay in signing the new agreement
forced the teams to push the game back to Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks and the New Jersey Nets meet each other at Madison
Square Garden at 7:30 p.m. next Wednesday and at Continental Arena
at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   There were other developments Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charles Barkley was trying to drive up his earning power in
Houston, implying that he had not ruled out Atlanta and Seattle as
possible teams he would sign with. Speaking from the Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic in La Quinta, Calif., Barkley mused out loud
whether to sign with Houston or Seattle. ``Who do you think is
better? Me, Olajuwon and Pippen? Or me, Gary Payton and Vin
Baker?''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said seven teams inquired about his services, and he
told four not to phone back _ including the Knicks. The prevailing
feeling among team officials is that Barkley will re-sign with
Houston. Also, the SuperSonics are interested in Olden Polynice and
Billy Owens to help shore up their front line.
</P>
<P>
   _ Glen Rice, the deadeye shooting guard for the Charlotte
Hornets, will undergo elbow surgery and will probably miss at least
the first month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Detroit Pistons were on the verge of signing Loy Vaught
and Christian Laettner to multiyear deals, despite injuries that
may prevent them from playing in February. Laettner, one of the
biggest lockout casualties, underwent arthroscopic surgery for a
torn knee ligament he suffered in a pickup game last summer at Duke
University. But he has been rehabilitating ever since, and may be
ready to play as early as March.
</P>
<P>
   _ Denver outlasted Phoenix in the scramble for the sky-walking
forward Antonio McDyess. ``It was a real close call,'' McDyess'
agent, James Bryant, told The Associated Press. ``It came down to a
question of do you want to inherit a contender or do you want to
build one? Phoenix is a great franchise, but Denver is doing a lot
of exciting things that haven't come out yet.'' The Suns,
meanwhile, began pursuing Tom Gugliotta, whom Minnesota hopes to
re-sign.
</P>
<P>
   League lawyers have been working on the new agreement round the
clock since the two sides settled on Jan. 6, and will get little
rest between now and Feb. 5. Every one of at least 15 deals on the
table on Thursday must be approved by the NBA before the trade or
acquisition is made final.
</P>
<P>
   One league official said on condition of anonymity: ``It's all
going to be happening rapid-fire. Teams will be talking to agents,
players will be meeting their new teammates and general chaos will
reign for a few days. But at least it's back to the business of
basketball, thank God.''

FAULTY CONSTRUCTION CITED IN TIMES SQUARE TOWER COLLAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 700-foot construction scaffold that buckled and
broke in Times Square last summer, killing a woman in a nearby
hotel and paralyzing traffic for several days, was built improperly
and was missing critical support braces on 10 floors, according to
citations issued Wednesday by federal safety officials.
</P>
<P>
   The citations issued by the federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration against the builder of the scaffold,
Universal Builders Supply, do not state that the defects were the
cause of the collapse, the city's most serious construction
accident in a decade. But investigators involved in a city inquiry
say the violations were among the problems that contributed to the
accident on July 21 at the construction site of the Conde Nast
building, on Broadway between 42nd and 43rd Streets.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing the citations accusing the company of four safety
violations, the federal agency recommended fines totaling $26,000.
Universal Builders, which is based in Mount Vernon, N.Y., has until
Feb. 10 to contest the citations.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the accident,'' said Robert Kulick, director of the
federal safety agency in New York, ``we found that the scaffold had
not been built in accordance with an engineer's plans, that support
braces were missing and that the company had failed to insure that
the mast bolts were maintained for tightness. We consider these
serious safety violations.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's official investigation into the causes of the
accident is still months away from completion. One person involved
in that investigation said that early on, ``it was clear that there
was some crossbracing that was missing.'' The braces were designed
to insure that the scaffold remained straight, level and square
against the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``My suspicion is that we'll undoubtedly agree with OSHA,'' said
the investigator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   City investigators and engineers said they were unsure whether
they could identify a single reason for the accident, but that they
could probably identify a series of problems that built one upon
another, creating a ``cascade effect,'' until the scaffold
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin O'Callaghan, president of United Builders, declined to
comment on the accusations of violations because the city was still
investigating the collapse. He did issue a statement saying that
``the actual cause of the collapse has not yet been determined.''
</P>
<P>
   United Builders, which erected scaffolding for the renovation of
the Statue of Liberty, Grand Central Terminal and the Washington
Monument, is already contesting citations for other safety
violations in the death of a carpenter, Charles Robbins, in an
earlier accident at the Conde Nast site, which is known as 4 Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   The city's report may not be completed until May 1, said Gaston
Silva, the city's building commissioner. ``We will look at OSHA's
findings and incorporate them into our findings,'' Silva said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the scaffolding cast a pall over what was
supposed to have been a triumph for the developer, Douglas Durst,
and a symbol of the rebirth of Times Square. Durst was building the
first new office tower in Manhattan since the recession in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But on the morning of July 21, the scaffold and an elevator
tower that had been erected next to the 48-story tower buckled at
the 21st floor as the sound of tearing metal echoed across midtown.
The scaffolding above the 20th floor dropped about eight feet,
wrenching the elevator tower, which snapped off and fell. A 50-foot
section of that tower pierced the roof of the Woodstock Hotel
across 43rd Street, knocking a concrete slab onto Thereza
Feliconio, 85, and killing her as she sat in her top-floor
apartment.

AMERICAN AND US AIRWAYS POST WEAK FOURTH QUARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Ariz.) 
(lb) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines and US Airways posted disappointing quarterly
earnings Wednesday on weaker-than-expected revenues, while America
West Airlines exceeded Wall Street estimates by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that American and US Airways, like other major
domestic airlines, were hurt during the final months of 1998 as
revenue declined from the premium fares most often paid by business
travelers flying at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airlines make most of their money off business travelers and
you saw business travel stall in the fourth quarter,'' said Glenn
Engel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Low fuel prices helped ease the carriers' pain by lowering
expenses. But the savings were not enough to offset the slide in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   AMR Corp., the holding company for American, the second-largest
airline in the United States, said earnings declined 13 percent to
$182 million, or $1.09 a diluted share, compared with $208 million,
or $1.16 a share, during the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting for a stock split and one-time gains, AMR earned $1.00
a share compared with $1.09 in 1997. The consensus estimate of
analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. was $1.16 a share.
</P>
<P>
   While total revenue at AMR rose 1.3 percent to $4.6 billion in
the quarter, passenger revenue at American Airlines fell 3 percent
to $3.5 billion compared with the same period last year. The
company attributed the decline primarily to softening demand on its
international routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing are weaker economies in Europe and Latin
America and Asia at a time of capacity increases by the industry,''
Gerard Arpey, AMR's chief financial officer, said.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, the sixth-largest domestic airline, earned $104
million, or $1.18 a share, in the quarter, compared with $479
million, or $4.66 a share in the same period a year earlier.
Excluding a one-time $125 million charge and a $467 million tax
credit, earnings declined 25 percent. The consensus earnings
estimate by First Call had been $1.20 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's costs, not including fuel, declined 1 percent
compared with a year earlier, largely because of the introduction
of Metrojet, the low-cost airline it started last year to combat
growing competition from Southwest Airlines. But Metrojet also
charges lower fares, which along with the softening of business
travel pushed US Airways' total per-passenger revenues down nearly
5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company was also hurt during the quarter by the transition
to a new computer reservations system that confused many
reservation agents.
</P>
<P>
   Engel said that Rakesh Gangwal, US Airways' chief executive,
told analysts during a teleconference on Wednesday that downward
pressures on revenues would continue this year as the airline
expands Metrojet and faces more competition. Gangwal warned that
the consensus 1999 earnings estimate of $6.40 a share might be too
high.
</P>
<P>
   America West, which struggled to improve its operations last
year, bucked the industry trend by attracting more business
travelers on long-haul flights to cities like New York and Boston
from its hubs in Phoenix and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for America West, which is based in Phoenix and is
the ninth-largest airline in the country, remained flat at about
$20 million in the quarter, but soared 11 percent to $22.4 million
after excluding a one-time charge. Stock purchases helped per-share
earnings soar to 56 cents from 43 cents in 1997, easily surpassing
the First Call consensus estimate of 39 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Parker, America West's chief financial officer, said
America West plans to continue to woo business travelers this year
and will expand capacity by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, America
West shares rose $1.375 to $19.50; US Airways fell $6.3125 a share,
to $51.125, and AMR fell $4.4375, to $59.8125.

 &HT;    Payne welcomes any look into Atlanta's bid
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's Olympic organizers say they would welcome an
investigation, if only to quash continuing speculation about what
misdeeds might have occurred in trying to get the 1996 Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be delighted to talk about the experience: the good, the
bad and the difficult,'' said Billy Payne, leader of the volunteer
bid committee and later president of the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games. ``We ain't perfect, and we ain't arrogant, but we
didn't bribe anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he is weary of the media barrage distracting him from
his current job as a top executive with Premiere Technologies. He
also said he hasn't heard the first word from any of the four
investigations into suspected wrongdoing by Salt Lake City Olympic
organizers. Although the International Olympic Committee said it
would expand its inquiry to other cities if presented with
evidence, Payne said no one has contacted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will talk to anybody,'' he said in an interview in his
sixth-floor office at Premiere headquarters near Lenox Square.
``Notwithstanding the fact that we all have other jobs now, and
this was 10 or 12 years ago, and it's hard to remember, we're still
put in a position where we have to explain the fact that we
competed under the rules, which is kind of regrettable. But we're
not stonewalling anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he responded to IOC inquiries in 1990 after Atlanta
won the Games. At that time, the IOC convened representatives of
all bid cities in Lausanne, Switzerland, and grilled them about the
bid process and any abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so euphoric, we didn't have anything bad to say about
the process,'' Payne said. He said he does not recall any losing
bidders citing specific problems. ``We would say what we already
said. We played by the rules. There was nothing untoward, nothing
unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Atlanta bid to heat up
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Battle, a key member of Atlanta's bid effort and later
head of ACOG's international relations, said Wednesday, ``In some
ways I wish they'd just investigate us, because I don't think
they'd find anything. And then they'd give us a clean bill of
health, and we could get on with things.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle, now president of Central Atlanta Progress, a downtown
business group, is the most public member from the Atlanta Olympic
effort. He said he has fielded dozens of media calls from around
the globe since the Salt Lake influence-peddling scandal broke in
November. The interest in Atlanta will only intensify now that the
IOC has promised to look beyond the awarding of the 2002 Games and
reportedly has unearthed unethical activities in Toronto and
Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   A report authored by the IOC's Dick Pound, a Montreal lawyer,
details influence-peddling in the awarding of Olympics dating back
to the 1980s, according to the Wall Street Journal, which has seen
the report. Pound details activities of sports agents attempting to
sell IOC votes for millions of dollars in bribes. And it implicates
as many as 16 IOC members, who could face expulsion for violating
IOC ethics by accepting payments and gifts from Salt Lake City bid
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he was ``shocked'' when told of allegations that Salt
Lake officials provided scholarships, medical care, lavish gifts
and cold cash to IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salt Lake had the best bid on its merits to host the Winter
Olympic Games,'' Payne said. ``It was not necessary, given the
incredible impressiveness of their bid, to move outside at all the
permitted boundaries of the bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   While all bidding cities were required to provide first-class
airfare and accommodations for visiting IOC members, Payne said,
the scholarships, cosmetic surgery and expensive rifles and ski
trips supposedly offered by Salt Lake officials crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's inappropriate, clearly,'' Payne said, referring to the
$400,000 scholarship program that benefited relatives of at least
six IOC members. ``It is systematic. It is organized. It is
intentional. I even saw where a member of their board said, `Yeah,
we used the Atlanta model.' Well, we didn't have a scholarship
program. We didn't have a model.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne's close ally on the Atlanta bid effort, former Mayor
Andrew Young, said last week he thought the scholarship program was
acceptable, because it helped poor Africans receive an education.
Payne said he disagrees but conceded that he understood Young's
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Andy espouses that there is nothing wrong with this
program, I know from the bottom reaches of his heart he sincerely
believes that,'' Payne said. ``In this particular context, as it
relates to the fact that relatives of these students were to later
cast their vote, I think it is inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Young recently admitted delivering athletic equipment and
apparel to Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC member implicated in the
scandal. The goods, to be distributed to African youth, were
delivered a month before Atlanta won the bid in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But Payne gave Young his unqualified support. ``You're talking
about the conduct of one of the greatest human beings that God ever
put on this Earth,'' Payne said about Young, bristling when asked
if Young's activities were questionable in the context of the
current scandal. ``So, when Andy Young tells me and others that in
taking those balls and T-shirts to those kids he was doing it as a
part of what he considered his mandate in life, to help others,
then I would support that with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   No control over plane tickets
</P>
<P>
   As for courting the IOC, Payne said, ``We were told that
first-class air fare was what you provide them, that gifts up to
$200 or $150 were permitted. Instead of taking them to fancy
restaurants, we took them into our homes. We felt it was just an
extension of Southern hospitality. I felt we were showing our city
in its best light.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he did not know that some IOC members habitually
cashed in their first-class tickets instead of using them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an obligation to reimburse them for first-class air
fare,'' he said. ``Whether or not we had an obligation to strap
them in a lie detector chair and ask them if they used it, I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he was never approached by any consultants seeking
bribes for votes and wouldn't have responded favorably if he had.
</P>
<P>
   As the IOC executive board convenes in Lausanne this weekend to
interrogate the indicted and discuss reform of the bid-selection
process, Payne and other former Atlanta Olympic officials debate
whether to hold a news conference here to manage what might become
a flood of inquiries. ``I have ultimate responsibility and
accountability for everything that happened during the bid,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he expressed disagreement with calls by Salt Lake
organizers and others for IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch to
take similar responsibility for the actions of IOC members. ``I'm
giving him the benefit of the doubt, primarily because I'm grateful
to him,'' he said. ``And I haven't seen any hard evidence to date
that connects him to this wrongdoing, and he's done so much for the
Olympic movement.

THE GENTRIFICATION OF SAN FRANCISCO'S MISSION DISTRICT

 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sixteenth and Mission Streets is still the heart
of the heart of the city's Spanish-speaking community. The fruit
stands are piled shoulder high with plantanos, yucca and mangoes,
the saleswomen in the discount department stores still greet
customers with ``Hola'' and families still wear their Sunday best
to attend services at the Pentecostal Iglesia de JesuCristo.
</P>
<P>
   Just one traffic light away, Sixteenth and Valencia Streets, is
another story. The people sipping lattes at the new Intermission
Cafe are young, trendy and non-Hispanic. The shops _ from vintage
clothing stores to bars to used-book stores _ cater to the same.
Every weekend, the bars along Valencia draw upwardly mobile
hipsters from all over the San Francisco Bay Area. They jam into
the pubs and clubs, zigzagging into the streets like lines of
dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   But Valencia Street is not the only pocket of change here. Madre
y padre grocery stores now stand side by side with health food
stores, auto shops with art galleries. The entire Mission District,
port of entry for San Francisco's Hispanic immigrants for more than
50 years, is changing by the day. Sagging Victorian houses that
landlords had chopped into two or three rental units are sold for a
half-million dollars, and warehouses are becoming loft condominiums
in the $300,000 to $400,000 range. The neighborhood is gentrifying.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, people here worry that these changes have come at
a heavy cost to the Mission's working-class residents. For all its
grit, the Mission has played an important role in a city where
prices already were extraordinarily high and low-income housing
especially scarce. It has been a cultural center for Hispanic
people in the Bay Area, the one neighborhood where new immigrants
knew they could find a home. Now, there is a fear that as San
Francisco becomes more affluent, the ingredients that made the
Mission District unique will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, San Francisco began attracting new money
squeezed out of the housing market in nearby Silicon Valley. That
drove the price of housing in the city sky high. The Mission
District, with two highways leading to Silicon Valley, 11 city bus
lines and stops for the Bay Area Rapid Transit trains, was waiting
to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, rents here have jumped from $600 a
month for a two-bedroom apartment to $1,800; a house that cost
$150,000 is now $450,000. More tenants have been evicted in the
last three years than at any other time by landlords using a city
ordinance that allows eviction if the owner or a relative plans to
move in for at least a year. Last year, 1,400 apartments in the
city were emptied for this reason, most of them in the Mission
District.
</P>
<P>
   Tenant advocates say that the real numbers are much higher
because scores of families simply moved when asked by their
landlords. A city law was passed in November to curb the owner
move-in evictions, in part because many landlords used the law to
re-list the apartments at up to three times the previous rent. But
tenants rights' groups say renters who are illegally evicted or
evicted using a state law, the little-known Ellis Act, continue to
flood their offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evictions are all we do these days,'' said Matt Brown, a
lawyer who directs the St. Peter's Housing Committee in the
Mission, a tenants' advocacy group. ``We'd like to do other things,
like community organizing, but the housing situation in the city
has made it almost impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Since November, when owner move-in evictions became harder, more
landlords have been seeking to evict tenants under the Ellis Act by
taking the buildings permanently off the market. Tenants in 16
buildings were evicted under the act in 1997, and in 65 buildings
last year.
</P>
<P>
   For many who have been forced out of their apartments in the
Mission, there is nowhere else in the city they can find apartments
with rents as low, except perhaps Hunters-Baypoint, a neighborhood
known for its crime and lack of stores. So Mission residents are
increasingly moving out of the city, and those who stay often rent
space in friends' or relatives' apartments, in miserable
single-room-occupancy hotels, or in garages, storage barns or even
vans.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Cedeno found herself in a garage with her 8-year-old son
and 6-year-old daughter after one piece of hard luck after another.
Her husband was deported to Nicaragua, then her apartment rent was
doubled. She rented a room for $400 a month in a two-bedroom
apartment, but had to leave when the landlord found out.
</P>
<P>
   Then she heard about the garage, which stood in front of a
toolshed occupied by a young man. Like most garages, it was cold,
dark and musty. Mold grew on the cinderblock walls, live wires hung
from the ceiling, and the corners had gaping holes. It had no
kitchen and no bathroom, just a sink. But the owner, Ms. Cedeno
said, promised that she would install a bathroom within two weeks.
Ms. Cedeno agreed to pay $400 a month for rent, and an additional
$75 a month for water and $85 for electricity for one outlet. The
bathroom was never installed, Ms. Cedeno said. Rats, worms and
roaches began eating her children's clothing. When her daughter
developed respiratory problems, a doctor told her to tell her
landlady to get the garage fumigated. The landlady scoffed.
</P>
<P>
   After nine months, Ms. Cedeno found a clean two-bedroom
apartment in Oakland for $650 a month. The garage was rented the
day she moved out, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, said Ted Gullicksen of the San Francisco Tenants'
Union, residents are harassed into moving or offered money to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point, starting in '97, when landlords were
getting 50 people lining up for an apartment,'' he said. ``So, the
next month an apartment was empty, they'd charge more, and they'd
still get 50 people lining up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Patricia Botilla left her beloved two-bedroom apartment in the
Mission, where she had lived for 16 years, when her landlord gave
her $15,000 so that he could re-list the apartment for $1,600 a
month. She was paying $465. ``I took the money because I was tired
of fighting,'' Ms. Botilla said.
</P>
<P>
   For three years before she moved, the six-unit building
containing her apartment was bought and sold three times.
</P>
<P>
   One landlord sent her an eviction notice, then retracted it when
she challenged its legality. Another emptied the building of
tenants, leaving her alone with workers who hammered and drilled
day and night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Botilla ended up renting a room for $375 in an
acquaintance's apartment in another neighborhood. Almost $5,000 of
the $15,000 she got from her landlord was spent on moving and
storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been displaced from everything I knew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After catching her breath and wiping away a sudden flow of
tears, she added: ``It's not that the Mission was any utopia. But
it was my home.''

SBC TO ACQUIRE COMCAST'S CELLULAR TELEPHONE OPERATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Md., Mass., N.Y., Conn., R.I., Pa., N.J., Del.)  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As part of continuing consolidation in the cellular telephone
industry, SBC Communications Inc. has agreed to acquire the
cellular telephone operations of the Comcast Corp. for $400 million
in cash and $1.27 billion in assumed debt.
</P>
<P>
   SBC will add Comcast's 800,000 cellular customers, most in the
Northeast, to the 6.5 million cellular subscribers it already has,
also concentrated in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, first reported in The Philadelphia Inquirer, offers
Comcast a way to focus more aggressively on its core cable business
and substantially reduce its debt.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast has been gradually reducing its debt, and its ratio of
debt to cash flow after the deal will be about 3.4 to 1, compared
with 8.7 to 1 in 1994. Along with other cable operators, Comcast's
stock has been rising steadily and closed Wednesday at $66.3125
after touching a 52-week high of $69.25 during the day. Once the
deal is completed, the company will have $4.9 billion in debt and
pro forma cash flow of $1.44 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was logical in an industry that has been consolidating
rapidly and is under intense pricing pressure because of the
popularity of the AT&AMP;T Corp.'s single-rate program, which allows
customers to use their phones anywhere in the United States and pay
one rate, with no roaming or long-distance charges. That plan has
forced regional competitors to consolidate and match the low
prices, and explains why the Bell Atlantic Corp. wanted to buy
Airtouch Communications Inc. so badly before it lost out to
Vodafone Group P.L.C. of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   With only 800,000 customers, Comcast could not hope to compete
aggressively, and Salvatore Muoio, who heads his own investment
partnership, said that the sale should have occurred years ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, SBC is paying only 10 times 1998 cash flow for the
cellular customers, or about $2,100 a customer. That multiple is
far lower than the roughly 18 times cash flow that Vodafone agreed
to pay for Airtouch in its $60 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of Airtouch's customers are overseas. Muoio
noted that American cellular properties are selling at lower
multiples because buyers think that there is more growth potential
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Roberts, the president of Comcast, acknowledged Wednesday
that there was a trend toward national and global competitors in
the wireless industry, making it harder for smaller operators. And
Comcast can use the cash from the sale to help pay off pending
acquisitions. It has agreed to pay $700 million for a controlling
stake in Jones Intercable Inc., which has a million subscribers,
and $760 million for Prime Communications, with 450,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   SBC already has agreed to buy the Ameritech Corp., the
fifth-largest local phone company. Its cellular customers are in
Washington, Baltimore, Boston, upstate New York, Connecticut and
Rhode Island. Comcast has customers in Philadelphia, Delaware and
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Salomon, a spokesman for SBC, said the merger would
slightly dilute earnings, but he added that it would not affect
Wall Street's projection of $2.37 a share for 1999. SBC fell 50
cents Wednesday, to $58.50.

BURE, MAN OF MYSTIQUE, JOINS THE ICE WARS 
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Russia, Canada, Wash., Mich.) By JOE LAPOINTE  
  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ After flying in Wednesday from Moscow, Pavel
Bure slept from midnight until 9 a.m., more hours than some hockey
players get on the road. Next to Bure in the first-class cabin was
Yuri Ushakov, on his way to Washington as Russia's new ambassador
to the United States. Bure was en route to New York as the newest
Florida Panther.
</P>
<P>
   High over the Atlantic, these two citizens of the world could
talk about hockey and politics and who knows what else. Perhaps
they discussed capitalism. Bure's next contract, currently being
negotiated, might pay up to $10 million per season. Russian players
such as Bure, Detroit's Sergei Fedorov and Ottawa's Aleksei Yashin,
the last generation raised under Soviet Communism, are among the
most determined bargainers in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   One of the elite athletes in his sport, Bure forced a trade by
refusing to report to the Vancouver Canucks and missing half the
season. Idle for nine months, no longer a resident of Canada, he
was back in the U.S. of A. for a morning skate with his new
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Bure decided to compete Wednesday night against the
Islanders at the Coliseum and Thursday against the Rangers in
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to start to play anyway,'' Bure said. ``So I'll start
tonight. I really want to play. The sooner I start, the better. It
was pretty hard, especially the last five months. I was missing it
a lot. Finally, it's over and I'm glad.''
</P>
<P>
   He wore black slacks, a black shirt with a zipper to the neck, a
black suit coat with little lapels, shiny, black buckled shoes on
his feet and the usual wary look in his eyes. His longish hair is
reddish-brown and his full mouth often seems to pout. In many ways,
Bure is hockey's international man of mystery. A few years ago,
Bure said he would re-establish his family's watch-making business,
which dates back to the days of the czar. Wednesday, he said that
it is hard to concentrate on hockey and business and that his
factories aren't yet on line.
</P>
<P>
   In recent seasons, Bure's name has been heard in whispers of
players targeted for extortion by Russian mobsters. When he travels
around to Moscow night clubs in luxury sedans with bodyguards, it
can promote gossip.
</P>
<P>
   His father, a former Olympic diver, was Bure's personal trainer
_ until Bure fired him.
</P>
<P>
   Among the teams mentioned in the trade talks for Bure were the
Islanders and the Rangers. After the Islanders dropped out, the
Rangers, seemed to be a logical fit. They need another scorer if
they are to avoid missing the playoffs for the second consecutive
season. They have the money, as their $42 million payroll suggests.
They have the Russian community of Brighton Beach nearby and they
have the big spotlight that Bure seems to enjoy, although he
pretends to shrug it off with insouciance. ``Do I have a choice?''
he said, with a smile, of the attention. ``Mostly, I enjoy playing
hockey. Anything else I have to do, I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers declined Bure when Vancouver insisted on the
rookie Manny Malhotra as part of the deal. The Rangers project
Malhotra as a future captain, a two-way center who could be a star
for a decade. With Wayne Gretzky at $6 million, Mike Richter at $5
million and free agent-to-be Brian Leetch negotiating in the range
of $6 million to $10 million, even the Rangers have their limits.
Neil Smith, the president and general manager, says that, at this
stage of rebuilding, a trade of Malhotra and other young players
for Bure would risk long-term infrastructure for limited,
short-term success.
</P>
<P>
   In the news media this week, Smith has spun his case with vigor
rarely seen outside impeachment defenses. It remains to be seen if
Smith's jury, his bosses at the Garden, will allow Smith to finish
his term, especially if the Rangers miss the tournament again.
</P>
<P>
   Bure dodges the Ranger issue as deftly as he avoids checks of
defensemen. He is a Panther now, dedicated to beating the Rangers
and finishing ahead of them and other teams in the race for the
playoffs. Ranger fans, wishful and wistful, can see him Thursday
night in his only scheduled New York appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Murray, the Panthers coach, said Bure would play on a line
with two other Russian skaters, Viktor Kozlov and Oleg Kvasha.
``The chemistry could be pretty good right away,'' Murray said.
``The fact that they speak the same language is going to make him
feel more comfortable at the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray's brother, Bryan Murray, is the general manager of the
Panthers. When he worked in Detroit, Bryan Murray helped assemble
the ``Russian Five'' that made up the core of the Red Wings'
championship squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous move for hockey,'' Bryan Murray said of
Bure's return.
</P>
<P>
   He is probably right, although he gambled big by trading
defenseman Ed Jovanovski and several other assets. In an era of low
scoring, great goalies and stifling defensive systems, Bure is a
virtuoso, able to create goals with solo rushes of speedy skating
and hard shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In the Olympics last winter in Japan, Bure's five-goal explosion
eliminated Finland and put Russia in the gold-medal game. Even
hockey's devoted aficionados can count its top gate attractions on
the fingers of two hands, and Bure could be the one with a ring.
For hiring him, the Murrays rate two thumbs up, even if their
fingers are crossed. &QL;

SAMMY SOLOVITZ, 71, A MENTOR AT THE TIMES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Texas)  By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sammy Solovitz, a wise-cracking, hard-living mentor to
generations of copy boys at The New York Times, died on Jan. 12 in
Houston. He was 71 and had lived in Texas since his retirement in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   He died in his apartment of natural but as yet undetermined
causes, said his niece, Brenda Polunsky.
</P>
<P>
   From the day he was hired at The Times _ Nov. 18, 1943 _ Samuel
Leo Solovitz captivated the low and the mighty with his feisty
manner and pugnacious wit. To the scores of well-known reporters
and editors who came to the business through his newsroom boot
camp, he became a figure in lore _ a symbol of an era when
newsrooms still pulsated to the clack of typewriters and copy boys
rushed stories, a few paragraphs at a time, from reporters to
editors, and then to the printers in the composing room.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he was hired, he was 16 and delivering telegrams. At
4 feet 9 inches, he was too short for the Army but tall enough to
work as a uniformed messenger for Western Union. When he whisked
into the city room, Edwin L. James, the managing editor, looked up
from his desk and was intrigued by the sight of a pillbox hat
bobbing above a railing that surrounded his corner office _ all he
could see of Solovitz.
</P>
<P>
   James investigated and engaged the messenger in conversation.
The messenger spoke his mind. (He always did.) James asked him if
he would like a job. Solovitz said he would. He went to the Western
Union office, turned in his uniform and then returned to take up
his duties as a copy boy, earning $16 a week, $2 more than he got
from Western Union.
</P>
<P>
   He had found his calling and rose quickly to become head of the
nightside copy boys, supervising a crew of journalistic aspirants,
many of whom would stay in the business and many who would not.
</P>
<P>
   Over 40 years, Solovitz could often tell the difference,
developing a fine eye for character and talent. ``He was the best
judge of people,'' said Arthur Gelb, who started as a copy boy and
later became the paper's managing editor. He remembered what an odd
couple they were when they went out to Times Square to pick up the
first editions of competing papers. Gelb stood 6 foot 2, while
Solovitz, to his delight, was often taken for a jockey. On such
occasions, he was not above telling attractive women that he was
riding at Belmont the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who counted him as their first boss at The Times are
Russell T. Lewis, now president and chief executive officer of The
New York Times Co.; Joseph Lelyveld, executive editor of The Times;
Norman Pearlstine, who led The Wall Street Journal and who is now
the editor in chief of Time Inc.; and Vice President Al Gore, who
spent a summer as a copy boy.
</P>
<P>
   Solovitz would start work at 7:30 p.m. and finish at 3 a.m.,
when the last edition went to press, repeatedly goading his
dawdling charges: ``Tell your story walking!'' or ``This is a
daily, not a weekly!'' or ``Where do you think you are, the Yale
Club?''
</P>
<P>
   At times he would resort to obscure Yiddish curses he had picked
up at his mother's candy store in Brooklyn, where his formal
education involved nothing more than spotty attendance at P.S. 17.
There were Ivy League magna cum laudes who feared him as a
martinet, but there were many more of his copy boys who later gave
him a place of honor at their weddings and at parties celebrating
the birth of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Though he loved life's diversions, he was dedicated to his job
and energetically made sure that every bit of paper got where it
was supposed to go. When the electricity failed and the lights of
New York City went out on Nov. 9, 1965, Solovitz found a kerosene
lantern to help the staff put out its ``blackout edition.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 10, 1970, after the paper had closed for the night,
Solovitz, was lingering alone in the office when the bells on the
Teletype machines signaled a bulletin. Charles de Gaulle had died.
Realizing that the presses were still rolling, he raced across West
43rd Street to Gough's bar and led back a group of editors and copy
boys who were able to prepare a replate and get the news into some
copies of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Solovitz became the stuff of legend. A.J. Liebling, the
``Wayward Press'' critic for The New Yorker, called him ``a
newsroom institution.'' Sketches of him appeared in Editor &AMP;
Publisher and The Columbia Journalism Review. He lectured to
students at the Columbia School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   More informally, he would pass on the romance and lore of the
newspaper business to his charges, telling them what happened in
the newsroom on V-E Day or V-J Day, or the day that Franklin D.
Roosevelt died, or the nights that Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated. Sometimes, he would
do it over late-night poker games, or sometimes, he would tell his
story walking, heading to Sam Wo's restaurant at 3 o'clock in the
morning or taking copy boys _ there were not yet any copy girls _
eager for authenticity to race tracks or to second-floor tearooms
on Allen Street, where men with pinkie rings played cards until
after dawn.
</P>
<P>
   After enjoying Solovitz's wit and intelligence, one senior
editor once tried to talk him into continuing his education. ``Why,
school never did any thing for Meyer Berger,'' he replied, evoking
the Pulitzer Prize-winning star reporter and columnist of The Times
who never earned a high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   When technological change came to the newsroom in the 1980s,
Solovitz took it hard. He had loved the Linotypes, the delivery
trucks being loaded outside the building, even the spittoons that
one or two die-hard editors kept by their desks. When computers
replaced typewriters, copy boys, and by then, copy girls, were no
longer as vital to the operation as they had been. Smoking was
increasingly frowned upon, not to mention spittoons.
</P>
<P>
   It was harder to find people to go to the track or to Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Mrs. Polunsky, his niece, persuaded him to retire and
move to Houston. Mrs. Polunsky and a nephew, Lewis Solovitz,
survive him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy had an apartment nearby,'' Mrs. Polunsky said. ``He
missed New York, but he had a life here. He would go to New Orleans
and Las Vegas. He kept active. Right up until the end, he smoked,
he drank, he gambled and he told people exactly what he thought.''

JOHNSON IS SAN JOSE STATE'S MIRACLE WORKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former Arizona assistant Phil Johnson was hired in
March to rebuild San Jose State. Less than a month later, the
Spartans were leftovers in the Western Athletic Conference breakup.
</P>
<P>
   It was horrendous timing, since Johnson planned to use WAC
competition and television exposure to lure recruits. But San Jose
State was in such disarray _ one of the nation's worst programs,
especially from a power conference _ that the breakup was the least
of Johnson's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about 50 things ahead of that to worry about,''
Johnson said. ``I thought it was a monumental job when I took it,
and I still do. The biggest fight is changing the kids' attitude so
that when things go bad, they don't say to themselves, `Here we go
again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that and other problems, Johnson has delivered perhaps
the finest coaching performance on the West Coast this season _
turning San Jose State into a respectable, energized program. The
talent pool is comically shallow for a WAC team, but last week the
Spartans (9-7) defeated Fresno State and Texas-El Paso and took New
Mexico into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   With nine wins, they've already tripled last year's total.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was a head coach at Oklahoma's Seminole Junior College a
decade ago, and he later apprenticed under two of the best: Tim
Floyd (New Orleans, now the Chicago Bulls) and Lute Olson
(Arizona). He has taken morsels from each and added a personal
touch _ intensity _ to revitalize the Spartans, who are holding
opponents to 40 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing very solid basketball,'' Olson said. ``They're
defending well. That's the big thing. They're working hard and
taking good shots. I don't know that they have a lot of offensive
firepower.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans' leading scorer is L.A. native Ben Sanders (13
points per game), and their roster accurately reflects the
program's makeshift existence. Guard R.J. Powell, a Pepperdine
castoff, asked Johnson if he could walk on because his mother
attends San Jose State. Top reserve Terrance Richmond commutes
daily from Oakland, the equivalent of living in Anaheim and
attending UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   One of Johnson's problems is the recruiting budget, which was
nonexistent. Every dollar he needs, he must raise himself. And he's
probably the only coach in the nation who doesn't have free use of
his own gym. The Spartans rent the 5,000-seat, multi-purpose Events
Center from the student body. The doors are locked unless Johnson
books time in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two recruits in from Florida, and at the time I had no
idea that we just rented the place,'' Johnson said. ``I took them
over to show them the arena, and we couldn't get in. Needless to
say, we didn't get the recruits.''
</P>
<P>
   Help will arrive next season, thanks to an eight-man recruiting
class that will dramatically improve San Jose State's talent base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of the program is terrible, especially in
California,'' Johnson said. ``The perception is a little better
out-of-state than in-state.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's improving by the week.
</P>
<P>
   Next generation: Monday's Dream Classic, a high school bonanza
at Pauley Pavilion, may have lacked the high-profile college
recruiters of recent years, but it had plenty of top Southern
California prep talent. Here's a look at the five best prospects,
with comments from former USC coach and current Fox analyst George
Raveling:
</P>
<P>
   1. Tyson Chandler , the 7-foot sophomore from Compton Dominguez
High who many think will skip college and enter the NBA. ``He has
unlimited potential. He's so fluid. He runs the floor well, and he
doesn't have a lot of highs and lows emotionally. I question
(skipping college), because he'll have to improve each year in
quantum leaps to be ready for the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Casey Jacobsen , the Stanford-bound wing guard from Glendora
who scored 43 points Monday against Capistrano Valley. ``He's
tailor-made for the way Stanford plays. He understands how to use
screens and he's mentally tough. He has NBA range and excellent
size. He's definitely an impact freshman. He could help Stanford
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Travon Bryant , a junior forward from Long Beach Jordan.
``He's pregnant with possibilities. He has good size (6-7, 200
pounds) and his body looks like it would carry 230 or 240. He has
got to be a power forward at the high Division I level.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Andrew Zahn , a junior forward from Redondo Union. ``He's an
excellent rebounder, but he has a little tendency to get
frustrated. He's shown meaningful improvement year to year.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Tito Maddox , a senior guard from Compton who committed to
Arizona State in the fall but did not sign a letter-of-intent. ``He
doesn't need an offense to get his shot. He could be a go-to guy
wherever he goes. He can play either guard position, and he could
probably get away playing small forward, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddox has narrowed his choices to four schools (Connecticut,
Maryland, Michigan and UCLA) but hasn't received a qualifying SAT
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way UCLA plays, and I like Steve Lavin's
coaching,'' Maddox said. ``They're just starting to recruit me
hard. Everyone thinks Baron (Davis) is leaving (for the NBA).''
</P>
<P>
   Around the Pac-10: Washington's starting point guard, Dan
Dickau, is out for the season with a broken foot. Freshman Senque
Carey, who is more athletic but less consistent than Dickau, will
run the team. . . .
</P>
<P>
   You heard it here first: If he stays in school, Arizona freshman
Michael Wright will be the first player to lead the Pac-10 in
rebounding for four years. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The latest Ratings Percentage Index Report _ it approximates,
but does not duplicate, the NCAA Selection Committee's power
ratings _ has five Pac-10 teams in the top 30: Stanford (No. 2),
Arizona (14), UCLA (23), Oregon (26) and Washington (29). . . .
</P>
<P>
   Bad news for the Huskies, who opened the league season with
three losses: Only two teams in the 1990s have started 0-3 and made
the NCAA Tournament: USC ('91) and Washington State ('94). . . .
</P>
<P>
   And finally: Someone check coach Ernie Kent's blood pressure.
Three of Oregon's six conference games have gone into overtime; two
others (USC, UCLA) were decided by three points. &QL;

CLINTON TEAM GIVES FORCEFUL DEFENSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's legal team delivered a forceful
rebuttal of the impeachment charges against him Wednesday,
meticulously challenging the facts presented by House prosecutors
as little more than nitpicking over semantics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to take the charges seriously when in each case
they boil down to arguments over semantics,'' said White House
special counsel Greg Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Using videotaped testimony of the president and legal opinions
from top federal prosecutors to bolster his argument, Craig spent
nearly three hours trying to convince the Senate that Clinton never
intentionally lied about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
although he may have walked ``up to the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Labeling the House Republicans' descriptions of the president's
grand jury testimony as ``absolutely false,'' Craig said a reading
of Clinton's statements would show that he did not try to conceal
the affair but admitted to carrying on an ``inappropriate,
intimate, wrongful relationship with Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he made that admission, there was no doubt in anyone's
mind what he meant,'' Craig said, taking issue with the
prosecution's contention that Clinton misrepresented the scope of
his entanglement with the young woman that began when she was a
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   He said House prosecutors were intent on criminalizing what
amounted to ``utterly meaningless'' conflicts in testimony,
including the president's and Lewinsky's different recollections of
when their affair began.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors insist that Clinton was trying to hide the fact that
Lewinsky was still a White House intern by testifying that their
relationship started in 1996 when she was a full-time federal
employee. Lewinsky, on the other hand, testified that their sexual
contact began in 1995 before she was given a staff job at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most likely explanation here is that there is just a
disagreement. There is simply no way that a reasonable person can
look at this testimony and conclude or agree with the (prosecutors)
that it is a ... direct lie,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every element of the crime of perjury must be proven, and if
it's going to be used as a criminal standard here, it must be
proven beyond a reasonable doubt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you convict and remove President Clinton on the basis of
these allegations, no president of the United States will ever be
safe from impeachment again. And it will happen, and people will
look back at us and they will say, `We should have stopped it then,
before it was too late,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-line presentation by Craig came on the second day of
White House defense arguments in the Senate impeachment trial,
which grew out of charges that Clinton tried to hide his affair
with Lewinsky. If convicted on either of the House articles of
impeachment alleging perjury and obstruction of justice, Clinton
would become the first president to be removed from office by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The senators also heard from White House deputy counsel Cheryl
Mills, who spent nearly 90 minutes picking apart the Republican
allegation that Clinton obstructed justice with a ``scheme'' to
influence the testimony of witnesses in the now settled Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit and the investigation of the Lewinsky
matter by independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big picture is this: The president had a relationship with
a young woman. It was inappropriate, but not obstruction of
justice,'' Mills told the 100 senators, who are sitting as both
jurors and judges in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Mills also raised eyebrows among some senators by using her
presentation to charge the 13-member House Republican prosecution
team with misconduct in the trial. Mentioning some of them by name,
she said they had ``dramatically shortchanged the truth'' when they
accused Clinton of pressuring his secretary, Betty Currie, into
retrieving gifts he had given Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, citing Currie's own testimony, said the secretary was
never instructed to retrieve the gifts, but simply agreed to hold
them for Lewinsky because she was ``a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   In one lighter reference to the charges against her boss, the
White House lawyer drew smiles from both sides of the aisle when
she disputed a contention made by Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., one of the
House prosecutors, that the facts of the case against Clinton fit
together like ``a finely tuned ... Swiss watch.'' In her view,
Mills said, ``they might not even make a good sausage.''
</P>
<P>
   Her performance was later singled out by Democrats and
Republicans as the most impressive at the trial. ``She put it in
laymen's terms, terms that I could understand,'' said Sen. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah, who called Mills' defense presentation ``very
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Craig, Mills addressed the House allegations point by
point, putting a different spin on the facts and evidence presented
by the prosecution team as she sought to prove that there was no
legal basis for the charges against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``His conduct is not criminal. That's the rule of law in this
case. We ask only that the rule of law be applied equally, not
emotionally or politically,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive presentation by the two lawyers incensed House
prosecutors, who released statement after statement rebutting every
single point that Craig and Mills made.
</P>
<P>
   They called it ``a mirage'' defense, designed to mislead and
confuse senators about what really happened. They also labeled the
charge of prosecutorial misconduct from the Clinton team as ``an
insult to the House of Representatives,'' which approved the two
articles of impeachment last month on a vote that broke down mostly
along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers began their defense of the president on
Tuesday with an opening presentation by White House counsel Charles
Ruff, who described the Republican charges as a ``witches brew'' of
circumstantial evidence. They will wrap up their defense
presentation today with summations beginning at noon Houston time
from former Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., and Clinton's private
attorney David Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   Although the impeachment trial is now in its second week, the
prosecution's case has apparently had little impact on the public's
view of Clinton. Polls released Wednesday indicated that Clinton's
job approval rating had climbed to an all-time high of 76 percent
following his State of the Union address Tuesday night. Most of
those surveyed said they support his proposals on Social Security
and other issues and oppose any attempt to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's performance in his speech, the arguments presented by
his defense team and the polls were almost too much for one
prominent Republican. The Associated Press reported that Christian
broadcaster and former presidential candidate Pat Robertson told
viewers of his ``700 Club'' show Wednesday that Clinton had ``hit a
home run'' with his speech and had probably killed any chance of
his being ousted.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a public relations standpoint, he's won,'' said
Robertson, one of Clinton's biggest critics. ``They might as well
dismiss this impeachment hearing and get on with something else,
because it's over as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic supporters of the president said they are hopeful
that the defense presentation will help convince Republicans not to
allow House prosecutors to seek further testimony from Lewinsky and
other witnesses in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Mills and Craig arguments, Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., said members should be able to ``easily conclude that there
is sufficient evidence on the record'' to help them ``reach an
accurate and fair decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment rules require that a two-thirds majority of senators
vote for conviction in order for a president to be removed from
office.

LUCILLE KALLEN, WRITER FOR `SHOW OF SHOWS,' DIES AT 76 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif.)  By MARGALIT FOX  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucille Kallen, the lone woman in the raucous, celebrated and
astonishingly untidy group of television writers behind Sid
Caesar's ``Your Show of Shows,'' died on Monday at her home in
Ardsley, N.Y. She was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Lise Engel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Show of Shows,'' which starred Caesar and Imogene Coca,
was broadcast live for 90 minutes on Saturday nights from 1950 to
1954 and is revered as a classic of television's golden age. For
writers, a job on the program was a coveted plum; many of Ms.
Kallen's colleagues, including Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner and Neil
Simon, became show business luminaries in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   The quick-witted, fast-talking gang of writers was so famous
that it was memorialized repeatedly in popular culture, including
the 1982 film ``My Favorite Year'' (remade as a Broadway musical in
1992) and Simon's play ``Laughter on the 23rd Floor'' (1993).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kallen, one of a tiny handful of women employed as
television comedy writers in the 1950s, was curiously absent from
these works: They featured instead a generic female character who
was an amalgam of Ms. Kallen and Selma Diamond, a writer for
``Caesar's Hour,'' which succeeded ``Your Show of Shows.''
</P>
<P>
   The two women were also conflated in the character of Sally
Rogers, played by Rose Marie on ``The Dick Van Dyke Show.'' That
program, created by Reiner, starred Van Dyke as a television comedy
writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucille got lost a little bit,'' said Mel Tolkin, the head
writer on ``Your Show of Shows.'' ``She was generally the least
given credit because the other people are so loud and so famous.''
</P>
<P>
   But if her co-workers barreled into posterity as hit
playwrights, movie directors and 2,000-year-old men, Ms. Kallen
was, in Reiner's words, ``a real writer'' _ the profession's most
dignified accolade _ who possessed a finely honed ear for dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was quite a talented girl, and she was cute as a button,
too,'' Reiner, who also performed as Caesar's second banana on
``Your Show of Shows,'' said recently. ``And being the woman, she
did give it the woman's touch.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Kallen was the author of six novels, including
the C.B. Greenfield mystery series.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ms. Kallen unearthed in her attic a faded piece of
paper that neatly encapsulated her craft. The paper contained notes
for a sketch in which a wife (Ms. Coca) bemoaned the spark gone
from her marriage to Caesar:
</P>
<P>
   Wife: Where is the sense of adventure? Where is the fun? Where
is the romance?
</P>
<P>
   Husband: How do I know where you put things? I can't even find
my shirt!
</P>
<P>
   ``This was so typical of their exchanges that I could
practically write it in my sleep,'' Ms. Kallen observed in an oral
history videotaped last April for the Archive of American
Television in Hollywood.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lucille Kallen was born on May 28, 1922, in Los Angeles. At 3,
she moved with her mother to Toronto after her parents separated;
she was raised there by her grandparents after her mother's death
seven years later. As a girl, she trained to become a concert
pianist; as a teen-ager, she founded a theater troupe, for which
she wrote songs and sketches.
</P>
<P>
   At 16, Ms. Kallen moved to New York to study at the Juilliard
School, but in the years that followed she had two epiphanies that
pre-empted her classical-music career: One, her fingers were too
short. Two, she hated to practice.
</P>
<P>
   She turned instead to writing, putting together a nightclub
revue that included the young Martin Balsam. The act was spotted by
producer Max Liebman, who invited Ms. Kallen to hone her craft at
Camp Tamiment, a Poconos resort renowned for its Saturday night
shows. At Tamiment, she was teamed with Tolkin, who would become
her longtime writing partner. She also met her future husband,
Herbert Engel, who worked there as a soda jerk; they were married
in 1952. Engel, a businessman, survives her, as do her daughter, of
Manhattan; her son, Paul, of Oceanside, N.Y., and four
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of their Tamiment sketches, Ms. Kallen and
Tolkin were hired to write for a new television show produced by
Liebman, ``The Admiral Broadway Review,'' which paired Caesar and
Ms. Coca for the first time. Undeterred by the fact that she had
never even seen a television program, Ms. Kallen signed on, dashing
off sketches with Tolkin in a corner of the male dancers' dressing
room. The program, broadcast simultaneously on NBC and the Dumont
network from January to June of 1949, was the direct progenitor of
``Your Show of Shows,'' which made its debut on NBC the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Kallen recalled, she and her colleagues didn't simply
write ``Your Show of Shows,'' they lived it, working seven days a
week, 39 weeks a year at the program's offices in midtown
Manhattan, producing a series of now-classic sketches for live
broadcast, including movie parodies (``From Here to Obscurity''),
opera sendups (``Galipacci'') and the weekly travails of the
married couple Charles and Doris Hickenlooper.
</P>
<P>
   In their cramped domain, known as the Writers' Room, the air was
blue with cigar smoke and invective and the decor was early
fraternity house: dogeared sofa, discarded paper cups crunching
underfoot, half-eaten sandwiches abandoned beneath piles of
typescript, acoustical-tile ceiling stuck with pencils hurled there
in moments of frustration, and widening pools of spilled coffee.
``I learned,'' Ms. Kallen wrote afterward, ``to wear dark skirts.''
</P>
<P>
   As the men paced and the room erupted with jokes and argument,
Ms. Kallen was a small, ordered island in a roiling sea, sitting
calmly, her legs tucked under her, taking down the good stuff in
pencil on a yellow legal pad as it hurtled by, all the while
contributing her share. ``She was the only one who could write and
talk at the same time,'' Caesar recalled recently. ``The rest of us
were all crazy. It was all being made up at that moment: `Put it
in!' `Take it out!' `You've got to put it back!' So it was a very,
very frustrating job.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the writers were extremely large. All of them were
extremely loud. Ms. Kallen was 5 foot 1 and, when off duty, spoke
with measured thoughtfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was torn between preserving my femininity and preserving my
career,'' she later said. ``It was difficult to be forceful enough
to get through.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she resorted to standing on the sofa and waving a
red scarf to command attention. It worked _ briefly.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Your Show of Shows'' went off the air, Ms. Kallen turned
down a job with its successor, ``Caesar's Hour'' (1954-57), to
write for ``The Imogene Coca Show,'' which lasted only a single
season. With Tolkin, she wrote a short-lived Broadway play, ``Maybe
Tuesday'' (1958). In addition to writing five mysteries, she was
the author of the novel ``Outside There, Somewhere,'' (1964), a
comic, early feminist exploration of the competing demands of
career and motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on her Writers' Room days, Ms. Kallen was forthright
about the condescension as well as the camaraderie she encountered
there. ``At the time I felt it was one big happy family, but later
I said, What an idiot!'' she remarked. ``There was a male phalanx,
and then there was me. But when we were working, there was no
difference.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 21:
</P>
<P>
   The current economic expansion will soon enter its ninth year,
making it the longest peacetime expansion in American history. But
it is unusual in more ways than length, as Alan Greenspan, chairman
of the Federal Reserve, emphasized in congressional testimony
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan pointed to the unprecedented rise in stock prices.
That has made it far cheaper and easier for American industry to
raise capital, and it has contributed to a sense of well-being in
this country. It also has led to President Clinton's proposal to
have some Social Security money go into stocks, an idea Greenspan
opposed out of fear of political influence in investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As Greenspan pointed out, government statistics show that
Americans are saving far less than they were in 1992, when Clinton
was running for president and complaining about poor economic
performance, but are much richer as household net worth has risen
about 50 percent. That has stimulated consumption, which remained
strong even when economists were most alarmed about the threats
from Asia's recession.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan insisted that, when the Fed cut interest rates last
fall, ``we were not attempting to prop up equity prices,'' but he
knows that was one result, and he appears to be bothered by it. He
warned that prices had risen further than profit growth would seem
to justify. He voiced concern about the impact a falling stock
market could have on consumer behavior and on the economy, and
warned that protectionist trade measures could severely damage
investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, along with most economists, expects the American
economy to slow this year, but he conceded that there is as yet
little evidence that is happening. Most sectors are booming. The
country's huge trade deficit has so far had little impact because
foreigners have been willing to finance it. In a time of
international financial turmoil, American investments have seemed
attractive to many, even with interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   There are sectors of the economy that are suffering _ largely
the parts most sensitive to international weakness. Food prices are
down substantially, hurting farmers. Producers of industrial
materials such as steel are suffering from the reduced demand
abroad, and many other manufacturers have seen orders and profits
decline. But together, notes Robert Barbera, the chief economist of
Hoenig &AMP; Co., those sectors employ about 20 percent of the work
force. The rest are doing well.
</P>
<P>
   This economic recovery began slowly in 1991, and now is going
very strongly. That is the reverse of the normal process, and has
surprised economists. But that very lack of predictability should
make politicians hesitate as they decide what to do with the budget
surpluses that have resulted. Assuming that the good times will
continue indefinitely may be tempting, but it would also be
foolish.

TEXAS TRIES TO DEAL WITH DEPLETED BASKETBALL ROSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was love at first sight _ Chris McColpin and the Erwin
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the 10th grade when my dad and I went to the state
basketball tournament,'' McColpin recalled. ``I saw those kids out
there on the floor and I knew I wanted to play out there one day
myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we never got to the state tournament in high school, I
knew the only way I'd ever get to do that was to play for the
University of Texas. And it didn't look like that was ever going to
happen _ not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny how things transpire.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the former all-district player at Carrollton Turner High
School who was never offered an NCAA Division I scholarship, is
averaging 10 minutes a game as a sophomore walk-on point guard for
the University of Texas _ one of the key role players on Rick
Barnes' seemingly ever-shrinking roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad to have him,'' Barnes said. ``Chris is a true point
guard who thinks like a coach on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Barnes is glad to have just about anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The midweek, one-game suspension of junior forward Gabe Muoneke
for unsportsmanlike conduct in Monday's loss at Kansas, coupled
with the loss of backup inside player Marlon Drakes to a broken
foot leaves the Longhorns (9-9, 5-1 Big 12) with McColpin and six
scholarship players to face No. 23 Oklahoma State (12-4, 4-1) on
Saturday (8:30 p.m.) at the Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows it's going to be tough for us and we're all
going to have to dig down deep and get this done,'' forward Kris
Clack said. ``We may lose if we don't step it up. It's just
something we have to get through.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke's absence will impact Barnes' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that Chico \RVazquez\S will have to play inside and
now Kris Clack becomes our fourth post player,'' Barnes said.
``We'll just deal with it. That's all we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in essence, has been Barnes' outlook all season. No
excuses, no whining. Cut and paste. Mix and match. Most nights, it
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I have a great appreciation for the way \RBarnes\S
is coaching this team,'' said Vazquez, a utility player who at
times this season has worn the shoes of every position. ``He's
overcome a lot with this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the coaching staff has done is see to it that every day,
every practice, every second, you play your role and nothing else.
Coach Barnes tells you where your shots are coming from, who's
going to get the shots and what to look for if the other team does
this or that. And when you get outside of your role, it shows. That
philosophy has helped us out a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes will use 6-foot-9 senior Wendell Carter in Muoneke's
power-forward slot against the Cowboys. That leaves McColpin and
William Clay in their usual roles as respective backups at the
point and shooting guard, where Vazquez starts. Carter can play
both inside spots and either Vazquez or Clack can play power
forward. Barnes also can use Vazquez as a pseudo-center offensively
and use him to draw an opposition post player to the perimeter to
guard him.
</P>
<P>
   But a turned ankle here, early foul trouble there and things
quickly get more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   If Barnes' first season at Texas is sometimes frustrating
because of the lack of numbers, he said it is at the least
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the more unpredictable years I've had in
coaching,'' he said. ``We can talk about different scenarios _ if
this guy gets hurt or this guy gets two fouls in the first minute _
but one thing I found out about the job a long time ago is it's not
scientific. The way you have to do it is take what you've got, play
the way you have to and don't make excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter has been one of Barnes' pleasant surprises. He logged
only insignificant minutes last season, but has become a
contributor under Barnes. He is, however, under no illusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a garbage man,'' Carter said. ``I go for loose balls,
rebounds, blocks, steals _ whatever it takes, you know? I have a
nice little jump hook when we need it, but my strengths are
rebounding and running the floor and my quickness. I just try to do
as much as I can to help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   All Barnes asks is all you've got.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach has this four-minute game he talks to us about,'' Carter
said. ``You go as hard as you can for four minutes and he'll take
you out and see you get your rest, get refreshed and go out and do
it again. It's working pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   All parts considered.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 21:
</P>
<P>
   In two days of vigorous rebuttal before the Senate, the White
House defense team put some significant dents in the House
prosecutors' case for removing President Clinton. Though Gregory
Craig and Cheryl Mills could not disentangle Clinton Wednesday from
his misconduct and false statements, they did raise technical and
substantive doubts about the perjury and obstruction accusations
leveled by the House. They argued that the House prosecutors had
brought in extraneous charges that went beyond the articles of
impeachment and the independent counsel's charges. Craig pounded at
the central issue of the case _ that Clinton's actions, while
reckless and reprehensible, do not meet the constitutional test for
canceling the verdict of the voters who elected him.
</P>
<P>
   Even before former Sen. Dale Bumpers begins his summation, the
Senate arithmetic seems clear. The 67 votes needed to convict and
remove Clinton from the White House are not in sight. Hearing
witnesses will not make the evidence appreciably stronger, and it
will extend the trial for weeks and throw the Senate into partisan
strife. Therefore Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, should be
looking for an endgame.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the State of the Union address should underscore
the point for him, even if Clinton's polls drift down a bit from
their current spike. Clinton reads the American mainstream better
than anyone now on the public stage, and knows how to assemble a
domestic program that trumps much of the Republican agenda.
Removing a popular president is unworkable in the absence of a
compelling constitutional case. Lott and many Republicans in the
Senate know that. Sealing their image as the party of impeachment
could cost Republicans heavily in the 2000 presidential and
congressional elections, risking their control of the House and
possibly even the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   So if Lott is to complete the wise and skillful leadership work
he began last week, he must find a way out among moderate
Republicans and Democrats, even if Republican hotspurs object. It
could come next week in a simple majority vote to dismiss the case
or to suspend the trial. It could be defeat of a motion to summon
witnesses. The end might even be a definitive vote on the two
articles of impeachment. The Senate can then move immediately to
censure Clinton, the sanction he deserves and the country supports.

GREENSPAN BLASTS PLAN BY CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Wednesday assailed President Clinton's plan to funnel a portion of
the nation's Social Security fund into the stock market, arguing
such investments could be held hostage to politics.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's central banker also raised fresh concerns about the
gravity-defying stock prices, warning investors not to expect the
Fed to bail out the market.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan told members of the House Ways and Means Committee
that he cannot support the Clinton administration's plan to invest
up to $700 billion from Social Security reserves over the next 15
years in stocks and bonds as a way to boost returns for taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is part of a broader strategy outlined by the
president in his State of the Union address to use an estimated
$2.7 trillion worth of budget surpluses to bolster the Social
Security system in time to handle an aging baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he fears political priorities might dictate
investment decisions, and he worries that a future administration,
caught in a financial crunch, might try to divert the money for
other uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe it is politically feasible to insulate such
huge funds from governmental direction,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of state and local pension funds already invest in the
stock markets, and Greenspan noted that their rates of return
typically are two to three percentage points lower than private
pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are also studies which suggest that the greater the
proportion of trustees who are political appointees on those
pension funds, the lower the rate of return,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic committee member Bob Matsui of California pointed
out that while state and local pension funds may have lower rates
of return than the private sector, they still outperform the
current Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Wednesday that they share Greenspan's
concerns about political influence on the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan calls for the creation of an
independent board that would contract with private pension managers
to handle the investments, similar to the way the federal
government's 401(k)-style retirement plan is now handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aiming to put this in the hands of private-sector
managers who are free from political interference,'' said Jake
Siewert, a spokesman for the White House's National Economic
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's opposition is a tremendous political blow for the
proposal. Lawmakers, who largely credit Greenspan for the longest
economic expansion in peacetime history, speak of Greenspan in
almost reverential tones, although they don't always follow his
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw cold water on the president's Social Security idea,''
said Bob Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities in New York.
``He made it very, very clear having the government invest in the
stock market is a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, contends that the Clinton proposal is fraught with
potential abuse, from political favoritism to government attempts
to dictate policy in companies in which it invests. Instead,
Republicans favor proposals that would allow taxpayers to invest
some of their Social Security funds themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ferrara, a policy analyst for the libertarian-leaning Cato
Institute, said the proposal would grant ``broad new powers over
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan did applaud the administration's efforts to try to
deal with the Social Security problem, which according to
administration projections is slated to run out of cash in 2032.
``We cannot go on the way we are,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's opposition to Clinton's Social Security plan was in
keeping with the Fed chairman's general wariness of the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Greenspan spooked the markets when he referred to
investors' ``irrational exuberance.'' At that time, the Dow Jones
industrial average was below 6,500. On Wednesday, the Dow closed at
9,335.91, down 19.31 points.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan refrained from employing such colorful verbiage
Wednesday, but he did suggest current stock values may be out of
sync with actual corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of equity prices would appear to envision
substantially greater growth of profits than has been experienced
of late,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also warned investors that the Federal Reserve's moves
to lower interest rates last year were not done in an effort to
bail out the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not attempting to prop up equity prices, nor did we
plan to continue to ease rates until equity prices recovered, as
some have erroneously inferred,'' Greenspan said. ``This has not
been, and is not now, our policy or intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Brusca said Greenspan had been ``getting criticized in Europe
for having cut interest rates to help goose the stock market. I
think he just wanted to make it really clear ... the Fed was really
aiming at something else,'' to help cushion the blow of the world
economic crisis on the U.S. economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 21:
</P>
<P>
   No investment in American national security has paid higher
dividends than the $2 billion Washington has spent over the last
eight years to help Russia and other former Soviet republics
dismantle nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. President
Clinton was right, in his State of the Union address Tuesday night,
to call for significantly increased spending on such programs.
Congress, including members who oppose other foreign aid to Russia,
should approve this White House request in full.
</P>
<P>
   There is no longer any threat of Russia's deliberately attacking
the United States. But Moscow's still-formidable stocks of nuclear
bombs, nuclear ingredients and biological and chemical warfare
agents pose a different kind of danger. Much of this material is
inadequately secured, and the workers guarding it are paid poorly
or not at all. That creates an unacceptably high risk that some
material could be sold to potential aggressors like Iraq, Libya,
North Korea or Serbia. Many Russian weapons scientists are also
unemployed or unpaid and vulnerable to foreign recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the $4.5 billion the administration is requesting for
the next five years would be used to speed the safe disposal of
bomb plutonium and chemical and biological weapons stocks, and
further improve security at storage sites. Washington would add new
defenses against smuggling by helping Russia to establish better
border controls and export monitoring. There would also be an
expansion of efforts to re-employ scientists in civilian work.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, the United States spent trillions of
dollars to deter Russia from using its nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons. It would not take much more than $10 billion to
eliminate most of the risks from those weapons today. &QL;

DELRAY BROOKS BUILDING BASE AT ISOLATED UT-PAN AM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURG, Texas _ Welcome to college basketball's loneliest,
most-secluded outpost. This is the sport's Fort Apache, its Foreign
Legion, its Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   This is the home of UT-Pan American, one of 310 Division I
basketball programs chasing that dream of NCAA Tournament
participation and glory. Know this: The Broncs have never
participated in the NCAA Tournament and, at 3-15, that's not going
to change this season.
</P>
<P>
   Where does UT-Pan American rate on the Hoops Scale? ``The worst
job in college basketball. I don't think there's another coach in
the country who would disagree with me.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Delray Brooks, 33, the Broncs' second-year coach who
has a glittering pedigree. Brooks is a former Mr. Basketball from
Indiana who played two years for the Hoosiers, transferred to
Providence and played in the 1987 Final Four. As an assistant with
Rick Pitino at Kentucky, he was a part of three Final Four teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, pointing to the picture of the 1996 national
championship Kentucky team hanging on the wall in his office, ``is
about as far away from here as you could get.''
</P>
<P>
   UT-Pan American isn't Kentucky or North Carolina, but it has a
fair amount of basketball tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the Broncs, led by future Olympian and NBA player Luke
Jackson, won the NAIA national championship. The next year, they
finished second. Abe Lemons and Lon Krueger coached here before
moving on to Texas and Kansas State, respectively. Marshall Rodgers
in 1976 and Greg Guy in 1993 led the nation in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a serious resurrection under way,'' said
federal judge Richard Jinjosa, who has been a fan for 20 years.
``This program has had some great coaches and teams, but because of
Brooks, for the first time in a long time, this program has a
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent history has been bleak. There have been two stays in
the NCAA's jailhouse (one year of probation in 1990, three years
starting in 1992). Other than a 16-12 record in 1993-94, the Broncs
have struggled. Since the 1990-91 season, UT-Pan Am is 57-161 _ a
winning percentage of .261.
</P>
<P>
   After seven seasons as a member of the Sun Belt Conference, the
Broncs were asked to leave after last season, making UT-Pan Am one
of three Division I independents. Independents have little chance
of making the NCAA Tournament _ the last to do so was DePaul in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the budget to salaries to scheduling to not being in a
conference, that's why this job was so bad,'' Brooks said. ``A lot
of the things to run a program, they're just not here. We're
struggling to put those in place. It's not an impossible task, but
it makes it more challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' program operates on a shoestring. The basketball budget
is approximately $450,000 (Texas first-year coach Rick Barnes earns
approximately $700,000 a season). Brooks earned $35,000 more as a
Kentucky assistant than he did in his first season at UT-Pan Am.
</P>
<P>
   This season, with no conference games, Brooks played a ``money''
schedule. Trips to Providence, New Mexico, Pittsburgh and DePaul
brought in $350,000 in game guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   UT-Pan Am has only nine home games scheduled. That sort of
scheduling contributes to an impending NCAA record. The Broncs have
lost 54 consecutive road games; the NCAA record is 55. Their next
game is Saturday at Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   As an assistant at Kentucky, Brooks worked with Tubby Smith,
Ralph Willard, Herb Sendek and Billy Donovan, his Providence
teammate. After making coaching debuts at other schools, all have
moved on to bigger jobs: Smith is the coach at Kentucky; Willard is
at Pittsburgh; Sendek is at North Carolina State; and Donovan is at
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Pitino would tell me the jobs I was applying for weren't
bad enough,'' said Brooks, who was 3-24 last season in his debut.
``The reason I'm here is that I wanted to be a head coach. Why
here? I wanted to be a coach and this is the school that hired
me.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the University of Texas system, Pan American knows
that NCAA indiscretions and embarrassing won-loss records will not
be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some big steps we need to take, but we're taking
them,'' said UT-Pan Am athletic director Bill Weidner, who was an
assistant athletic director at SMU for seven years. ``We think
we've got a state-of-the-art compliance program. We're committed to
being successful without taking shortcuts. We've done a lot of work
trying to rebuild trust in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Broncs' record is 3-15, there is improvement.
Last season, the Broncs allowed 100 points six times and lost 12
games by 20 or more points. This season, UT-Pan Am has allowed 100
points three times and has lost by 20 or more once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never heard of UT-Pan American, but I came here because
of coach Brooks,'' said guard Brian Meriweather, who leads the
nation in scoring at 25.9 points per game. ``We have the talent and
the coaching to get it done here. We can compete and be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks plans to bring in some junior-college transfers next
season to bolster this year's recruiting class, which was ranked in
the top 50 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I was crazy to take this job and they think I'm
crazy when I say we can be successful,'' Brooks said. ``With the
parity in college basketball, we can compete. We're going to bring
in some players next season who are going to be bigger, faster,
stronger. They'll make us better and we're going to start making
some serious noise.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Every small-town kid knows, or used to know, how a town can
change when the carnival sets up its rides and its plush-toy,
deep-fried midway at the fairgrounds. What's so exciting isn't just
the chance to get dizzy on the Tilt-a-Whirl or to spend money in a
way you'll soon regret. It's the presence in your midst of a closed
society of strangers conforming to a way of life _ no matter how
ordinary it may be at heart _ that makes your own look dull.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, the carnival will leave, but until it does your
town looks larger and smaller all at once. Larger for the noise and
the cotton candy and the unfamiliar glow among the trees at night,
but smaller because the carnival will drive off into the enormous
world it came from while you lie asleep in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City isn't a small town and the International Olympic
Committee isn't a carnival, but you can see the parallels. The IOC
is a closed society with its own opaque way of doing business _ a
family, its president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, calls it, though he
has also said, ``We function as a state.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake was eager to capture the 2002 Winter Olympics _ any
city would be _ and it was also eager to prove something about
itself by doing so, to ease the suspicion, which the Olympic
possibility only heightened, that it was not quite front and center
on the world stage. So Salt Lake played along with the practices
the IOC brought to town.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has its own problems. Some are outlined in a draft
report by Richard Pound, the member appointed to investigate the
present mess, and many more will emerge. But what is interesting is
the psychology of Salt Lake itself. Salt Lake is already a global
city. It has enjoyed the kind of high-tech-industrial explosion
that has transformed other cities in the West. The Mormon Church is
as cosmopolitan, if not as urbane, an institution as the IOC
itself, and vastly more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like every city in this country at one time or another,
Salt Lake's boosters have clamored for something they feel it
lacks, something that the money and the crowds the Olympics will
bring can only partially satisfy. That something is attention _ the
satisfaction of seeing your town enlarged, redefined, because it
has been broadcast to the world.
</P>
<P>
   What this suggests, I think, is a rather different meaning for
Marshall McLuhan's old metaphor of the global village. In its
original sense, the phrase forecast the way the new electronic
media would bind the world into a single place. The point was not
only the coherence of this new world but also the absence of a
center. But as we've begun to discover, wherever the media focus
their powerful glare is the center, and everywhere else is the
provinces. The global village is now a place of unalleviated
provincialism, except when the media _ a carnival of their own kind
_ come to town on an Olympic scale.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Salt Lake clamored for the Olympics, though so far the
city has only garnered an attention its boosters could never have
wanted.

UCONN-DUKE COLLISION COURSE IFFY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Midway through the season, the game we'd like to see is the game
we likely won't see until the Final Four: No. 1 Connecticut vs. No.
2 Duke. Both teams have played difficult nonconference schedules,
but they aren't scheduled to play each other this season.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Connecticut and Duke have distanced themselves as the
nation's top two teams. Assuming each is a top seed in its
respective regions (Connecticut in the East, Duke in the South),
this year's bracket wouldn't have those two regional champions
meeting until the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   While each team has the ability to win the national title, the
odds of both reaching the Final Four, much less meeting in the
title game, are slim. The NCAA Tournament doesn't work that way.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's only loss came to Cincinnati. The Blue Devils were 17-1
going into last night's game with Clemson. The Huskies were 15-0
going into last night's game with Miami (Fla.)
</P>
<P>
   Both teams could stumble along the way. Connecticut plays at
Stanford on Feb. 6. Duke has two games remaining with North
Carolina, one with Maryland and a nonconference matchup with St.
John's.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Connecticut and Duke occupy the top two spots in the
poll and continue their dominating play, the debate will continue:
Who's better?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who's better,'' said forward Harold Swanagan,
whose Notre Dame team has lost to both. ``They're pretty close. The
big-man edge would probably go to Duke with Elton Brand in the
middle. But UConn's guards are certainly some of the best in the
nation. You've got to give them credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech coach Bobby Cremins sounds as though he's ready to
concede the national championship to the Blue Devils and coach Mike
Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to take an injury or someone playing a
perfect game,'' Cremins said of a team beating Duke. ``I can't get
over what Mike has done. Mike has gone off the charts this year. I
thought last year he had a great team. This year, he's gone off the
chart.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams have three common opponents. Connecticut beat
Fairfield, 102-67; Michigan State, 82-68; and Notre Dame, 101-70.
Duke beat Fairfield, 98-66; Michigan State, 73-67; and Notre Dame,
111-82.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's NCAA statistics, Duke is No. 1 in scoring,
Connecticut is No. 7. In scoring margin, Duke is No. 1, Connecticut
No. 2.  &LR; tagtop:Wendell Barnhouse, (817) 390-7238

FREE THROWS Stanford's standard Injuries have reduced Stanford's
superior depth. And losses to North Carolina and Maryland knocked
the Cardinal off the radar screen of this season's dominating
teams.
</P>
<P>
   But since the Maryland loss on Dec. 6, Stanford (15-2) has won
11 consecutive games and again is displaying the form that put them
in the Final Four last March.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Stanford swept UCLA and Southern California in Los
Angeles. That's the second consecutive year the team has done that.
Before last season, the last time Stanford had won both games in LA
had been 1941-42.
</P>
<P>
   And Pacific-10 Conference coaches are talking about the
Cardinal's becoming the first team to go through the league 18-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just trying to put pressure on us to see if we can't
handle it,'' Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said. ``We have no
designs on 18-0, it's not what we're thinking about.'' Mass appeal
Massashusetts was 6-8 going into Saturday's game with Kansas. The
Minutemen had been a preseason Top 25 team, but their season had
been defined by inconsistency and indifferent effort.
</P>
<P>
   So, with chances of postseason play slipping away, Massachusetts
upset the Jayhawks, 64-60. It was the school's first victory
against Kansas in four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, it's not like our season is over,'' Massachusetts
coach Bruiser Flint told his team before the game. ``We can turn
this thing around. People have thrown dirt on us before.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint said that after Kansas' Jeff Boschee hit two 3-pointers to
tie the game, he was afraid his team would fold because that's how
it had played previously. But guard Charlton Clarke sealed the
victory with two free throws with eight seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I wanted to be,'' Clarke said. ``I wanted to be
there at the end, to seal the game. These are the type of games we
live for. What we've got to try to do now is apply the same
intensity to the rest of the games we have to play this year.''
Quotebook Northwestern coach Kevin O'Neill on his team's defense:
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams we play usually say, `We just didn't shoot well.' After
a while you might decide we do something right. We watch a lot of
videotape. We guard the guys who can shoot, and we don't guard the
guys who can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's C.J. Black after the Volunteers' 47-46 victory at
Kentucky, the first win for Tennessee in Lexington since 1979:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play in front of 25,000 people and can make them all
hush, that's the greatest feeling you can have.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Earl Watson after Stanford defeated the Bruins, 72-59, in
a game featuring 49 Stanford free throws:
</P>
<P>
   ``They kicked our butts up and down the court. They came out and
exposed us tonight. There's nothing more to say. They killed us.
Exposed us. Beat us. Whatever you want to say.''
THE BUZZ Briefly All three of Florida's losses have come in road
games against ranked teams _ Duke, Kentucky and Auburn. The average
margin for defeat in those three games has been 28 points.
</P>
<P>
   When No. 10 North Carolina plays Virginia tonight, it will be
the Tar Heels' 300th consecutive game ranked in The Associated
Press Top 25. That's not the longest streak in the Atlantic Coast
Conference. From 1973 to 1983, North Carolina was ranked in 319
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   When the Wooden Award is presented April 2 in Los Angeles, there
will be an inaugural ``Legends of Coaching'' lifetime achievement
award presented. Former North Carolina coach Dean Smith will be the
first recipient. That handshake between Smith and John Wooden will
be a special photo opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Jaeson Maravich, son of late Louisiana State star Pete Maravich,
is a walk-on at Alabama. When the Crimson Tide played at the Pete
Maravich Assembly Center in Baton Rouge, La., last week, Jaeson
received a standing ovation when he was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Entering last night's game against Wofford, freshman Adam
Harrington was averaging 13.7 points per game to lead North
Carolina State. The school has never had a freshman lead the team
in scoring.
Midseason numbers The NCAA released its Division I men's basketball
midseason trends yesterday. Compared to last year's midseason
numbers, scoring is down nearly a point a game and shooting
accuracy has declined. However, no trend is apparent because
scoring was up for the 1997-98 season compared to scoring for the
1996-97 season. A look at this year's midseason statistical trends
(statistics are per-game, per-team averages): Category 1999 1998
Field goals made 25.0 25.4 FG attempts 57.3 57.9 FG pct. 43.7 43.9
3-point FG made 5.9 5.9 3-point FG attempts 17.2 17.3 3-point FG
pct. 34.2 34.3 Free throws made 14.5 14.7 Free throws attempts 21.7
22.0 Free throw pct. 67.1 66.7 Points 70.5 71.4

PAT ROBERTSON SUGGESTS CLINTON TRIAL BE HALTED 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Utah)  (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-TRIAL, EDIT-IMPEACH, IMPEACH-BUSH,
IMPEACH-SCENE) 
 (bl) 
By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pat Robertson, the conservative television
evangelist who has been an important leader in pressing for the
impeachment and ouster of President Clinton, said Wednesday that
the president had ``hit a home run'' in his State of the Union
address and that the impeachment trial might as well be halted.
</P>
<P>
   While Robertson's remarks were the most dramatic, he was only
one of many prominent Republicans around the country who said
Clinton's speech Tuesday was an unsettling reminder that their
party cannot compete with the president's political skills _ and
that the impeachment trial can only endanger their prospects in
competitive states.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a public-relations standpoint, he's won,'' Robertson said
on his television program, ``The 700 Club.'' ``They might as well
dismiss this impeachment hearing and get on with something else,
because it's over as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments by Robertson, who is the founder and chairman of
the Christian Coalition and was a candidate for president in 1988,
marked a stunning reversal because he had for months urged the
ouster of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's remarks carry great weight because he is one of the
most popular and influential Christian conservatives; many leading
Republicans, including presidential candidates, take their cues
from him.
</P>
<P>
   And his comments could also provide cover for Republicans who
have felt pressure to move forward for impeachment so as not to
alienate their conservative supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson's remarks brought a stern reaction from one of the
House prosecutors in the impeachment trial. ``It's discouraging,
because he's missing the point,'' said Rep. Christopher Cannon,
R-Utah. ``This is not a PR war _ this is a matter of law.''
</P>
<P>
   And Robertson sought Wednesday night to back down from his
remarks. Speaking through a spokesman, he said: ``I was speaking in
my capacity as a political analyst. I was not advocating this, nor
do I favor this. But it was my view that this is how things are
likely to play out.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's comments were a striking contrast to what he said at
the Christian Coalition's annual meeting last September, when
congressional Republican leaders were hesitant to attack Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson thundered that the president should not resign, but
should be impeached so he could be punished.

TEXAS SOCIAL PROMOTION BILL HAS ESCAPE HATCH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush is scheduled to unveil
legislation Monday aimed at ending social promotion _ one of his
key campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sets a standard,'' said Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, and
one of the chief architects of the bill. ``It says we should not be
promoting students from one grade level to the next if they clearly
demonstrate they're not able to do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   But contrary to the governor's adamant pronouncement last year
that there would be no way a student could advance to a higher
grade without passing the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, the
bill as Bivins outlines it would establish an appeals process that
gives discretion to schools to promote students who repeatedly fail
the test. The bill also contains measures designed to prevent abuse
of the appellate process.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing here is setting the bright line, setting the
standard but then allowing an appeals process, in the event of
extenuating circumstances, that is driven by local
decision-makers,'' Bivins said. ``I don't see this as a major
departure from this goal of ending social promotion. I think it's
more of what's practical, what's going to work out there in the
real world.''
</P>
<P>
   If the bill is approved, though, Bivins and Bush spokeswoman
Karen Hughes said Houston school officials, who have tough new
promotion standards for grades 1 through 8 ready to take effect at
the end of this school year, would have to alter their policies for
third, fifth and eighth grades.
</P>
<P>
   That's because in addition to TAAS scores, the Houston
Independent School District will factor in course grades and
performance on the Stanford Achievement in deciding whether to hold
back students.
</P>
<P>
   HISD would be allowed to implement its promotion policies in
other grades, but not in the three covered by state law, Bivins and
Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only say that our board and superintendent have taken a
strong stand that we want to have multiple criteria and not use
TAAS as the sole determining factor,'' said HISD spokesman Terry
Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leadership will be discussing that with legislators,''
Abbott said, adding that HISD would favor a law that would allow it
and other districts that have already implemented strong promotion
policies to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins, who also chairs the Senate Education Committee, said Lt.
Gov. Rick Perry has designated the legislative proposal as Senate
Bill 1, a symbolic acknowledgment of its importance. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Under the proposal, students in three grades would face
retention based on failing test scores, Bivins said. Third-graders
would have to pass the TAAS reading test to move ahead to the
fourth grade, fifth-graders would be required to pass reading and
math, and eighth-graders would face exams in reading, writing and
math.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said his bill also would require TAAS tests to be
administered three times in those grade levels, first in early
spring. Students who fail the test would be required to attend
intensive remedial instruction classes either during regular school
hours or in extended-day programs, he added.
</P>
<P>
   TAAS tests would be administered a second time near the end of
the school year, and those who failed again would face mandatory
summer school. The state would pick up the tab for remedial
instruction, Bivins added.
</P>
<P>
   TAAS tests would be administered a third time, at the end of
summer school. If they didn't pass then, students could still
appeal decisions to hold them back.
</P>
<P>
   Local school campuses would establish appeal committees
consisting of the retained students' parents, teacher and principal
to determine whether there were extenuating circumstances that
warranted moving the child ahead despite three TAAS failures,
Bivins said.
</P>
<P>
   He said said he decided an appeals process was necessary after
talking with Waco school officials about the appeals process they
established as part of the aggressive promotion policy they
implemented last school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was influenced by the reality that there were going to be a
host of horrible hypotheticals out there,'' Bivins said. ``What's
the best way to deal with what will certainly arise (with)
extenuating circumstances?''
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said the bill would not specify the extenuating
circumstances a school could weigh when deciding whether to promote
a student. He added, though, that committees might advance a child
whose test scores improve with each test administration or one who
just moved to Texas from another state.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the appeals process will leave Bush with little more
than the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Although social promotion is illegal under current law, many
education officials now acknowledge that it has been going on for
years. A 1996 survey by the Texas Federation of Teachers determined
that 150,000 students each year are promoted without passing their
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins, however, said his bill would create a safeguard to
prevent blanket promotions of failing students by making the
appeals process part of the school accountability system. Schools
would be required to report the number of students they advance
based on the appeals committee decisions. The Texas Education
Agency would then factor those numbers into its campus and district
ratings, he added. Schools that promote too many students despite
failing TAAS scores could face lower ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It's that appeals process that is the clearest departure from
what Bush outlined during his re-election campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his plan to end the practice of social promotion,
Bush said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The message to our schools is this: Do what it takes to teach
our children to read. The voices of the status quo will say too
much is riding on one test. And I say stop the excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no flexibility. Beginning in the year 2003, we are
shutting down social promotion, and we have given school districts
ample warning.''

NORTHRIDGE BASEBALL HAS 19 NEW FACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a regular occurrence around the Cal State
Northridge baseball team. The season begins in January _ Friday at
home against San Francisco, to be exact _ yet coach Mike Batesole
won't have a starting eight set for about 25 games, which means
March 11 against Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Batesole is going to need the time because the Matadors have 19
new players in the program, including six freshmen. This follows
last year's surprise 37-19 finish in which the team won 25 of its
last 27 games with mostly junior college and Division I transfers.
That came about because the program had been cut then reinstated
and few saw it through. Batesole was named Collegiate Baseball
magazine's national coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Since CSUN is playing as an independent again, it will require
an at-large berth into the NCAA playoffs. Last year, 37 wins
against what many thought to be a weak schedule wasn't enough. This
year, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Batesole said it depends on what other teams do as well as
against who and where the Matadors win. Road victories help, and
CSUN will have plenty of chances late in the season to do that,
with 23 of its last 33 games away from Matador Field. The team
begins with 15 of 20 at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors have been practicing since September, so they
welcome the chance to play other teams, even if starting positions
remain undecided.
</P>
<P>
   With so many new players, Batesole is aware losing could become
more frequent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for a quick fix,'' he said. ``If we have to
get kicked in the teeth, so be it. To get to the highest quality,
like in '96 (a 52-18 record to win a Western Athletic Conference
title and an NCAA regional appearance), it means we'll be taking
our lumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen players have earned opportunities to win spots. Some won
chances based on their fall performances. Others got help from
outfielder Jason Watkins' separated finger. Watkins was to be the
center fielder and leadoff batter, but since he's out six weeks,
Batesole is shuffling.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Phillips moves from left field to center field, leaving
four players battling for the spot. Tom Morefield, a Chatsworth
graduate, and Mike Bumstead will try to win the right-field spot.
</P>
<P>
   Around the infield, things are a little more set. Adrian Mendoza
is the first baseman, and freshman J.T. Stotts, from Hart, has won
the shortstop position for now. Senior Kevin Patrick moves from
third base to his natural second base, and Eric Horvat, a Hart
graduate who was the only freshman last year to stay with
Northridge, moves from the outfield to his natural third-base spot.
</P>
<P>
   Junior catcher Jeremy Sickles, along with Mendoza, started the
last 21 games of his freshman year and all of his sophomore season,
so Batesole said there's no reason he won't start.
</P>
<P>
   Three pitchers return. Senior Jose Vasquez won 10 games last
year. Relievers Tim Bell and Jim DeBiase move into starting roles.
Bell is scheduled to start Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The relievers will be a pair of freshmen, Mike Frick and Andy
Davidson from Hart, as well as sophomore Tom Manos from Royal and
senior Andrew Sanchez, a transfer from New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   But who will do what? Like with the rest of the team, Batesole
said, it will take time.

AMERICA WEST WORKERS CHEER POSSIBLE BUYOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN CRENO 
 LISA GONDERINGER 
 and REBECCA ROLWING 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ America West Airlines employees, some still stinging
from tense union negotiations, cheered a possible United Airlines
buyout that they said would bring them higher pay.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if United keeps them on the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Some America West pilots said there was a constant buzz
Wednesday about a possible sale.
</P>
<P>
   But such speculation is nothing new. Word among workers recently
had Delta Airlines as a possible suitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumors probably are some of the best sources of entertainment
for flight crews. After awhile &UR; , you don't get excited. I'll
believe it when the new uniform shows up in my locker,'' one
America West pilot &UR; said.
</P>
<P>
   America West flight attendant Lara Ketterman said she is excited
about the prospect of a merger with United and doesn't fear she
would be laid off. United is a strong company with good management,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Other America West employees interviewed for this story insisted
that their names not be used. The airline, like many big companies,
has a strict policy that forbids employees to talk to the media.
Some workers have been reprimanded after being quoted.
</P>
<P>
   Two flight attendants said a buyout would benefit their
pocketbooks, noting that United has strong union representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be wonderful for us. Getting into their union, our
pay would double,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, their own union continues to be at odds with America
West management.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pay for America West flight attendants is $15,571 and
reaches $25,974 after 12 years, according to figures from the
flight attendants union. Southwest Airlines starts its flight
attendants at $15,465, but they reach $42,700 in the 12th year, the
union says. Figures for United were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 America West mechanics settled on a contract in
October after two years of negotiations, but contract talks
continue with the Association of Flight Attendants, with meetings
resuming Monday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,100 flight attendants have voted to strike if an agreement
can't be reached on pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about 2,000 baggage handlers and other fleet service
workers voted this month for representation by the Transport
Workers Union, which has now launched an effort to organize America
West's gate, ticket counter and reservation workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Transport Workers Union also represents about 35 America
West dispatchers.
</P>
<P>
   From pilots to ramp workers, most America West employees said
they hoped a buyout would lead to better pay.
</P>
<P>
   It also would allow them to work for America's largest airline.
</P>
<P>
   A sale to United would be ``a great thing,'' one pilot &UR; said.
That's because pilots get more money when they fly larger planes,
which United has more of than America West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think even the most junior pilot would be happy,'' said a
longtime America West captain. ``There's no comparison as to what
America West pays for flight crews vs. what United pays.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, United offers a pension plan, something America West
lacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a pilot at America West, you put in 20 years and
hope you saved some money. United has a great pension,'' said a
United pilot who was in transit at Sky Harbor International Airport
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   America West officials would not comment beyond saying it has
been approached by ``a number of airlines expressing interest in
possible transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of ramp workers hoped a buyout would lead to better pay
if United kept them on board. Their hourly salaries float from $7
to about $11.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be awesome if they took us with them,'' one ramp
worker said.
</P>
<P>
   The low pay has led to high turnover among America West's ground
crews, something the airline appears ``content with,'' a worker
said.

AIRLINE POSTS RECORD INCOME DESPITE TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ America West Airlines, knocked off course in 1998 by
labor battles, chronic flight delays and a $5 million FAA fine over
maintenance violations, still managed to report record net income
of $108.6 million for the year.
</P>
<P>
   That was an increase of 45 percent from net income of $75
million in 1997, according to figures released Wednesday by the
Tempe carrier in its earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its troubles, passengers are returning to fly America
West and investors seem encouraged by the airline's financial
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are particularly pleased with our improvement in the
fourth-quarter earnings at a time when the airline industry in
general is experiencing declining profits,'' Chairman William
Franke said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   While America West Holdings Corp. financial results were
soaring, with total revenue topping the $2 billion mark for the
first time, the airline was buffeted last year by the largest fine
in U.S. aviation history, bitter disputes with its mechanics and
flight attendants unions and the worst on-time arrival record of
the 10 major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanics settled on a contract, but negotiations continue with
the Association of Flight Attendants, with talks resuming Monday in
Washington. . The 2,100 flight attendants have voted to strike if
an agreement can't be reached on pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about 2,000 baggage handlers and other fleet service
workers voted Jan. 8 for representation by the Transport Workers
Union, which has also launched an effort to organize America West's
gate, ticket counter and reservation workers.
</P>
<P>
   America West expects to reach agreement with the flight
attendants union this year, according to Chief Financial Officer
Doug Parker. He declined further comment on the negotiations, other
than to say that the union's threatened strike over the Christmas
holidays did not have any material effect on the company's
fourth-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   America West's final quarter net income of $22.4 million,
excluding non-recurring charges of $3.7 million, is 11 percent
better than the previous record of $20.1 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share of 56 cents were 30 percent above last year's
record of 43 cents and well above the 39 cents predicted by
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Parker characterized America West's performance as a ``really
fantastic year,'' following a good year in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Airline analyst Edward Starkman of Warburg Dillon Read said
America West is performing well, but not quite as good as the
earnings report showed.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in fuel prices has masked some ``revenue softness'' at
America West and other airlines, he said, adding that Warburg
Dillon Read has a ``hold'' rating on America West and all other
airlines except Southwest and US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   America West's fuel costs for the fourth quarter were down 17.5
percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter revenue, up 4 percent to $507 million, was higher
than expected, said Parker, adding that the company didn't know how
quickly it could improve its operations and convince customers to
fly America West again.
</P>
<P>
   The airline was plagued by a rash of canceled and delayed
flights, some of which it attributed to its dispute with the
mechanics union. Only 66.5 percent of the carrier's flights arrived
on time from July through September. That improved to 73.3 percent
in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration levied its $5 million civil
penalty at start of the third quarter in July. America West agreed
to pay $2.5 million to settle the allegations of lax maintenance
and operations violations and the FAA waived the remaining $2.5
million if the airline meets the terms of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   America West's sales force has done a good job of convincing
travelers that the third quarter operations were an aberration,
Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue passenger miles were up 4.4 percent in the fourth
quarter to 4.03 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bookings for the first month of this year appear to be strong,
but it's hard to tell how America West will do in the first quarter
because most passengers book flights only a month in advance,
Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   America West is planning for 10 percent growth in 1999 and will
continue to add flights on long-haul routes from Phoenix and Las
Vegas to the east coast, including New York, Boston and Baltimore,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy has proved successful in luring more business
passengers to America West, Parker added. &QL;

LARGEST STUDY YET RATES EFFECT OF FERTILITY DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs to correct byline)  (lb) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using fertility drugs increases a woman's chances of getting
pregnant, but the drugs should be used cautiously to avoid the
possibility of multiple birth, said a study and an accompanying
editorial in the current issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The report was the first large, well-controlled study to ask and
answer the question about whether using fertility drugs actually
improved chances of pregnancy. Some doctors have suggested that
conception would occur normally without drug treatment for couples
who were patient, and some have suggested that other treatments
without fertility drugs might work just as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the new study, carried out on 932 couples at 10 fertility
centers around the United States, showed that for couples with no
known physical bars to pregnancy who had tried to get pregnant for
three and a half years, on average, using fertility drugs and
injecting the husband's sperm directly into the wife's womb was the
most effective method.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of drugs and uterine injection used each month
for four months resulted in pregnancy for 33 percent of the women.
A second method, using drugs but injecting sperm onto the cervix,
had a 19 percent success rate. A third group, using no drugs but
with injection of sperm into the womb, had a success rate of 18
percent. Injecting sperm onto the cervix produced pregnancies in 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in an editorial accompanying the study, two Dutch fertility
experts, Dr. Egbert te Velde and Dr. Bernard Cohlen, both of
University Hospital in Utrecht, raised a caution about the study.
The doctors wrote that the data in the study supported the idea
that if patients were willing to wait another year and continue
with sexual intercourse alone, a result that was just as good might
be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting has the advantage of avoiding the possibility of
multiple births caused by fertility drugs. In this study, 24 of the
72 women who took drugs and became pregnant had multiple
pregnancies _ including three sets of quadruplets and four sets of
triplets. Without fertility drugs, about one in 90 pregnancies
might produce multiple births.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial suggested that couples seeking to have children
often were not given full information on their choices, and might
believe they no longer had a good chance of getting pregnant
without drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Guzick of the University of Rochester, the chief
author of the paper, argued that although 10 percent of the
patients in the study who did not take drugs still became pregnant,
that did not suggest that if the study were carried on for another
year or two, an additional 10 percent or 20 percent would get
pregnant. Some patients might have unknown problems that prevented
pregnancy, Guzick said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the fertility treatments studied were
generally not the first option. The women in the study took
gonadotropins, which induce women to produce more eggs than normal,
in conjunction with sperm injected directly into the uterus,
usually the third approach. The first two methods are carefully
timed intercourse and treatment with weaker drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Benjamin Younger, executive director of the American Society
of Reproductive Medicine, said that the editorial's suggestion that
couples wait for treatment was ``great in theory, but doesn't work
in practice,'' adding, ``People who have been trying for years are
very frustrated and don't want to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the authors of the study noted that they were paid
consultants for Serono, a Massachusetts company that makes
fertility drugs.
