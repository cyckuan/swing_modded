CLINTON DIGS AT ASHCROFT DURING HEALTH CARE APPEARANCE AT MU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ President Clinton said
it once. Then he said it again and again:
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate needs one more vote _ just one _ to pass a
sweeping patients' bill of rights that the president can sign.
</P>
<P>
   In a Missouri visit Thursday laden with political overtones,
Clinton never mentioned the name of the senator whose vote he
needs. But almost everyone in the crowd of 1,300 at Jesse
Auditorium at the University of Missouri knew who was on the
president's mind.
</P>
<P>
   That was John Ashcroft, the Republican senator seeking
re-election this year against the man who stood alongside the
president Thursday _ Gov. Mel Carnahan, a fellow Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed frustration at the bill's narrow failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so close,'' the president told an enthusiastic crowd in
one of the most Democratic areas of the state. ``I came here
because I don't think we ought to stop one vote short.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill is designed to give patients more choices in health
care and the authority to sue their insurance providers for bad
service. The version the president backs easily passed the House
last fall but was defeated in the Senate last month on a 51-48
count.
</P>
<P>
   But one Democratic senator who was absent has said he would have
voted for the bill, making the tally 51-49. If one Republican
switches sides, the count moves to 50-50, and Vice President Al
Gore would break the tie in favor of passing the House version.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's other senator, Republican Kit Bond, also voted
against the bill. Bond, however, was re-elected in 1998 and is not
on the political radar screen this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survey after survey after survey shows that more than 70
percent of all Americans, whether they identify themselves as
Republicans or Democrats or independents, support a strong,
enforceable patients' bill of rights,'' Clinton said. ``And,
therefore, in Washington we have an obligation to pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's visit, with its dual purposes of lobbying for a
favored bill and promoting Carnahan in one of the year's most hotly
contested Senate races, apparently failed to persuade Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the president's 24-minute address, the senator's
staff released a pair of news releases that underscored Ashcroft's
continuing support for a Republican-backed Senate version of the
patients' bill of rights. Clinton says that proposal falls far
short of what's needed.
</P>
<P>
   Using some of the same rhetoric that Clinton employed, Ashcroft
said he'll continue to back a ``real'' patients' bill of rights
``that puts doctors and patients in control of health-care
decisions instead of insurance claims adjusters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People want the job accomplished,'' Ashcroft said in his news
release. ``They expect leadership to fix problems, not fix blame.''
</P>
<P>
   With the war of words continuing to escalate over the issue, the
main differences continue to center on who should be covered by a
patients' bill of rights and how much money an injured patient
should be able to recover from a health care provider in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft and most Senate Republicans want damages limited to
$350,000 in federal court. Supporters of the House bill that has
drawn bipartisan support want no limits on damage awards.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argues that a federal bill should cover all Americans.
The Senate version would cover people in self-insurance plans only
in which employers pay medical bills directly.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, the president argued passionately that the
Senate bill falls short in several areas: All Americans are not
covered under the Senate plan, he said. Access to specialists is
not guaranteed. Nor is emergency room care or access to clinical
trials that allow at-risk patients access to new treatments for
cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version excludes 135 million Americans from coverage,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when you hear people say, `Well, I support a patients' bill
of rights,' the operative word in that sentence is `a' as opposed
to `the,' '' the president said. ``The difference in the one-letter
word and the three-letter word is 135 million of your fellow
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this whole debate's about.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ashcroft and business interests pointed to several
shortcomings in the bill Clinton backs. The first is the emphasis
the House bill would place on lawsuits as a way of settling medical
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The House version ``has a provision that really moves people
into the courts, into lawsuits,'' Ashcroft said during a visit to
Kansas City Wednesday. ``I think when you're sick, you need
treatment. One of the things about this bill that we passed in the
Senate is we get people to treatment quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the drawbacks that Clinton cited, an aide to
Ashcroft said only that the plan the senator backs is stronger in
several respects than a law the Missouri General Assembly passed in
1997. Clinton lauded that law Thursday as a model for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ashcroft said the patients' rights bill he backs
calls for medical-care disputes to be resolved within 14 days.
Missouri law requires that such disputes be remedied within 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Sullivan, spokeswoman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
also disagreed with Clinton. She said employers may drop
health-care plans as a fringe benefit because of the unlimited
liability involved in the bill Clinton backs. Businesses could be
at risk if they provide their workers with faulty coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers just simply cannot afford to take on that type of
risk with the trial lawyers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, companies may wind up giving workers lump-sum cash
payments so that they can buy their own coverage, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Carnahan said passage of Missouri's bill of rights
has not resulted in the litigation nightmare that Republicans had
forecast. Democrats, he suggested, have credibility on the issue
because of the success of the state's law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to report to you that the critics were dead wrong,''
he said to applause. ``We know there are many advantages to living
in the Show-Me State, and health-care protection is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went out of his way to avoid mentioning Ashcroft by
name. The closest he came to a direct knock on the senator was when
he pointed out that during his years as governor of Arkansas he
served with four Missouri governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Mel Carnahan is clearly one of the very best governors I
ever served with,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Clinton only served at the same time with three
Missouri chief executives: Joseph P. Teasdale, Kit Bond and
Ashcroft. Carnahan was elected in 1992, the same year Clinton was
elected president. ( 30 )

VENUS RISES ABOVE HYPE, SUSPICIONS TO REACH WIMBLEDON FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When it was over Thursday afternoon outside of London,
Venus Williams put her arm around her little sister and walked her
off Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
   Serena, the reigning U.S. Open champion, had just lost to Venus
in the semifinals of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the all-Williams matchup, while emotional for the
young women, will allow Venus her second chance at a first Grand
Slam title. She will play fellow Californian Lindsay Davenport in
the final Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always the big sister. I always take care of Serena. She
does what I do, but I'm still the big sister,'' Venus said after
the highest matchup of sisters in a Grand Slam event since the
inaugural Wimbledon in 1884.
</P>
<P>
   But for the uneasiness of their sibling showdown, there they had
been, fulfilling the prophesy, becoming unavoidable opponents.
</P>
<P>
   They were two of the last four players in the biggest
championship in tennis. Considering the curve they're on, soon
perhaps they will more consistently be the final two, each the
other's best friend, fiercest protector, supportive critic and
challenging rival.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, in the postmatch interviews, which were piped from the
All England Tennis Club via the Internet for worldwide access,
mostly what everyone wanted to know was whether the match had been
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Did the father of these two top-ranked tennis professionals
ordain which one would win?
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Serena, too savvy to be caught in this latest round of
tactics, knew how to deal with the insinuation that Venus' win was
a conspiracy, as if it were Venus' turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I'm aware of,'' Venus said, cagily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer that question,'' Serena said.
</P>
<P>
   At every phase since their emergence onto the tennis circuit, at
each stage of their development, the Williams sisters have dealt
with the inquiries, the quizzical attempts to define them, their
father, their family and their place in this game.
</P>
<P>
   From a purely athletic point of view, experiments like the one
Richard Williams has performed are not completely uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Marinovich's father notoriously groomed his son to be an
NFL quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods' father stuck a driver in his son's hand when the
kid was 6 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. learned much of what he knows about life inside
major league clubhouses.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, however, the experiment Richard Williams
undertook with his two daughters warrants a little bit more awe.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Williams clan has attracted more than its share
of curiosity, but perhaps it is time to pair that with a great deal
more appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Everything Richard Williams predicted has come true.
</P>
<P>
   His daughters have accomplished just about everything he said
they would, starting from the moment Venus, now 20, walked onto a
court in Oakland six years ago and made her professional tennis
debut.
</P>
<P>
   At first, her game powerful and raw, Venus was sometimes
dismissed for her failure to break down points and her uneven shot
selection.
</P>
<P>
   But as people kept talking about the beads Venus and her sister
used to wear in their hair, the two prodigies were busy upgrading
their shot selection, learning to focus their concentration on what
works on grass and what doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Venus, despite injuries this year that have kept her to just
four tournaments, seems to have risen up over the speed bump of
last year's U.S. Open loss to Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   By beating Hingis in the Wimbledon quarterfinals, Venus
announced her comeback. She has shown there is still upside to her
game and championship aspirations, while Hingis, once seen as the
successor to the reign of Chris Evert, Monica Seles and Steffi
Graf, may have peaked.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Venus was asked what is different about her from 1997,
when she last played in a Grand Slam final at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even full-time on the tour then. I didn't understand
some things. I didn't know how to break down certain points,'' she
said. ``These are totally different circumstances. It's extremely
different now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Venus first, and later Serena, handled the pressure of
rising to the top of their game by circumnavigating much of the
hype and pressure. That has not always been easy, since their
talk-the-talk mode of self-confidence has served to increase the
hype and suspicion about them.
</P>
<P>
   By race and sociology and by the economics of their start back
in their native Compton, these young women are outsiders to tennis.
But these outsiders have now become fixtures at the top of women's
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   And watching them accomplish this has been fascinating,
especially in the white-washed world of the professional tennis
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is Venus Williams' turn to win a Grand Slam, but not
because her father predicted that one day she would. It is her time
because she has earned this chance.

CLINTON PREPARING TO DELAY U.S. EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.C., Puerto Rico, Va., N.Y., Md.)   (ADDS year of last federal execution in 6th graf) 
By RAYMOND BONNER and MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is planning to postpone
the first federal execution in nearly 40 years because of a lack of
clemency procedures and concerns about racial and geographic
disparities in death penalty cases, administration officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is awaiting Justice Department regulations for
death row inmates to follow in seeking clemency from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Raul Garza, who was convicted seven years ago of three
drug-related murders, is scheduled to be executed on Aug. 5, and
his lawyers said Thursday that they would use the new procedures as
soon as they have them to ask President Clinton to spare Garza's
life.
</P>
<P>
   The department is also finishing a report on whether members of
racial minorities or defendants in certain parts of the country are
more likely to face the federal death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Data gathered so far by the Justice Department shows that
members of minorities make up more than three-quarters of the
defendants in federal capital cases and that federal prosecutors in
five districts, including two in New York, have filed nearly half
of the federal cases in which the death penalty was an option,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department report, to be released later this month,
is certain to generate questions about the fairness of the federal
death penalty beyond the Garza case, which would be the first
federal execution since 1963, when John F. Kennedy was president,
officials said. There are currently 21 men who face the death
penalty for federal crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The new clemency procedures, the first in federal capital cases
since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, should be
completed within a week or two, a Justice Department spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   They will allow for the death row inmate's lawyer to make an
oral presentation to a clemency panel, and the process, from filing
to final decision, will take at least 90 days, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said Garza, who was convicted in 1993 in
Brownsville, Texas, would be allowed to take advantage of the new
procedures. Thus, his execution will have to be postponed,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman said the department had no
authority to grant a reprieve to Garza at this time, and that the
sole power for such a reprieve now lay with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, the president's pardon powers are
absolute. Thus, options in the Garza case include a pardon, which
would erase the criminal record, commutation to a life sentence or
a temporary reprieve, which would allow Garza to follow the new
clemency procedures. A 90-day reprieve would put off the execution
until after the election, one official noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cautiously optimistic,'' said Garza's lawyer, Gregory W.
Wiercioch of the Texas Defender Service in Houston. Wiercioch added
that he had not been given official notice of any reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until then, we have to move forward on other fronts,'' he
said. Wiercioch was in Washington Thursday looking for support for
his client.
</P>
<P>
   Garza has had his hopes dashed before. When Judge Filemon B.
Vela of U.S. District Court in Brownsville first proposed setting
an August execution date, U.S. Attorney Mervyn M. Mossbacker Jr.
joined the defense in asking that he not do so. Noting that it
would be the first federal execution in more than three decades,
Mossbacker said the Justice Department was developing guidelines
and procedures to ensure that it would be carried out ``in an
appropriate, dignified and expeditious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Although declaring that he was ``not a proponent of the death
penalty,'' Vela rejected the arguments and set the date, after
which the U.S. attorney dropped further opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, a high school dropout who is the son of migrant farm
workers, was the head of a drug-running operation that smuggled in
tons of marijuana from Mexico, according to the federal charges. He
was convicted of ordering the execution of three people as part of
his criminal enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Although Garza has declared that he was not responsible for the
murders, his lawyers, in seeking clemency, do not intend to argue
that he is innocent. Rather, they will argue that it is unfair to
put Garza to death because the federal death penalty system, as it
currently operates, discriminates against members of minorities and
is unevenly applied across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The administration of the federal death penalty is like a
``rigged lottery,'' with the outcome determined by ``the color of
your skin and where you purchased your ticket,'' Wiercioch said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week, Clinton said he was concerned
about ``the disturbing racial composition'' of the federal death
penalty population, and that a handful of federal districts account
for the majority of death penalty cases, ``which raises the
question of whether, even though there is a uniform law across the
country, what your prosecution is may turn solely on where you
committed the crime.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Clinton said, he had asked the Justice Department
to undertake a review.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court declared in 1972 that the death penalty as it
was then applied was unconstitutional. In 1988, Congress enacted
legislation that allowed prosecutors to seek the death penalty for
certain crimes. It was first applied to drug-related crimes, in
what has become known as the ``drug kingpin statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his political career, Clinton has been a
stalwart backer of the death penalty. In his 1992 campaign,
Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, interrupted his campaign to
deny clemency to two inmates who subsequently were executed by
lethal injection. As president, he signed legislation in 1994 that
expanded the federal death penalty to about 60 crimes. Two years
later, after the Oklahoma City bombing, he backed a law
streamlining the appeals process, which applied to both state and
federal prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one men have a death sentence hanging over them, said the
Federal Death Penalty Resource Project, an organization in
Columbia, S.C., that opposes the death penalty. Fourteen are
African-American, three are Hispanic, one is Asian and three are
white, including Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted in the Oklahoma
City bombings.
</P>
<P>
   With most of these men having only recently exhausted all their
appeals, the Justice Department has not been under pressure to
adopt federal rules for clemency, which is an inmate's last hope
after all the courts have spoken. Even without formal procedures,
however, federal inmates are able to petition the president for
redress.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. attorney needs the approval of the attorney general
before seeking the death penalty, and Attorney General Janet Reno
has instituted a formal procedure for federal prosecutors to follow
in seeking that approval.
</P>
<P>
   In a case in which the death penalty is an option, the
prosecutor is required to send a memorandum to the Justice
Department, with a recommendation on whether or not it should be
sought. A committee set up by Reno then reviews the file and makes
a recommendation to her.
</P>
<P>
   A defendant's lawyer is allowed to make a presentation to the
federal prosecutor before the government seeks the death penalty,
and then to the Justice Department review committee, two levels of
protection that do not exist for a defendant in state capital
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to 1988, the attorney general has authorized the
death penalty against 199 defendants, according to the death
penalty project. Three-fourths of these defendants have been
members of minority groups, with 103 of them African-Americans, the
project said.
</P>
<P>
   A former member of the death penalty review committee, Rory K.
Little, has described Reno's death-penalty case review system as
``consciously race-blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The racial disparities creep into the system, said Little, who
now teaches at Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, because of
the wide discretion given to federal prosecutors. They decided in
the first instance whether to charge a defendant with a crime that
carries the death penalty and then whether to plea bargain for a
life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   This same discretion explains the geographic disparities in the
system, he said. A chart published by Little in a law review
article showed that for the years 1995 through 1998, U.S. attorneys
submitted 471 death penalty cases to the Justice Department for
review. Slightly more than 200 were from five judicial districts.
Puerto Rico was at the top, with 59 submissions; the Eastern
District of Virginia followed, with 52; the Eastern District of New
York, 42; the Southern District of New York, 30, and Maryland, 24.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official said that the numbers would be
updated in the department's current report, but that the five
districts still led in death penalty cases.

OVITZ CROSSES OCEAN IN GLOBAL FILM ALLIANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Gregory J. Wilcox 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles _ Hollywood power broker Michael Ovitz's filmmaking
endeavors received a boost when his Artists Production Group formed
a joint venture with a European company to produce as many as 15
films whose total budgets could top $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with StudioCanal, the European studio operation of
Canal Plus, calls for the films with global appeal to be made over
the next three years. The average budget could top $50 million,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the first collaborations between a major European
studio and a domestic production company.
</P>
<P>
   The new enterprise will be run on both creative and strategic
fronts by a management team consisting equally of executives from
APG and StudioCanal. Ovitz, the former Walt Disney Co. president
and once the entertainment industry's most powerful agent, will be
its chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty excited considering we've been in business for 18
months,'' Ovitz said Thursday on the partnering with StudioCanal.
``They are really savvy and they really get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Five projects are in development with production a year to 18
months away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what we've done is create a ministudio with very
little overhead and a big development fund,'' Ovitz noted.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 18 months Ovitz burst back onto the Hollywood scene
in grand fashion with companies focused on artist management, the
Internet, episodic television and film production. APG was founded
by Ovitz, Rick Yorn, Julie Silverman-Yorn and Cathy Schulman.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal combines StudioCanal's global reach and the
multitiered pan-European distribution network with APG's A-list
talent and production expertise. StudioCanal produces, finances and
distributes feature films and television programs and is modeled
after other major Hollywood studios.
</P>
<P>
   Clients signed on with Ovitz's Artists Management Group include
Cameron Diaz, Robin Williams, Leonardo Di Caprio and authors Tom
Clancy, James Ellroy and Michael Crichton.
</P>
<P>
   His clients will get first crack at projects, but there will be
work for the rest of Hollywood, too, Ovitz said. And he is not
concerned about any perception of a conflict of interest from
representing talent and making movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the opportunity to make five more pictures a year and
there is nothing wrong with that. It's very positive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Garzilli, co-president of Beverly Hills-based Canal Plus
US, considers the deal with Ovitz a coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is a tremendous asset to any type of project like this.
Because of his contacts and experience in the industry, this is a
terrific relationship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The French film company likewise holds American products in high
regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. films travel very well. They are clearly an important
ingredient in setting up your studio. U.S. films clearly have a
global market,'' Garzilli said.
</P>
<P>
   Canal Plus is 50 percent owned by Vivendi, the big French
conglomerate that snapped up Seagram Co. Ltd. to take control of
Universal's entertainment operations. It renamed the company
Vivendi Universal and installed Canal Plus chief Pierre Lescure as
its head.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Ed Hatch at SG Cowen Securities Inc. in New York said
the deal with Ovitz follows what is now a trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film industry is becoming increasingly global due to the
great upgrade in the exhibition business overseas, which has made
the international market in total even more important than the
domestic market now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz agrees, noting that what's hot in Los Angeles is likewise
hot in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Films produced by the new joint venture will capitalize on it,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really are looking to make pictures that appeal to a
worldwide audience,'' Ovitz said. ``Kids are kids. It's really
interesting. If you walk through Paris, aside from their different
culture, my teen-agers could fit right in and vice versa.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The families fill the courtrooms and hallways of this
city's courthouses each day, a stream of human traffic driven by
surging arrest rates and crowded court calendars.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases they arrive in force: parents, siblings and
children determined to show support for a loved one with their
sheer numbers. But in most cases they are women who arrive alone or
with young children they cannot leave at home: a solitary mother,
wife or girlfriend intent on supporting a scorned defendant, or
serving as a poignant reminder of a murder victim.
</P>
<P>
   They are the families of the accused and the victims, and they
are all in some form of mourning. They often display remarkable
grace and loyalty, and say their experiences in the grim
courthouses can be cathartic.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of families are those that have long been seen in the
criminal courts _ the poor. But defense lawyers say that they have
seen a different type of family arrive in recent years as the
city's quality-of-life crackdown continues. More working-class
families who have never before had brushes with the law arrive in
shock after a loved one is arrested and jailed overnight for a
minor offense, like driving with a suspended license.
</P>
<P>
   But despite high divorce rates and the far-flung nature of
modern families, one longstanding legal truism endures: the concept
of family remains a potent weapon in court. The presence of family
members often has an impact, great or small, on the outcome of the
trial or arraignment they have come to see.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with judges, jurors, prosecutors and defense lawyers
suggest that the presence of these families _ some tattered, some
durably faithful _ can be a critical factor in the balance of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   A frantic wife or a grieving mother staring intently at a judge
or jury can humanize a defendant or a murder victim, they said. And
the lack of any family members in the audience _ a situation that
roughly half of defendants face _ can sully the accused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for juries,'' said Acting Justice John P.
Walsh of State Supreme Court, a former police inspector who
supervises the city's arraignment courts. ``It shows that a
defendant's family hasn't abandoned them. Psychologically for
jurors, if it's a close case, it will have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges said that jurors sometimes do not realize the subtle
emotional impact families have on them by sitting in a courtroom.
Jurors also may disregard instructions to pay no attention to the
audience, the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jurors in the first trial of Andrew Goldstein, a schizophrenic
man convicted in March of murdering Kendra Webdale by pushing her
in front of a subway, were instructed to draw no inference from the
failure of Goldstein's family to testify in his defense or to
attend his trial.
</P>
<P>
   But several jurors said they found the absence of Goldstein's
family suspicious. And after Goldstein's first trial ended in a
hung jury last November, jurors apologized to members of Webdale's
family and hugged them in front of the courthouse. Jurors said they
owed it to the Webdale family to have reached a verdict. They said
they had noticed the victim's relatives sitting resolutely in the
courtroom each day.
</P>
<P>
   But the human tales that play out in the courtrooms and the
crowded, often loud, sometimes menacing hallways of the courthouses
typically do not receive much notice. The families come intent on
doing the right thing and on perhaps gaining an edge in the pending
legal fight, but anything can happen.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   David Kapner, a defense lawyer who supervises arraignments for
the Legal Aid Society in Manhattan, said the city's quality-of-life
crackdown had brought a different type of family to the city's
criminal courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality-of-life arrests suck up a lot of people who have
never been in trouble before, and those are the people who are more
likely to have their families show up in court,'' he said. ``There
are more teen-agers for drinking beer, or immigrants for
peddling.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   One morning last month in the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building
was typical of a justice system in which a thousand people a day
are arrested and thousands of cases are handled every week.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Cabrera, 49, wept as she, her husband, her two daughters,
her daughter-in-law and her nephew walked into the lobby
desperately searching for her son, who had been arrested by
immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would get run over by a bus or a train if that would make
them let him go,'' said Cabrera, who sobbed and said she was afraid
her son would be deported.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, Blanca Santiago, 18, sat on the floor waiting
with her father-in-law for her husband to be released. The husband
had been arrested and accused of selling flowers without a permit.
A few feet away, a Chinese man tried to comfort his two children as
he and his sister-in-law tried to find out when his wife would be
released after being arrested on a charge of buying untaxed
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera and Santiago were hardly alone in their wait for the
release of husbands, boyfriends and sons who had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Anguished conversations on the bank of pay phones that line the
lobby wall are common. Family members break the news that someone
has been arrested, try to hire a lawyer or struggle to raise bail
money.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women are financially dependent on the men, defense
lawyers said. Mothers who say they have no place to leave their
children take them to the courthouse. At night, strollers and
crying infants are common sights and sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `I'm looking for my baby's father,''' said Sgt.
Stephen Crisafulli, a court officer who supervises the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mothers who struggle to keep the children quiet in courtrooms
often retreat to the hallways. There, the children play impromptu
games, sitting on the floor or running in circles and shrieking as
their mothers wait.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday night, Angela Medina, 18, gave her
one-month-old son a bottle as she sat in the lobby waiting for her
sister's boyfriend to be released. ``I want to support him and my
sister,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases sometimes draw immigrant families who arrive in
force. During one night court shift, 12 relatives of a woman from
Senegal who was arrested in a domestic dispute arrived at 1 a.m. to
find her. The group included her 2-month-old niece.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents and spouses accept defendants' claims that they
were victims of false arrests by officers overzealously enforcing
the city's quality-of-life crackdown. But others fly into a rage at
their loved one.
</P>
<P>
   The most heated confrontation in the Manhattan Criminal Courts
Building in the last several years was between a father and son,
Crisafulli said. The father, who had spent time in prison, flew
into a rage after his own son was arrested. ```How could you do
this! I work every day for you!'' the father thundered as court
officers restrained him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really ripping the boy to keep him from going down the
same path,'' the sergeant said. ``It was fear and frustration, not
anger.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Judges said that in less serious cases, defendants' ties to
their families are factors in how much bail they set or whether
they offer plea bargains involving probation or drug rehabilitation
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's got a mother, brother, sister and wife sitting in the
audience, it shows he has a support system,'' Walsh said. ``That
support system is important for him to take his medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers said that the presence of families can also
complicate matters. Some young defendants will refuse to plead
guilty in front of their mothers, for example, if they have sworn
to their parents they did not do the crimes. Other family members
give terrible legal advice, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   While the building's ground floor is filled with families
usually suffering smaller heartaches, its upper floors are lined
with families enduring far larger ones. There, defendants face more
serious felony charges, most involving drugs, that can result in
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Racial and class tensions can also hover over the courtrooms.
Poor families frequently complain that their loved ones receive
longer sentences because they cannot afford ``a real lawyer,'' and
that fury finds expression in the court buildings. After a drug
addict who killed a man with his car while on PCP was sentenced to
15 years in prison last month, one of his relatives shouted ``let
it be a Mercedes-Benz, and you'll walk away no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many family members seem to fall into stereotypical roles in the
courthouse, judges and lawyers said. Mothers generally attend
trials religiously and are better able to express their emotions,
they said. Fathers, by contrast, appear intermittently and seem to
struggle with their anger.
</P>
<P>
   Many relatives on the building's upper floors are hoping to
influence judges or to simply catch a glimpse of a jailed defendant
during a brief court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the mother, two aunts, girlfriend and three cousins
of Victor Rhymer, 19, waited hours for him to be sentenced for
robbing a man of his beeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a strain to come here because we love him,'' his aunt
Claudette said.
</P>
<P>
   Courthouse veterans said that explaining the continuing power of
families in the court system is simple. Jurors and judges, like all
people, may groan about their own nagging mothers, distant fathers
and crazy siblings. But blood is still expected to bind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that if you're alone in this world,
it's much harder to rehabilitate yourself,'' said David Kapner, a
defense lawyer with the Legal Aid Society. ``But if you have some
people in your life, you have a better chance of pulling yourself
together. Intuitively, judges and juries understand that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers and judges say one of the most depressing sights
in court is the roughly 50 percent of defendants who arrive alone,
with no family members. Many are long-term drug abusers whose
addictions have shattered their ties to their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are acquitted and they walk out of the courtroom
and there is no one there,'' said David Stern, a Manhattan defense
lawyer. ``Some are convicted and no one sheds a tear.''

RANGERS OWNER TAKES A TURN IN WRONG DIRECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A funny thing happened on the way to Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of this bus _ an otherwise judicious fellow named
Hicks _ took a left turn and pointed the Rangers back toward
Oakland, Anaheim and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to a man who vacations in Alaska, this is nothing. In
Tom Hicks' world, a man can fish in any time zone.
</P>
<P>
   But gee whiz, Tom. The kids have homework. We newspapers have
deadlines. If the Rangers were ever to clinch a pennant in, say,
the Pacific Northwest, it would be grand if someone other than
Conan O'Brien and the late shift at Denny's were awake to see it.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? The Rangers were in the driver's seat, motoring
blithely toward realignment. Baseball commissioner Bud Selig was
quoted as saying that he owed the franchise one _ imagine that _ in
the form of a promise he once made to then-owner George W. Bush,
who at the time was also doing business as The First Son.
</P>
<P>
   Several oblique realignment proposals later, it appeared that
the worst the Rangers could end up is being co-Alpha dog in a
six-team American League Central. Annual visitation rights to
Houston were included.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad. The inequities of possibly being in baseball's only
six-team division were duly noted. We can do the math.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, we hear owner Hicks saying to hold everything.
Hicks has been saying that he likes the ``tradition'' of his guys
playing the Oaklands, the Anaheims and the Seattles. For
tradition's sake, he wants the Rangers to remain in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. Randy Johnson. Mark McGwire. Tony La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, what do you mean they're gone?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they're gone. Some traditions come and go _ like
ballparks. Rangers fans may have grown attached to seeing their
heroes battle Junior and McGwire. But how many hearts soar now when
John Halama and Olmedo Saenz come to town?
</P>
<P>
   Hicks told our paper's T.R. Sullivan the other day, ``... our
fans would like to see us play Seattle, Oakland and the Angels
rather than the Twins and the Royals.''
</P>
<P>
   They would? Says who?
</P>
<P>
   Those alleged blood-rival Athletics, young and brimming with
talent, attracted only 28,964 to The Ballpark for the series closer
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, lest the owner forget, were once division mates of
the same Twins and Royals that Hicks wants to shield the fans from.
Not all that long ago, those same two teams were the class of the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   In today's game, fans fill seats either to watch superstars play
or to revel in the excitement of a game of importance. If it's late
August or September and the game is important, let me suggest that
it doesn't matter whether the opponent is named the Angels or the
Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the aforementioned fan must first be awake. Which
brings us back to the original issue.
</P>
<P>
   With the planned unbalanced schedule, the Rangers would be
playing even more road games starting at 9 p.m. or later. Yes, the
true fans will watch. But in the long run, the fan base will suffer
because your young audience will be asleep.
</P>
<P>
   It seems elementary _ teams should try to play as many games as
possible in the same time zone where their fans live.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history might be telling owner Hicks that the Rangers can
handle this AL West. Three division titles in four years speak for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So who's to fear in the AL Central? Don't say the Cleveland
Indians. They're almost 10 games back.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there don't appear to be any more big spenders in the
Central division than in the West. So what's Hicks' big fear?
</P>
<P>
   If his most important objective is playing interleague games
against the Astros every year, someone needs to ask why. Mitch
Meluskey is fine, but I think I'd rather see Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   A Rangers-Astros rivalry would attract initial curiosity, but it
will never be like the Mets-Yankees or Cubs-White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if that's the trade-off _ the Rangers staying in the AL
West, just for the privilege of playing the Astros each year _ that
doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Nor good business sense, at any hour of the night.
</P>
<P>

Cordero returns home
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rangers are expected to be without pitcher Francisco Cordero
during their three games with the San Diego Padres this weekend.
Cordero, who has been used in middle relief for most of the season,
has returned to his home in the Dominican Republic to attend his
grandmother's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin said the Rangers won't make a move,
leaving manager Johnny Oates with a five-man bullpen for the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem, but there's nothing we can do about it,''
Melvin said. ``We could option him out, but we wouldn't have him
for the first three games after the All-Star break.''
</P>
<P>
   If a player is optioned to the minors, he must stay for 10 days.
 &QL; 
Torre considered Alicea, Wetteland
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre of the New York Yankees said he considered
both Rangers second baseman Luis Alicea and reliever John Wetteland
for the American League All-Star team. But Torre said the
overwhelming offensive numbers put up by first basemen and
outfielders made it difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult, especially with Luis,'' Torre said
yesterday. ``I know this would have been his first All-Star Game.
But the glut of first basemen and outfielders really tied my hands.
I did consider John and Luis, but I just decided to go in a
different direction. Last year, I came close to picking \RChicago
second baseman\S Ray Durham, but at the last minute I did something
else. This year, I didn't want to omit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ivan Rodriguez will be the Rangers' only All-Star
representative for the game, scheduled Tuesday in Atlanta.
Rodriguez is participating for the ninth consecutive year and is
starting for the eighth consecutive year.  &QL; 
Padres without Gwynn
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, with the resumption of interleague play, open a
three-game series tonight against the San Diego Padres, who are
without future Hall of Fame outfielder Tony Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-time batting champion underwent arthroscopic surgery
on his left knee last week and is expected to be sidelined for two
to three weeks. Gwynn, who has 3,108 hits in his career, was
hitting .323.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and the Padres are 5-5 against each other since
interleague play began. The Rangers have won four of five from the
Padres at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, after yesterday's loss to Los Angeles, have lost 18
of their past 27 and are 27-38 after a 10-9 start. The Padres went
into yesterday's game having committed 78 errors, the most in the
major leagues.  &QL; 
Zimmerman's numbers
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zimmerman has a 6.29 earned-run average, the third highest
relief ERA in the American League. His biggest problem has been
having yielded seven home runs in 34 innings. But in some other
areas, Zimmerman ranks in the top 10 among American League
relievers:
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are hitting .137 (7-for-51) off Zimmerman with runners
in scoring position. That's seventh lowest in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman has allowed only 20 percent (7-for-35) of inherited
runners to score. That's the ninth-lowest ratio in the league.
</P>
<P>
   He has held first batters to a .188 average (6-for-32), the 10th
lowest in the league.  &QL; 
Adjusting for Davis
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have adjusted their farm system with an eye toward
Doug Davis being with the team after the All-Star break by
promoting three top pitching prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure what we're going to do with Davis after the
All-Star break,'' Doug Melvin said. ``This is just a sign we need
pitching at Triple A and Double A.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers replaced Davis on the Triple-A Oklahoma roster by
promoting pitcher Jose Martinez, who was 5-6 with a 3.14 ERA at
Double-A Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed pitcher Andy Pratt, who was 7-4 with a 2.72 ERA at
Class-A Charlotte, was promoted to Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed pitcher Matt Kosderka was promoted to] Charlotte
from Class-A Savannah, where he was 5-4 with a 2.57 ERA.  &QL; 
Time change
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers game at Seattle on Saturday, July 22, has been
changed from 8:05 p.m. to 3:10 p.m. to accommodate Fox, which is
planning to include the game in its regional telecasts. The game
will be shown locally on KDFW/Channel 4 rather than Fox Sports Net.
 &QL; 
Hot hitters
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez has a nine-game hitting streak, equaling his
season high, accomplished twice previously. He is batting .378
(14-for-37) during the streak. He has reached base by hit or walk
in 17 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer, who is hitting .293, has a seven-game hitting
streak, with 12 hits in his past 31 at-bats. He also has at least
two hits in 14 of his past 17 games, hitting .403 in that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui has hit safely in 10 of his past 11 games, batting
.378 (17-45).
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lamb, after going 3-for-5 in Wednesday's game, is batting
.364 in his past 18 games. He has also reached base in nine of his
past 15 plate appearances.

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ When Ruben Mateo gets out of his black sports
utility vehicle and inches toward The Ballpark in Arlington from a
nearby parking lot, he knows shagging fly balls won't be a part of
his daily routine. The major-league uniform he wore at the
beginning of the season has been replaced by a white T-shirt and
pair of black wind shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a broken right leg, the rookie who once patrolled
center field for the Rangers now hobbles on crutches to a
rehabilitation center in a suite above the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I thought about is that I would not be able to
play baseball again,'' said Mateo, who suffered a broken right
femur running to first base against Arizona on June 2. ``I feel bad
because I cannot play, but I got hurt trying my best at my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Mateo, 22, has someone close to him who can help
him through tough times. Rookie reliever Francisco Cordero, also
22, lives with Mateo and Ruben's mother, Ancelma Perez Coldero, in
a modest two-story home in Arlington. Cordero has known Mateo since
they were teen-agers playing on the same team, Escogida, in the
Dominican Republic. Cordero knows firsthand what his friend is
going through, having suffered a season-ending elbow injury in July
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it is hard for him to have to sit there and watch
someone else play your position,'' said Cordero, who came from
Detroit in the trade that sent Juan Gonzalez to the Tigers in
November. ``I care about him and I know this is very hard for him
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo said his mother's support and Cordero's friendship have
helped keep his spirits up since his injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Francisco is a good person, and I talk to him about a lot of
things,'' Mateo said. ``He keeps me from getting sad. He misses his
family, but we all do in the beginning. Seven months without family
is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo said his mother ``does everything for us. I thank God she
is here with me at such difficult time. She tells me not to feel
bad. She is my support.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordero's mother, Martina, and 11 siblings live in Santa
Domingo. He wants to bring her to the United States next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very far away from my family and I miss my mother,'' said
Cordero, who lives with his mother when he goes back to the
Dominican Republic. ``My mom worked very hard for me to get me
where I am at now.
</P>
<P>
   ``She worked for 21 years as a housekeeper to give me what I
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Cordero's father, Diego, died of cancer. Diego Cordero
introduced Francisco to baseball as a toddler, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was big baseball fan, and he always took me to baseball
games,'' Cordero said. ``We used to go everywhere. It was hard for
me when he died, very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, who had planned to return home during the All-Star
break, left early yesterday to attend his grandmother's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, as Mateo, is trying to fulfill large expectations
within the organization. He believes he can be the team's future
closer. In 39 innings, he's 1-1 with a 4.28 earned-run average, 27
strikeouts and 28 walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a closer full time,'' Cordero said. ``I think I
can close for the Rangers or any team.''
</P>
<P>
   What will keep both happy, they said, is solidifying their
future with the Rangers. General manager Doug Melvin said there's a
possibility Cordero can develop into a full-time closer with what
he calls a ``power arm and a good slider.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a few unknowns in Mateo's game because he has been
hurt so often, having been on the disabled list twice last year in
his first major-league season, and now must come back from a
serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping for 20 home runs and 65-70 RBIs this year from
Ruben, and it is unfortunate that he was injured,'' Melvin said.
``It was a big loss for us. Now, we have to wait until next season
to see if he performs at the big leagues for a full season.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Stauffer, site coordinator at HealthSouth Sports Medicine &AMP;
Rehabilitation Center, works with Mateo and said he should be able
to walk without crutches within the next two to three weeks. Mateo
will be required to continue two-hour, five-day-a-week
rehabilitation sessions until spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo said he'll continue to visit The Ballpark each weekday for
treatment, but tries to be home with his mother before the first
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to go to the ballpark and watch others play,'' he
said. ``I like to go there and play baseball. It still bothers me
to watch.''

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ While everybody awaits the blockbuster John
Wetteland trade, just remember the name Ed Vosberg.
</P>
<P>
   Vosberg, when last seen in these parts, was a capable but
obscure left-handed relief pitcher who served the Rangers well for
two-plus years. Too many people remember him more for his failed
ticket-scalping scheme than for being a valuable part of the 1996
bullpen that may have lacked a standout closer but still had plenty
of depth.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Marlins recognized Vosberg's value the following
year, when] they made their historic run to become the first
wild-card team to win a World Series. Needing a left-handed
reliever, the Marlins snatched Vosberg on Aug. 12, 1997, when the
Rangers had fallen out of the race and general manager Doug Melvin
was trying to get a head start on next year.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Melvin got Rick Helling in return, easily the best
trade he has made in six years as the Rangers' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, Melvin is likely to consider few players
untouchable when it comes time in the next few weeks to start
getting ready for 2001 and the best trade may not be what he gets
for Wetteland or David Segui but for Dave Martinez or Chad Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, yes, the Rangers would need a designated hitter if
Segui were traded. But, right now, Melvin said Pedro Valdes and not
Ruben Sierra would be the likely player promoted from Triple-A
Oklahoma. Still, it wouldn't be surprising if the Rangers need
Sierra, their one-time superstar, who is making an impressive
comeback with the Redhawks.
</P>
<P>
   That said, it seems inexorable that changes are coming to the
Rangers in the next few weeks, even after the three-game sweep of
the Athletics. As much as Melvin and owner Tom Hicks keep saying
the team is not out of contention, it's no longer a question
whether the Rangers can compete].
</P>
<P>
   A wild-card playoff spot holds little lure for Hicks, who was
once the proud owner of Lord Stanley's tankard and lustily dreams
of Bud Selig handing over a World Series trophy. Hicks knows that
even if the Rangers squeak through to win the wild card or the
American League West, the playoffs are likely going to result in
the same frustration experienced in all three of the Rangers'
playoff appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, it has to be really driving Hicks nuts that
his team has gone south the same year in which the Yankees have
done so as well. George Steinbrenner might throw some more money at
some of his pitching problems, but right now his team looks
eminently beatable.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks isn't interested in throwing more money at problems that
can't be fixed, the way Peter Angelos did in Baltimore. Angelos
went blindly searching for a World Series championship with a bunch
of thirtysomething relics and ended up driving his franchise in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks and Melvin know the Rangers are a wild-card team at best.
Even so, that's a fantasy not even worth pursuing, not when there
are glaring needs that must be met if this team ever hopes to win
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the Rangers are going to need another big bat. This
lineup drops off too quickly after Segui, and no team is going to
go far in the American League with Martinez and Curtis _ two nice
role players _ platooning in what should be the power-laden sixth
spot. Whatever happened to Mickey Tettleton? Dean Palmer? Todd
Zeile?
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will also have to take a hard look at their bullpen,
especially with Wetteland due to become a free agent, and another
starting pitcher will likely be needed if they don't hit the
complete trifecta on Doug Davis, Ryan Glynn and Matt Perisho.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin is getting ready to talk. He has Hicks' blessing. It
won't be a complete makeover. The idea is to put together a World
Series contender. Another Vosberg-for-Helling deal would be a
start.

   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ It's true. People will do almost anything
for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   It's no different when the jockeys walk through the winner's
circle after a race at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be 100 kids here on some days, and they can get
desperate,'' said Chuck Tynan, the assistant clerk of scales at
Lone Star who assists jockeys with autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, a grown man comes out here with a sign made,''
Tynan said. ``The sign read something like `Today is my daughter's
birthday, and she's sick and couldn't come out to the track.'
People use all sorts of tricks. And that guy, we went ahead and
gave him one.''
</P>
<P>
   What they gave him is different from any sports venue where
autographs are signed. Baseball players sign baseballs or bubble
gum cards. Golfers sign visors.
</P>
<P>
   But at the racetrack, jockeys sign goggles.
</P>
<P>
   Goggles? Clear-plastic goggles are used by a jockey every time
he rides a horse. He has to have them to protect his eyes from wind
generated when a horse is running 30 mph and faster and also from
the sand that gets kicked back when a jockey is behind other
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's probably a better idea to give away goggles to a
youngster than to give away a whip.
</P>
<P>
   While autograph seekers collect signatures before baseball
games, they line up at Lone Star after each race. After the jockey
has his picture taken on the winning horse, he dismounts and walks
over to ``weigh out'' to ensure for the racing stewards that his
weight plus the weight added to his saddle add up to the amount he
was assigned to carry.
</P>
<P>
   After he weighs out, Tynan gives the jockey a clean pair of
goggles to sign. It can be a challenge to write on a slick plastic
surface that's no more than 8 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy,'' jockey Roman Chapa said. ``You don't have
your whole arm to sit somewhere. It's not perfect, but it'll do for
these kids. They appreciate anything you can do for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the goggles are signed, they can be delivered in a number
of ways. Some jockeys give them to youngsters who are with a group
that's allowed to enter the winner's circle after a race. Some
jockeys throw them into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But that makes people scamper for them like a foul ball. Fingers
can get stepped on. Elbows scraped.
</P>
<P>
   So most jockeys walk along the railing next to the winner's
circle and find someone to hand them to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants them,'' Chapa said. ``But I like handing them
to the little girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a jockey gives his own goggles away. But a more
custom-fit pair of goggles _ some of them are tinted for protection
from the sun _ can cost $6.
</P>
<P>
   So Lone Star provides a generic pair of goggles for jockeys to
sign and give away. Steve Sexton, general manager at the track,
said Lone Star can purchase them for between $3 and $4. Sexton
estimates the track spends at least $4,000 a year on goggles. He
said the track writes it off as a marketing expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking for things where we can reach and touch
the public with,'' Sexton said. ``People remember things when they
were growing up as a kid. So hopefully this creates a fan for
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fact that the signatures come on a piece of equipment
that can't be found at a major sporting event, Sexton said there
are other things about the autograph session conducted between
races that make it unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball players or other pro athletes never sign an autograph
in the middle of the game,'' Sexton said. ``And here you're always
getting the winner.''

CLINTON BEGINS UPSTATE TOUR IN FAMILIAR SPOT, FOCUSING ON ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS spelling of ``Tompkins'' and ``Cortland'' in 11th graf)  
By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton returned Thursday to
an electronics plant that was the scene of an event during her
early days as a prospective Senate candidate last year. She talked
Thursday about reviving the economy in upstate New York and chose
this spot to begin a five-day tour throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton began her upstate campaign swing, her Republican
opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, was on the final legs of his trip. In a
meeting with about 100 workers at a Lockheed Martin electronics
plant and in speaking with reporters, she was quick to point out
the differences in her campaign tactics from those of Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got moderate talk on the trail and extreme rhetoric in
his mail,'' Clinton said. ``I just think it's hard to tell what he
means and where he is from day to day. I'm not going to respond to
his personal insults. I'm going to run a campaign on issues, not
insults.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Clinton reacted to a fund-raising letter sent to
voters this week by Lazio's campaign in which he attacked Clinton
and President Clinton for having ``embarrassed our country and
disgraced their powerful posts.'' Clinton, the letter states,
``covets power and control and thinks she should be dictating how
other people run their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has said he had not reviewed the fund-raising letter
before it was sent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking to reporters, said, ``It's hard for me to get
this straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week he was telling New Yorkers that he wasn't
responsible for his voting record,'' she said. ``And this week he's
telling us that he's not responsible for his fund-raising letters.
I think he ought to rename his bus. Instead of the Mainstream
Express, he ought to call it the Double-Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news briefing outside a senior housing apartment
building in Syracuse Thursday, Lazio said he still had not seen the
letter and he continued to decline to specify what the president
and Clinton had done to embarrass the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can make a big distinction between a solicitation
letter for funds among your supporters and communicating with
commercials,'' Lazio said, referring to television advertisements
by Clinton's campaign that he has characterized as attack ads.
</P>
<P>
   At the plant, where electronic controls are made, Clinton met
with managers, took a tour and experienced simulated flying in a
military aircraft. Meeting with employees, she answered questions
on topics like transportation in the Southern Tier region of the
state and federal spending on research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also attended a cookout with about 1,500 people in
Endicott, N.Y., sponsored by the Democratic Party organizations in
Broome, Tioga, Tompkins and Cortland counties. Her trip throughout
the region comes a year after she unofficially entered the race for
the U.S. Senate when she visited the farm of Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, whom she hopes to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, however, Clinton is a full-fledged candidate and
her tour across the state's western half is focused on economic
issues. She has produced a pamphlet that is being distributed to
voters discussing various ideas, including tax credits for
investments in new technology and making high-speed Internet access
more widely available.

<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ On the day in December when Laffit Pincay
Jr. broke Bill Shoemaker's world record for all-time number of
victories as a jockey, European rider Cash Asmussen was in Houston
for the Texas Champions Day racing card at Sam Houston Race Park.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Asmussen if he had watched satellite dish network
TVG and its live coverage, when cameras were isolated on Pincay's
rides leading up to the record-breaking race.
</P>
<P>
   It was powerful, insightful coverage because it showed how adept
Pincay was at getting a horse out of the starting gate, gathering
the horse's balance and immediately scanning the field in the first
moments of a race. It gave viewers an idea of what must go through
Pincay's mind as he starts judging if the race is setting up as he
thought it would before the race, when he looked at the past
performances of his horse respective to the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   It gave you an idea that the guy breaking the record, this guy
who everyone thought was washed up two or three years ago, was
still pretty darn good and deserving of ``Shoe's'' record. He's
still a top jockey, not a guy who has hung around long enough to
break a record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time someone's about to break a record,'' Asmussen said,
``that person gets more attention, and you can get a chance to see
how talented that person is and why he's breaking that record in
the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't always require setting a record to instruct us
about someone's talent. Sometimes talent becomes apparent when
other competitors leave the scene.
</P>
<P>
   You see the talent, and it becomes apparent: What were we
thinking about when we were overlooking these guys a few weeks ago?
</P>
<P>
   That's what has been happening the past two weeks at Lone Star
Park at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   When leading jockey Donnie Meche had to take off mounts because
of his injured shoulder, and when a handful of jockeys moved to
Louisiana Downs when that track opened two weeks ago, things looked
pretty bleak at Lone Star. This looked like a watered-down jockey
colony.
</P>
<P>
   But it has allowed us to see what we shouldn't have been
missing. Now, we can't help but see that Curt Bourque and Ronald
Ardoin really should be considered among the top jockeys in this
region.
</P>
<P>
   While Ardoin has been in that top-jock consideration for a
generation of horseplayers who made the trip east on Interstate 20
to Louisiana Downs, he has sort of suffered from the same thing
that afflicted Pincay in recent years. He has been shuffled to the
side to a degree, while a collection of younger riders have hit
this circuit.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who paid attention to a race last week when Ardoin
lost the lead on a horse named Yoyoyo, then regained it in deep
stretch and won, knows that Ardoin can still ride. Yoyoyo was like
a real yo-yo, and Ardoin was pulling the right string.
</P>
<P>
   He had the lead, then went back in second. Horses are usually
done at that point, but Ardoin sensed his horse wasn't responding
to the whip. So he put away the whip and flipped the reins
underneath Yoyoyo's cheek. That, his horse liked.
</P>
<P>
   Race over. Yoyoyo comes back and wins, and Ardoin brushes some
color to an otherwise mundane midweek racing program.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque hasn't quite enjoyed the same profile that Ardoin has
earned. But his rides in two of the three biggest stakes races at
Lone Star last week were as good as anyone will find.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he might have been on the best horses, though neither was
favored. But Bourque didn't get them beat. He put them in the
perfect position to win.
</P>
<P>
   He hugged the rail on Gran Mujer and was able to charge ahead on
the inside when the front-runners eased outside in the $100,000
Sundance Stakes. He had another ground-saving trip on Watch in the
$150,000 Walmac Lone Star Oaks and absolutely pushed and drove her
to win while world-class jockey Yutaka Take was wide and running
late on favored Islay Mist.
</P>
<P>
   There's no isolation camera at Lone Star, but your actions are
always isolated when you win. Ardoin and Bourque made the most of
their time in the spotlight.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Call it the Sugar Ray Leonard Syndrome.
Coaches and athletes find that the ease of retirement is a poor
replacement for the adrenaline surge of competition. Soon after
they quit, they are lured back to the sports spotlight like moths
to the flame.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you remember Bill McCartney. Coached at Colorado. Took
over a woebegone program in 1982, coached the Buffaloes for 13
seasons, won a share of the national championship in 1990. After
the 1994 season, McCartney retired from coaching. And he's still
retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaching college football was intoxicating,'' McCartney said.
``I wanted to be a coach since I was 7 years old. But I'm no longer
under its lure. When you're part of \Rcoaching a team\S, it seems
like it's the most important thing. In stepping out of it, I don't
feel that way anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   A devout Christian, in 1990 McCartney formed Promise Keepers,
which describes itself as ``a Christ-centered ministry dedicated to
uniting men through vital relationships to become godly influences
in their world.'' PK will have one of its national meetings today
and tomorrow at Reunion Arena in Dallas. McCartney will address the
group tomorrow. His topic will be nobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good word for our times,'' McCartney said. ``I
think it should be defined as superior moral character. It means to
be willing-hearted, it means to be generous. I think it's a message
men need to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   PK is a nonprofit organization that has been rich in
controversy. Critics assail the group's stance against abortion and
say that its position on gays is homophobic, that PK is a male
supremacist movement backed by radical right-wing religious groups.
McCartney says those criticisms are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Two Big 12 Conference coaches _ Colorado's Gary Barnett and
Oklahoma State's Bob Simmons _ were assistant coaches on
McCartney's staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know Bill McCartney, he has a singleness of purpose in
the things he does,'' Barnett said. ``It doesn't surprise me that
he could walk away from coaching football. He willed Colorado to a
national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett left McCartney's staff in 1992 to take over at
Northwestern before returning to Colorado last season. When
McCartney left Colorado, Simmons was passed over for the job, so he
left for Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill shared with me the vision of Promise Keepers, and he's
helped me in my walk with the Lord,'' Simmons said. ``I'm not
surprised he walked away from college football. He has done what he
wanted to do, to bring men into the Lord's presence. Bill is
totally at peace and contented.''
</P>
<P>
   McCartney occasionally visits Barnett's practices in Boulder. As
the years pass, McCartney's name drifts further off the coaching
radar screen. And that's fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 60 years old and I'm over the hill,'' McCartney said.
``It's not that I have any less love for football. There are 27
million children who go to bed every night without a father in
their house. I can help, I can be part of solving that problem.
That to me is what's really important.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly UCLA
officials are miffed that Missouri has pulled out of a
home-and-home football series with the Bruins. UCLA was scheduled
to play at Missouri in 2001, with the 2002 game in Los Angeles.
Missouri officials said the games were scheduled more than 10 years
ago, before the school wound up in the Big 12 Conference. UCLA,
which believes it could lose $500,000 in potential television
revenue, is considering legal action. And, UCLA officials say they
will consider not playing Missouri in any sport. The schools are
scheduled to play in the 2001 John Wooden Classic.

RANGERS OWNER TAKES A TURN IN WRONG DIRECTION

<P>
   A funny thing happened on the way to Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of this bus _ an otherwise judicious fellow named
Hicks _ took a left turn and pointed the Rangers back toward
Oakland, Anaheim and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to a man who vacations in Alaska, this is nothing. In
Tom Hicks' world, a man can fish in any time zone.
</P>
<P>
   But gee whiz, Tom. The kids have homework. We newspapers have
deadlines. If the Rangers were ever to clinch a pennant in, say,
the Pacific Northwest, it would be grand if someone other than
Conan O'Brien and the late shift at Denny's were awake to see it.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? The Rangers were in the driver's seat, motoring
blithely toward realignment. Baseball commissioner Bud Selig was
quoted as saying that he owed the franchise one _ imagine that _ in
the form of a promise he once made to then-owner George W. Bush,
who at the time was also doing business as The First Son.
</P>
<P>
   Several oblique realignment proposals later, it appeared that
the worst the Rangers could end up is being co-Alpha dog in a
six-team American League Central. Annual visitation rights to
Houston were included.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad. The inequities of possibly being in baseball's only
six-team division were duly noted. We can do the math.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, we hear owner Hicks saying to hold everything.
Hicks has been saying that he likes the ``tradition'' of his guys
playing the Oaklands, the Anaheims and the Seattles. For
tradition's sake, he wants the Rangers to remain in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. Randy Johnson. Mark McGwire. Tony La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, what do you mean they're gone?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they're gone. Some traditions come and go _ like
ballparks. Rangers fans may have grown attached to seeing their
heroes battle Junior and McGwire. But how many hearts soar now when
John Halama and Olmedo Saenz come to town?
</P>
<P>
   Hicks told our paper's T.R. Sullivan the other day, ``... our
fans would like to see us play Seattle, Oakland and the Angels
rather than the Twins and the Royals.''
</P>
<P>
   They would? Says who?
</P>
<P>
   Those alleged blood-rival Athletics, young and brimming with
talent, attracted only 28,964 to The Ballpark for the series closer
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, lest the owner forget, were once division mates of
the same Twins and Royals that Hicks wants to shield the fans from.
Not all that long ago, those same two teams were the class of the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   In today's game, fans fill seats either to watch superstars play
or to revel in the excitement of a game of importance. If it's late
August or September and the game is important, let me suggest that
it doesn't matter whether the opponent is named the Angels or the
Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the aforementioned fan must first be awake. Which
brings us back to the original issue.
</P>
<P>
   With the planned unbalanced schedule, the Rangers would be
playing even more road games starting at 9 p.m. or later. Yes, the
true fans will watch. But in the long run, the fan base will suffer
because your young audience will be asleep.
</P>
<P>
   It seems elementary _ teams should try to play as many games as
possible in the same time zone where their fans live.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history might be telling owner Hicks that the Rangers can
handle this AL West. Three division titles in four years speak for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So who's to fear in the AL Central? Don't say the Cleveland
Indians. They're almost 10 games back.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there don't appear to be any more big spenders in the
Central division than in the West. So what's Hicks' big fear?
</P>
<P>
   If his most important objective is playing interleague games
against the Astros every year, someone needs to ask why. Mitch
Meluskey is fine, but I think I'd rather see Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   A Rangers-Astros rivalry would attract initial curiosity, but it
will never be like the Mets-Yankees or Cubs-White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if that's the trade-off _ the Rangers staying in the AL
West, just for the privilege of playing the Astros each year _ that
doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Nor good business sense, at any hour of the night.
</P>

PROTESTORS TARGETS WILL BE VARIED

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Threatening to shut downtown Los Angeles
businesses, banks and corporate offices during the Democratic
National Convention, protest organizers said Thursday they will
flood the streets daily with as many as 50,000 demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters said they plan to target businesses -- not delegates
or the convention -- with daily rallies, marches and disruptions
between Aug. 14 and Aug. 17. And they said they refuse to be
confined to a designated protest area outside Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is not to shut down the convention,'' said organizer
Lisa Fithian of Echo Park, during a news conference in Washington,
D.C. ``We want to face and confront the institutions that oppress
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, organizers said, they will target the World Trade
Center, banks and corporate offices downtown with a ``March Against
the World Trade Organization and Corporate Globalization''
beginning at Pershing Square at 2 p.m. Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry if some people are inconvenienced, but the issues
we are raising inconvenience people around the world every day of
their lives,'' Fithian said.
</P>
<P>
   Business and building owners said they are contemplating whether
to close during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned for our businesses, we're concerned for the
safety of our employees, we are concerned for the safety of
peaceable protesters,'' said Hilary Norton Orozco, director of
legislative affairs for the Central City Association, which
represents downtown businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to board up, we want to be open for business and
trust people when they say they are going to act peaceably,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wells Fargo Bank skyscraper, spokeswoman Mary Trigg said
the bank has been involved with security planning for the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with the LAPD and other security people with
the convention to make sure that our property in any of the
affected areas, our employees and our customers and clients are all
going to be fine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police said they have 2,000 officers ready to
aggressively protect businesses, property and lives with a much
stronger show of force than displayed during the Lakers
championship riots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If individuals are unlawful and intent on being arrested, we
have the plans and resources to accommodate them -- all of them,''
said Cmdr. David Kalish, the department's top spokesman. ``It is an
important issue to the Police Department and every effort will be
made to protect individuals and their businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD has canceled all vacations, extended shifts and made
arrangements to call in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
and 42 other police agencies from throughout the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers said they expect 50,000 protesters
representing more than 100 groups -- and myriad causes -- to
descend on Los Angeles. The organizers said they plan similar
actions in Philadelphia from July 31 to Aug. 3, during the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   For Los Angeles, protesters said they hope to cause widespread
traffic tie-ups downtown, cutting off access for workers, employers
and merchants.
</P>
<P>
   The April protests in Washington against the World Trade
Organization and World Bank spanned four days and eventually led
police to seal off 20 square blocks of the downtown area. While
largely peaceful, the protesters staged hit-and-run marches and
rallies at a number of sites, forcing police to deploy their forces
over a wide area.
</P>
<P>
   They closed dozens of major streets and several subway stations.
Many offices and retail stores in the affected area lost business
or elected to close during the protests.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, two planned events include a 5 p.m. ``March for
our Lives'' from downtown to Staples Center on Aug. 14, and a
candlelight vigil outside the center the evening of Aug. 17, when
Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to make his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   Fithian said the protesters -- including many who participated
in December's violent demonstrations in Seattle against the World
Trade Organization and an April WTO protest in Washington, she said
-- are also planning an Aug. 15 march and rally in the Garment
District to urge better working conditions and to urge total
amnesty for all undocumented aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators would ``use creative ways'' to evade police lines
and other restrictions, Fithian said, declining to provide more
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our country and these are our streets,'' Fithian said.
``We're going to get our message out and rally support for our
issues with or without permits.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizers said they would go beyond the sanctioned protest
area to take their messages to the city's streets at will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protest pen is like a prison and none of us intend to go
there,''said Margaret Prescod of Los Angeles, one of the lead
organizers of four days of demonstrations being billed as ``The
Democratic Intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said their protests would be peaceful. ``The only
violence we're worried about is police violence,'' Prescod said.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters represent an array of causes and concerns,
including gay and lesbian rights, racism, universal health care
coverage, improved services and benefits for welfare recipients,
assistance for the homeless, globalization of the economy,
abolition of the death penalty, immigrant rights, campaign finance
reform and disbandment of the nation's military.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   ``William Wegman: Fashion Photographers''
</P>
<P>
   (Abrams, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   Wegman's dogs, those long-suffering Weimaraners, are everywhere
these days. We would not be shocked to see them dancing to Gershwin
in the next Gap commercial. Why aren't we tired of them? There's
something fascinating about Wegman's anthropomorphic photographs,
and something so woefully game about the animals that they don't
inspire backlash even as they teeter on the brink of saturation.
Here the dogs are fashion models, posing in shoes by Yves Saint
Laurent (a bad fit), a fur coat by Isaac Mizrahi, tuxedos by
Valentino, shirts by Armani. We wonder: Do they really sit
willingly like that in wigs and sunglasses? Or does Wegman
tyrannize them somehow, forcing them to pose? Either way, they are
oddly beautiful as they solicit our interest and affection. ``My
Weimaraners are perfect fashion models,'' Wegman says. ``Their
elegant slinky forms are covered in gray, and gray, everyone knows,
goes with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run: Hatching the Movie''
</P>
<P>
   By Brian Sibley
</P>
<P>
   (Abrams, $35)
</P>
<P>
   We are sick of these chickens already, no matter how good the
movie is. We have a close association with an 8-year-old, however,
and we observed that this book distracted him from the Pokimon
scourge for an entire afternoon. The result: We have built a shrine
to Brian Sibley in our house and are lighting candles daily in his
name. Actually, we enjoyed the book ourselves, because it's about
the extraordinary and exhaustive animation that went into creating
a feature-length film starring a bunch of clay birds. (Sibley also
addresses such questions as, ``How many fluffles are on Bunty's
bottom?'' The answer: 3,077, and aren't they grand?) There are lots
of behind-the-scenes photographs and stories about the making of
the movie, as well as sketches, storyboards, a foreword by Mel
Gibson and a cameo appearance by Wallace and Gromit. And, oh yes,
there are chickens everywhere, and they translate very well to the
page.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Better Angel''
</P>
<P>
   By Roy Morris Jr.
</P>
<P>
   (Oxford, $25)
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, 1862, Walt Whitman saw the name of his brother,
George, in a newspaper list of men recently wounded in the Civil
War. George had been encamped at Fredericksburg, Va. Within an hour
Whitman had packed up and left New York, determined to find his
brother, dead or alive. It was, says Morris, the beginning of the
rest of Walt Whitman's life, for although he would find George with
only minor wounds, there were plenty of soldiers whose luck had not
held up so well. Whitman became obsessed with them. Over the
ensuing months, he devoted himself to the aftermath of battles,
visiting tens of thousands of maimed and broken men who filled
military hospitals and convalescent camps. He brought them gifts,
friendship and his own exuberance. This is the flattering story of
Whitman's effect on those soldiers and theirs on him and his work.
``If he was not literally an angel,'' writes Morris, ``he was more
than a passable substitute.''

   PHOENIX -- Jim Pederson called it a ``great day for Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Others called it a great day for Pederson.
</P>
<P>
   Pederson almost single-handedly financed an initiative drive to
change the way Arizona draws its legislative districts, and he
stood triumphantly in front of a wall of boxes carrying 250,000
petition signatures to place the issue on the Nov.7 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Arizona politics, 2000-style, where deep-pocketed
individuals such as Pederson, grass-roots groups that have been
ignored by the state Legislature and legislators themselves have
turned over the responsibility to voters via the initiative
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have certainly put a lot of money into this, but that's
only part of the issue,'' said Pederson, a developer from Casa
Grande and chairman of the Citizens Independent Redistricting
Commission. ``It was something I could do. I've lived in the state
my whole life, and I don't like the direction our representative
democracy is moving. I thought that this one issue probably meant
more to the state of Arizona, to our kids, than any other.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of three other citizens initiatives dropped off hundreds
of thousands of petition signatures before Thursday's deadline,
hoping to join one of the most crowded ballots in state history.
</P>
<P>
   The general election ballot already lists 10 questions put on by
lawmakers and citizens groups. Three others await verification of
signatures and four more were filed Thursday. Added Thursday were
initiatives on using the state's share of the $3.2billion
nationwide tobacco settlement for health care, ridding Arizona of
its state income tax, taking away the job of drawing legislative
voting districts from lawmakers and allowing phone giant USWest to
set its own rates in areas where it has no competition.
</P>
<P>
   If those four make it, along with all the others, the ballot
will have 17 questions, two short of an all-time high of 19 reached
in both 1980 and 1950.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the ballot, an initiative to change state law
requires 101,762 valid signatures. An initiative to amend the state
Constitution needs 152,643. Initiative backers must deliver far
more than the minimum to have any chance at the ballot, state
Elections Director Jessica Funkhouser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a higher and higher percentage of invalid
signatures because more and more drives are using paid petition
circulators,'' Funkhouser said.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, a ``buffer zone'' of 25percent above the minimum
was fine; but now, initiative backers must have up to 50percent
more than the minimum or face sweating out the state's monthlong
verification process.
</P>
<P>
   The Healthy Arizona II initiative delivered 172,000 signatures.
The initiative would use a share of Arizona's tobacco windfall to
expand the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System to cover all
people under the federal poverty line of $16,500 for a family of
four. The initiative would triple the income cap to be eligible,
providing coverage for more than 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years is too long to wait for health insurance,'' said
Dr. Eve Shapiro, chairwoman of Healthy Arizona II. Healthy Arizona
passed overwhelmingly in 1996, but never was funded by the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   It faces stiff competition from a hospital-backed initiative to
spend tobacco money for insurance and other health programs for
40,000 working poor with children. The other initiative would
change the state Constitution to create a five-person, politically
neutral team to redraw Arizona's legislative districts. The job now
lies with incumbent legislators who routinely give one side or the
other such a lopsided advantage that opposing parties often don't
even field challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will create more competitive districts where you have
strong candidates fighting each other over ideas,'' said Arizona
Attorney General Janet Napolitano, who supports the initiative.
``Will it work or be perfect? Who knows? But it's a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate president, Senate minority leader, speaker of the
House and House minority leader each would appoint one member of
the redistricting committee. The leaders then would choose the
fifth member, who could not be a member of either political party.

K.D. LANG'S `INVINCIBLE SUMMER,' ROMANCE AND RETRO POP 
</HEADLINE>
 WEEK-NYT   By   JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While there are countless Christmas albums, it took K.D. Lang to
follow through on the old Beach Boys and build a theme album for
Warner Brothers around the opposite season: summertime. It's
justification enough for her to look again at ``the beauty of
desire,'' this time with blissful optimism. For Lang, summer is
time for heady new romance and glimmers of retro pop. Writing with
new collaborators, she harks back to 1960s styles without turning
archival.
</P>
<P>
   She's bubbly over a ``Summerfling,'' surrounded with vocal
harmonies and nonsense syllables; she's elated amid the
near-psychedelic funk of ``It's Happening With You'' and the
orchestrated folk-rock of ``Extraordinary Thing.'' She finds
contemplative rapture in ``Love's Great Ocean'' and ``When We
Collide.''
</P>
<P>
   Now and then she recognizes that things might not turn out, but
for the moment _ a moment she sustains through the album _ it's too
sunny for any second thoughts.  &QR;

AMISTAD REPLICA DEPARTS; PIER PROBLEMS CITED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Conn.)  By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Amistad freedom schooner, a reproduction of a
historic ship on which slaves rebelled, pulled out of New York
Harbor early Thursday morning to the disappointment of thousands of
visitors who showed up at a pier off Battery Park to see the
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The ship left because the pier where it was supposed to moor,
which is under construction, did not have adequate bumpers and
safety guards to prevent the 136-ton ship from banging repeatedly
against it, said Will H. Mebane, vice president of Amistad America,
the owner and operator of the vessel. The crew was afraid the ship
would be damaged if it remained there any longer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Amistad America had surveyed the site before the ship
set sail, Mebane said he did not expect the docking problems that
would arise when 20,000 boats entered harbor for OpSail, creating
enormous waves.
</P>
<P>
   But Annie Bliss, director of design for Pier A Operations, which
runs the pier, said she had warned the Amistad crew that the waters
were turbulent. She added that most large ships traveled with their
own system of safety guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rough water on that side,'' she said. ``But I would say
the inexperience of the Amistad crew working together was not
helpful to the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mebane said that with only one exception, every member of
the nine-member crew had extensive sailing experience, many with
similar schooners, and that the captain, Bill Pinkney, had
circumnavigated the globe. He said the crew had been working
together since April, and added, ``I'm not sure how that impacts
whether or not there's an appropriate dock that's adequate to
protect our vessel.''

   The Amistad is a reproduction of the vessel on which 53
Africans, destined for a life of slavery on a Cuban plantation,
staged a violent revolt against their captors in 1839. The new ship
made its maiden voyage on Monday, when it left Mystic, Conn., where
it was built, to join Operation Sail 2000 in New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Mebane said tens of thousands of sightseers visited the ship on
Tuesday, although they were not allowed to board because there was
a private, $100-per-person event on the pier that evening.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the vessel sailed to the Harlem piers, where the
Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and Amistad America
held a special event, with presentations by the poet Maya Angelou
and former Mayor David Dinkins of New York. About 1,000 people
attended the event, Mebane said, and 600 of them boarded the
Amistad.
</P>
<P>
   Public viewing of the Amistad was to resume at Pier A Thursday
morning, but after three days of working around the clock, fighting
the currents to create makeshift bumpers to bolster the ship
against crashing waves, the crew wearily set sail for Mystic, where
the ship will be checked for damage.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of visitors were disheartened when they arrived at
Pier A Thursday to see the ship. ``How annoying,'' said Leonard R.
Pace, 55, a taxi driver from the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn,
when he arrived in front of a shuttered gate at the end of West
Street, hoping to get a glimpse of the ship and perhaps meet its
captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to meet Capt. Pinkney,'' he said, ``or if not
that, at least get pictures to show the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amistad will participate in Operation Sail 2000 in Mystic
beginning Wednesday and will then sail to New Haven for public
viewing there on July 15.

 L.A. JUDGE CHARGED WITH LYING ABOUT HIS PAST  &HT;     By MICHAEL TAYLOR 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To hear Judge Patrick Couwenberg tell it, his life before
donning the black robes was a collage of combat heroism and secret
CIA missions, but now the state's judicial watchdog agency says
Couwenberg lied about being a Vietnam war veteran and about many
other events in his background.
</P>
<P>
   In a seven-page ``notice of formal proceedings,'' the state
Commission on Judicial Performance charged the Los Angeles Superior
Court judge with ``providing false information regarding his
background and qualifications'' when he applied to be a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Couwenberg, 55, faces a hearing before three special masters
appointed by the state Supreme Court. After receiving the special
masters' report, the commission can remove Couwenberg from the
bench or ``censure, publicly admonish, or privately discipline''
him.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, it was clear that the judicial watchdogs are not happy
with Couwenberg's alleged flights of fancy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Couwenberg said he was awarded a Purple Heart for
injuries received while he was an Army corporal in Vietnam and that
he still has shrapnel buried in his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were never in the Army, in Vietnam or otherwise,'' the
commission's chairman, Court of Appeal Justice Daniel Hanlon wrote
in the commission's complaint on Wednesday. ``You were in the Navy
reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's investigation of Couwenberg began nearly two
years ago. In January, while the probe was still in its informal
stage, Couwenberg gave a sworn statement to the commission.
</P>
<P>
   In that statement, the charges say, Couwenberg ``testified
falsely that (he) had participated in a covert CIA operation in
Southeast Asia between June 1968 and December 1969,'' and that in
1984 he ``made a delivery of funds or documents for the CIA'' to
someone in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Hanlon also charged that Couwenberg lied about the year he
received his law degree from the University of La Verne Law School.
Hanlon mentioned that Couwenberg was admitted to the state bar in
1976, after he ``failed the California bar examination five times''
between 1973 and 1976. Couwenberg also falsely claimed that he
worked for the prestigious Los Angeles law firm Gibson Dunn &AMP;
Crutcher.
</P>
<P>
   Couwenberg referred calls to his attorney, Edward George, who
said, ``What we have here is a series of nonintentional
misrepresentations. Some of these things he made some mistakes on,
sure, but we think we can explain them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Couwenberg is a former Los Angeles County prosecutor who
was appointed to the bench in April 1997 by former Gov. Pete
Wilson. George said he could not go into specifics about
Couwenberg's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those specifics dealt with Couwenberg's penchant for
exaggerating his military career and were parenthetically rebutted
by Hanlon in the charge sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Couwenberg, for example, told some colleagues that he went to
Vietnam when he turned 18, that he had a master's degree in
psychology and that he had been late to court one day ``because of
a medical appointment for shrapnel in (the) groin.'' Hanlon said
Couwenberg had never been anywhere near Vietnam and had never been
injured in combat and had no master's degrees in anything.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the shrapnel wound, Couwenberg testified that he got
it in Laos, not Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Couwenberg isn't the only judge to make claims of combat
heroism. In Illinois, Circuit Judge Michael F. O'Brien told
colleagues that he had not one but two Medals of Honor for valorous
Navy service off the coast of Lebanon in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, faced with the choice of prosecution or resigning from
the bench, O'Brien chose to quit his judgeship and go into private
practice.

HERSHISER CALLS IT QUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Not only did Orel Hershiser's stay with the Los
Angaeles Dodgers end after an eight-run second inning June 26, his
career also ended.
</P>
<P>
   After contemplating his future for more than a week, Hershiser
announced his retirement Thursday during a conference call that was
hurriedly put together after word of a since-canceled Friday press
conference leaked out.
</P>
<P>
   What came out of a hectic day in which a Dodgers legend retired
was that Hershiser will remain affiliated with the team. He will do
a little of everything for the next three months, including
scouting and possibly helping the on-field talent of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, 41, cleared release waivers last Friday and had
offers from other teams, but decided to end his 17-year playing
career.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to retire, Hershiser, who was 204-150 with a Cy
Young Award and World Series MVP to his credit, went back to a
meeting he had in 1988 with his attorney and close friend, Robert
Fraley, who last year died with golfer Payne Stewart in a plane
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser said he listed five criteria for knowing when to
retire, which was part of his statement Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   ``One, Jamie (his wife) and I are still in love,'' Hershiser
said in reading the statement. ``Two, I know and love my two boys.
Three, My reputation is intact. Four, I am financially secure.
Five, God is still at the center of my life. I am humbly thankful
to say these criteria have been met.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will honor the right-hander during ``Orel Hershiser
Day'' later this season, but a date is yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   It's a ceremony Dodgers managing general partner and CEO Bob
Daly believes in whole-heartedly, especially given the way
retirement day turned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think this is the way this should have been done, but
we have no other choice but to go down this road, but I must say I
am extremely upset and I will apologize to (Hershiser),'' Daly
said. ``This is not the way a man of his stature, who's been a
member of the Dodger organization, this is not the way it should be
done, but unfortunately I have no other choice because it's been
leaked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser said he wanted to work with the organization for the
next few months to earn the remainder of the $2.5 million he was
guaranteed when he signed a deal in the offseason. Daly said
Hershiser would have a place in the organization after the season,
but Hershiser wouldn't commit to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked about anything in the future at all,''
Hershiser said. ``This is not something that I'm preparing for - a
specific job or anything. This is really just kind of an informal
apprenticeship for me to be able to gather knowledge. The Dodgers
are giving me access to the organization and I'm giving the Dodgers
access to me. This is very mutual, and I don't think you need to
read anything into this or where it's headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Before moving to the front office for good, Hershiser could
become either a coach or manager. If the Dodgers falter during the
second half of the season and the coaching staff changes, Hershiser
would be the front-runner to be pitching coach next season, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   This season didn't turn into the triumphant return many hoped it
would be. Despite an awesome spring training, Hershiser faltered in
every area with the Dodgers. Starting didn't work, pitching out of
the bullpen was a fiasco and even a minor-league stint did nothing
for him to return to form.
</P>
<P>
   While the glory days of 1988 were never a serious notion,
Hershiser going 1-5 with a 13.14 ERA wasn't expected. But the
Dodgers plan to teach Hershiser the daily operations of the club
from the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous competitor and he did so much for the
Dodgers,'' Dodgers senior vice president and former manager Tom
Lasorda said. ``He was a tremendous role model for the ballclub. No
matter where he went he exemplified what the Dodgers represented. I
think this announcement is what he should have done. He's done a
great job his entire career, and he's had a wonderful career and
now it's time for him to start looking in a different direction.''

TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALLGAMES   (BY SUBWAY, CAR OR CANOE) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``It's a subway series _ you gotta take the train,''
Tom Milan was saying with such an adamant certainty that his
buddies at the bar just had to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you don't,'' said one of them, Jerry Beyrer, putting his
beer momentarily aside. ``You don't take the train at all. You get
a nylon jacket, print `security' in orange on the back and you
sneak on the team bus. That's what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Manny Feliu, sitting next to Beyrer at the Yankee Tavern
Wednesday night, saw it even differently. ``You stay at home,'' he
said, swirling his gin with quiet authority. ``You click the remote
from station to station, then you relax. Trust me, it's the
quickest trip you'll ever take.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was some of the chatter among the city's baseball fans this
week as they sought to unravel a truly unusual sports conundrum.
With the Mets and Yankees poised to play an exceedingly rare
split-park doubleheader Saturday, how much chaos would ensue as
legions of fans (not to mention two entire Major League ball clubs)
traveled between the two games, from Shea Stadium in northern
Queens to Yankee Stadium in the South Bronx?
</P>
<P>
   The games on Saturday _ the first at Shea at 1:15 p.m., the
second at Yankee Stadium at 8:05 p.m. _ promise to be a movable
feast of baseball. They also promise to be part sports novelty,
part transit brain-teaser and, of course, an all-out example of New
York City excess as police escorts accompany both teams along what
is likely to be the chosen route: down the Grand Central Parkway,
over the Triborough Bridge and up the Major Deegan Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   The split-park two-fer, the result of a rain cancellation at
Yankee Stadium on June 11, also brings with it a host of logistical
headaches. Subway motormen will have to brace themselves for beery
cheering and perhaps some nastiness among desegregated fans. The
fans will have to manage some quick commuting calculus, faced with
the choices of strap-hanging, driving or canoeing through Flushing
Bay past Rikers Island to get from park to park.
</P>
<P>
   Even Charlie Samuels, the Mets' equipment manager, has
acknowledged having a minor crisis to avert: he and his staff must
wash and dry a roster's worth of dirty underwear in the interlude
between the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in years to come, to look back and say, yeah, in the
year 2000 we had a day in which we played two games in two separate
parks, it might be something to talk about,'' said Al Leiter, one
of the Mets' starting pitchers, sounding decidedly unconvinced.
``But Saturday, for the most part, guys are going to view it as an
inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time that two big league ball clubs played a day game
in one park then decamped for a later game in another was on Sept.
7, 1903, when the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Superbas (later
to become the Dodgers) faced off twice, winning one game each. The
first game was played before 9,300 fans in Washington Park in
Brooklyn, which predated Ebbets Field; the second was played before
a crowd of more than 23,000 at the Polo Grounds in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   While there were no reports in the newspapers of the day on how
the teams and their retinues traveled from Brooklyn to Manhattan,
one thing is sure: They did not ride the subway or cross the
Triborough Bridge. Neither existed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the possibility of an entire baseball stadium _
even a third of a baseball stadium _ picking up their plastic cups
and felt pennants and riding the rails in an interborough swarm to
yet another baseball stadium, city transit officials have added
seven subway trains to each of the three lines that are expected to
be hit: the 7, the D and the 4.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Pettinato, a conductor on the 7 line, had a dire
prediction about what would happen on the subways between games.
``As soon as the Mets fan hit the Bronx,'' he said, ``the Yankee
fans are going to set them on fire. They're going drop some
gasoline on them and light a match.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees manager, said he, at least, was
unconcerned about the traffic. ``That's why we have a police
escort,'' he said. ``We can just have all the fans follow us and
we'll E-ZPass them through.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The authorities have taken the situation seriously. The police
said that each team had been escorted through the city separately
in the past but that they had never received such treatment on the
same day.
</P>
<P>
   One potential kink, given baseball's inherently lax attitude
toward time, is what happens if the first game at Shea runs into
extra innings? Would the teams wind up on the road together,
traveling in a single Bronx-bound convoy?
</P>
<P>
   Rich Levin, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, said he was
confident that there was enough time between the games.
``Obviously, the record is 26 innings, and if it goes 26 innings we
might be in trouble,'' he said. ``But we're expecting everything to
be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on an unscientific survey (asking around on the Yankees
and Mets Internet bulletin boards), most fans lucky enough to have
tickets to both games seem to be leaning toward the subway as their
mode of transportation. The 7 train from Flushing to Grand Central.
Switch. Head over to the 4 train to the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, the Yankee Tavern was still filled with hot debate
about the transit problem Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going to be doing the dumbest thing they can, like
riding a bike,'' said Feliu, who once more advocated staying home.
``We all know what New Yorkers are like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you could probably catch a good fight or two on the
train,'' Milan offered.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Joe Bastone, the owner of the bar, chimed in.
``You know what I would do if I was going,'' he said. ``Park the
car at Yankee Stadium. Take the train over to Shea. Then come back
to the Bronx by train. And then drive home.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, the pub fell into silence. It looked as if the
answer had finally been found. But then the barmaid, Natalie
Grigas, had to chip in with her two cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was me,'' she said, polishing a pint glass with a rag.
``I'd hitchhike.''

QUACKENBUSH AIDES QUIT, PART OF INSURANCE
DEPARTMENT  RESTRUCTURING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Moving swiftly to distance the Department of
Insurance from the scandal surrounding Insurance Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush, the department's new caretaker accepted the
resignations Thursday of six top deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Kelso, who was named interim chief deputy Wednesday, said
the move is part of the department's restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is simply to establish new leadership and to keep the
department fulfilling its important role in protecting and serving
consumers and regulating the insurance industry,'' said Kelso, who
will become acting commissioner Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush announced his resignation last week to avoid almost
certain impeachment by the Legislature. Lawmakers were
investigating Quackenbush's creation and use of a nonprofit
foundation financed by his department's settlements with insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Kelso said in a statement that the decision to accept the
resignations ``does not reflect any judgment by me or the
department on their past years of service.''
</P>
<P>
   But the removal of Quackenbush's executive staff was widely
expected after his top aides were repeatedly interrogated by
legislative investigators, who said they often found their
testimony to be questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oversight investigation raised a number of troubling
issues involving the leadership of the department,'' said
Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento. ``I think a fresh
start for the department is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's resignations came from six of the department's 12
deputies and include those most directly involved in the
questionable foundations.
</P>
<P>
   A department spokesman said he did not know the effective dates
of the resignations or whether the aides would seek to move to
different civil service jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear if any other staff members will leave the
department under the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have faith in Mr. Kelso's judgment and his ability to
determine who should remain on the executive staff,'' Steinberg
said. ``For those not involved in any aspect of what happened,
there does not seem to be a reason to start anew.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff members who resigned Thursday are Michael Kelley,
chief deputy commissioner; Brian Soublet, chief counsel; Jim Dong,
deputy commissioner for administration; Steve Suchil, deputy
commissioner for research and special projects; Mark Lowder, deputy
commissioner for enforcement; and David Langenbacher, deputy
commissioner for consumer affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Kelso also named Deputy Attorney General Steven Green as the
acting chief counsel for the department.
</P>
<P>
   Kelso, a law professor at Sacramento's McGeorge School of Law,
was recommended to take over as a caretaker by the attorney
general's office. He will hold the position until Gov. Gray Davis
appoints a successor. That person, who must be confirmed by the
Legislature, will hold the office until Quackenbush's term ends in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said last week that he hopes to nominate a new
commissioner in the next month. He said he will look for someone
who is not political.
</P>
<P>
   Kelso has said he will try to put off most policy decisions
until a permanent successor is in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In initiating the restructuring of the department, I have
taken the first step in the transition to a permanent insurance
commissioner and a new department leadership that will be appointed
by Gov. Davis in due course,'' Kelso said.

COLUMN: FOR HUNTER-GATHERERS, LOVE IS A CHEMICAL THING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)  By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When trying to explain why his affections had shifted
from his wife to another woman, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani told a news
conference, ``The fact that we've grown independent, we've grown
more separate over the years _ who knows why those things happen?''
If he really wants an answer, he might enroll in Helen Fisher's
experiment. She's ready to scan his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, an anthropologist at Rutgers University, has been trying
to find out why people fall in and out of love by putting
romantically infatuated New Yorkers into a magnetic resonance
imaging machine. Working with scientists at Albert Einstein Medical
College and the State University of New York at Stony Brook, she is
analyzing which parts of the brain are activated by thoughts of the
beloved.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is testing a grand unified theory of love that she began
developing after noticing a pattern in divorce statistics from
around the world: in all types of societies, the peak time for a
couple to divorce tends to be in the fourth year of the
relationship. Fisher believes the cycle is the remnant of our
ancestors' breeding season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among hunter-gatherers,'' she said, ``it's my gess that a
male and female had to stay together at least until the child was
walking and weaned and could be cared for by others. So the human
brain evolved with the circuitry to promote pair-bonding for at
least four years. It's like robins in Central Park who are
programmed to stay together for one breeding season.''
</P>
<P>
   The human brain promotes what Fisher identifies as three
distinct aspects of love: lust, attraction and attachment. Lust is
triggered by testosterone and gives you the initial impetus to find
a partner. Then comes attraction, the romantic infatuation that
Fisher attributes partly to low levels of serotonin, the brain
chemical associated with Prozac and feelings of well-being.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting infatuated New Yorkers for her experiment, Fisher
was looking especially for those in the throes of what
psychologists call ``intrusive thinking,'' and what songwriters
call ``can't stop thinkin' 'bout my baby.'' Intrusive thinking
about your mate, like obsessive-compulsive disorders, has been
linked to low levels of serotonin.
</P>
<P>
   Other commonly reported symptoms of romantic love are euphoria,
hyperactivity, loss of appetite and sleeplessness. Fisher believes
they're triggered by high levels of dopamine and norepinephrine _
natural stimulants activated by drugs like cocaine and
amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love being in love because it's a chemical high,''
Fisher said. ``But the high often ends after about a year, probably
because the brain produces less of the chemicals or the receptor
sites become dulled. Romantic love wears off _ as it should, or
we'd all die of sexual exhaustion. It evolved so you could
distinguish between potential mating partners and conserve your
mating energy by focusing on just one.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time your energy has produced a child, your brain has
moved on to the next phase, attachment, which produces feelings of
security, comfort and spiritual union with a long-term partner.
Fisher believes it is triggered by higher levels of vasopressin and
oxytocin, which have been demonstrated to trigger attachment in
animals. Attachment is a more durable emotion than lust or
infatuation, but it too can wane _ or eventually be overridden by
other emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rub is that these different systems in the brain aren't
always very well connected,'' Fisher said. ``You can feel deep
attachment for one individual while you feel romantic love for
someone else while you feel lust for a stranger in a magazine. You
might get all three together when you're walking up the aisle to be
married, but the brain isn't built to keep it that way forever.
We're built to be restless in long-term relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   When divorce does come, it involves more than just the
emotion-inducing chemicals in the brain. Humans also evolved with a
prefrontal cortex capable of rationally overriding those
extramarital temptations. The prospect, say, of winning a U.S.
Senate seat may be enough to keep a certain man _ or a certain
woman _ in a marriage when the chemicals are no longer flowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prefrontal cortex is constantly calculating the
perquisites and deficits of the relationship,'' Fisher said. ``We
have only so much mating energy, and we have to decide how to spend
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani fits the stereotype for the high-profile divorce in New
York: the alpha male dumping his wife after he gains power or
money. But most divorces are actually instigated by women, for
reasons that are only just becoming apparent to researchers. More
on that next week.

DISCIPLINE FIGURES PROMPT CALL TO IMPROVE SCHOOL BEHAVIOR
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ It is a statistic that troubles many educators
in Connecticut, and encourages others: Nearly 14 percent of public
school students in the state were expelled or suspended from school
at least once during the 1998-99 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Some administrators see the figure, disclosed in a June report
by the state's Department of Education and first reported Thursday
by The Hartford Courant, as a sign of stricter discipline in
Connecticut public schools, which produce some of the
highest-achieving students in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the figure, which represents one of every seven public
school students in the state, has also prompted Theodore Sergi, the
state commissioner of education, to issue broad new directives to
Connecticut's 166 school districts to improve the behavior of what
he called an increasingly belligerent student body.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real collective feeling among administrators that
it's time to be more aggressive in addressing the behaviors of our
youngsters in our schools,'' Sergi said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be equally concerned with the personal development
of kids as we are about academic achievement,'' he added. ``The
challenge is, we are not providing enough teaching around personal
responsibility in kindergarten and grades one, two, three and
four.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut education officials cautioned against comparing the
data, compiled for the first time this year, with statistics for
public schools in other states or for the nation. But some experts
said that, no matter how the figure was viewed, 14 percent was an
unusually large proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a high number,'' said Michael Casserly, executive
director of the Council of the Great City Schools, in Washington.
``It sounds like Connecticut needs to make its own judgment about
whether suspending 14 percent of its students is a good idea or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Most violations committed by the state's 544,657 public school
students, prekindergarten through 12th-grade, were minor
infractions like cutting classes, talking back to teachers or using
foul language. But the report also found that students were removed
from their classes 32,030 times during 1998-99 for violent offenses
like fighting, making threats or bringing weapons to school.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, most of the bad behavior occurred among students in
grades 7 through 12. Ninth-and 10th-graders were, statistically,
the worst behaved, accounting for 44,564 violations, or 36 percent
of the total.
</P>
<P>
   About 51 percent of the students suspended or expelled were
white, and 45 percent were black or Hispanic students, who make up
slightly more than 25 percent of the public student body, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal laws required state officials to compile the
disciplinary report. The results suggest that Connecticut schools
suspended or expelled their students in the 1998-99 school year at
a rate double that of public schools nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-98 school year, 3.2 million suspensions and 90,000
expulsions were given to 46 million public school students in the
United States, said Chris Chapman of the National Center for
Education Statistics, who quoted data compiled by the Office of
Civil Rights, a unit of the federal Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The data revealed only the number of these punishments, not the
number of students who received them. But even if the punishments
were meted out at a rate of no more than one per student, the
national rate would still be only 7 percent, half that measured in
Connecticut last year.
</P>
<P>
   As in Connecticut, black public school students nationally were
suspended and expelled at a rate disproportionately higher than
their school populations.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Connecticut school officials believe that the state's
suspension or expulsion rate is terrible news. In the Stratford
School District, in Fairfield County, Superintendent Raymond
O'Connell said he was encouraged by news accounts of the report,
which he had not yet read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expulsion rate is probably up there,'' he said.
``Actually, I'm a little bit encouraged by it. Our Saturday
detention program seems to be having a positive effect on the
kids.''

GEORGE A. SNOW, 73, RESEARCHER WHO ADVANCED PARTICLE PHYSICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George A. Snow, whose laboratory experiments and theoretical
calculations helped shape the modern theory of particle physics,
died on June 24 in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was 73 and a
professor emeritus of physics at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, his son Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
   Snow ``was the last of a rare breed of physicists who knew both
theory and experiment,'' Andrew Baden, a physicist at Maryland,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a consummate researcher who immersed himself in
scientific problems that interested him, Snow ``was like Michael
Jordan with basketball,'' Baden said.
</P>
<P>
   Snow was also known as an advocate for women in science and
taught the first women's studies course at the University of
Maryland, in 1972, in collaboration with his wife, the artist Lila
Snow.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Beauchamp, a professor emerita of English and the first
coordinator of women's studies at the university, said support from
Snow and several other physicists was crucial in the days when such
programs were struggling to gain academic credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was right along with us from the beginning,'' Beauchamp
said.
</P>
<P>
   George A. Snow was born in Manhattan on Aug. 24, 1926, and moved
with his family to the Bronx as a child. He graduated from high
school at 14 and went on to receive a bachelor's degree from City
College of New York in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, he completed his Ph.D. at Princeton University under
Eugene P. Wigner, one of the giants of theoretical physics and a
Nobel Prize-winning theorist. Snow later spent a year at the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton when Einstein and other
great theorists were working there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked around at all those brains there and he said,
`There's no way I can compete with those guys,''' Baden recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So Snow shifted his emphasis to experimental physics but
nevertheless wrote a highly influential theoretical paper with
Thomas Day and Joseph Sucher in the late 1950s, about the time he
joined the Maryland faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The paper helped physicists extract the properties of particles
from complicated collision experiments, said Nick Hadley, a
professor of physics at Maryland. Those properties were later used
to support the successful theory that the particles are made of
elementary particles called quarks, Hadley said.
</P>
<P>
   Snow's experimental work, which he undertook at Brookhaven
National Laboratory, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and the
CERN laboratory in Switzerland, helped establish the nature of the
so-called weak nuclear force, an interaction that causes
radioactive decay.
</P>
<P>
   All of these results were eventually rolled into what is now
called the standard model of particle physics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Lila, of Chevy Chase, Md., and his son
Andrew, of Bethesda, Md., he is survived by his son Zachary of
Manhattan; a daughter, Sara Snow, of Vancouver; eight
grandchildren; and two brothers, Robert Snow of Del Ray Beach,
Fla., and Lawrence Snow of Great Neck, N.Y.

 FLIGHT ATTENDANTS FIGHT `AIR RAGE'  &HT;     By STEVE RUBENSTEIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Christine Black remembers a flight when a
passenger started shoving her and swearing because he didn't get
fish for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we had left was steak and chicken,'' she said Thursday.
``He didn't want steak or chicken. He wanted the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   The passenger threw his tray against the wall of the airplane
galley and began pushing Black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really scared,'' she said, recalling the incident that
happened three years ago aboard a San Francisco-to-Tokyo flight.
``This is not something you want happening at 30,000 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Black was one of eight flight attendants passing out leaflets
Thursday in front of San Francisco International Airport as part of
a nationwide campaign against the growing problem known as air
rage.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants maintain that the near-constant access to
in-flight liquor and a reluctance by airlines to offend customers
have contributed to the a dramatic increase in air rage incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Black, who managed to subdue the passenger with the aid of her
crewmates and had him arrested when the plane landed in Japan, said
such incidents are no longer isolated and that most of her
colleagues have similar tales to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines are providing champagne and hard liquor to
passengers before the plane ever leaves the gate,'' said Dawn Marie
Bader, a flight attendant and chapter president of the Association
of Flight Attendants. ``They're drinking before breakfast, before
dinner. They're drinking during dinner, after dinner and during the
movie. Passengers are drinking all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants' union is urging airlines and airports to
post signs and warn passengers at check-in that interfering with
flight crews is subject to a $25,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The union also wants airlines to practice ``more responsible
alcohol service (and) mandatory training for flight crews in
dealing with abusive passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants say oversold flights, crowded planes and small
seats are making passengers grumpier, and that air rage frequently
involves liquor, drugs or anger over bans on smoking and electronic
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Most departing passengers who stopped to chat with the
leafleting flight attendants said they supported &LR;  the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for them to serve people two and three
drinks at a time,'' said one Los Angeles-bound man.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Andre of Berkeley, who flies 100,000 miles a year and
sits in the part of the plane where passengers' legs do not fall
asleep in flight, said banning liquor on planes would be ``sort of
idiotic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They should cut off unruly drinkers, but not everyone else,''
she said. ``When I fly, I like to drink myself into oblivion and
then I go to sleep. It helps. I don't feel so good when I land,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport spokesman Ron Wilson said reported incidents of air rage
aboard flights arriving in San Francisco increased 70 percent last
year. There were 85 incidents in 1999, 50 incidents in 1998 and 29
incidents in 1997.

HERSHISER HAD AN EVERYMAN QUALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's only one thing for a Los Angeles Dodgers
fan to do at a Hallmark moment like this.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a retirement card. Then, mail it to yourself. Pick out a
gold watch. Then, strap it onto your own wrist. Stock up on
streamers and balloons. Then, throw a party for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Do this because, when Orel Hershiser announced his retirement
Thursday afternoon, he ended not only his own remarkable pitching
career, but also the vicarious career of every fan who lived
baseball's highs and lows through him.
</P>
<P>
   Which is pretty much all of us.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary thing about Hershiser wasn't the 200-plus
games he won, the scoreless-innings streak, the Cy Young Award, the
postseason heroics, the comeback from shoulder surgery, the
celebrated craftsmanship or all of the special moments it produced
- the elements of a Hall of Fame candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary thing is that he allowed his fans to feel as
if we were doing those things along with him.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, he looked, from a distance, like Everyman: pale,
gawky, reliant on contact lenses on the field and eyeglasses off
it, an all-around ``Poindexter,'' as his 1988 teammate Rick Dempsey
said affectionately after the Dodgers released Hershiser last week.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he was kind enough to allow us the illusion that he
was no more a physical marvel than you or I, just a scrawny kid
scraping by on guts and guile.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, which you realize if you stand next to him, is that
Hershiser is a born athlete, tall and trim and angular. Poindexter
couldn't throw 90 mph, but Orel could.
</P>
<P>
   His pitches had natural, nasty movement. And he could hit. He
might look bookish, but you can't learn any of that from a
textbook. He had a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in discussing any of his 204 victories, he would never make
it sound as if he overpowered opponents. It was more like he
outthought them, or he won because he managed to ``stay within
myself,'' the Hershiserism that so amused the nation's
sportswriters at the 1988 World Series and made his reputation as a
baseball intellectual.
</P>
<P>
   It always sounded like he was some pipsqueak corporal who'd just
taken down the entire Russian Army with one cleverly directed
grenade.
</P>
<P>
   As lies go, it was exactly what we wanted to hear. Hershiser was
the cool, crafty pitcher we'd be if only we got the chance.
</P>
<P>
   He always seemed to understand - better than any other athlete
I've known - how the public saw him, his team and his sport, his
role as an entertainer and the media's part in the equation.
</P>
<P>
   He played that role right to the end Thursday. He played down
his brawn and played down his brains. He played down his talent and
played up his labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you work real hard to get somewhere, when you're
not the best from the beginning, when you're a 17th-round draft
choice ... you realize there's always something to learn, whether
it's from the man sweeping the floor or the president of the
company,'' he said, trying to explain his perspective, unusually
broad for a ballplayer. ``I just like to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Do I seem to imply that Hershiser was somehow cynical about this
put- on, out to manipulate the press and public in order to cash in
on the resulting popularity? I don't mean to.
</P>
<P>
   I think he is a genuinely nice man, one of the best to step onto
a diamond, court or ice rink in this big-league sports city. And I
think one of the nicest things about him is that he brought us with
him. (Now if he'd like to bring us with him when, inevitably, he
steps into Dodgers management, we've got some ideas ...)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought it was special to put the uniform on and
walk on the field,'' Hershiser said early in his all-too-short
final season.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was special to be out there. You must have felt it
yourself.

ENRIC MIRALLES, 45, DIES; DESIGNED SCOTLAND'S NEW PARLIAMENT
BUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Scotland, N.Y., Spain)   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Enric Miralles, the renowned Catalan architect whose
most important project, the soaring headquarters for the fledgling
Scottish Parliament, is still being built, died of a brain tumor
Monday at his home in Barcelona, a spokesman for the Parliament
said. He was 45.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Miralles _ the brash creative force behind such
eclectic projects as the Utrecht Town Hall in the Netherlands, the
archery pavilions for the 1992 winter Olympics in Barcelona and the
Takaoka railway station in Japan _ was chosen to design the
building that is to house Scotland's first independent Parliament
in nearly 300 years. Admirers of Miralles praised his bold concept
for the building, which looks a bit like an upturned boat and is
now being constructed at the bottom of the Royal Mile in
Edinburgh's Old Town.
</P>
<P>
   But the project was beset by trouble almost from the beginning,
when some opposition members of Parliament grumbled that they
didn't like the design and others said there was no need for a new
structure at all. The cost, originally estimated at 50 million
pounds _ about $75 million _ soared to 195 million pounds earlier
this year. Predictions of when the building would be completed
changed, too: the current schedule calls for an opening date at the
end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Miralles was so eager to get the commission for the Parliament
building, a process he described as a ``fantastic conversation,''
that he reportedly rearranged the furniture in the room where he
was to have his final interview so as to improve the atmosphere and
help secure the job. But after his death, newspapers in Scotland
reported that Miralles had told a friend, even as he was dying,
that he was disillusioned that the project had become so
politicized. ``He was tired of their bureaucratic approach, saying
that they treated him like an engineer, not a creative person,''
the friend, Julio Capella, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1955, Enric Miralles Moya studied architecture in
Barcelona and received a doctoral degree from Columbia University.
With his first wife, he set up an architectural practice in
Barcelona in 1984, and he went on to win architectural competitions
throughout Europe. He was influenced by Charles Rennie Mackintosh,
Le Corbusier and Antonio Gaudi.
</P>
<P>
   Miralles avoided living in houses of his own design. Instead, he
once said, he preferred ``second-hand places, places in whose
creation you haven't participated, and to play the role of
observer.''
</P>
<P>
   Miralles is survived by his second wife and business partner,
Benedetta, also an architect; a daughter, Katerina; and a son,
Dominic. He was buried on Tuesday in Igualada Cemetery outside
Barcelona, which he designed.

 MOBILE SNEAKERS RUNNING OUR WAY  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
A Russian has invented gas-powered shoes, which is cruelly ironic,
since most Russians can't afford gas or shoes.
<P>
   But the shoes could solve a major problem in San Francisco: Cars
go too fast and take up too much room; pedestrians go too slow and
become roadkill.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the ideal compromise. We outlaw cars in San
Francisco, make gas shoes available to everyone, and the streets
become a wonderful scene of smoothly flowing fast-foot traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The power shoes have pistons that push off the ground with each
step, giving the walker a huge boost. Top speed is about 25 mph, so
during rush hour you could even walk the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   The power shoes would level the playing field. As it is now,
cars and buses level the pedestrian field.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have no need for Muni buses when you can hop around town
faster than they can. All the buses could be donated to the PD for
target practice.
</P>
<P>
   Parking? Parking schmarking. We could turn the parking garages
into homeless shelters and playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   No plan is perfect. People wearing BMW and Volvo shoes would
still assume they own the road. People wearing Chevy Suburbans
would still hog more than their share of the space.
</P>
<P>
   But basically, a groovy scene.
</P>
<P>
   And we'll save one pair for Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   JURY DUTY came calling to Selma Guthertz, so she sent back a
letter explaining that she recently fell and needs a walker to
move, and she must have an attendant with her 24 hours a day, and
she is blind in one eye, and she is 96 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Selma got an immediate reply. She is excused this time, but they
might be calling on her in the future.
</P>
<P>
   FOUR GUYS were motorboating on the Fourth, about 6 p.m., when
they spotted a man struggling desperately in the water under the
Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The man was the skipper of a sailboat, he had fallen out of the
boat into the freezing water, and in the heavy wind his
inexperienced ``crew,'' mostly his family, was having no luck
maneuvering to fish him out. It was a mini version of ``The Perfect
Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   The four motorboaters zoomed in and plucked the man out of the
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was blue and half dead,'' says Dr. Jordan Shlain, one of
the four.
</P>
<P>
   But the adventure was far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Shlain and the boys yelled to the sailboaters to power up and
head for the shelter of the Fort Mason Marina.
</P>
<P>
   At the dock, the sailboat crew tried to tie up, but their line
toss was wild and the rope fouled their prop. The wind began to
blow the boat toward a cement wall.
</P>
<P>
   Shlain cell-phoned 911 and begged the Coast Guard to help save
the 40-foot sailboat from crashing into the wall. But when no help
arrived, the motorboat zipped near the sailboat, Yariv Baum and
Steve Nolan leapt aboard with a line, and the yacht was towed back
to safety. The Coast Guard never did show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we buy you guys a drink?'' asked someone on the frazzled
sailboat crew.
</P>
<P>
   On the powerboat, Nolan, an emergency medical technician, called
back, ``Thanks, but no thanks. This is what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   SLOWLY, BUT surely, all the personality is being sucked out of
radio. Or is it just my imagination?
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, Live-105 dumped local comic Johnny Steele so
the Bay Area could be treated to a daily dose of Howard Stern's
syndicated potty prattle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, KFOG has dumped Stan Sinberg and his weekly two-minute
topical humor commentary, ``Take a Stan,'' reportedly to make more
room for music.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sinberg, the commentary spot was held down by Scoop
Nisker. So there was a kind of tradition going. Now, FOGheads get
less punchy local humor and one more Dave Matthews song.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEWS of the death of famed showbiz tap-dancer Harold
Nicholas brought a pang of sadness to the old gang from Harding
Park Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Nolan was part of an informal group of golfers back in the
'70s, the Harding Park Rabbits. They played every afternoon for 25
cents a round.
</P>
<P>
   The Rabbits kind of blended themselves in with a group of black
men who also played regularly at Harding. Nolan and Nichols hit it
off, became a daily team, won their fair share of friendly wagers
against the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teamed up for two years, '75 and '76, until a new
management ended the Rabbits,'' Nolan says. ``Harold was a great
guy, and never let on that he'd been a famous dancer. We played
together for a year and a half before I knew he'd been in show
business.''

   THE SIGN posted at 15th and Judah says, ``Please Stop the `Bird
Calling Machine' That Sounds in the Middle of the Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone has scribbled under that, ``Shoot the mockingbird?''
</P>
<P>
   It's no machine, it is indeed the lovely yet pesky mockingbird
and its mating-season serenade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the prettiest songbirds;it mimics every pretty
bird call,'' says Arthur Feinstein, executive director of the
Golden Gate Audubon Society. ``But it also mimics answering
machines, phone rings, car alarms. And it sings all night. We get
calls from people on the verge of insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The best we can hope for is that the birds aggressively attempt
to mate with car thieves.

 ARNIE WEINMEISTER, 77, A GIANTS STAR IN THE '50s 
By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arnie Weinmeister, the Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive
tackle who starred for the Giants in the early 1950s then forged a
second career as a leader of the Teamsters union, died June 28 at a
hospital in Seattle. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Weinmeister was among the biggest players of his day, at 6 feet
4 inches and 235 pounds, but was known for his quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonder to see him on the field,'' said Dante Lavelli,
the star end for the old Cleveland Browns, who lined up opposite
Weinmeister when the Giants and Browns built their rivalry. ``He
was one of the first big men who could move that quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck Shaw, the coach of the San Francisco 49ers, said in 1954:
``Weinmeister is the outstanding tackle in the NFL. One man can't
handle him.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinmeister was born in Rhein, Saskatchewan, to German
immigrants who moved to Portland, Ore., when he was a child, and
then to Seattle. He played three seasons for the University of
Washington as a tackle and end, before and after serving in the
Army artillery during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating with a degree in economics, Weinmeister joined
the New York Yankees of the All-America Football Conference in
1948. He played both offensive and defensive tackle for two
seasons, then went to the Giants of the NFL, with the Yankee
defensive back Tom Landry, when the All-America league went out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   In Weinmeister's first three seasons with the Giants, they were
conference runners-up to the Browns, using coach Steve Owen's
umbrella defense, which featured an innovative four-man secondary.
Weinmeister and his fellow tackle Al DeRogatis were anchors of the
line while the defensive backs _ most notably Landry and Emlen
Tunnell _ spread out like an umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was a very down-to-earth guy, a great defensive coach,''
Weinmeister recalled. ``We wound up having the best defense in the
league, but we didn't score any points to speak of.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry, who would gain renown as coach of the Dallas Cowboys,
once remarked how Weinmeister was adept at analyzing plays. ``If
you wanted to know where the opponent's ball was, all you had to do
was look for Arnie's jersey number,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weinmeister played for the Giants from 1950 to 1953 and was
selected for the Pro Bowl each season. He then joined the British
Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football League as a player-coach,
winning a court battle with the Giants, who maintained that he
still belonged to them.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving football in 1956, Weinmeister became an organizer
for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. He was director of
the 13-state, 400,000-member, Seattle-based Western Conference of
Teamsters in the late 1980s and early 1990s and served as the
union's second vice president. He was also president of Joint
Council 28, covering 20 Teamsters locals in Washington, northern
Idaho and Alaska, and was secretary-treasury of Local 117 in
Seattle before retiring in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when the Justice Department filed suit to remove the
Teamsters' senior leadership, charging that it had made a ``devil's
pact'' with organized crime, it accused Weinmeister and the 17
other members of the executive board of failing to root out
corruption. Under a consent decree, scores of union officials were
removed by overseers. Weinmeister remained in office. He said in a
1988 deposition that he had no knowledge of organized crime other
than what he had read in the newspapers or had seen in the
``Godfather'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   Weinmeister is survived by his wife, Joey, of Seattle; two sons,
Hans, of Anchorage, and Jason, of Scottsdale, Ariz.; two daughters,
Kirsten Weinmeister, of Duvall, Wash., and Gretchen Slater, of
Anchorage; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In his football days, Weinmeister could be as hard on teammates
as he was on opponents. Roosevelt Brown, the Giants' longtime
offensive tackle, would recall having met his match when he faced
Weinmeister during workouts. Brown, who like Weinmeister was noted
for his quickness, would also become a Hall of Famer. But when he
practiced pulling out and cutting off the inside defender, he could
not shake off Weinmeister.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Weinmeister, it was impossible,'' Brown remembered. ``He
was very, very fast himself and one of the toughest to go up
against. Fortunately, I only had to do that in practice.''  &QL;

EDITORIAL: PREPARING TO REMAKE MEXICO  
 
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 7:
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans have understandably high expectations for Vicente Fox,
the man they elected to break the 71-year presidential monopoly of
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. In the euphoria that
has followed his decisive victory Sunday, they now look to Fox to
eliminate the official corruption, economic inequalities and
political repression that were the defining characteristics of PRI
rule. Fox's initial declarations are promising. But he will need
persistence and cooperation from Mexico's other parties to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over from an entrenched autocracy is never easy, and Fox
faces more than the usual difficulties. The PRI remains in power
for five more months, long enough to destroy records of corrupt
dealings and deny Fox a smooth transition. His party will lack a
Congressional majority, requiring him to make deals with other
political forces, including the PRI. President Ernesto Zedillo
should make sure that the current government shares information
fully with Fox's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The most important issue facing Fox is government corruption. He
has promised to remove police functions from the highly politicized
Interior Ministry and the attorney general's office and establish a
new, more professional ministry of security and justice. Those are
necessary steps. Mexico's police have become notorious for
protecting drug dealers and preying on ordinary citizens while
facing little threat of investigation or punishment. But merely
creating a new ministry is not enough. The training and management
of police and prosecutors must be overhauled to ensure that
criminal investigations are conducted properly and all law
enforcement officers are held accountable for misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has also pledged to channel public resources toward reducing
poverty and to bring the benefits of the North American Free Trade
Agreement to smaller businesses. Washington should offer him strong
support. A Mexico with economic opportunity more widely distributed
among its 100 million people would not only provide a better market
for American consumer goods, it would also be a more comfortable
economic and political partner for the United States. Washington
should consider Fox's sensible ideas about expanding legal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's size, proximity and prominence as a trade partner tie
it inextricably to the United States. Washington should do all that
it can to support Fox's efforts to transform his country from an
autocracy based on patronage and privilege into a law-abiding,
pluralist democracy.  &QL;

RECIPE FOR WEAKER SCHOOLS  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 7:
</P>
<P>
   Private prep schools often provide a fifth year of high school
for students who performed poorly in their earlier years and need
to strengthen themselves academically before moving on to college.
The American Federation of Teachers has suggested that public high
schools formally add a fifth year for struggling students. This is
not a good idea at this point. Public high schools need to make far
better use of the four years they already have.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of formalizing a fifth year was floated this week by
the federation's president, Sandra Feldman, during a conference of
the teachers union in Philadelphia, where Feldman called for a
``transitional-year'' program, before ninth grade or in high
school, in which teen-agers who lacked basic skills could be
prepared for college's more challenging course work. The optional
fifth year, she said, would serve ``kids who are just absolutely
falling through the cracks because no one's paying attention to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   These are noble sentiments. But an extra year for a few students
would quickly be expanded to cover a greater number of students.
These students would be passed unprepared from grade to grade, on
the theory that there would be time for them to catch up
academically somewhere down the line.
</P>
<P>
   The most important task now is to improve the four-year system.
A forthcoming study of national achievement data by the Education
Trust, a Washington foundation devoted to school reform, shows that
the public high schools have declined dramatically over the last 10
years _ and now yield less academic growth among their students
than in any other phase of the public school system. According to
the foundation's director, Kati Haycock, the new data show smaller
gains in high school than in the lower grades, a consequence of a
less rigorous curriculum that includes fewer challenging reading
assignments than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those who favor a five-year approach argue that many students
already take that long to graduate. This is certainly true in New
York City, where only about half of all students receive high
school diplomas in four years. Encouraging those students to
graduate, even if they need more time, is the right thing to do.
But allowing high schools five years to graduate students as a
matter of policy would weaken the system, ensuring that more and
more students take longer to graduate. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A STREET CROSSING LONG AGO

  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 7:
</P>
<P>
   In about 1835 an artist named George Harvey painted a small
watercolor of the intersection of Broadway and Houston Street. The
painting, called ``Night-Fall, St. Thomas Church, Broadway, New
York,'' now belongs to the Museum of the City of New York and is
reproduced in a new book called ``Picturing New York: The City From
Its Beginnings to the Present,'' by Gloria Deak. Like his friend
Washington Irving, whose house at Sunnyside he helped design,
Harvey was a romantic, with a romantic's love of atmosphere. He
painted what he called ``atmospheric landscapes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Night-Fall, St. Thomas Church'' is an atmospheric cityscape in
the period of summer. The lamplighters are at work, and the lamps
have just begun to take effect in the twilight. A saddlemaker
stands under a canvas awning, lit by the shop's light spilling onto
the walk. Carriages make their way across the cobbled intersection,
as do pedestrians and two riders, one accompanied by a small dog,
the other raising his horse in a levade. A squad of
white-pantalooned soldiers is about to pass the doors of St.
Thomas, whose twin towers frame a glowing leaded window. On the
street darkness is taking hold, but above St. Thomas the sky is
pale with midsummer. Looking at this painting you can feel the
mixture of diffusion and directionality in the light, so strongly
characteristic of the season, so familiar still.
</P>
<P>
   In 1835 there were perhaps a quarter-million people living in
Manhattan. Forty-eight of them are visible in Harvey's watercolor,
whose only unreality is the unreality of all figurative paintings,
the protracted seizing of an instant. As Harvey depicts it, the
intersection at Broadway and Houston might have been a village
square, so orderly and placid does it seem, so rural that
overarching sky. And yet you can sense the continuity that city
streets always imply, the way they reach into an unseen distance.
</P>
<P>
   St. Thomas is long since gone from that spot _ it is now at 53rd
Street and Fifth Avenue _ and saddles and harnesses are no longer
made anywhere in the city. The cobblestones have nearly all been
taken up and the hand-lit streetlamps all taken down. The 48 people
in Harvey's painting, and their quarter-million neighbors, have all
passed into the oblivion on which the present serenely rides. Three
tides of traffic now cross at Broadway and Houston, and every
pedestrian who pauses there for a light carries within him an
intuitive sense of the city's volume, its voltage, just as the
pedestrians in Harvey's watercolor surely did. That is perhaps the
only thing that has not changed in 165 years. That, and on fair
summer nights, the pale western sky.

BELCHER AT `WIT'S END' UPON GOING ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Tim Belcher has always been known as a tough
competitor, but the 38-year-old pitcher is also a realist.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher was placed on the 15-day disabled list Thursday with a
strained flexor muscle in his right elbow, the same injury that
eventually required surgery last year. While doctors are saying the
latest setback is not directly related to the surgery, Belcher said
he knows there's a chance his career could be finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've struggled with the whole scenario for a year now, when it
started bothering me last year in mid-May,'' said Belcher, who is
2-2 with a 9.49 ERA in four starts this season. ``Because I never
had an elbow problem before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a long discussion with my wife (Wednesday) night. My
last couple of (bad) outings, it had kind of gotten to the point
where I had a different emotional reaction than what there had
been. I told my wife the frustrating part was that in the last game
I got knocked out in the first inning, and it was the shortest
outing of my career. But when I came out I didn't have the energy
to throw things around. It was like I'd rather sit down and cry
than break stuff up. ... It's certainly an indication of being at
my wit's end.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Belcher makes a decision to end his career, he's going to
take the steps required to get back to the mound. He had a
cortisone injection Thursday and plans to play catch this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher said he could have made his scheduled start tonight but
didn't want to put a strain on the bullpen like he did his last
time out, when he gave up seven runs in one-third of an inning and
was taken out.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing, Belcher said, is ``life'' on the ball out of his
hand. He hasn't had the same movement in his past two starts as he
had in his first two, when he went 2-0 with a 3.18 ERA. Instead,
his pitches have been flat and hitters are teeing off.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he is feeling, Belcher said: ``About as miserable as
you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher is making $4.6 million this season, the second year of a
two-year contract. The Angels have an option worth about $5 million
for next year but are more likely to exercise their $1-million
buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz recalled: Ramon Ortiz has been called up from Triple-A
Edmonton and will make the start in Belcher's place tonight. Ortiz
was 2-2 with a 6.90 ERA in six starts for the Angels when he was
sent to Edmonton on May 10. In 10 starts for Edmonton, Ortiz was
4-3 with a 4.58 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz was called up instead of Seth Etherton because Etherton
started a couple days ago and threw 120 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Bullpen gets boost: In an effort to get help for a weary
bullpen, the Angels optioned starter Brian Cooper to Lake Elsinore
and called up reliever Lou Pote. Cooper pitched Wednesday night and
was not going to get another start before the All-Star break.
Cooper will make a start for Lake Elsinore to stay on a five-day
schedule, then return to the major- league club and start July 17
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus sits: Third baseman Troy Glaus was not in the starting
lineup Thursday, partly because of fatigue in his right shoulder,
and partly because of his ongoing hitting slump. In his past nine
games, he is 2 for 33 with 18 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you look and we're playing Seattle, but I'm looking at
the big picture,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``When a guy needs a
day off you give him a day off. He'll be better off in the long
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehabbing: Shortstop Kevin Stocker is expected to be activated
from the disabled list today or Saturday. Stocker has been on the
DL since June 22 with tendinitis in his left knee. ... Pitcher
Scott Schoeneweis (strained rib-cage muscle) threw off the mound in
the bullpen Thursday and is scheduled to throw a simulated game
this weekend.

EDITORIAL: EGYPT ARRESTS AN ACTIVIST 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 7:
</P>
<P>
   Egypt arrested a prominent sociologist last week, along with at
least eight of his colleagues, and shut down the democracy
institute where they work. The government said the sociologist, Dr.
Saad Eddin Ibrahim, was suspected of, among other things, accepting
funds from the European Union and harming Egypt's image by making a
voting rights video that discussed past election fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests follow a campaign of attacks on Ibrahim in the
Egyptian media and represent the latest harassment of advocates of
democracy and human rights by the government, which appears to be
trying to silence them before parliamentary elections this fall. If
Egypt is truly worried about its image, it should end its
embarrassing assault on independent activists.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Ibrahim and other staff members of his
institute, the Ibn Khaldoun center, are similar to those brought in
the past two years against other activists. The Egyptian
authorities also tightened regulations on nongovernmental
organizations last year with a law that was recently declared
unconstitutional on technical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's human rights community is understandably alarmed that
the government would move against the prominent and well-connected
Ibrahim, who also holds U.S. citizenship and is a professor at the
American University in Cairo. According to one of Ibrahim's
lawyers, several of his staff members are still in jail, and no one
has been able to visit Ibrahim since Monday. The government has 15
days to investigate charges against him, but can renew his
detention indefinitely. His request for bail was denied.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt seems to be harassing Ibrahim for his democracy work and
for activities like accepting foreign donations and criticizing
government actions. This is not criminal conduct and should not be
treated as such. Washington, which gives Egypt $2 billion a year,
says its ambassador has raised the case with Egypt's prime
minister. The United States should continue to press for the
release of Ibrahim and his staff, and for the political rights of
all Egyptians.  &QL;

CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE DRAFTS CAMPAIGN FINANCE OVERHAUL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ Showing uncharacteristic speed, the Legislature
has drafted and approved a major overhaul of the state's campaign
finance laws to limit contributions and encourage candidates to
restrict spending.
<P>
   The reform legislation, written last week and adopted Wednesday
by the Senate and Thursday by the Assembly, needs voter approval to
become law.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis' expected approval is needed soon to meet a
deadline for placing it on the November 7 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Good government groups such as Common Cause and the League of
Women Voters say the legislation is too weak. They contend believe
 &LR; it was hurried through the Legislature in an effort to pre-empt
Proposition 208, a much stricter measure adopted by voters in 1996
but sidetracked by legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the new measure are limits on the size of
contributions to candidates, as well as voluntary ceilings on
campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, a candidate for the Legislature could receive no
more than $3,000 from a donor each election. That amount would
climb to $5,000 for all statewide offices except that of governor.
Contributions in the governor's race would be capped at $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause and the League of Women Voters say the new bill's
changes aren't strong enough to slow the torrent of campaign cash
lavished on candidates by special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the Legislature gives us a weak package that is
nothing like what the voters wanted,'' said Trudy Schafer, a
lobbyist for the League of Women Voters of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's especially galling is this is so premature, because 208
is going back to court next week,'' she said. ``Even lawyers
opposing 208 say they think it will be upheld.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 208 calls for contribution limits of $250 per donor
for legislative candidates and $500 for those seeking statewide
office.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are no limits on contributions, a point
Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, used in urging the
lower house's approval of the plan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it better than what we have on the books now? There is
nothing on the books now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Legislature approved a broad overhaul of
campaign finance laws was in 1994. The plan never appeared on the
ballot because it was vetoed by then-Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, voters approved Proposition 208, a tough
campaign finance measure, but it was declared unconstitutional in
1998 without ever taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Davis said the governor had no position on the
new campaign finance reform package. But Senate President Pro Tem
John Burton, D-San Francisco, the architect of the plan, said the
Democratic governor will sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers originally set a $10,000 ceiling on gubernatorial
contributions, but Davis wanted the $20,000 level.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is a voracious fund-raiser. He has already amassed more
than $20 million 21/2 years before his re-election, much of it in
$25,000 to $100,000 chunks.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage a higher number of smaller contributions, the
Legislature's plan would allow political action committees financed
by more than 100 people kicking in no more than $200 each annually
to give double the individual contribution limits for legislative
and statewide races.
</P>
<P>
   The $20,000 cap still would apply in the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   In the 80-member Assembly, which sent the plan to Davis on a
42-to-21, largely party-line vote, GOP critics said the limits
would help rich candidates by forcing less well-heeled candidates
to spend more time trolling for money.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative proposal would also create voluntary spending
limits in campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Spending in the governor's race would be capped at $6 million in
the primary and $10 million in the general. By contrast, Davis
spent $34.4 million in his successful run for governor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly races would be limited to $400,000 in the primary and
$900,000 in the general election. State Senate races would be
capped at $600,000 in the primary and $900,000 in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   As an incentive to adhere to the voluntary limits, candidates
who refused to limit their spending would be identified in voter
pamphlets as doing so.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate adhering sticking  &LR; to the limits could also pay to
include a 250-word statement in the sample ballots mailed to
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Stiff penalties would be imposed if the limits are accepted and
then exceeded.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by voters, the limits would not take effect for
statewide officeholders, such as Davis, until after the November
2002 election. The limits would be imposed on legislative races
beginning in next  &LR; January.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of Proposition 208 complained that the Legislature's
proposal is designed to replace the much lower limits the voters
approved in 1996: $250 for legislative candidates and $500 for
statewide candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Those low spending limits were among the reasons Proposition 208
was declared unconstitutional. A new hearing on the measure's
constitutionality is scheduled for Tuesday in Sacramento federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the proposition are optimistic that a recent U.S.
Supreme Court decision upholding $1,000 contribution limits in
Missouri will lead to Proposition 208's reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco lawyer Joe Remcho, who leads the opposition to
Proposition 208, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposition's limits are totally unconstitutional,''
Remcho said. ``The cost to communicate with voters in California is
much higher than in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, the cost of 1998 elections and recent case law
have proved the judge was right the first time around in saying
208's limits prevent a candidate from amassing enough money to run
an effective campaign,'' Remcho said.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 208 would banned &LR;  fund-raising prior to one year
before the date of a primary for statewide candidates and six
months before the primary in a legislative race. The Legislature's
plan would does  &LR; not.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 208 would also banned &LR;  transfers among candidates,
one of the tools legislative leaders use to shore up weaker
candidates. The Legislature's plan would allow transfers but would
cap them at the contribution limits.

 OFFICIALS WANT PROBE OF PRISON LAB-TEST SCAM  &HT;     By JANET WELLS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Calling it a potential threat to public safety,
state officials and prisoners' rights advocates called Thursday for
an inquiry into the state's apparent failure to retest thousands of
prisoners after a medical lab was found faking test results for
AIDS, hepatitis and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle reported that while seven state prisons were
warned about the falsified results three years ago, there is little
evidence that the state Department of Corrections made any attempt
to retest inmates or notify them that their test results were in
question.
</P>
<P>
   B.C.L. Clinical Labs, a Southern California firm, was shut down
in 1997 after state investigators raided the laboratory and found
evidence that it was simply making up results on vital medical
tests and typing them into a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Corrections still does not know how many
prisoners may have been affected by the testing fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will demand of them a full response, and request corrective
actions. (We will) continue to investigate to ensure that this very
serious problem is corrected,'' Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San
Francisco, said. ``Certainly we'll insist upon greater oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will shake up a wobbly and inconsistent department,''
Migden said, criticizing the Department of Corrections _ which
oversees 160,846 inmates in the state's 33 prisons _ as ``difficult
to rein in.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems with prison health care are nothing new, said Geoff
Long, chief of staff for the Assembly's Appropriations Committee,
``They just get bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   If the state did not follow up with new medical tests for prison
inmates, it may have serious health consequences not only for the
inmates themselves, but also for the general population, said Long,
who has worked on corrections issues for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Without retesting, inmates could have lacked crucial information
about their health, and could have been released back into society
without knowing they had a serious or potentially contagious
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission of the Department of Corrections is to lock people
up and keep them away from the public. They're pretty good at that.
What they're not good at is medical treatment, substance-abuse
programs, things that make it safer for the public when they get
out,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We release 100,000 of these (prisoners) a year,'' Long added.
``They are not out there wearing little face masks ... If they've
got hepatitis or TB, they are spewing them around. They are out in
the mall.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest snafu with prison health care is not ``particularly
surprising,'' said Steve Fama, staff attorney for the Prison Law
Office, a nonprofit organization in San Rafael that provides free
legal services to inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care in California's prisons is marked by many
problems. One of the major ones is the lack of follow up,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fama said the state's failure to retest or inform prisoners, if
true, could have serious legal implications.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Corrections medical staff could be liable for
medical malpractice, ``depending upon the harm that would be
suffered by the patients,'' Fama said. And if the prison was
``deliberately indifferent'' to these patients, ``it could possibly
be a civil rights violation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by The Chronicle's inquiry in March, Department of
Corrections authorities have said that they are looking into the
matter, and hope to be able to document an organized approach to
retesting inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections spokesman Bob Martinez added Thursday
that prison doctors ``were professional and did whatever was
necessary to verify prognoses or concerns about patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical staff members at several prisons that contracted with
B.C.L. expressed concerns about the lab's slow response time and
shoddy work. At one facility, Chuckawala Valley State Prison,
prison doctors sent some test samples to local hospitals to be
reprocessed after the doctors said they could not rely on B.C.L.
test results.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Culton, Chuckawala's chief medical officer, told The
Chronicle that he urged state health inspectors to check out the
lab and that any prisoner whose lab results were suspect was
retested at his facility.
</P>
<P>
   However, Culton acknowledged that he never set any formal
retesting program down in writing. Department of Corrections
officials have been unable to produce evidence of a cohesive or
widespread attempt to retest inmates tested by B.C.L.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no record that would absolutely document retesting,''
Martinez said. ``Those records don't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Martinez said, ``I'm confident that they retested, even
though they didn't set up a reporting process for that. It was done
within each of the inmate's files.''
</P>
<P>
   A Chronicle review of the records of more than a dozen female
inmates shows only two cases of retesting. One woman was given
another HIV test 13 months after her initial test, and another was
retested for a thyroid condition but not for other possible
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Corrections is evaluating the ``appropriate
protocol at this point,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be possible to retest everyone. It
would be very, very difficult to do,'' he said. ``It's a whole lot
of people. We're talking thousands and thousands. It's a very
large, decentralized operation.''

 AIDS CONFERENCE TO CONVENE IN EYE OF EPIDEMIC  &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most important thing about the 13th International AIDS
Conference convening Sunday is the simple fact that for the first
time it is taking place in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   After all, more people are living with the AIDS virus today in
South Africa, the conference's host country, than any nation on
Earth. About half of the 15-year-olds in that country and other
African nations hardest hit by the epidemic will eventually die of
the disease, according to UNAIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the symbolism alone, this is a very important meeting,''
said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's leading AIDS
researcher who directs the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci is one of more than 10,000 AIDS researchers, activists and
journalists converging on Durban, a historic South African seaport
and Indian Ocean beach resort, for the biennial meeting to report
on the latest efforts to track the disease and curb its spread.
</P>
<P>
   When the first international conference was held in Atlanta in
1985, the global dimensions of the AIDS epidemic were only
beginning to take shape. AIDS is now estimated to have killed 18
million human beings, most of them from the world's poorest places.
</P>
<P>
   The location of the weeklong International AIDS Conference has
already stirred up unprecedented interest in Africa's AIDS
epidemic, which has been consuming the continent without much
attention from Western nations preoccupied with their own, smaller
battles with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is having an incredibly destabilizing effect on these
countries,'' warns Tom Coates, director of the AIDS Research
Institute at the University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Like many researchers who watch HIV playing out on a global
scale, he is hopeful that the Durban conference will prompt the
United States to devote more time, attention and money to
prevention efforts abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Durban itself has a storied past. One of the few natural harbors
on the southern coast of the African continent, it became a major
port and railway center for South Africa. It was from the Indian
immigrant community there that Mohandas Gandhi launched his
political career.
</P>
<P>
   With its unique and tragic history of apartheid, South Africa is
a nation that straddles two worlds. It is both a developing country
_ with its black majority population among the most impoverished in
the world _ and an industrial power. It is rich in mineral
resources and has a highly educated workforce. It also has advanced
computer and communications systems and a strong military believed
to have nuclear capability.
</P>
<P>
   Durban is both a gateway to South Africa and a port of entry for
the AIDS virus _ a place where, after the fall of apartheid and the
lifting of international sanctions 10 years ago, the world poured
in, bringing with it renewed trade, immigration and HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   Spared the early onslaught of AIDS _ which had been killing
millions of people in other countries of sub-Saharan Africa since
the 1980s _ South Africa has suddenly found itself the epicenter of
a global pandemic.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty percent of South Africa's adult population, or 4.2
million people, are believed to be infected with HIV. The
proportion of infected adults nearly doubled from two years ago,
according to UNAIDS.
</P>
<P>
   UNAIDS estimates that one in four South African women aged 20 to
29 is infected. According to a University of Pretoria assessment,
45 percent of South Africa's mine workers are now HIV-positive. In
the eastern KwaZulu-Natal province _ where Durban is situated _ the
HIV infection rate has exceeded 30 percent among pregnant women,
while rates as high as 60 percent have been recorded in the
Messina, near the northern border with Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   While South Africa is seen by much of the industrialized world
as the ``hope of Africa,'' its government's hesitant and conflicted
response to the epidemic has both puzzled and angered AIDS
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has upset the world scientific community more than South
African President Thabo Mbeki's flirtation with widely discredited
theories that the human immunodeficiency virus is not the cause of
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Without access to the costly anti-retroviral drugs that have
helped suppress HIV in the United States, and slowed the horrific
death toll from AIDS, there is a yearning on the part of millions
of Africans for a different explanation of what is happening there.
``I really wish they would find the HIV is not the cause of AIDS,''
said Winstone Zulu, an HIV-positive activist from Zambia. ``because
then I would be off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, there was talk of canceling the Durban conference
to protest Mbeki's stance. Renowned San Francisco AIDS clinician
Dr. Paul Volberding said he is not attending the conference this
year, ``in part because of Mbeki's statements.''
</P>
<P>
   At a visit to San Francisco in May, however, the South African
president seemed to be subtly shifting the target of his skepticism
_ no longer so concerned whether HIV is the cause of AIDS, but
asking more pointed questions about why HIV has struck Africa so
much harder than the industrialized West. While the epidemic in
Europe and the United States remains concentrated among gay men,
injection drug users and their partners, in Africa it is a
heterosexual epidemic. ``If there are different biological
circumstances affecting Africa, it is important for us to take into
account those differences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the British journal Nature published a statement
endorsed by more than 5,000 scientists stating unequivocally that
HIV is the cause of AIDS. The so-called Durban Declaration said the
evidence was ``clear-cut, exhaustive and unambiguous, meeting the
highest standard of science ... HIV causes AIDS. It is unfortunate
that a few vocal people continue to deny the evidence. This
position will cost countless lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the declaration on July 1, prior to its
publication in Nature, drew a quick rebuke from the South African
government. ``We have never seen this kind of intolerance and we
don't want people bringing intolerance to South Africa,'' Mbeki
press spokesman Parks Mankahlana told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   As it grapples with the growing epidemic, the leadership of
South Africa has been criticized at home and abroad for its failure
to react decisively. South Africa's health minister, Dr. Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang, told American reporters in May that HIV is only
one among a long list of serious health and economic problems
facing his country. ``People with AIDS expect you to drop
everything for AIDS,'' she remarked. ``As my daughter said to me,
`You are the minister of health, not the minister of AIDS.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Tshabalala-Msimang has taken the lead in
pressuring the global pharmaceutical industry to provide low-cost
access to modern drugs. At a recent conference, she reasserted her
government's right to make or purchase generic version of AIDS
drugs by issuing ``compulsory'' licenses to patent holders and
shopping the world market for the cheapest products.
</P>
<P>
   The conference itself is unlikely to yield any major scientific
breakthroughs. Because of the highly politicized environment of the
international AIDS conclaves _ the program is a magnet for global
activists and sometimes disruptive protests _ the most important
research findings are saved for other gatherings, such as the
Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, held last
February in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But as a forum for discussing the impact of AIDS in the
developing world, the Durban conference will be unparalleled. Dr.
Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, said the world is only
now beginning to grasp the devastating impact AIDS will have on the
social fabric of struggling nations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Piot released a dire prediction of an entire
generation of Sub-Saharan Africans taken out by AIDS _ most notably
in countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. ``The
probability that you die from AIDS when you are 15 today is over 50
percent in these countries,'' Piot said. ``We are going into
societies where there are more people in their 60s and 70s than
there are in their 40s and 30s. This is unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Durban will focus the world's attention on the growing problem
of AIDS orphans. A total of 13.2 million children under the age of
15 have lost either their mother or both parents to AIDS, according
to Piot.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Drugs Out of Reach
</P>
<P>
   There will be many debates and demonstrations in Durban about
the lack of access Africans have to the anti-retroviral drugs used
by HIV-infected Americans and Europeans. At a cost of at least
$12,000 a year, the triple drug combinations are hopelessly out of
reach for millions of Africans, where total health spending is a
fraction of that in the West. In the United States, for example,
per capita health spending is $4,187. In South Africa, it is $268.
In Cameroon, it is $31.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, a medical conference on AIDS in Africa will focus on
the frustrating search for a vaccine. ``Some of the realities will
come into focus when people go to Africa,'' said Dr. Donald
Francis, president of VaxGen Inc., a Brisbane firm that is now
conducting advanced trials of an AIDS vaccine. It is similar to one
that blocked HIV in chimps. Final evaluation of the trials is still
three years away.
</P>
<P>
   As a public health worker in Africa in the 1970s, Francis played
a role in the successful campaign to wipe out smallpox, and he was
among the first to identify AIDS as a global threat. ``The cost of
treating AIDS in Uganda at current prices for anti-retroviral drugs
is 12 times that nation's gross national product,'' he noted. ``If
they reduce prices by 80 percent, it's still more than twice the
country's GNP.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis believes economics like that will force policymakers to
pay more attention to prevention strategies, including vaccines.
``Those of us who have worked over there know that life is really
tough in most of the world. You have to recognize that, and then do
the best that you can,'' he said.

 5 STEPS TO CONQUER A KILLER  &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa,
presents an opportunity for Western nations to respond to Africa's
AIDS epidemic. On the basis of interviews with doctors, scientists,
epidemiologists and economists, here are five realistic steps that,
with Western assistance, could help bring Africa's HIV epidemic
under control.
</P>
<P>
   1. PROVIDE HIV TESTING AND COUNSELING: People who know they are
infected with the AIDS virus tend to change their behavior. They
are more likely to use condoms and less likely to infect others.
But in Africa, fewer than 10 percent of those who are infected with
HIV know it. AIDS tests cost only a few dollars each, still out of
reach for most African governments. With help from abroad, HIV
testing and counseling could become commonplace. With readily
available testing, AIDS education and condom distribution programs
would become more effective.
</P>
<P>
   2. TREAT SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES: Sexually transmitted
diseases such as syphilis and herpes are a major risk factor for
the transmission of HIV. Offering antibiotics and antiviral drugs
to treat these conditions will not only alleviate the suffering
they cause, but could also reduce HIV infection rates.
</P>
<P>
   3. PROMOTE MALE CIRCUMCISION: A growing body of evidence is
convincing AIDS researchers that lack of male circumcision may play
a huge role in the spread of HIV among heterosexuals. In Nigeria,
where there is a tradition of circumcision, the HIV rate is 4
percent. In Botswana, where it is not practiced, the adult
infection rate is 36 percent. Proponents say male circumcision,
with appropriate counseling on the continued need for safe sex,
could cut HIV transmission by 50 percent or more. Under sterile
conditions, male circumcision is a safe, low-cost (under $6) and
permanent medical intervention that could prevent millions of HIV
infections.
</P>
<P>
   4. PROVIDE DRUGS TO CUT MOTHER-TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION: Roughly 30
percent of infants born to HIV-infected mothers contract the virus
at birth. Short courses of the drug AZT costing about $800 during
and after birth have reduced mother-to-child transmission in the
United States to under 5 percent. Less expensive, lower-dose
regimes tested in Thailand show the potential to cut the
transmission rate at least in half. A single dose of the antiviral
drug nevirapine for mother and child bettered the Thailand results
at a cost of only $4 per infant, compared to $60 for AZT.
</P>
<P>
   5. OFFER DEBT RELIEF: AIDS, like many other diseases on the
African continent, remains overwhelmingly a disease of poverty. As
long as African nations must function under extreme financial
constraints, they will not be able to build the roads, water
systems and hospitals needed to treat the epidemic. South African
president Thabo Mbeki is expected to ask the world's leading
industrial powers for $100 billion in debt relief to free up money
to battle Africa's health problems. It is a big number. So is the
number of HIV infections in the developing world.

arrive alone, a solitary mother, wife or girlfriend there to
support a scorned defendant or bring to life a murder victim. They
are the families of accused criminals and crime victims, and they
are all in some form of mourning. They often display remarkable
grace and loyalty, but in just as many instances, those families
that show up show a more fallible side. Fights break out.
Relationships in the process of coming apart unravel completely in

the gentrified outer reaches of the New York metropolitan area, is

   VANGOGH-PORTRAITS (Boston) _ Despite a reputation for antisocial

held a series of face-the-public jobs, as an apprentice art dealer,
a schoolteacher and an evangelical preacher. Van Gogh is surrounded
by people, and very much part of the crowd, in ``Van Gogh: Face to

when mid-Manhattan was the automotive Acropolis of America. But
there was such a time. And there was such a place: Automobile Row,
a one-and-a-half mile stretch of Broadway from the 40s to the 70s,
lined with car makers, tire companies and dealerships by the
dozens. Bedazzled buyers could find the ``Three P's'' of luxury

   MINNEAPOLIS _ What had once been an 8-1 eighth-inning laugher
gradually faded into a life-and-death situation, with five
ninth-inning Minnesota runs already home and the tying run a bloop
or bleeder away on second base.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been the worst loss of the first half, period. And
there have been some beauties.
</P>
<P>
   Notice the tense. What woulda or coulda happened didn't happen.
There are good vibes floating around the Boston Red Sox right now,
and The Worst That Could Happen didn't. Derek Lowe induced Matt
Lawton into a grounder to second, and the 8-7 W was in the books.
And nothing was going to keep Jimy Williams from feeling good about
his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``No bad feelings whatsoever,'' said the skipper. ``It goes in
the lefthand column, and that's what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   How this one got there might matter even more. While there was
more of the offensive thunder that characterized this four-game
sweep of Tom Kelly's Twins, the feel-good story was the poised,
professional, and definitely most welcome six-hit, one-run,
zero-walk performance of 22-year-old righthander Paxton Crawford,
who picked up the first win of his major league career.
</P>
<P>
   Young Mr. C was supposed to be a onetime gap-plugger, wasn't he?
He was supposed to do what he could last Saturday in Chicago and
then pack his bags and head to coal mining country in Scranton and
Wilkes-Barre, where he could make a start for the PawSox. But he
looked much better than the final pitching line in his 5 1/3
innings Saturday, and he looked like a serious major league pitcher
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I'm telling you,'' said Crawford. ``I'm tickled to death.
This is one of the happiest days of my life. My first big league
win. And the way my teammates reacted. I was getting hugs.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched extremely well,'' said Jason Varitek. ``It's nice
to see somebody get us through seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford was staked to a quick 2-0 lead when Carl Everett drew a
two-out walk from Brad Radke, Minnesota's new $36 million man, and
Nomar Garciaparra hopped on a 3-0 pitch and drove it over the
Office Max sign in deep left-center for the first of his two home
runs. And the sound! Let's just say they don't sound like that
when, no offense, Manny Alexander or Jeff Frye manages to poke one
over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford gave a run back in the first, but it could have been
worse because the inning started with men on the corners with
nobody out and yet only one man scored, and that via a Ron Coomer
sacrifice fly. He knew he was in the Bigs in the second when Frye
flashed some serious leather, first running down a foul pop down
the first base line, and then turning a snappy 4-6-3 double play to
erase David Ortiz, who had singled. He got help from both Cristian
Guzman and Everett in the third. With men on first and second and
one out, Lawton flied to medium-deep center. Cummings moved to
third, but Guzman foolishly tried to challenge Everett's arm and
was erased, 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   From then on it was ``The Paxton Crawford Show.'' The kid
retired 10 in a row and 13 of his final 14, the only blemish being
a one-out Corey Koskie double in the seventh. Crawford's reaction
to that aberrational occurrence was to get Ortiz on a foul pop and
then fog pitch No. 102, a high-rising fastball, past Chad Moeller
for only his second strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one had a little hair on it,'' Varitek advised.
</P>
<P>
   By that time he had a 8-1 lead. The Sox got two in the fourth
when Frye _ notice how often you've been reading that name of late?
_ singled and Brian Daubach launched a bomb to dead center for home
run No. 14. That made him the 11th Boston player to homer in this
four-game series, which, if not a verifiable record, is still an
amazing factoid. Two more runs came across in the sixth when
Everett walked and Nomar smacked Radke's first pitch for a garden
variety line-drive homer to left. The final two came courtesy of a
Daubach two-run double down the right-field line in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   There was a scary moment in the eighth. Rheal Cormier was on the
mound when Jay Canizaro hit a one-out fly to left. Troy O'Leary
came in, calling off Garciaparra, who unsuccessfully tried to avoid
colliding with his teammate. Nomar rammed O'Leary in the chest,
forcing him from the game. Afterward, Nomar was in a joking mood,
but O'Leary, a man of few words in almost any circumstance, was
visibly annoyed when questioned about it. ``I'm fine,'' he said
tersely.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Young was on in the ninth with an 8-2 lead but he didn't
handle things very well, hitting Koskie and giving up a two-run
homer to Ortiz. When he walked Moeller, Williams called upon Lowe
for the 38th time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe wasn't as bad as his line would indicate, giving up two
ground ball singles and a check-swing single. The fact is he got
the man he had to get in order to save the game.
</P>
<P>
   And the facts are that in this four-game series the Red Sox had
44 runs and 53 hits, 28 for extra bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our attitude's a little different now,'' said Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   You think?

HOME RUNS HELP ANGELS EARN SERIES SPLIT

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It might have been difficult to find someone
in the Anaheim Angels clubhouse to say Thursday night's game
against the Seattle Mariners was more important than any other
game. But it was.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels began the night seven games behind the first-place
Mariners in the AL West, and a loss would have left them eight
games out going into the weekend series before the All-Star break.
Also, the Angels won't play the Mariners again until the final
three games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So their 5-1 victory before 18,790 at Edison Field was big in a
sense. It meant the Angels are now six games out, and only three
behind second- place Oakland, which is the wild-card leader. The
Angels split the four-game series against the Mariners, although
Seattle has won six of 10 overall against them this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels did it by making the most of what little they had on
this night. They got only five hits, but two were home runs by Mo
Vaughn (No. 22) and Tim Salmon (No. 18).
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Jarrod Washburn (5-2) managed to get through
just five innings, but he didn't allow a run and gave up only four
hits. Mike Fyhrie relieved Washburn to start the sixth and gave up
one run in 2 innings. Mark Petkovsek (1 scoreless innings) finished
it off.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad led off the Angels' half of the first inning with a
single but was thrown out at second on a botched hit-and-run
attempt when Orlando Palmeiro swung and missed. It cost the Angels
a run because Vaughn followed with his home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels lost another run in the third inning after another
attempted hit-and-run, only this time it was first-base umpire Mike
Winters who cost the Angels. Erstad led off the inning with a walk
and was on his way to second on a pitch to Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro reached out and slapped the ball into the ground on the
infield grass. Shortstop Alex Rodriguez initially broke to cover
second but recovered in time to field the ball. His throw to first
was obviously late to get Palmeiro, but Winters called him out
anyway, drawing a protest from Angels manager Mike Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   It ended up costing the Angels a run because one out later,
Salmon hit a home run, good for two runs instead of three.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washburn seemed to struggle but got big outs when he
needed them. With Jay Buhner on second (double) and David Bell on
first (walk) with two out in the second, Washburn got Joe Oliver on
a liner to right.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Stan Javier and Rodriguez singled with two
out, bringing up Edgar Martinez. But Washburn struck him on with a
91-mph fastball on a 3-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, the Mariners had runners on first and second with
none out and the heart of the lineup due up. But Washburn struck
out Javier, then got a break when Mark McLemore's baserunning
blunder resulted in an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit a liner to the gap in left-center, but the ball
stayed up long enough for left fielder Erstad to run it down.
McLemore, however, broke from second, rounded third and was doubled
up easily to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   That marked the end for Washburn, who threw five scoreless
innings but needed 97 pitches to do it. He walked three and struck
out five. In his past six starts, Washburn has allowed two runs or
fewer five times. Thursday was only the second time in those six
starts he hasn't pitched into the seventh inning.

SPARKS STREAK REACHES 11

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ With WNBA President Val Ackerman in
attendance, the Los Angeles Sparks stretched the league's best
winning streak of the season to 11 against the gutsy Washington
Mystics.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie led five Sparks in double figures with a game-high
21 points as Los Angeles kept its home record perfect at eight with
a 79-70 victory at the Forum on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mystics (8-8) tried the spoil the Sparks' visit from the
president with a late run. Washington star Chamique Holdsclaw, who
had a relatively quiet first half, helped trim an 11-point Sparks
lead to two with 4:53 to play.
</P>
<P>
   But Sparks center Lisa Leslie, Holdsclaw's Olympic teammate,
scored her 19th point on a layup and Washington got no closer.
</P>
<P>
   The victory brings the Sparks within four games of the
league-record 15- game win streak set by the Houston Comets in
1998. The three-time defending champions remain a half-game ahead
of the Sparks (16-2) in the Western Conference after their win over
Seattle on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second Sparks game for Ackerman, who was in
Sacramento Wednesday for the Sparks' 76-61 victory. She spoke of
the low overall attendance, which she contributed to the
early-season start to accommodate the USA team members in the
Olympics. The Sparks' DeLisha Milton and the Mystics' Nikki McCray
join Leslie and Holdsclaw on the national team. Ackerman was
optimistic about the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our history has been that July and August have been our better
months,'' she said. ``We'd like to see our attendance get better.``
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which drew 5,109 Thursday, has the ninth lowest
home attendance average (6,090), despite the second-best record in
the league and an 8-0 mark at home. Earlier this year the franchise
was awarded a 10-year operating contract extension, indicating the
league's confidence in the Sparks' organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think L.A. has great potential to be a great market for
women's basketball,`` Ackerman said. ``We have a lot of confidence
in the market. There's a lot of support from (Lakers owner) Jerry
Buss. ... Personally, I'm grateful to Jerry for being behind the
league.``
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back on the court the Sparks were trying to win the
series against the Mystics, who they defeated 74-72 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks led by as many as 13 in the first half, but
Washington got back on track with the resurgence of Holdsclaw. She
scored 12 of her 16 points in the second half, including five of
six in the run that trim the Sparks lead to 66-64 with less than
five minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sparks held strong defensively. With a minute to play
Mwadi Mabika blocked a shot and Ukari Figgs drove the court for a
diving layup to make it 76-69.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie added 13 rebounds and two blocks shots to her efforts,
while Allison Feaster came off the bench to contribute 14 points.
Mabika and DeLisha Milton had 13 points apiece and Tamecka Dixon
had 12.
</P>
<P>
   McCray had 20 points for Washington, which saw its two-game win
streak end.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie and Dixon scored 21 of the Sparks 42 first-half points.
The Sparks stretched the game out early, building a 18-10 margin
after getting six consecutive points by Dixon, a 3-pointer from
Mabika and a 18-foot jumper from Leslie. They led by as much as 13
when Dixon knocked down a 3-pointer at the 3:32 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks shot 47 percent to take a 42-31 lead at the half.

</P>
<P>
   After the victory, many Angels conceded it was an important
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big game for us,'' Fyhrie said. ``Anyone who says it
wasn't, I think they'd be lying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you're ever satisfied with a split, but we won
two games against a very hot club,'' Angels manager Scioscia said.
``Obviously, it was a big game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won despite having to nurse Washburn through his five
innings. He had a couple of knots in his back that needed work
between innings. He said it didn't affect his pitching, but he made
97 pitches in just five innings, accelerating his departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't real pleased with the way I threw,'' said Washburn,
who walked three and struck out five. ``But I kept putting up
zeroes and we won the game, so I have to be happy with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think I can pitch like that every five days and
win. I have to improve on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Washburn struggled, he got big outs when he needed them.
With Jay Buhner on second (double) and David Bell on first (walk)
with two out in the second inning, Washburn got Joe Oliver on a
liner to right.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Stan Javier and Alex Rodriguez singled with
two outs, bringing up Edgar Martinez. But Washburn struck him on
with a 91-mph fastball on a 3-2 pitch.

   In the fifth, the Mariners had runners on first and second with
none out and the heart of the lineup due up. But Washburn struck
out Javier, then got a break when Mark McLemore's baserunning
blunder resulted in an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit a liner to the gap in left-center, but the ball
stayed up long enough for left fielder Darin Erstad to run it down.
McLemore, however, broke from second, rounded third and was doubled
up easily to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In his past six starts, Washburn has allowed two runs or fewer
five times. Thursday was only the second time in those six starts
he hasn't pitched into the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy shows you every start what he's made of,'' Scioscia
said. ``It's why he's going to be a consistent winner in the major
leagues. He doesn't back off. He knows he can get the ball where he
needs to in tough situations.''

 ANGELS CHASE ABBOTT, ENDS SEATTLE`s STREAK  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Mariners came away from a big road trip
with a winning record, but a losing feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to its inability to hit Anaheim lefty Jarrod Washburn,
Seattle lost to Anaheim, 5-1, Thursday night. The Mariners return
to Safeco Field Fridan night for a series against Los Angeles
having won four of seven on the road swing through Texas and
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our record could have been better, but it is what it is,''
second baseman Mark McLemore said. ``It's over, so now we have to
concentrate on (Friday).''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners return home to Safeco in much better position than
when they left a week ago. Seattle left with a half-game lead over
Oakland in the American League West. Going into the opener against
L.A., the Mariners have a three-game lead over the suddenly
slumping A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased, I really am,'' Seattle skipper Lou Piniella said.
``It wasn't an easy trip, and we knew it wasn't going to be before
we left. But any time you go on the road and come back with a
winning record, you have to be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we were able to pick up ground in the division and not
lose any. From that perspective, you've got to be pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were pleased, too, because a loss Thursday would have
put a crimp in their hopes to be competitive in the AL West.
Seattle had taken two of the first three, and had the Mariners won,
the third-place Angels would have been eight games out of first.
Now, they're only six back.
</P>
<P>
   They made up ground because they were able to convert a couple
of Paul Abbott pitches into runs early in the game. Abbott allowed
just three hits in the first five innings, but among them were
homers by Mo Vaughn (a solo shot in the first) and Tim Salmon (a
two-run bomb in the third) that put the Mariners in a hole.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott had pitched well enough to claim a spot in the rotation
the second half of the season. He was 4-0 in June and July. But
nothing concerning his status as a starter has been finalized, so a
good outing Thursday was Priority No. 1 for Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   The early homers hurt him, and he got chased from the game in
the sixth when he walked two, setting the Angels up for the final
two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbott pitched well for five innings,'' Piniella said. ``But
he seemed to get tired in the sixth.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only Mariner to feel that way. McLemore talked
about the club looking ``a little flat'' Thursday night. Shortstop
Alex Rodriguez said, ``the energy of the club has been really good
lately, but tonight the energy wasn't as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella noticed it. He wouldn't admit to the club being tired,
but he noticed the dropoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you this, I'm going to rest the entire team some
over the weekend,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those getting time off might be center fielder Mike
Cameron, who was scratched from the lineup just before the game
started. He has a sore right knee that is the result of a run-in
the outfielder had with the Edison Field wall.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the Cameron-less Mariners lose, Piniella said he
planned to ``use my bench this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Mariners fatigue had to do with Washburn, who
pitched well enough to take advantage of any lapse of energy on
Seattle's part.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn surprised Seattle with his pitch selection, then was
out of the game before the Mariners could adapt. He pitched just
five innings, but the Mariners didn't touch him for a run and only
had four hits. Even so, it was obvious he was tiring by the fifth,
closing in on 100 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The lefty, who had a no-hitter for six innings in his previous
start, against Oakland July 1, came into the game with one previous
appearance against Seattle, a win in a start in Anaheim two years
ago. When he was done after five innings and 97 pitches, he left
with a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Although his pitch total was high, he only walked three and no
runner got past second base. Seattle's only run came against the
bullpen when Jay Buhner singled home Edgar Martinez in the eighth,
averting the shutout.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' one charge at Washburn was set up by a McLemore
single and a walk to Rickey Henderson to open the fifth inning.
Washburn battled back to strike out Stan Javier, but Rodriguez
lined a shot to left-center. McLemore said he assumed the ball
would drop for a double, but left fielder Darin Erstad ran down the
ball and McLemore was doubled off base. End of rally. End of
Washburn, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they could tell we were getting closer to getting
him,'' Rodriguez said. ``But he surprised us. He threw a lot of
fastballs, really challenged us, which we weren't expecting. I
think the next time we see him, it might be a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   It may take a while. The Mariners and Angels don't play again
until the final weekend of the season.

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For once, hyperbole is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   In confounding pollsters and pundits by choosing Vicente Fox as
their next president last Sunday, Mexicans did far more than change
their government. They ended seven decades of rule by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), put a whole era in
Mexico's history behind them and turned their country into a real
democracy at last.
</P>
<P>
   All that is to be celebrated, but so too is the peaceful manner
of the PRI's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   It was always far more than a political party. It was a system
of government and of social organization which had its roots in
every corner of Mexican life. After slowly withering for the past
two decades, one-party rule is now dead.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in Mexico's history, one regime has given way
to another without large-scale bloodshed. For that, and for
overseeing the essential final stage of that process, much credit
goes to President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he create an independent electoral authority, which
ensured that last Sunday's vote was the cleanest ever in Mexico,
passing any reasonable test of freedom and fairness. His swift
acknowledgment on election night of Fox's victory also avoided any
possibility that lingering uncertainty might lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   It helped, too, that Fox won by a clear margin of some seven
percentage points. That was a personal triumph: his stubborn
campaigning and charisma drew support from far beyond his own
conservative National Action Party (PAN).
</P>
<P>
   Both the victor and his voters carry messages about the deeper
meaning of Mexico's election.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is in many ways an untypical Mexican politician. Of
immigrant descent (with an Irish grandfather and a Spanish mother),
he is a Jesuit-educated Catholic, a man who in a different country
would be a Christian Democrat, but who has built bridges to the
left with some populist touches.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a rugged individualist, a businessman whose career
has included a stint running Coca-Cola's Mexican operation. Those
who voted for Fox were disproportionately young, urban and
better-educated.
</P>
<P>
   In a real sense, therefore, his victory personifies the dynamic,
emerging Mexico being molded by the North American Free-Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) _ a Mexico which, for all its social problems and
inequalities, is now less suspicious of the free market and of the
United States than it has been in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a vote, too, against the PRI. Despite the reforms
of the past three presidents, and despite Zedillo's success in
restoring economic growth after the peso's collapse in 1994-95,
average real incomes in Mexico are still below their 1982 level,
and inequality, corruption and crime have flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Fox now carries a heavy burden of expectations _ not least
because, under the PRI, Mexico made kings of its presidents for
their six-year terms (and nobodies thereafter).
</P>
<P>
   In office, he will command enormous powers of patronage. He
should resist the temptation to use them, and instead devolve power
away from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That means, for example, turning Mexican federalism from fiction
to fact by fulfilling his promise to give more power to the states
and to municipal governments, though without creating new fiscal
burdens.
</P>
<P>
   Fox this week promised to make tackling corruption his priority.
That is needed and welcome, but reform of the PRI state should mean
more than that. It means turning a venal bureaucracy into a
professional civil service, instilling a new ethos of independence
into a politicized judiciary, and drumming both professionalism and
integrity into corrupt and incompetent police forces.
</P>
<P>
   The new president faces other challenges, too. Sustaining
economic growth, especially given the likelihood of a slowdown in
the United States, which takes 90 percent of Mexico's exports, will
require further reform _ urgently so in the energy sector, which
remains a state monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Fox backed away from earlier plans to
privatize Pemex, the state oil company. But, rightly, he wants to
end its monopoly, and to open up the electricity market too.
</P>
<P>
   The third challenge lies in turning the state into an instrument
of social progress. Mexico needs to spend more, but more wisely, on
education and health. That means raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Past governments have depended too much on milking Pemex. But
the most effective tax reform would involve abolishing VAT
exemptions, such as those on food. This would hit the poor hard;
they will need help.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, many Mexicans who might otherwise be sympathetic to Fox
are scared by his social conservatism, his opposition to abortion
and his party's clerical roots. He needs to reassure them that he
will not be illiberal in such matters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his clear mandate for change, Fox faces some big
handicaps. Unlike his predecessors, he did not win a majority of
the votes cast. And although the PAN has displaced the PRI as the
largest party in Congress, it lacks an overall majority.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the PRI still controls many state governments. Fox
could face sabotage from officials who fear they might suffer in a
clean-up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, more than most parties, the PRI may find that its
traditional strength will be sapped by opposition. And by
signalling his intention to form a government of national unity, in
which he may include individuals from all parties, Fox is doing
more than send a message of continuity to the markets.
</P>
<P>
   He may be trying to redraw Mexico's political map. Fox's
election thus promises many welcome changes. But there are some
risks. One lies in the fact that Fox is not due to take office
until Dec. 1. That five-month gap is a legacy of the old system,
and it has often bred turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Encouragingly, Fox and Zedillo have both pledged to do
everything they can to ensure a smooth handover. Even so, Mexico's
democratic era will start not a moment too soon. &QL;

<P>
   ``If it smells, put a lid on it,'' goes an old Japanese proverb.
But it is the wrong prescription for the 30-odd lawsuits that have
been lodged in California against Japanese companies such as
Mitsubishi and Mitsui on behalf of many Asians and some Allied
prisoners of war who were forced into slave labor during the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   The response of both the government and the companies to all
such claims has been to point to the 1951 San Francisco peace
treaty. Besides waiving ``all reparation claims of the Allied
Powers, other claims of the Allied Powers and their nationals''
against Japan, the treaty empowered the allies to seize Japanese
property to pay reparations to former servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   By 1952, America had seized $90 million of Japanese assets and
paid some of it to former prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Germany made no such settlement after its defeat, says Japan, so
the $5.2 billion fund organized by its government last year to
compensate wartime slave laborers is not a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   This hard-line defense has fended off lawsuits in Japan itself.
But it may not work in California.
</P>
<P>
   As German firms have found to their cost, there is now a
well-organized lobby with political clout in America. The shameless
theatrics of Edward Fagan, the American lawyer who championed the
reparation claims against the German companies, look ominous.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan launched his class-action suit against the Japanese
companies on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor in December. There is
certainly an unappealing whiff of blackmail about these latest
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a quick settlement of them is in all likelihood in Japan's
commercial interests. Otherwise the hostility that has begun to
build in America, where Japanese exporters sell so many goods,
could do serious damage.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement would also be morally right, despite the passing of
time. The surviving laborers, especially the many who were not
POWs, have a strong case for compensation from somebody: the
question is who.
</P>
<P>
   To land the bill on today's shareholders seems capricious. In
many cases, the companies and their managers changed when Japan's
prewar zaibatsu were broken up. And it is hard to argue that
today's shareholders have reaped huge benefits from uncompensated
slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying perpetrator of these and other crimes was the
then government; it is right that its successor should settle
claims today, although companies might be invited to make voluntary
contributions to any settlement fund.
</P>
<P>
   There is another good argument for such a government-organized
settlement. Demands for reparations are becoming entangled with the
whole question of Japan's war guilt and contrition.
</P>
<P>
   One bill before America's House of Representatives demands,
along with reparations, an apology from Japan for its war actions;
California's state government has also asked for an ``unambiguous
apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated Japanese officials maintain that the country has
already satisfied foreigners wanting apologies. But the wording of
these apologies suggests that the government is still seeking a
compromise with those in Japan who are struggling to come to terms
with the facts of Japanese history.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a stream of senior Japanese politicians has
found it necessary to deny colonial brutality in Korea, the rape of
Nanking in China or the ill-effects of Japanese expansion in Asia.
The current prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, has himself wondered
aloud in parliament whether Japan really launched a war of
aggression against its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder that allied prisoners of war, Asian slave
laborers, ``comfort women'' and other victims should still be
seeking justice. A government-sponsored settlement would be a
welcome sign that Japan is at last coming to terms with its past. &QL;

<P>
   The task is vast. Last October Abdurrahman Wahid was given the
presidency of one of the world's largest countries, spread across
17,000 islands and with numerous ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Run as a dictatorship for more than 30 years, Indonesia was rife
with corruption, desperately short of honest judges and policemen,
and full of groups with the money, the arms and the influence to
cause trouble.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, the country's first democratically elected
president inherited an economy crippled by a collapsing currency,
collapsing banks and companies collapsing under their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and by the way, President Wahid is half-blind and was
weakened by a near-fatal stroke two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes it scarcely surprising that Gus Dur, as
President Wahid is affectionately known, is finding it hard to get
his country moving firmly in a better direction.
</P>
<P>
   Separatist and interreligious violence refuses to die down,
especially in Aceh and the Moluccas, where this week a state of
emergency had to be declared. Gus Dur has even let it be known that
he blames some members of the ``political elite'' for inciting some
of the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth has begun to sputter back into life, but the
improvement is too recent, fragile and small to have yet made much
difference to the lives of ordinary Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption remains a festering sore. No senior people from the
old dictatorial regime of President Suharto have yet been found
guilty or even brought to court. This week bombs were found in the
offices of the attorney-general, Marzuki Darusman, the man leading
the anti-corruption investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Gus Dur needs to be given time to get a grip on all this; a
country in this sort of condition cannot be changed overnight. Yet
the patience of other politicians, of the media, even of his own
supporters is running out.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the explanation doubtless lies in unreasonable
expectations of the magic that this saintly Muslim cleric could
provide. Some lies in the ambitions of political rivals who would
be happy to profit from his failure.
</P>
<P>
   Much, however, is his own fault. In recent months, he has done
little to earn the patience even of his sympathizers, and much to
infuriate them.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, President Wahid will face a series of
political tests. He has been called before parliament to explain
his abrupt dismissal earlier this year of two economics ministers.
</P>
<P>
   And in August a meeting of the full parliament, designated as a
constitutional assembly, will meet to hear his report on the state
of the nation and to decide, as it is empowered to do, whether to
allow him to continue as president.
</P>
<P>
   He will probably survive these tests, but on sufferance. He
would greatly strengthen his position, both before and after the
assembly meets, if he were to do two things.
</P>
<P>
   The first sounds simple: reshuffle his cabinet, particularly the
economic portfolios. The Jakarta rumor mill has it that this has
already been made possible by a deal between the main power brokers
in the government _ his vice-president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, and
Akbar Tandjung, who heads Golkar, part of the governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   President Wahid has had to govern with a cabinet largely imposed
on him by his coalition partners. Now, they want to give him a
freer hand, which is welcome, though it comes with a sting: if he
now fails, all the fault can be laid at his door.
</P>
<P>
   Even Amien Rais, a rabble-rouser who will chair the August
assembly and is one of the president's fiercest critics, appears to
accept that, after this reshuffle, Wahid should be given a further
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gus Dur needs to exploit this opportunity. He is a famously
wily, ambiguous character who likes to get his way by dividing, or
baffling, his opponents. This has worked well in his efforts to
gain control of the armed forces. But it is proving disastrous in
economic matters.
</P>
<P>
   He has set up a series of councils of advisers to act as a
parallel source of thinking to the ministries, but has left even
the councils baffled as to who is in charge of what. The ministers
are either inadequate, or undermined by the councils and the
president, or both.
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous reshuffle, bringing in new economics ministers who
are competent and who clearly have the president's backing, offers
the only chance for a new start that could stabilize the currency,
privatize the piles of nationalized assets, and clear a huge
backlog of disputed corporate debts.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing that Gus Dur must do concerns corruption. Even
if the task of reestablishing the rule of law is vast, he must show
businesses and the public at large that his government is moving
decisively in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest obstacles to that is the perception _ so far
justified _ that nothing much has changed from the bad old days of
Suharto. The powerful still act with impunity and use bribes or
muscles to get their way.
</P>
<P>
   President Wahid needs rapidly to show that this is going to
change, by bringing one of the most notoriously corrupt to court,
and thence to prison. Ex-President Suharto himself would be a fine
place to start, but failing that one of his family would do.
</P>
<P>
   In his wily way, President Wahid knows full well the power of a
demonstrative act. He cannot fight every battle simultaneously. But
he needs to make some impressive moves and achieve some more
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, in a year from now, Gus Dur will be out of office.
And the alternatives are far from promising. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Americans may come to look back on 2000 as a
decisive political year. The reason will not be the election of
President Gore or President Bush, but the election of President
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The victory of Vicente Fox in Mexico seems like a vindication of
Americans' belief in the possibility of worldwide political
progress.
</P>
<P>
   It would be too much to say that the man who persuaded Mexicans
to drink Coca-Cola has now got them to swallow another American
export, since democracy is neither specifically American, nor a
fizzy consumable _ and there is always a chance that the vanquished
PRI may return.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fox's victory is another big stride away from autocracy,
following the victories of opposition parties in South Korea and
Taiwan in the past three years and the spread of democracy
throughout Latin America and Eastern Europe in the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, this week's election marks the moment when the
worldwide trend towards greater democratization washed back over
the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   There are around 20 million Mexicans in America, making it
easily the most important mother country for immigrants. Mexicans
are also the fastest growing group of new American citizens,
accounting for a fifth of the total. As a result, their country is
becoming a touchstone of sorts for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fostering relations with Mexico has become a way for American
politicians to display their credentials as people mindful of
America's future as a multi-ethnic nation.
</P>
<P>
   When Gray Davis became governor of California he invited so many
Mexican politicians to his inauguration that people joked it would
have been more convenient to hold the ceremony in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's election came one day after the moment when whites
officially became a minority in California. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing represents the growing domestic significance of Mexico
better than the family history of the Bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott Bush, a senator from Connecticut, epitomized the
Waspish traditions of the Eastern Seaboard. George Bush began the
drift to the Southwest by moving to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, with his halting Spanish, won 49 percent of the
Latino vote on reelection as governor of Texas partly by reaching
out towards Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   His nephew, George P. Bush, whose mother is Mexican and who
speaks fluent Spanish, represents the next stage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Mexico's significance in American domestic politics
has grown over many years. That has nothing to do with Fox. But his
triumph owes much to one vital event in that process.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in part, a vote for the North American Free-Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) and, by extension, it is a vindication of the
strategy of successive American presidents of seeking to influence
foreign countries' behavior by opening up their markets to trade.
</P>
<P>
   That trade tends to promote freedom is often doubted _ most
recently at the time of the congressional vote to grant permanent
normal trade relations to China this June.
</P>
<P>
   Trade liberalization is obviously not a sufficient condition for
democracy, since there are free-trading autocracies. But as the
Mexican vote suggests, trade and freedom are disposed to go
together.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a case in which the political elite chose to open up to
trade against their own narrow self-interest. Once trade
liberalization is achieved, political liberalization can be kept at
bay only at an ever-higher cost.
</P>
<P>
   Though the parallels between Mexico and China should not be
pressed far, it is worth remembering that 25 years before Mexico
signed NAFTA, it had a Tiananmen Square massacre of its own.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 the president ordered his troops to open fire on
students protesting in Mexico City. Hundreds died. And though
Mexico's authoritarian history is not nearly as long as China's,
its habits of government antedate even the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's victory makes it that much harder to argue that any
country's political traditions or habits of thought leave it
invulnerable to economic liberalization. For the Chinese Communist
Party, too, this was an important election.
</P>
<P>
   This is all very satisfactory for the United States. But not
entirely so. Some consequences of this week's election will be
uncomfortable for America, however desirable for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the American relationship with its southern neighbor
has been a partnership of unequals, with Mexico the prickly,
reluctant supplicant, America the condescending benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   This had advantages for the United States. It could negotiate
bilateral deals with the Mexican president with the expectation
that they would be implemented in full, without any subsequent
revisions. NAFTA is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   That will change. In a democratic Mexico, the new president will
be more constrained by his local constituencies and Washington will
find it harder to get its way. Relations with Mexico will become
negotiations of political equals _ more like those with Germany (on
a good day) or France (on a bad one).
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, this must mean rethinking American policy
towards its southern neighbor. The two countries now talk past one
another. America wants to discuss drugs and illegal immigration.
Mexico wants to discuss legal migration, poverty, foreign
investment and trade flows.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one day the two will be able to have a rational
discussion about immigration. Perhaps one day the border between
the two will be as airy and open as that with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   This would be no bad thing. But the impact will be a balance of
gains and losses, not an unalloyed benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of Mexico into a real democracy may even
subtly change how Americans see their place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must always remember,'' said John McCain earlier this year,
``that America is a beacon of hope and freedom.'' This notion _
that America is engaged in a battle for democracy _ runs deep. It
plays a vital role in maintaining the domestic constituency for the
country's continued engagement in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's election, which leaves the United States as just one part
of a North American democracy that stretches from the Arctic Circle
to well below the Tropic of Cancer, is another victory in that
crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet paradoxically, this crusade's growing success may make it
harder to keep alive the idea that America is a special beacon. For
how can you do that as more and more countries get lights of their
own? &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ America's 400 teaching hospitals may not immediately
resemble ``Tom Brown's Schooldays,'' but for young resident
doctors, life at a 19th-century English public school might seem
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   As new boys (and girls), young trainee doctors are expected to
work until they drop, often completing 100-hour weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Once they have qualified, the Flashmans then go on to inflict
the same dire regime on the next generation of young doctors,
telling them that, yes, it will be good for them too.
</P>
<P>
   Being one of America's 100,000 medical interns or residents is
certainly a hard life. Lack of sleep is the most common complaint.
But there are others.
</P>
<P>
   A survey published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association in 1998 found that 93 percent of trainee doctors
experienced at least one incident of mistreatment by a teacher, and
more than half reported episodes of being belittled or humiliated
by more senior physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Around 70 percent of the trainees reported seeing colleagues
working in an impaired condition, most often caused by lack of
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Young surgeons seem particularly exposed to overwork and
harassment. Last year, the National Labor Relations Board
overturned an earlier ruling that prevented American trainee
doctors at private hospitals from joining trade unions. (Residents
have been allowed to join unions at public hospitals for some time,
but more than 90 percent of them learn their trade at private
hospitals.)
</P>
<P>
   The original ruling, handed down in 1976, officially classified
medical residents as ``students'' rather than ``employees.'' Now
they are free to organize themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of American Medical Colleges, which opposed the
NLRB decision, worries that the threat of strikes or binding
arbitration will undermine the educational mission of hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Cohen, the AAMC's president, calls binding arbitration an
``abhorrent idea'' that would violate the trust between student and
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies, such as one conducted in 1988 by surgeons at the
Medical College of Wisconsin, have come up with the implausible
conclusion that sleep loss had no apparent effect on their
trainees' cognitive performance.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one should be surprised. Surgeons, the most brutal
taskmasters by most measures, are predisposed against finding fault
with the system.
</P>
<P>
   The medical establishment still holds most of the trump cards.
Senior physicians have enormous power over a trainee's future
career. But pressure for change may be mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Medical residents are complaining that a longstanding New York
state law limiting their hours to a mere 80 hours a week has been
ineffective, and the state health department has repeatedly fined
hospitals for violations.
</P>
<P>
   Around 400 residents at two private New York hospitals recently
voted to join the Committee of Interns and Residents, a union
affiliated with the Service Employees International Union which
already represents 10,000 people (mostly from public hospitals).
</P>
<P>
   According to Michael Phelan, CIR's organizing director, the
response of residents in the private sector to the NLRB decision
has been ``phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   The union has gained nearly 1,000 new members since the NLRB
ruling, and the number of inquiries received by the union from
interested doctors has tripled. All this could lead to increased
leverage for the union movement in America's teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Patients might gain if unionization occurs. At a public forum
last year, hundreds of New York medical residents confessed that
fatigue had led to close calls.
</P>
<P>
   A Veterans Affairs Medical Center study back in 1991 found that
changing work schedules to give doctors more rest resulted in 29
percent fewer errors to do with medication.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, staff costs for hospitals would rise if trainees
worked shorter hours. But the Veterans study also showed that
gentler schedules could cut the amount of time patients spend in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a small chink opened up in the medical establishment's
armor. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education,
which oversees the training of American doctors, cited nearly one
in three of the programs it reviews for violating existing
standards for working hours.
</P>
<P>
   Surgical programs came in for a particular pasting, with more
than half the pediatric surgery programs exceeding the maximum
allowable hours on duty.
</P>
<P>
   The CIR smells a rat: it thinks the new enforcement efforts
might be a Flashman-like ploy to reduce the appeal of unions. But
most young doctors will be grateful for respite of any sort. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Freedom is one of those words that politicians bandy
around a great deal over the July 4th holiday. Few practical
freedoms seem to matter to Americans more than the ability to drive
their own set of wheels wherever they want, whenever they want _
and to have cheap gasoline to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, gas is suddenly not nearly as cheap as Americans
would like; and even though this is probably a temporary
phenomenon, it is already causing a political fuss.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, prices at the pump have soared to record highs
(in nominal terms at least). In parts of the country, they have
gone past $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have been full of pictures of mournful car drivers
staring at gas pump nozzles and faded images of their parents
queuing for gas during the Carter years.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in Congress want to scrap the tiny federal
tax on gasoline (about 18 cents a gallon) altogether. Indiana and
Illinois have suspended their tiny state taxes. Both Al Gore and
George W. Bush have responded to the ``crisis'' by saying how much
they hate high gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, the American motorist's outrage has already cured
itself. The high level of gas prices in America is the chief reason
why Saudi Arabia shocked the oil markets this week by announcing
unilaterally that it would release more oil shortly.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this was a simple commercial decision: the American
economy is the goose that lays the golden egg for OPEC, and
sustained high energy prices threaten to drag the miracle economy
into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the answer, though, lies in politics: Saudi
Arabia relies heavily on American goodwill and soldiers for
protection from Iraqi bogeyman Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Although this dependence embarrasses the Saudis in front of
militant brethren like Iran, it is also why they always take the
angry phone calls from Bill Richardson, America's energy secretary,
demanding lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that energy policy will soon fade from the
political landscape? Not necessarily. One reason is that drivers
may not see much relief before the summer is over.
</P>
<P>
   Unless this week's news prompts a split in the cartel and so a
collapse in crude-oil prices, retail-gasoline prices in America may
not drop dramatically before the end of the summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   There is also likely to be another burst of consumer outrage as
America's overloaded and decaying electricity grid succumbs to
blackouts, like the one that plunged parts of Northern California's
Silicon Valley into darkness a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Colder weather will bring little relief: natural-gas prices are
also soaring, and low stocks of heating oil suggest a possible
repeat of last year's winter oil-price crunch.
</P>
<P>
   This week President Bill Clinton vowed to create a
home-heating-oil reserve for the Northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case in particular, there are good reasons to keep oil
prices in the spotlight: they provide an easy link to Bush's ties
to the oil industry, which is currently making record profits. Gore
has already come out fighting, blaming the price spike on the Big
Oil pals of his rival.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has ordered the Federal Trade
Commission to investigate possible price-gouging in Midwestern
states, where price hikes have been steepest.
</P>
<P>
   Forced into a corner, Bush has also meekly voiced support for
the FTC enquiry. He himself pins the blame for the recent price
increases on costly environmental mandates for cleaner gas ordered
by the federal government (by implication: Gore). In this, he has
just been joined by the state of Wisconsin, which has filed a
federal lawsuit to overturn the federal orders.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are being outstandingly hypocritical. For Bush,
who has openly campaigned to defend the interests of the oil
industry, to go suddenly weak at the knees about high oil prices is
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   How Gore, the author of ``Earth in the Balance'' and a keen
proponent of ridding the world of the internal-combustion engine,
can piously insist that he also believes in low energy prices
beggars belief.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, it is not just the two candidates who are talking
rot. The energy industry has once again issued warnings that
America must no longer remain ``hostage'' to foreign oil: it thus
needs not only subsidies but also permission to drill in pristine
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments ignore the fact that the crude-oil market is
global: no American firm is selling its crude any lower than the
world price. And even if America pumped all the oil trapped in
forbidden areas, it would not attain the volumes necessary to
dictate world prices.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what outrages the rest of the world is not how high
American gasoline prices are, but how low.
</P>
<P>
   Today's ``shocking'' prices for gas, adjusted for inflation, are
lower than the prices Americans paid for gas during the oil shock
of two decades ago, and far less than what European or Japanese
drivers pay now.
</P>
<P>
   America guzzles more gas per person than any other big country,
and uses more energy to produce each unit of economic output than
most of its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   If America's politicians were really serious about reducing
OPEC's sway over America, they would consider three things. The
first is tougher fuel-economy rules. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 900) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, an influential green lobby, talks about finding
oil by ``drilling under Detroit.'' The group wants Congress to
stiffen the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which
have led to a steady improvement in the fuel efficiency of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Greens grouse that light trucks and sport-utility vehicles
(SUVs), which now make up about half of the vehicles sold in the
country, are not subject to the same CAFE standards as cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A second, better way to improve fuel efficiency and reduce
reliance on oil would be to increase taxes (or add a tax based on
the carbon content of fuels). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,000) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Since the oil shocks of the 1970s, Europe's energy efficiency
has soared, and now stands about 50 percent higher than America's.
</P>
<P>
   One anecdote is revealing: the average fuel economy of Ford's
cars sold in Europe is far higher than that of those it sells in
America. As a result of its diminished reliance on the mucky stuff,
Europe has weathered the recent surge in the world oil price much
better than America.
</P>
<P>
   A comprehensive carbon tax that took in other fuels, such as
coal, would be much greener than just gasoline taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is supposed to be a passionate believer in them. Yet even
when Bush's campaign has mockingly produced specific passages from
Gore's book about carbon taxes, the vice president has refused to
admit that they would drive up fuel prices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,225) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The final option is to do more about public transport. Americans
undoubtedly love to drive. But there is also a distinct lack of
alternatives: outside the older cities on either coast, public
transport in America is usually a farce.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has just put forward his ``Keep America Moving'' scheme,
which he claims is a $25-billion plan to improve, integrate and
expand such public-transport systems as light rail and bus
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has derided these proposals as a mere rehash of tired
Clinton policies. But they are better than anything he has put
forward. &QL;

   &UR; FEUD OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore accused George W. Bush of lacking compassion for the
disabled. Bush accused the Gore campaign of ``blatant
misrepresentation.'' According to American Disabled for Attendant
Programs Today, a pressure group, Bush has not supported any
disabled programs as governor of Texas, even his father's Americans
with Disabilities Act. Gore's support is also described as
``lukewarm.'' (Salon.com, June 30) &QL;

<P>
   Bush used his 54th birthday on July 6 to add to Republican
coffers. Laura Bush has sent party donors a birthday card (in red,
white and blue, with an outline of Texas and a winding road to the
White House) which she asks to be returned to the governor with a
donation of between $54 and $540. ``If you wish, write George a
personal message,'' she adds. (U.S. News and World Report, July

   AMMAN _ Ask the King of Jordan what knowledge he most lacked
when he unexpectedly came to the throne last year, and he explains
how difficult he has found it to work out the hidden agendas and
personal rivalries among his advisers, ministers and court
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, although he does not put it so bluntly himself,
Abdullah II knew little about Jordanian politics. A lifelong
soldier, he had served as crown prince for only a week before his
father, King Hussein, died.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, thanks to his schooling at military academies in Britain
and America, he could barely get by in the language of his
subjects. ``The king's Arabic has improved,'' says one, ``but he
still has trouble with his h's and his r's.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Jordanians were hoping for other improvements too,
especially to their country's stagnant economy and stalled
democratization process. Since 1996, the population has grown at
least twice as fast as the national income.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this dire economic picture, and with widespread
popular opposition to Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel, King
Hussein spent his last few years trying to rein in the democratic
debate that he had previously encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   At his accession, King Abdullah promised to steer his country
towards free markets and a constitutional monarchy. He strode off
on his reforming tasks with resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of his father's death, he went first to the Gulf,
to persuade his wealthy Arab brethren to provide more jobs and aid,
and then to Europe (and sent his finance minister to Japan) to
plead for relief from Jordan's hobbling $8.5 billion debt.
</P>
<P>
   He even persuaded the United States to start negotiations on a
free-trade pact, a rare distinction.
</P>
<P>
   At home, he spoke of turning Jordan into an Arab Singapore, and
prodded his government to reform education to that end.
</P>
<P>
   A new intellectual-property law and lower import duties helped
win the country admittance to the World Trade Organization.
Long-delayed privatizations, of the state-run freight railway and
telephone systems, finally got off the ground, as did much-needed
tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Bill Gates, charmed by the king during a meeting of
the World Economic Forum, announced that he would think about
setting up shop in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the regal vigor the king exudes, Jordan remains
stubbornly uninvigorated. The real keys to growth are out of the
government's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli security concerns and the international embargo on Iraq
strangle trade with two of Jordan's closest markets: Iraq and the
West Bank. A huge proportion of the budget goes on debt repayment
and salaries, and there is no easy way of changing this pattern.
Jordan already receives the best deal it can hope for from its
biggest creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with unemployment at 25 percent, laying off workers
would be political suicide.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he will get the economy going again, Ali
Abul-Ragheb, the recently appointed prime minister, can think of
nothing more dramatic than following up on the privatization and
trade policies of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, the record looks equally equivocal. Even
as the king toured the world, confiding his liberal inclinations,
the government in Jordan was hounding critical journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, although the king has condemned the systematic
discrimination against Jordanians of Palestinian origin (who make
up as much as two-thirds of the population), he also took the
controversial step of closing down the local offices of Hamas, a
radical Palestinian group allowed to operate by his father.
</P>
<P>
   A royal adviser who had the temerity to discuss the
Palestinians' role in Jordan's future found himself out of work. An
academic who spoke openly about the king's inexperience also lost
his job.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, many of these decisions came not from the king
himself, but from his more conservative advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel-Rauf Rawabdeh, King Abdullah's first prime minister, who
revels in the nickname of ``the bulldozer.'' spent his time doling
out jobs to his chums and strong-arming his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Sami Battikhi, the head of the secret police, has also made his
mark on policy, to the extent of sitting in on the meeting at which
the king appointed Abul-Ragheb.
</P>
<P>
   An old guard of such reform-leery native Jordanians has
succeeded in driving the best-known liberals from office. On the
other hand, King Abdullah stood by and let the old guard have its
way.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that he needed intimidating figures to ensure a smooth
succession, and says that he will now allow more progressive types,
such as Abul-Ragheb, to take center stage.
</P>
<P>
   But King Abdullah preserves a soldier's obsession with security,
talking of shadowy ``extremists'' on the Jordanian political scene,
and hinting darkly at plots to overthrow the present order. He
suggests that he will not concede parliament more power until the
electorate, and their representatives, learn to behave more
responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Jordan's main political forces, including its prominent
Islamic movement, seem remarkably moderate. But they certainly
differ from King Abdullah in their hostility to the peace treaty
with Israel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (50-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the political parties and professional associations have
pursued an aggressive campaign against normal nongovernmental ties
with Israel. Next year's parliamentary elections will doubtless
give this view more publicity, especially if the government sticks
to its promise to alter the electoral law to increase
representation in towns where Palestinians are the majority. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah's dismissal of anti-peace agitation as a passing
trend that will fade as the economy grows may be overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   He has misjudged his people before, most visibly over a laudable
but heavy-handed drive to stamp out the tradition of murdering
young women in the name of family honor.
</P>
<P>
   He sounds more comfortable talking about computer moguls in
Davos than about Islamist politicians in his own country. His
latest initiative, a Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi poster campaign designed to
lift morale, has met with bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   While he has improved his grasp of his subjects' language, he
still seems uneasy with their political views. &QL;

OPEC: SAUDI ARABIA LIFTS THE VEIL OF PRETENSE

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Could this week mark the great schism that
eventually tears apart OPEC?
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell. But what is clear is that Saudi Arabia has
decided to lift the veil of pretense, and admit that the cartel is
mere window-dressing for its political and economic agenda, a
convenient fiction to be tolerated in good times but disregarded in
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The oil cartel has a long history of fractious infighting, but
it had recently appeared more harmonious. After watching the price
of crude oil plunge to below $10 a barrel early last year, the
member governments seemed to put aside their differences.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Mexico and Norway, two outsiders, they slashed
production. When prices shot past $30 a barrel in response, they
agreed to release more oil on to the market in March.
</P>
<P>
   When the price stubbornly refused to go down, they raised
production quotas again in June _ but to little effect, as it
turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the recent ups and downs, Saudi Arabia has worked
hard to win the agreement of its smaller partners. No longer. The
Saudis announced on July 3 that they will unilaterally release
500,000 barrels of crude oil on to the market shortly if prices do
not drop to $25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The news caught world oil markets by surprise, and clearly had
the same effect on the rest of OPEC. Oil ministers from other
countries, when quizzed by reporters, seem hazy about what is
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Rodriguez, Venezuela's oil minister and currently OPEC's
president, made himself look more foolish than usual by declaring
that there was ``no idea by any country to raise output
unilaterally.'' He blamed the whole episode on ``journalistic
misinterpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, compared with the Delphic proclamations that the Saudis
usually issue, this week's announcement was unmistakably clear.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has dropped the pretense that OPEC is a consensual
body, and is ready to push the market in the direction that best
serves its own interests _ even if that means risking a collapse in
the cartel.
</P>
<P>
   What has forced the Saudi hand? In recent months the problem has
been a shortage not of oil on world markets, but of gasoline in
America's domestic petrol market, which is the world's biggest
single market for oil.
</P>
<P>
   America's record-high gas prices are largely caused not by any
actions by OPEC, but by domestic factors _ such as bottlenecks at
domestic refineries and tough new environmental standards on
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Saudis cannot afford to appear as America's
lackeys, they listen carefully to its concerns. The desert kingdom
depends on the United States both for its biggest market and for
its defense.
</P>
<P>
   The raging energy debate in the United States alarms the Saudis.
It has already become a hot political issue.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Saudis fear that it might tip the economy into
recession. They gritted their teeth through two recent OPEC summits
as the cartel's small fry kept them from raising output as much as
they would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   And, explains Roger Diwan of the Petroleum Finance Company, an
industry consultancy, they looked ahead and saw that worse may be
in store. He points to low stocks of heating oil in America.
</P>
<P>
   Unless crude-oil prices drop soon, this may presage another
energy crisis this winter. Adding urgency to the Saudi decision are
signs from elsewhere in the world that sky-high oil prices are
doing damage.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Drollas of the London-based Center for Global Energy Studies
blames current high prices for the unusual decline in oil demand
over the past year in Europe's four biggest economies. He reckons
that they may choke Asia's economic recovery too.
</P>
<P>
   Others worry that Iraq, always unpredictable, might use the
tight supply situation to its advantage in coming months, as winter
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Such conspiracy theorists suggest that Iraq might seize the
chance of peak demand during northern winter months to hold the
world hostage by suddenly taking its oil off the market in order to
win some concessions on, say, U.N. sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
   If such an unlikely event were indeed to happen, the world's oil
market would have only one savior: Saudi Arabia. That is because it
is the only country with any significant amount of spare capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Important though its vast reserves and its huge production may
be, it is this ability to bring on fresh barrels in a crisis that
gives it so much power.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Saudi Arabia's rulers have been reluctant to wield
that market power too openly, and have instead used OPEC as cover.
This time, though they still talk of ``coordination with OPEC,''
they seem willing to call the shots.
</P>
<P>
   If they are to be taken at their word, however, they need soon
to produce the promised 500,000 barrels, or the world's oil markets
will be thrown into even greater turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC cartel will surely survive, but whether anybody will
again take it so seriously is another matter. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ ``The shame of our history is now going abroad,'' says
Tadashi Kosho, who has spent his life studying the use of slave
labor by Japanese companies during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Edward Fagan, a New York lawyer and world-class
embarrasser. The man who shamed Swiss bankers and German
industrialists into stumping up billions of dollars for their
wartime offenses now plans to take on the might of Japanese
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Launched late last year, with all his customary flair, on the
anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, Fagan's class-action
lawsuit charges Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui &AMP; Company and Nippon
Steel with violations of human rights, the use of forced labor and
unjust enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, more than 30 similar lawsuits have been lodged
in California, a state where courts have a statute of limitations
extending until 2010 all claims related to the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs include former allied prisoners of war, Asian slave
laborers, ``comfort women'' and other alleged victims of Imperial
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Since, under American law, foreigners can file suit as easily as
Americans, Asia is now crawling with lawyers. Worryingly for
Japanese companies, this sudden barrage of lawsuits has caught the
attention of politicians in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Senate passed a bill to require the American
government to open its archives on Japanese war crimes, compiled
during the postwar occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 18 congressmen presented the House of
Representatives with a bill calling for Japan to apologize for its
war crimes and to pay compensation to victims. And last week the
Senate held hearings to sift the historical and legal issues
surrounding forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   Former American prisoners of war spoke of their grievances and
demanded justice and compensation.
</P>
<P>
   If Fagan is to be believed, Japanese firms may have to pay tens
of billions of dollars in reparations, outstripping the $5-billion
Nazi-slave-labor settlement reached by Germany's companies and
government that was confirmed in the Bundestag this week.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the secrecy still surrounding government and company
archives in Japan, nobody knows for sure how many people Japanese
firms enslaved during the war. But some historians guess that there
were as many as 700,000 Koreans, 40,000 Chinese and hundreds of
thousands of other Asians who were forced into labor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides these, perhaps half of the 140,000 allied prisoners
captured by the Japanese army were also forced to work.
</P>
<P>
   Workers slaved in wretched conditions in mines, steel plants,
construction sites and factories in Japan and throughout its
colonies. Death rates were high in many of the prisoner-of-war and
work camps, and torture and abuse were common. Promised salaries
for Asian ``workers'' were rarely paid.
</P>
<P>
   The most enthusiastic users of slave labor were the zaibatsu,
the giant financial and industrial conglomerates that the Americans
dismantled after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Although their owners were purged, the zaibatsu managed to
regroup themselves under the same management. Despite what Japanese
firms claim about their non-relationship with the zaibatsu, the
postwar break was by no means complete.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the capital amassed by the zaibatsu during Japan's
colonial expansion also survived the purge: the money was siphoned
off into house banks that escaped American attentions.
</P>
<P>
   Cold-war politics further discouraged the Americans from
pressuring Japan and its large companies to pay reparations. So
far, Japan has not budged an inch. The companies involved are
keeping a frosty silence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The government, meanwhile, seems in no mood to cut a deal,
insisting that the 1951 San Francisco peace treaty settled all
reparation claims permanently.
</P>
<P>
   On June 27 Japan's ambassador to the United States, Shunji
Yanai, said his government would support Japanese companies, adding
that it would furnish them with the ``necessary information'' to
defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances from the American government that it supports
Japan's interpretation of the 1951 peace treaty, Yanai seemed
sufficiently agitated to issue threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening the lid'' on the issue of war reparations would, he
claimed, ``result in grave consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   For a start, it is by no means clear that the 1951 peace treaty
protects Japanese companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers argue that, although the treaty settles all claims
by governments against Japan, the text is less clear about the
rights of individuals to bring suit.
</P>
<P>
   Other specialists and human-rights scholars argue on fundamental
grounds that peace treaties between governments cannot take away an
individual's right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these legal arguments eventually fail, Fagan's talent
for publicity will ensure plenty of damaging stories in the
meantime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Influential Asian-Americans and human-rights organizations, such
as the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, have begun focusing
on the ``forgotten Holocaust'' of the Pacific war.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, California's state government passed a law, sponsored
by a local Japanese-American politician, calling for Japan to offer
``an unambiguous apology and compensation to the victims of its
wartime atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   It took two years of rough handling in the media and untold
damage in public relations before Swiss and German firms agreed to
pay compensation. One sign of the sensitivity of the political
issues surrounding the German suits was the role that the
government played in organizing the compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, at least, the Japanese ought to be tempted to settle
quickly on commercial grounds alone. This time, however, Fagan may
have hit a blind spot. For companies such as Mitsui have resisted
pressure for reparations for years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 court cases have been filed in Japan demanding
restitution for slave labor. Not one has won. Only three have been
settled out of court, and even then on terms that were hardly
favorable to former slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, for instance, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries refused to
make a court-suggested payment to a group of 12 Korean forced
laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the Japanese press lets its companies get away with
this sort of high-handed treatment: criticism of big Japanese
companies by the mainstream media in Japan remains muted.
</P>
<P>
   There will be stubborn political resistance too. Among the right
wing of the dominant Liberal Democratic Party are politicians who
refuse to accept that Japan waged a war of aggression. It is thanks
to these enduring political forces that, to the outside world,
Japan still cannot seem to offer an unequivocal apology for its
wartime actions.
</P>
<P>
   The difference with the latest court cases, of course, is that
they have been filed abroad, exposing Japanese firms to a hostile
press, hostile public opinion and hostile politicians.
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence so far, the guess has to be that they will make
a worse mess of the issue than even the Swiss and the Germans. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ America's House of Representatives voted last month
to phase out the country's estate tax over the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
   If the law passes the Senate and has enough support to override
a threatened veto by President Bill Clinton (unlikely but
possible), America could become one of a handful of rich countries
without an inheritance or estate tax, at least at the federal
level.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the ``death tax,'' as they have dubbed it, claim
that its repeal would remove an unfair, immoral tax that adds to
the pain suffered by mourning families.
</P>
<P>
   They say it prevents farms and small businesses from passing
from generation to generation. And they claim that it penalizes the
frugal who pass wealth on to their children, reducing everybody's
incentive to save and invest.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the tax, in contrast, retort that it is highly
progressive (the more you have, the more, proportionally, you pay)
and thus a small, but effective, counterweight to America's
concentration of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   They assert that it has few disincentive effects since it is
payable only at death. And they claim that repeal would generate a
huge windfall to rich people.
</P>
<P>
   The truth probably lies somewhere in between. America's estate
tax is levied at a high rate (a marginal rate of 55 percent for the
biggest estates), but it kicks in only after a sizeable exemption
(in effect, the first $1.35 million of gross estate per couple,
rising to $2 million by 2006, goes untaxed).
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is a tax paid mainly by the rich. In 1997, over
half of all estate-tax payments were made by 2,400 estates with a
gross value of over $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the tax in fact affects very few farmers and small
businesses. Farms account for only 0.3 percent of gross taxable
assets. Special provisions also ensure that small businesses and
farms have a long period to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax touches relatively few people, but it still
generates a noticeable share of tax revenue (around $30 billion in
1999, about 1.5 percent of the total).
</P>
<P>
   It remains controversial, as taxes on the transfer of wealth
have been throughout history.
</P>
<P>
   They were first levied by the Egyptians in the 7th century BC.
Classical economists argued about their merits: Adam Smith was
broadly in favor, David Ricardo (a rich man) against.
</P>
<P>
   But economists agree that, in principle, all taxes should be
judged against three criteria: fairness, efficiency and simplicity.
Fairness is hard to gauge. Clearly, the estate tax is at an extreme
of progressivity, since the vast majority of taxpayers do not pay
it at all.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand the tax also has unfair aspects. The many
loopholes and exemptions surrounding it mean that people of
equivalent wealth often pay different amounts of tax, depending on
their acumen at estate-tax avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``soaking the rich'' is not a principle of good
taxation.
</P>
<P>
   A progressive tax can also be a highly inefficient one.
Efficient taxes should create minimal distortions to economic
activity. How much the estate tax distorts behavior _ by, say,
reducing the incentive to save and accumulate wealth _ is a complex
question.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike income taxes, which affect choices about how much of
one's lifetime to devote to working, inheritance taxes affect
incentives governing the choice between consuming now and
bequeathing to one's descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding how these incentives work means understanding why
people leave assets when they die.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that bequests are simply an accident. People do
not know how long they will live, and so they keep more money than
they turn out to need.
</P>
<P>
   If bequests are an accident, the estate tax is quite efficient.
However, if people are motivated to work by the idea of leaving
their families an inheritance, the tax will be distortionary.
</P>
<P>
   Again, however, the impact of the distortions is unclear. People
might accumulate less wealth in an effort to avoid the tax. On the
other hand, if people have a specific amount they wish to leave to
their children, the estate tax might have the opposite effect,
increasing saving.
</P>
<P>
   Estate taxes also affect the behavior of recipients. The
children of the wealthy might work and save less, conscious that
they were going to inherit.
</P>
<P>
   Some libertarians are in favor of confiscatory estate taxes on
exactly these grounds: they see inherited wealth as affirmative
action for the children of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that in a system that has an income tax, the estate
tax will always be less efficient than setting the income tax at
optimal rates. Indeed, the estate tax's high rate suggests that it
could have big disincentive effects.
</P>
<P>
   The top rate of 55 percent, combined with a top income tax of
39.6 percent, means that high income-tax payers, who intend to
bequeath any new dollar they earn to their descendants, are taxed
on it at the rate of almost 73 percent. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850, OR CONTINUE TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A forthcoming paper by Joel Slemrod and Wojciech Kopczuk of the
University of Michigan suggests that the estate tax does affect
people's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   By looking at changes in the rate, base and structure of the tax
since it was introduced in 1916, the two economists tried to gauge
whether these changes have affected the size of reported taxable
estates. They found that a sharp increase in the estate tax in the
1930s coincided with a sharp decrease in the size of reported
estates.
</P>
<P>
   By examining historical data on individual tax returns, they
also found evidence that rich people reduce the size of their
taxable estates as rates rise. That could be because people have
less incentive to accumulate wealth; or it might be because their
estate planning was more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Only the former affects overall capital accumulation, but both
are indicative of the costs of estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   So critics are right that the estate tax creates distortions. It
also fails the simplicity test. These objections could however be
partly met by reducing the tax rate and removing many loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   A lower tax on a broader base would be more efficient, though
also less progressive. But it would certainly make more sense than
abolition. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ The growing realism of computer games makes it ever
harder for players to tear themselves away from their screens to
attend to their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   For some players, however, the distraction of having to earn a
living may now be a thing of the past. They have learned to make
real money in the imaginary world of online fantasy games.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for treasure in these games is so great that
experienced players can sell the fruits of their gaming labor to
their less-experienced counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   How did things become so deadly serious? In the early days of
networked computing, geeks quickly worked out how to run
role-playing ``swords-and-sorcery'' games online.
</P>
<P>
   These multi-player adventures became known as multi-user
dungeons (MUDs). Players spent their time killing monsters and
collecting treasure. Since the games had no graphics, imagination
was at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   The high cost of computers and slow speed of networks further
limited their appeal. But as microprocessors and Internet
connections have improved, MUDs have evolved in both popularity and
sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Everquest, one of the most popular games, boasts over 200,000
players, as well as three-dimensional color graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Since players can interact online, devotees see these games as a
social experience as much as a competitive one. This makes them
maddeningly addictive. They are also time-consuming. To get the
most out of them, players find they have to spend hours every week
developing powerful online characters.
</P>
<P>
   And so a commercial opportunity has arisen. Skilled players
found they could accumulate hoards of digital treasure. Busy or
impatient players wanted a head start. So imaginary gold, castles
and magic swords began to be sold for real money.
</P>
<P>
   eBay, an auction Web site, is the main forum for such
transactions: 100,000 gold pieces in a game called Ultima Online
currently cost about $40; a well-situated castle might change hands
for over $500; Everquest players can buy a ``Froglock Bonecaster's
Robe'' on eBay for a cool $750.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of money on offer, it is not surprising that some
old hands have decided to turn professional. They have given up
their jobs to play full-time, making a living by selling their
spoils to other players.
</P>
<P>
   They have also started to buy items for resale. Their Web sites
accept credit cards; one even offers an escrow service to guarantee
delivery of the virtual treasure before the real money is paid
over.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional players have nothing good to say about these
entrepreneurs. They are derisively referred to as ``campers'' or
``farmers'' because of their formulaic, professional playing style.
They are excoriated for commercializing the games they play, and
find themselves widely shunned by the true aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   So, although the idea of playing games for a living sounds
entrancing, full-time gamers may not be having as good a time as it
seems.
</P>
<P>
   They miss out on the games' sociable and problem-solving
aspects, which are what make them so addictive in the first place.
They face the opprobrium of their fellow players. And the demands
of running a business and buying for resale must also seem rather
mundane after a day spent slaying dragons.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises a troubling, if not wholly new, question:
when you play games for a living, do they stop being fun? &QL;

   AUSTIN _ Along with the stifling heat, devastating fires are
part of summer in the Southwest. Whether caused by lightning or the
cigarette butt of a thoughtless camper, they ravage thousands of
acres in the region each year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's conflagrations in New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado
are worse than anything nature has produced for a long time past.
</P>
<P>
   Drought and strong winds propelled them; but the biggest fires
were begun by government workers. This raises new, and troubling,
questions about the stewardship of America's forests.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts began in May with the Cerro Grande fire that raged
through Los Alamos, in New Mexico. When the smoke finally cleared,
the fire had destroyed more than 47,000 acres and more than 400
houses, causing an estimated $1 billion in damage and barely
missing the National Laboratory, home of America's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   This turned angry eyes on the policy of ``controlled burning,''
which has been used by the National Park Service for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled burns are fires deliberately set by park officials in
order to clear out grass, brush and deadwood that could be the fuel
for later, accidental, blazes. In essence, the practice is an
attempt to restore the natural fire cycle that existed 100 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As more people have moved into the region (in recent years, the
Southwest has been the fastest-growing part of America), natural
wildfires have been suppressed by humans. This has led to an
enormous buildup of scrub brush and deadwood, the elements that
turn forests into tinderboxes.
</P>
<P>
   It is to burn away this buildup that the National Park Service
has quadrupled the number of controlled burns in the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a controlled fire is often an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   According to a damning Interior Department report on the Cerro
Grande fire, park officials made ``seriously flawed'' calculations
about how the fire was likely to behave, underestimating the effect
of high winds and dry weather.
</P>
<P>
   They also failed to have enough firefighting equipment ready.
Two other notably uncontrollable ``controlled fires'' have happened
at the Grand Canyon, where the blaze spread over 14,000 acres and
forced the closure of several tourist lodges, and at Seven Springs,
in New Mexico, where the town had to be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the conditions that lead to the best controlled
burns (usually, dryish weather and strong enough winds to spread
the fire) are nearly the same as those that cause a fire to burn
out of control. And drought in the Southwest has made things worse.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steve Gatewood, executive director of the
Arizona-based Society for Ecological Restoration, any decision to
order a controlled burn under current conditions is bound to be
risky.
</P>
<P>
   He also points out that the forest agencies are behind schedule
on controlled burns, and may have felt pushed to approve burns that
tested the limits of fire safety.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative way to restore forests, based on research by
Professor Wallace Covington of Northern Arizona University, is
being tested on 100,000 acres of dense pine forests near Flagstaff,
Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   This method involves first thinning out the forests by selective
logging, turning dense woods into pine cluster _ the sort of forest
that used to be the norm a century ago. Such a forest can then be
left, or subjected to limited controlled burns.
</P>
<P>
   Selective logging enjoys the support of the sensibly green
secretary of the interior, Bruce Babbitt, and many scientists.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists, never friendly to anything with the word
logging in it, see it as a scam to help the logging industry (which
would inevitably have to cut down those trees).
</P>
<P>
   This enrages Covington: ``As soon as I advocated tree-thinning,
they immediately assumed I was trying to rape the forest.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the issue has inevitably turned into a battle
between western Republicans (with strong logging-company
connections) and liberal Democrats (with green contributors).
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of a preservationist elite are driving this
administration's environmental policies,'' says Helen
Chenoweth-Hage of Idaho, a hard-line Republican congresswoman.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, Republicans pushed through a plan to increase the
government's budget for fighting forest fires to $350 million, with
much of the money going to forest thinning.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats whimpered about their foes exploiting national
disasters. The hot air, it seems, does not blow merely in the
West. &QL;

`BOWLING ALONE': WHAT'S MISSING IN AMERICAN SOCIETY

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ ``Bowling Alone'' is an ambitious book. Even before
its publication, its central thesis had been well chewed over in
America. Both major presidential candidates had consulted its
author; so had Bill Clinton. The cognoscenti were sure they knew
what Robert Putnam was saying.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the book has finally appeared, amplifying and
reinforcing a famous article from the Journal of Democracy in 1995,
the danger is that its potential audience _ wise before the event _
will not bother to read it. That would be a pity.
</P>
<P>
   If Putnam, a Harvard political scientist, is right, his findings
constitute the greatest challenge now facing America's political
classes.
</P>
<P>
   If he is wrong, his book will nevertheless afford the reader a
rich and subtle portrait of modern America (with an unexpected
nugget of information on almost every page).
</P>
<P>
   Either way, ``Bowling Alone'' is a prodigious achievement.
Putnam's scholarship is wide-ranging, his intelligence luminous,
his tone modest, his prose unpretentious and frequently funny.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, the professor is probably right. He argues
that while America has recently witnessed record growth in physical
and human capital, its stock of ``social capital'' _ informal
social connectedness and formal civic engagement _ has fallen
dangerously low.
</P>
<P>
   Americans used to bowl in leagues. Now they bowl alone. In New
London, Conn., they bowl alone while watching giant television
screens, thus further reducing their chances of forming meaningful
social connections.
</P>
<P>
   For Putnam, bowling alone is an extended metaphor for much that
ails both modern America and modern Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence for Americans' growing social isolation is strong:
families dine together a third less often than they did even in
1980; electoral turnout has fallen precipitously, even though
blacks in the South are now free to vote, and do.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying causes include pressures of time and money,
long-distance commuting, compulsive television-viewing and, most
important of all, the gradual replacement of the long ``civic
generation'' _ those tempered by the Great Depression and the
Second World War _ by waves of laid-back, solipsistic baby-boomers
and ``generation X'ers.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence for isolation can be ambiguous, it is true. The
risk of caricature is always present and what is social isolation
to one person may be new forms of interaction to another.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Putnam's passion for social capital, hard as it may be to
define, is easily explained. Innumerable recent studies show that
it is at least as vital as physical and human capital for the
well-being of individual citizens and whole nations.
</P>
<P>
   Socially disconnected individuals, neither supported by dense
social networks nor contributing to them, are unhealthier,
unhappier and commit more crimes. They are also often poorer and
much less good at nurturing and educating their children.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam is too polite to say so, but he clearly feels the whole
country is becoming like those American states that are already
conspicuously lacking in social capital, notably Mississippi,
Louisiana and other states in the old Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam concludes with a range of practical proposals, albeit
rather vague ones.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that American policymakers _ and business and
religious leaders _ factor social capital into their plans and
decisions. Will whatever I or my company proposes to do serve to
build social capital or destroy it?
</P>
<P>
   He challenges employers ``to ensure that by 2010 America's
workplace will be substantially more family-friendly and
community-congenial'' than it is now, and he challenges the
nation's planners and developers to ensure that Americans spend
less time on the road commuting and more time connecting with their
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   He also maintains that ``a mounting body of evidence confirms
that community service programs really do strengthen the civic
muscles of participants, especially if the service is meaningful,
regular, and woven into the fabric of the school curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam cheerfully admits to being a missionary. Inevitably, a
book cast in such an ambitious mold fails to fill all of it. Many
of Putnam's prescriptions, as he himself acknowledges, are lacking
in detail and definition.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, he fails to develop the distinction between
strictly local social capital and forms of what might be called
``like-minded social capital'' transcending local and even national
boundaries. The one may languish while the other flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, ``Bowling Alone'' is a book that civic-minded
Americans, of whom there are still many, ignore at their peril. &QL;

dictatorship, Indonesia was rife with corruption. On top of all
that, the country's first democratically elected president
inherited a collapsing economy. Oh, and did we mention that
President Wahid _ affectionately known as Gus Dur _ is half-blind
and weakened by a near-fatal stroke two years ago? All of which
makes it scarcely surprising that Wahid is finding it hard to get
his country moving firmly in a better direction. Yet patience in
Indonesia is running out. Some of the explanation doubtless lies in
unreasonable expectations of this saintly Muslim cleric. Much,
however, is his own fault. &QL;

   For once, hyperbole is appropriate. In confounding pollsters and
pundits by choosing Vicente Fox as their next president last
Sunday, Mexicans did far more than change their government. They
ended seven decades of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI), put a whole era in Mexico's history behind them and
turned their country into a real democracy at last. &QL;

   ``If it smells, put a lid on it,'' goes an old Japanese proverb.
But it is the wrong prescription for the 30-odd lawsuits that have
been lodged in California against Japanese companies such as
Mitsubishi and Mitsui on behalf of many Asians and some Allied
prisoners of war who were forced into slave labor during the Second
World War. For moral, and commercial reasons, Japan should
compensate the victims of its sordid history _ and quickly. &QL;

   &UR; GUS-DUR-LASTCHANCE-ECONOMIST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The task is vast. Last October Abdurrahman Wahid won the
presidency of one of the world's largest countries, spread across
17,000 islands and with numerous ethnic groups. After a 30-year
dictatorship, Indonesia was rife with corruption. On top of all
that, the country's first democratically elected president
inherited a collapsing economy. Oh, and did we mention that
President Wahid _ affectionately known as Gus Dur _ is half-blind
and weakened by a near-fatal stroke two years ago? All of which
makes it scarcely surprising that Wahid is finding it hard to get
his country moving firmly in a better direction. Yet patience in
Indonesia is running out. Some of the explanation doubtless lies in
unreasonable expectations of this saintly Muslim cleric. Much,
however, is his own fault. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Americans may come to look back on 2000 as a
decisive political year. The reason will not be the election of
President Gore or President Bush, but rather the election of
President Fox. The victory of Vicente Fox in Mexico seems like a
vindication of Americans' belief in the possibility of worldwide
political progress. More importantly, this week's election marks
the moment when the worldwide trend towards greater democratization
washed back over the Rio Grande. &QL;

around a great deal over the July 4th holiday. Few practical
freedoms seem to matter to Americans more than the ability to drive
their own set of wheels whenever they want, whenever they want _
and to have cheap gasoline to do it. Unfortunately, gas is suddenly
not nearly as cheap as Americans would like; and even though this
is probably a temporary phenomenon, it is already causing a
political fuss. &QL;

drop, often completing 100-hour weeks; many complain of
mistreatment or harassment. Indeed, senior physicians have enormous
power over a trainee's future career. But pressure for change may
be mounting. &QL;

 By ROBERT BOLICK    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARIEN, Conn. _ I was reading a good book the other day on the
train home: ``Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of
Crowds.'' Before I knew it, the train was stopping, and I was
scrambling to gather my things to get off. So? So, the book was an
electronic book: I was reading it on a hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   Like Elmore Leonard's ``Be Cool'' or ``The Education of Henry
Adams'' or Stephen King's ``Riding the Bullet'' _ all of which I
also read as e-books _ that book had pulled me into its world. It
didn't matter that I was looking at a screen, that I was tapping
and pushing buttons to advance the text in readable chunks; just as
if I were sitting with a good print book and turning pages, nothing
mattered but the magic of the book itself.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, there were only a few thousand e-books,
stored at universities, readable only over the Internet on computer
screens and only as scrolling text. Today, there are tens of
thousands, available across different formats and several devices.
But still, that is not nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of American Publishers has created a task force
for e-book standards, some major publishers are launching e-book
initiatives and almost all of our university presses have
experimented with the technology. One of our key national
booksellers is leading in the selling of e-books. But the sense of
urgency should be greater _ not only for the sake of the book
business, which must adapt to the digital world, but also for
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those readers are ready now. When a friend of mine who
works for an e-bookseller told her son's school class about her
job, children waved Gameboys in the air and asked, ``When can we
read our books on these?'' College students and professionals now
spend more time doing research on the Web than in libraries:
e-books are the natural next step.
</P>
<P>
   With e-books, I can carry around 50 pounds of books in a device
weighing a couple of pounds, or have access to vast libraries
wherever I can log on to the Web, or share a good book with a blind
friend because an e-book can be read aloud by software.
</P>
<P>
   And with its possibilities for links to other information, like
reference books and maps, as well as to sound and animated
diagrams, the e-book is a challenge to authors and publishers, as
well as readers, to master words, sense and form in a new way.
</P>
<P>
   To be engrossed in a writer's argument, stumble over a word I
thought I knew and be able to look it up on the page, on the
screen, right there and then, with a movement of thumb and
forefinger _ that speeds my growth as a reader. Or to be able to
seek out the passages that interest me with a search engine rather
than an inadequate or nonexistent index _ that gives me a map of my
own discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Like the personal computer before it, the e-book opens a world
of possibilities. It is not necessarily better than printed books,
nor need it supplant them. But its time is here.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Despite doomsday rhetoric as they prepare for
Tuesday's Camp David summit, Israelis and Palestinians are closer
than ever to settling their 52 years of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process is getting creative with proposals that could
navigate around the symbolic issues that have kept the two sides
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Have a problem with Israeli settlers on land previously held by
the Palestinians? A solution might be to have Israel officially
recognize Palestinian sovereignty but lease back land where Jews
now live.
</P>
<P>
   On the nettlesome issue of what to do about Palestinian
refugees, perhaps they could get new homes in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And the question of whether Israelis or Palestinians should
control Israel? Negotiators could impose overlapping layers of
authority over the holy city, letting both sides claim it as
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, they could add up to $100 billion in international aid for
both sides to make the compromises come easier.
</P>
<P>
   True, these are just ideas for a region that usually defies
simple or even logical solutions. Meanwhile, Israelis and
Palestinians continue preparing the rifles _ and attack helicopters
_ for the street fighting that could follow a summit failure.
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out, making the potential and the risk of this
summit great.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, with fewer than seven months left in office,
cajoled Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to come meet Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Camp David. It's Clinton's final
chance to push for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barak and Arafat are facing a self-imposed Sept. 13
deadline as the end of their negotiating period.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has vowed he will declare statehood then, with or without
Israeli agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He has also said it could come with a new violent uprising. In
response, Israel has threatened to use attack helicopters and
tanks. Already, at a base in the West Bank, troops have practiced
storming the streets of a model Palestinian village.
</P>
<P>
   But, the talks offer hope. Even if they do not produce a
breakthrough in the first week, they could be the first of several
closely timed rounds of meetings aimed at forestalling a violent
fall.
</P>
<P>
   As Israeli columnist Oded Granot(cq) wrote in the Ma'ariv
newspaper last week: ``If peace cannot be achieved by September, at
least get through September in one piece.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the goal is bigger. It is, as Clinton put it this past
week, ``an agreement on the core issues that have fueled a
half-century of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel steps in as the more powerful party. It has a dominant
army backed by the United States and its soldiers ride patrol in
the disputed land.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have the weight of United Nations resolutions
that say, in broad terms, that occupied land should be returned.
They also have the support of the oil-rich Arab world and the power
to disrupt _ through uprising or protest.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are framed by the Oslo peace process, which began with
an agreement reached in Oslo, Norway. Signed in 1993, it set out a
rough schedule for Israel to withdraw from Palestinian lands in The
Gaza Strip and the West Bank, which Israel captured in 1967. In
return, the Palestinians are supposed to let Israelis live
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Over seven years there have been Palestinian terrorist attacks,
riots and angry anti-Israel rhetoric. Israeli troops have
frequently confiscated Palestinian land and occasionally shot
unarmed Palestinians. But, the process has ground on.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians control most of the Gaza Strip now. About 40
percent of the West Bank, which is home to about 2 million
Palestinians, is under partial or full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   But, Oslo set aside the toughest issues for the end.
</P>
<P>
   They include questions of who should control Jerusalem, what the
final borders will be between the two sides, what will happen to
the 3.7 million Palestinian refugees and how the region's meager
water supply can be shared. Also, what kind of Palestinian state
should be allowed?
</P>
<P>
   The key to solutions, experts say, is building practical
solutions that have enough conceptual room to let both sides claim
victory before their peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible to find linguistic formulations that will
satisfy both sides,'' said Ron Pundik(cq), one of the original
Israeli architects of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Rasheed, a Palestinian negotiator, indicated
flexibility last week. Stressing that he was speaking
theoretically, he said if they encounter sacrifices that no Israeli
prime minister could ask of his public, ``We are ready to deal with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The solutions will need to recognize some realities beneficial
to both sides while giving each a symbolic victory.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Jerusalem has been under Israel since 1967 and
Israelis say they will never let it be divided. But the reality is
that 210,000 Palestinians live there in largely segregated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians could get local autonomy for the neighborhoods they
populate and be allowed to fly their flag on their holy sites. They
could put their capital in a suburb that is technically beyond the
Jerusalem border but, to the eye, looks like part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Life would be the same for Israelis and they could claim overall
control of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say this is not enough because they should get
absolute sovereignty over their Israeli-occupied areas. But, this
kind of formula could let both sides tell their public that
Jerusalem is theirs.
</P>
<P>
   On borders, Israel has already offered the Palestinians up to 87
percent of the West Bank, though (it) would be transferred over
several years.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part comes with the more than 200,000 Jewish settlers
who Israel has encouraged over the last 30 years to build housing
developments on confiscated Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
   Barak talks of moving 40,000 settlers back to Israel and
grouping the rest in a few large blocks, already like small cities.
Palestinians reject that and say the West Bank, interpreting U.N.
resolutions, is theirs.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israel could recognize Palestinian ownership of the land,
then agree to lease back the land it needs for settlers. Also,
Israel could compensate the Palestinians with vacant land inside
Israel's borders.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee problem will require money.
</P>
<P>
   There are 3.7 million refugees in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan,
Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere. They, or their parents, fled what is
now Israel in 1948 and, in some cases, from the West Bank in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians demand the ``right of return'' to Israel, something
that Israel, with just 5 million Jews, will never allow.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israel could agree theoretically to something like a right
of return. Then, it might let a few hundred thousand Palestinians
slowly back into the West Bank. Palestinian officials know that's
about all their struggling economy could handle, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The rest could be compensated with money, better conditions
where they live, or permanent homes in America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed said the Palestinians seek more than $25 billion from
international donors and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On water, the solution depends on technology. Israel controls
and uses the vast majority of the water and Israelis use far more
per capita than Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But, Oslo architect Pundik said both sides recognize there's not
enough to go around. The region needs better wells, water imports
or costly new water plants. The concept would be to ``increase and
share.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the terms will have to be set out for what kind of
limits might be imposed on a new Palestinian state. For example,
can it have an army or make alliances with Israel's enemies? The
options there are wide.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Arafat and Barak will be able to make a
deal their publics can accept.
</P>
<P>
   Barak promises to put the agreement to a referendum. In the
meantime, members of his own government are defecting and
threatening his term in office just because he is going to the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has promised his people a state with Jerusalem as its
capital _ whether through negotiation or violence. But,
Palestinians appear to be tiring of the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My aim is to get more, but if this is all I can get I will
take it and ask for more,'' Palestinian Nafez Abu Shalbak, 43,
said.
</P>
<P>
   A former Palestinian fighter and prisoner in Israeli jails, Abu
Shalbak now runs a business and drives a Mercedes. ``It might be
the end of the resistance for my generation but the next generation
will continue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peacemakers hope that by the time the Palestinians of the next
generation grow up, they will be accustomed to a peace they can
live with.

<P>
   KEY ISSUES IN THE CAMP DAVID SUMMIT:
</P>
<P>
   JERUSALEM: Israel controls it and claims total sovereignty. But,
about 210,000 Palestinians live there and they want a piece for
their capital.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Palestinians get partial sovereignty in their
areas and can put their capital just outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BORDERS: Palestinians have full or partial control over about 40
percent of the West Bank, but 205,000 Jewish settlers still live on
other areas taken by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Israel recognizes Palestinian rule over the
entire area, but leases back land for settlers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REFUGEES: Palestinians demand the ``right of return'' for the
3.7 million refugees from Israel and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Refugees get some theoretical right to
return, but only a few hundred thousand are let back to the West
Bank. Others get compensation and new homes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WATER: Israel controls most of the region's water and lets its
citizens have more than the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Use new technologies or water imports to
increase, then share, the supply.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STATEHOOD: Palestinians want a state, but Israel fears the
development of a Palestinian army and alliances with anti-Israel
countries like Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Allow statehood with limits.
</P>
<P>
   ENDIT.

 &HT;    MEXICANS PINCHING THEMSELVES AS THEY START SECOND REVOLUTION
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (i) International and (k)
commentary categories.
 &HT;    With MEXICO-PRI
 &HT;    For Sunday, July 9

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Stunned observers around the world are calling
Mexico's historic elections the Second Mexican Revolution, Mexico's
Berlin Wall or the Electoral Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   By any name, what happened on July 2 is more like a dream for
average Mexicans. They're pinching themselves, waking up to the
fact that for the first time in their 500-year modern history - and
after 71 years of the same party in the presidency - they're headed
for a peaceful transition of power from one political force to
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me by surprise. The forces of fraud were gathering,
but in the end, honesty and decency prevailed,'' said Homero
Aridjis, 60, a former ambassador, poet and environmental activist
who voted last Sunday for Vicente Fox Quesada and against Mexico's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned to defeat the PRI,'' Aridjis said. ``And now we all
have to learn how to live in a real democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Fox, who has beefed up his bodyguard detail, is
already facing rumblings of potential difficulties just ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Marginal, rock-wielding PRI supporters upset at losing in local
mayors' races attacked opponents and electoral officials in Mexico
state Wednesday, claiming fraud in those elections.
</P>
<P>
   Among political interest groups, grassroots environmentalists
were the first out the chute, pressuring Fox not to name a
political ally _ the controversial president of Mexico's small
Green Party _ to his cabinet. And the leftist Democratic
Revolutionary Party, which refused to join Fox's coalition, has
implied it could be a thorn in the new president's side.
</P>
<P>
   But since Fox's election as a centrist candidate of change,
Mexicans seem prouder and more confident. Even many voters who were
assumed to be a fountain of PRI support _ such as federal workers _
are also welcoming a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for Fox and so did most of my friends at work. But we
never said we were going to do that openly in our office,'' said
Roberto Torres, 35, a lawyer at the federal Treasury Department.
After Sunday he no longer feared speaking publicly about his
preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support change and I'm not afraid to lose my job now that
Fox has said he wants the best people for the government. I
consider myself capable,'' Torres said, referring to Fox's
ambitious plans to accelerate improvements of Mexico's civil
service and crack down on corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1929, no one in the federal government has ever labored
under an administration other than one run by the PRI. The world's
longest-ruling party until last Sunday, the PRI built up an
infrastructure of inertia or coerced loyalty over the decades by
offering favors to public workers and through unions and other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   That old-fashioned system was already on its knees before the
election. It now appears headed for its deathbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those in Treasury who seem deflated,'' Torres said,
``but that's normal if they were PRI supporters to the core. And to
tell you the truth, some of them aren't that brilliant for the
positions they're in. Maybe they're afraid because they won't fit
the profile of the new government.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox supporter Carolina Galinda, a secretary at the Social
Services Institute for Government Workers, said, ``For me this
change is like the real independence of Mexico. I think even the
PRI will be helped by its defeat and learn to fight cleanly.''
</P>
<P>
   A non-union worker, Galinda said her unionized colleagues were
given extra days off if they agreed to go to PRI rallies.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer at a government food subsidies program said she
supported Fox, too. ``But everybody here thought that (PRI
candidate) Francisco Labastida would win,'' she said, ``I did
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she still
is afraid of reprisal because there are five more months of PRI
government left. ``Those who supported the PRI are in total pain,''
she said. ``They look like they're in mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   The employee said she was forced by supervisors _ who kept lists
of cooperative employees _ to don a Labastida jacket and cap and
join other government workers passing out election propaganda and
balloons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so degrading,'' she said. ``People would roll their car
windows up. The only people who would take the propaganda were the
poorest people. And after a while even they weren't interested.
Just kids who would take the balloons.''
</P>
<P>
   Since February, she said, the directors of her office had been
withholding raises for the employees. They were so sure that
Labastida would win, she said, that by Monday _ the day after the
election _ the back pay had suddenly appeared in her bank account.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of system has to end now,'' she said. ``This
election wctions. In some of Mexico's poorest southern states, like
Guerrero, Tabasco and Hidalgo, where the regional PRI remains
strong, Lund found a distinct link between votes and coercion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Elections Institute failed in that regard,'' he
said, ``but where the elections institute had muscle _ the secret
ballot _ it used it beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican broadcast media and some newspapers, Lund pointed
out, took a leap toward independence with this election cycle. But
they still offered biased news coverage more favorable to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials quantified and denounced the bias, but
couldn't do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   But what a difference a day made.
</P>
<P>
   Newscasters are now eager to interview Fox and are effusively
congratulatory. So much so that a popular television comic
performed a sketch pretending to be a newscaster who had donned
black cowboy boots, Fox's trademark, and a silver belt buckle that
said FOX, another trademark of the president-elect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been with you, Vicente,'' comic Adal Ramones
gushed to guffaws from his live audience.
</P>
<P>
   Irreverent political humor on Mexican television is still young
and cautious. Under Fox, it has a chance to take off, just as news
organizations now have an opening to push for freer and more
independent coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Only within the last 10 years have editorial cartoonists
gradually started lampooning Mexican presidents in print.
Television and movies are a final frontier.
</P>
<P>
   After Ramones performed his newscaster sketch last Tuesday, he
called Fox from his set and got him to play straight man. Fox, a
showman himself, sternly hinted that Ramones deserved to be fired.
Then he burst into laughter and congratulated the comic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Constructive criticism accepted,'' Fox said as the audience
went wild and flashed Fox's symbol, the victory sign.

</P>
<P>
   ``This type of system has to end now,'' she said. ``This
election was marvelous for Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled public employees were part of a silent majority of
young, middle-class workers in Mexico who took advantage of the
secret ballot and gave Fox a victory margin of roughly seven
percentage points over Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   That was a much higher margin of victory than most professional
American and Mexican pollsters believed Fox would win by, if at
all.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of two privately commissioned polls that went
unpublished in the media here, most surveys showed Fox and
Labastida in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coercion of the vote worked in some places, but overall it
didn't,'' said Dan Lund of MUND Opinion Services, whose exit
polling revealed that some people who were given traditional PRI
handouts of food or building supplies voted their conscience.
</P>
<P>
   In response to polls, some people declared for the PRI but ended
up being very ambiguous, Lund said. ``We found that in extended
families, there were people who wanted to vote against the PRI. But
they wanted to talk about it with their families and know they
weren't alone.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Lund said, Fox, Mexico's new Congress and
election officials will have to address coercion and vote buying to
achieve truly clean elections. In some of Mexico's poorest southern
states, like Guerrero, Tabasco and Hidalgo, where the regional PRI
remains strong, Lund found a distinct link between votes and
coercion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Elections Institute failed in that regard,'' he

black cowboy boots, Fox's trademark, and a silver belt buckle that
said FOX, another trademark of the president-elect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been with you, Vicente,'' comic Adal Ramones
gushed to guffaws from his live audience.
</P>
<P>
   Irreverent political humor on Mexican television is still young
and cautious. Under Fox, it has a chance to take off, just as news
organizations now have an opening to push for freer and more
independent coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Only within the last 10 years have editorial cartoonists
gradually started lampooning Mexican presidents in print.
Television and movies are a final frontier.
</P>
<P>
   After Ramones performed his newscaster sketch last Tuesday, he
called Fox from his set and got him to play straight man. Fox, a
showman himself, sternly hinted that Ramones deserved to be fired.
Then he burst into laughter and congratulated the comic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Constructive criticism accepted,'' Fox said as the audience
went wild and flashed Fox's symbol, the victory sign.

</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-TEST (Washington) _ On a test of the U.S. missile
defense system that is scheduled for Friday night, between 10 p.m.
and 2 a.m. EDT. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   RWANDA-REPARATIONS (United Nations) _ An independent panel
assembled by the Organization of African Unity said Friday that a
``significant level of reparations'' should be paid to Rwanda by
nations and institutions that failed to prevent or stop the 1994
genocide that killed up to 800,000 people. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   (An early version of this story will move by 3 p.m. EDT.)
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-BANK-CHINA (Washington) _ The World Bank is scheduled
Friday to vote on a $40 million loan to China that would involve
relocating 58,000 farmers to land that is traditionally used by
Tibetan herders. By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   SWISS-ISRAEL (Geneva) _ Switzerland's highest court sentenced a
confessed Israeli spy Friday to a one-year suspended prison

</P>
<P>

   &UR; UNITED STATES &LR;  _ General
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-ABORTION (Austin, Texas) _ There's little doubt that the
next president will have a major role in shaping the make-up and
prevailing attitudes of the Supreme Court. Republicans expect, and
Democrats fear, that Gov. George W. Bush will use his appointments
to the court to restrict women's access to abortion. But if his
appointments to the Texas Supreme Court are any indication, those
expectations may not be fulfilled. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in `p' category)
</P>
<P>
   JAMAICA-MISSING-EDITOR (Negril, Jamaica) _ Frederick and Mary
Ann Kirschhoch have made two trips to Jamaica, where their
daughter, a travel editor, vanished around May 27. They came
because they believed they could describe their daughter to
Jamaicans in a way that only parents could. By Edward Wong.
</P>
<P>
   ALCOHOLICS-MODERATION (Seattle, Wash.) _ After she founded a
self-help program called Moderation Management seven years ago,
Audrey Kishline became a national spokeswoman for the notion that
problem drinkers could be taught to cut back without abstaining
altogether. Having recently pleaded guilty to two counts of
vehicular homicide after a binge drinking episode last March,
Kishline said through her lawyer that she has a new message:
Moderation Management ``is nothing but alcoholics covering up their
problem.'' By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in `f' news category)
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-BANK-RUSSIA (Washington) _ The World Bank says that an
internal investigation has found no proof that a former Russian
official passed confidential information to a Russian bank in 1993.
By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Just 11,000 jobs were created in June,
much fewer than expected and the smallest increase in four years,
in the latest sign that the U.S. economy is slowing. By Louis
Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   SEASIA-ECON (Singapore) _ Despite Southeast Asia's economic
recovery from the crisis that began three years ago this month,
foreign investors have been dumping stocks and currencies from the
region. Its markets this year are the worst-performing in the
world, having dropped more than 22 percent on average. By Wayne
Arnold.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   WAR-CRIMES-DEFINED (Undated) _ From the grisly amputations of
the hands of innocents in Sierra Leone to the systematic sexual
abuse of women in Bosnia and Rwanda _ or, some would say, to the
bombing of Kosovo refugees by NATO war planes _ modern conflicts
raise new and complex issues. There still is not total agreement on
universally accepted moral codes. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   (Will move with an ``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   WRITING-FOR-KIDS (Undated) _ As those who do it best have
testified, writing well for children is, first and last, very
difficult. And as memoirs and biographies have shown, the great
children's works have often been the products of personal
difficulty and stress, a distillation in narrative form of
anguished experience. By Eden Ross Lipson.
</P>
<P>
   GUERNICA-DOCUMENTARY (Guernica, Spain) _ It's hard to imagine
the scene as it was here some 60 years ago, when one of the first
major atrocities of World War II took place. A new documentary
film, ``The Bombing of Guernica: The Mark of Men,'' produced by a
peace research center here, includes the voices of the people who
survived the Luftwaffe attack. By Herbert Mitgang.

</P>
<P>
   MEMORIAL (San Francisco) _ The late civil rights leader Mike
Masaoka wrote in 1940 about how much he loved America. Now he has
become the focus of a seething controversy over a national monument
that will carry his name and the words he wrote long ago. He is
among seven individuals _ including former Rep. Norman Mineta,
D-Calif., commerce secretary-designate _ whose quotations will
grace the $11 million National Japanese American Memorial to
Patriotism, which will be dedicated in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 9.
By ANNIE NAKAO.
</P>
<P>
   BREAST-CANCER (San Francisco) _ Los Angeles and San Francisco
continue to be among the top 10 locations in the world with the
highest known breast cancer rates. Yet health officials won't be
able to reverse the increase until they find the causes, experts
agree at an environmental health forum here. They say the missing
link is a national database that would allow tracking of chronic
diseases to environmental factors such as air pollution,
pesticides, plastics and household chemicals. By JANE KAY.
</P>
<P>
   HOSPITALS (San Francisco) _ Unionized workers at 10 area
hospitals return to work after a 24-hour strike that inconvenienced
administrators and some patients and their families, drew attention
to labor's concerns and caused no serious health problems. By CAROL
NESS and PIA SACKAR.
</P>
<P>
   SF-WHARF (San Francisco) The developer of a revamped Fisherman's
Wharf project is mounting an aggressive campaign to win community
and political support. He is changing the name of the project and
scrapping plans for faux fog. Gone is the original name ``San
Francisco at the Wharf.'' Its new moniker: ``The San Francisco
Interactive History Museum.'' By RACHEL GORDON.
</P>
<P>
   MAYOR-RILEY (Albany, N.Y.) _ If there's such a thing as civic
plagiarism, Joseph P. Riley Jr., the six-term mayor of Charleston,
S.C., and architect of the city's downtown revitalization, did
nothing on a recent visit here to discourage it. And the mayors of
Albany, Troy and Cohoes, N.Y. seemed to be on the same page with
Riley, whose philosophy is that beautiful urban design is the way
to revive dying downtowns. By PAUL GRONDAHL. (For release Sunday.)
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SWINGING-NUN (Altamont, N.Y.) _ To help her fellow golfers see
spirituality in everything from a missed putt to a hole-in-one,
Dominican Sister Dorothy Ederer has written ``A Golfer's Day with
the Master: Spiritual Wisdom From the Fairway.'' According to
Ederer, golf is ``a great time to really listen to God.'' By THEOLA
S. LABBE.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES (Brimfield, Mass.) _ This week the Brimfield Outdoor
Antique and Collectible Show opens with more than 4,000 dealers in
tents spread out over 22 fields along a mile-plus stretch of Route
20, Brimfield's main thoroughfare. By FRANCES INGRAHAM HINES. (For
Sunday release.)
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT(``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-BIG-BROTHER (Undated) _ After the success of ``Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire'' last summer on ABC, all the networks broke their
ankles leaping aboard the bandwagon by putting on game shows of
their own. But they missed the point. We wanted contestants, yes,
but we craved the real-life drama. We wanted reality and we still
wanted game shows. Put them together and we go nuts. By MARK
McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-SCARY (Undated) _ In ``Scary Movie,'' director
Keenen Ivory Wayans and two of his brothers, Shawn and Marlon
Wayans, blend the elements from recent rude comedy hits, horror
spoofs and other popular pictures to create the raunchiest movie of
the summer. Also, one of the funniest. By MIKE HESS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-THEKID (Undated) _ In what will stand as the middle
flick in the unofficial yet-to-be-completed Bruce
Willis-and-small-metaphysically-gifted-boy trilogy, ``The Kid''
follows the ``The Sixth Sense,'' pitting Willis against another
problem child. This time the boy has wandered into Willis' fortress
of solitude from his childhood, and captures his heart in the
process. Since the film is Disney's ``The Kid,'' look out that he
doesn't walk off with yours as well. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   DOT-COM-POLL (San Francisco) _ Americans are wildly enthusiastic
about the future of Internet companies. Just don't ask them to put
their money where their mouth is. So says a survey by Scudder
Kemper Investments, Inc., a Boston-based financial firm that polled
2,900 Americans to gauge their confidence in the new economy. While
71 percent of Americans believe the CEOs of Internet companies can
run a successful company, 65 percent of them say they haven't even
considered putting aside money for riskier technology or dot-com
investments. By ALAN T. SARASEVIC.
</P>
<P>
   SECURITIES-FRAUD (San Francisco) _ An investment manager has
pleaded guilty to securities fraud in the operation of a hedge fund
that allegedly cost his investors nearly $7 million. Michael
Timothy Higgins, 36, of San Anselmo, Calif., admitted that he lied
about the performance of Ballybunion Capital Partners and provided
false documents to lure investors between November 1998 and April
of this year. By BOB EGELKO.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ I'm a ``Survivor'' survivor. In
fact, I love the show. I love all those shows, in this summer of
televoyeurism. What is television but voyeurism, and what is much
of life? By ROB MORSE.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ A friend sent me a list called ``Tips for a
Lifetime.'' Most of these tips, although useful, would be more
appropriate for someone who ran a Martha Stewart-styled household.
That's not me. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVEDMINTER-COLUMN _
Our cousin, Don Harp, is a preacher. He knows exactly what to say
when a family member crosses the Jordan. One of the things he
pointed out at Aunt Ida Mae's funeral was that we are running out
of what Tom Brokaw and a lot of us think of as The Greatest

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The big winner in the Mexican election was
Mexico itself, but the hero of the election was not the successful

national correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR

</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ With each passing day, we are exposed to
newer and more imaginative forms of political correctness. It is
obvious that there are no bounds, no time limits. Last week, the
Hartford Courant, the nation's longest continuously published daily
newspaper, apologized in a front page story for accepting
advertising from 1764 until 1823 for the sale of slaves and the
capture of runaways.(Kleinberg, Cox News Service.) MOVED THURSDAY

</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ TV broadcasters have reneged on their pledge to
Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to roll
out high-definition TV (HDTV) by the middle of the decade. They've
come with another idea on how to use the free public spectrum,
allotted for HDTV broadcasts and worth tens of billions of dollars.

   ADAMS-YOSEMITE _ Yosemite National Park draws a whopping 3.6
million visitors a year _ making it one of the busiest sites in the
park system _ and many credit Ansel Adams' majestic black-and-white
photographs for its popularity. ``Every year I have to have an
Ansel Adams calendar of the park,'' said the Rev. David Johnson, a
Welches, Ore., minister. ``Now I want to see the vantage points
firsthand.'' The park plays to the fascination visitors have with
Adams by offering camera walks filled with basic instruction and
nifty details on where some of his classic images were executed. We
took the walk but also hiked independently, trying to view this
magnificent land in a way similar to the great photographer.

   Principal's legacy will linger on
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The wooden plaque on Mary Ann Wietzel's desk at
Helke Elementary School summed up her philosophy as principal:
``Let them be children first.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that meant she had to be a child too _ rolling up her
trousers to wade in the stream, leading nature walks at Aullwood
Audubon Center _ then so be it.
</P>
<P>
   If that meant staying up late into the night, writing grant
proposals so students could experience ballet, the symphony,
puppetry, all the riotous variety of the arts, then so be it.
</P>
<P>
   If that meant baby pigs visited story hour at the library _
creating pandemonium when they made their escape during a reading
of Charlotte's Web, then so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to get them back in the pen now, won't we?'' Ms.
Wietzel said calmly, recruiting students to corral the renegade
swine.
</P>
<P>
   The beloved principal died June 23, at 67, from cancer, at her
home in West Milton. But her presence will continue to be felt at
the Vandalia-Butler school that she ran with high spirits and high
expectations. ``She wanted them to experience things in that
innocent naive way children can, and grasp it all,'' said Karla
Brooks, who worked with Ms. Wietzel for many years as a media aide
_ or ``storyteller,'' as she prefers to call it, in the school
library. ``She encouraged children to get messy, to get out and
play in the grass and take it all in.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalls interim principal Diane Lileas, ``If a teacher was
conducting a stream study, Mary Ann would be right there with her,
pant legs rolled up, testing the water with her kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wietzel wanted them to experience the wonders of nature
through Aullwood Audubon Center, a living laboratory in Helke's
back yard. Ms. Wietzel worked tirelessly to create community
sponsors _ the PTA and VFW Post 9582 _ to enable students to
participate in all-day ``Aullwood Adventures'' at least twice a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Each kindergarten class planted a class tree and watched it
grow. Each student brought home a sapling on Earth Day. The effect
was far greater than a once-a-year-field, notes first-grade teacher
Sherry Hartings: ``It was carried through from one year to the
next, so love of nature was instilled in them.''
</P>
<P>
   How fitting, then, that Ms. Wietzel's memorial service will be
held tomorrow at Aullwood Audubon Center. A nature walk will follow
the 10 a.m. service.
</P>
<P>
   What better place to reflect on Ms. Wietzel's legacy? Think of
the generations of children who will be enriched by the time they
spent here.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place to learn about the world's natural beauties, to
develop an affinity for nature, the environment. It's a place to
explore, to learn about prairie grasses and owls, to make homemade
candles, tap trees for maple syrup.
</P>
<P>
   It's a world remote from computer games and cable channels, a
timeless place where their ``schedule'' consists of nothing more
complicated than riding in a horse-drawn wagon on bundles of hay,
listening to an owl screech, or savoring the glint of sunlight
through a canopy of leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is going to be missed; it's not going to be an easy start
to the school year,'' Lileas said. ``Mary Ann was a person who
touched everybody's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking around the school building she adds, ``You can see her
in everything that's here.''
</P>
<P>
   That will continue to be true, one suspects, as long as Helke
remains a place where children can be children first.

 &HT;    The greatest: 'Who among us is going to take their place?'
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We gathered at a little Methodist church, as we have too often
in recent years, to say goodbye to our Aunt Ida Mae, who would have
celebrated her 93rd birthday on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   We are fortunate in funerals. Our cousin, Don Harp, is a
preacher. He knows exactly what to say when a family member crosses
the Jordan. One of the things he pointed out at Aunt Ida Mae's
funeral was that we are running out of what Tom Brokaw and a lot of
us think of as The Greatest Generation. ``Who among us is going to
take their place?'' Don asked. It is a worrisome question.
</P>
<P>
   He eulogized Aunt Ida Mae as one of the great women of our
little community, who, like Dorcas in the Bible, did good things.
One thing she did, besides teaching me to read the newspaper, was
teach a Sunday school class.
</P>
<P>
   We had only two youth classes. Lacking rooms in the church, one
met in Uncle Walter Burch's 1941 Ford, the other in Aunt Ida Mae's
Studebaker. Don said the first building program was when Aunt Ida
Mae and Uncle Welden traded their Studebaker for a Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing he said was each of us ought to call or drop a
note of appreciation to the men and women who fought World War II
for us.
</P>
<P>
   His reminder brought back one of my most vivid memories of WWII,
which for a teenager at home was mostly headlines in the newspaper
and saving tinfoil to be recycled into airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   This Methodist church stands on the very site of Mr. Marvin
Lamb's general store. When Gray Burch, one of the family of cousins
I consider the embodiment of The Greatest Generation, was in pilot
training he wrote home that he would circle Mr. Marvin's store at a
certain time on a certain afternoon. We of the home front gathered
at the appointed hour.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 o'clock we heard the roar of motors. A huge B-25 bomber in
dusky war paint appeared out of the northern sky. The bomber flew
low, tilted so that we could see into the cockpit, made two
circles, then leveled out and flew south toward Woolsey, passing
over the Reeves' house and the Burch homeplace.
</P>
<P>
   Gray went on to the Pacific, flew missions, was wounded and came
home to raise a fine family and enjoy a productive life. He never
had complaints or developed a neurosis.
</P>
<P>
   Walking out of the church after Aunt Ida Mae's funeral I
realized we were standing on the exact spot I had stood more than
50 years ago waiting for Gray to fly over in his bomber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray,'' I said, ``do you remember an afternoon when a big
bomber came out of the sky and circled over Inman?''
</P>
<P>
   He grinned. ``I sure do. You know what I remember? I remember
how the chickens scattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed since 1942. We no longer have yard chickens for
a low-flying B-25 to scatter. I hope things haven't changed so much
that we've forgotten the values The Greatest Generation took to war
and then brought home.
</P>
<P>
   I was remiss on personally thanking veterans on July 4, as
Cousin Don suggested. But I can tell you what I am going to do.
There is a presidential election coming up, and I'm going to try to
thank the veterans of World War II, of Korea and Vietnam and the
Gulf, in the best way I can. I'm going to cast my vote for the
candidate most likely to see to it that our military is strong
enough so that our children, as General Eisenhower said on a visit
to the American cemetery in Normandy, will never again be called
upon for such sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good time to remember the summer of 1950 when young
Americans, unprepared and underequipped, were sent piecemeal to be
butchered by a Communist juggernaut pouring into South Korea. It
was a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Colin Powell crying into the wilderness, nobody seems
to notice that once again the nation's military is being neglected.
The prosperity we enjoy is bought partly at the expense of the men
and women in our armed services.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War is over, we hear. All that's needed is a police
force to show up, here and there, now and then. I wouldn't bet on
it. Look around. The world is still a dangerous place.
</P>
<P>
   These are prosperous, carefree times. Never have so many had so
much. This would not be so if young Americans had not been willing
to do what they were asked to do in defense of freedom here and
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In this election year the best way we can show our appreciation
is to seriously examine issues and candidates, and then cast our
votes as close as we can to the values that made their generation a
national treasure.

 &HT;    Friend's list of helpful household pointers not relevant in this
case
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend sent me a list called ``Tips for a Lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   I've read the list carefully trying to pick up on the message
that applies to me. I don't see it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these tips, although useful, would be more appropriate
for someone who ran a Martha Stewart-styled household. That's not
me.
</P>
<P>
   My three-bedroom house is used to store motorcycle gear. One
bedroom is used for street riding gear. Another is used for race
gear. The one I sleep in holds touring gear.
</P>
<P>
   A long wrap-around sofa in the living room holds helmets, gloves
and miscellaneous gear that I grab last before going out the back
door.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one place to sit at the far end of the sofa next
to a reading lamp where I can easily reach for stacks of motorcycle
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Similar stacks of motorcycle magazines are in both bathrooms and
beside the half of the king-sized bed where I sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the bed, as well as a nearby bedroom sofa, is
a staging area for packing for motorcycle weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The den, which is a converted garage, is filled with motorcycle
parts, tools, tires and other equipment used on two roadracing
bikes, one dirt track bike, one street bike and a d mall.
</P>
<P>
   My tip is better. Eat ice cream out of the container it came in.
There's no need for sugar cones or miniature marshmallows. Avoid
malls.
</P>
<P>
   Another tip from the ``Tips for a Lifetime'' list suggests using
a meat baster to ``squeeze'' your pancake batter onto the hot
griddle _ ``perfect shaped pancakes every time.''
</P>
<P>
   If you have friends who think less of you because your pancakes
aren't perfectly shaped, you need to get new friends. Besides, if
you want a perfectly shaped pancake all you have to do is pour
enough batter in the skillet to cover the entire pan.
</P>
<P>
   ``To determine whether an egg is fresh, immerse it in a pan of
cool, salted water. If it sinks, it is fresh. If it rises to the
surface, throw it away,'' suggests my ``Tips for a Lifetime'' list.
</P>
<P>
   That's interesting _ if it's true. Since I've had little trouble
in my lifetime with rotten eggs that I bought at a grocery store
and stored in my refrigerator, this suggestion appears to be a lot
of unnecessary work.
</P>
<P>
   I crack eggs into a skillet. If one stinks, it isn't fresh.
Scrape it into the garbage disposal. If the next two or three also
are rotten, take the rest of the eggs outside and throw them at a
tree or other targets of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't throw out all that leftover wine: Freeze it into ice
cubes for future use in casseroles and sauces,'' suggests the
``Tips for a Lifetime'' list.
</P>
<P>
   What leftover wine? Just when you think you've heard it all,
you're hit with a brand new concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a splinter, reach for the Scotch tape before
resorting to tweezers or a needle. Simply put the Scotch tape over
the splinter, then pull it off. Scotch tape removes most splinters
painlessly and easily,'' suggests the ``Tips for a Lifetime'' list.
</P>
<P>
   That's a handy tip. If Scotch tape works on most splinters, duct
tape should work on all splinters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep rolls of duct tape with you at all times.'' That's my tip
for a lifetime.

`QUICK-RESTORE' ERASES PROBLEM _ AND MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a Compaq with Windows 98. I tried to
download an antivirus program, and it caused my computer to crash.
I used the Compaq ``quick-restore'' CD, but in the process lost
Microsoft Word and Microsoft Works and a few other programs and
files.
</P>
<P>
   _ Overkill
</P>
<P>
   Dear Over: Ummmm, I think you might have overreacted a tad. The
only time you want to pull out one of those quick-restore CDs is
when you've hammered your system so badly that there's just no
turning back.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that a bungled download was enough to kill
your PC, although almost anything is possible. I certainly would
have asked the office geek to take a quick look at it before
dropping the big one, though.
</P>
<P>
   A restore CD usually reformats and rebuilds the computer to its
pristine, out-of-the-box state. That may or may not include any
bundled applications like Word or Works. Generally, if the
applications aren't included in the restore disc, there's some sort
of utility that allows the buyer to create a set of installation
floppies. I guess it's sort of late for that.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the original documentation and product registration
numbers, you might be able to wheedle a copy of the software out of
Compaq _ or maybe even Microsoft _ for a nominal fee. If not, I'd
suspect that some local software store will be more than happy to
take your check for a whole new set of programs.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I added a 3-megabyte hard drive to my computer
and made it a slave to Drive C. I am now having problems with space
on C. Is it possible to use a program called ``Uninstaller'' to
move DOS to the second hard drive, leaving only Windows on Drive C?
Is this the best solution to the problem?
</P>
<P>
   _ Too Much Stuff
</P>
<P>
   Dear Too: Nooooooooo. Does that answer your question?
</P>
<P>
   First, those uninstaller programs usually require that they be
installed before you install an application. They keep a record of
which files are loaded where so they can find them all later.
</P>
<P>
   Second, you could use some geek tweaks to boot from a secondary
drive, but why clog up the plumbing? And, all you Poindexters out
there, don't start writing me with duct-tape-and-spit solutions.
Sure, maybe you can get it to work, but this guy is a normal human.
</P>
<P>
   Third, DOS and Windows are used to being in the same place,
since they're all part of one happy operating system. Well, not
that happy, but you get the point. Trying to scatter them over two
drives is just going to give you a major headache.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you want to do: Uninstall any application on the
primary hard drive that you can, then reinstall it on the new one.
Leave the operating system alone.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What is your insight on all these sweepstakes?
Are they actually giving away all that money? Do you by any chance
know which ones are legitimate?
</P>
<P>
   _ Barnum Was Right
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BARNUM: The only truly legitimate sweepstakes I can fully
endorse is the Bombay Institute's Cash-a-Palooza, in which entrants
are asked to put their names and addresses on 10-dollar bills and
send them to my Cayman Islands address. Some lucky winner could
receive as much as $20 if I draw his or her name out of a hat. Or
not. I'm not sure where I put my hat.
</P>
<P>
   (About 30 attorneys want to make sure that you know Dr. Emilio
Bombay's last answer was a joke. Get it? Please don't send him
money. However, you can write to him at

</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I'm a ``Survivor'' survivor. In fact, I love the
show.
</P>
<P>
   I love all those shows, in this summer of televoyeurism. What is
television but voyeurism, and what is much of life?
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who follow national politics, for example, aren't
interested in Al Gore's ideas about pharmaceutical companies or
George W. Bush's education plan.
</P>
<P>
   We're waiting to see them fall on their faces (maybe literally,
like that young guy running against Hillary), say dumb things, get
caught with their hands in naughty places _ and then have to eat
something much worse than rat meat but found abundantly in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Voting them out of the political jungle is an afterthought, and
we make odd choices.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Clinton. Sometimes the most egregious character is the
prize-winning survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead. Vote me out of the profession. I'm the last columnist
in America to make strained ``Survivor'' comparisons, and I never
wrote about Darva at all.
</P>
<P>
   I've been out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   Although filled with obnoxious slackers, yuppies and corporate
trainers not native to the island of Pulau Tiga, ``Survivor'' is
supposed to be exotic escapism. Sometimes it seems uncomfortably
close to real life.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere of CBS's ``Big Brother'' was on after ``Survivor''
Wednesday night, and it should be a great show. There are dozens of
cameras in the house to follow the lives of the contestants, and
all the contestants they introduced seemed like real jerks, except
for the New York guy with one leg.
</P>
<P>
   I can't wait to see how he takes a shower or how long the beauty
queen takes to put on her makeup, and whether their bathroom time
gets them kicked out of the house. You know that chubby mini-golf
fan will be heading back to his chubby family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' is wish fulfillment for young people who live in
expensive places, where they have to share apartments with a
half-dozen people. It's great to watch jerks get the boot _ one
deviation from reality.
</P>
<P>
   Voyeurism, we love to watch it. In some ways, it's even better
than voyeurism itself.
</P>
<P>
   We love to watch Springer's audience egging on grappling
transvestites. We love the sight of special prosecutors
transcribing every gruesome detail of a president's love affair. We
love watching idiots watch each other on islands and in bugged
houses, while they make nasty comments about each other.
</P>
<P>
   The unanswered questions are so alluring. Who's boinking whom?
Was that really dog food they ate from the can? Where'd they get
that green pepper? Where do they go on that island to poo?
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' has a camera over the can, but the pompous host
(who calls everyone ``my friend,'' when no one is anyone's friend)
says it won't be turned on unless contestants start holding
conferences in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holding conferences'' in the bathroom _ I want to see that on
a family network.
</P>
<P>
   In typical form, PBS has offered up a costume drama version of
``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother.'' The British ``1900 House'' shows
a middle-class family living with the same discomforts, lack of
amenities and confining clothing as typical British families had
100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This show, almost as hyped as ``Survivor,'' is billed as
educational, but come on. It's like PBS's ``Antiques Road Show.''
You don't tune in for education, but to see people with pained
looks on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Antiques Road Show,'' they're pained because they're stuck
with old junk. The people on ``1900 Show'' are stuck in old junk.
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable moments, of course, concerned the gruesome
details of the lady of the house's undergarments. But the thing
about living 1900-style that drove the women craziest was the fact
that they had to wash their hair with some kind of soap goo.
</P>
<P>
   The hell with getting the vote. Getting shampoo was more
liberating for women, and getting vacuum cleaners a close second.
</P>
<P>
   That's the educational message of ``1900 House,'' as far as I
can see. Strange how the man of the family seemed to love living in
1900.
</P>
<P>
   One thing missing from ``1900 House,'' though. Neighbors. There
were no 1900 neighbors to have to tea and talk about later, and no
1900 neighbors to watch while they played Lady Chatterly with the
gardener.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have TV then. They had to take their voyeurism
straight, or well, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   One of the objects found in my great-aunt Blanche's 1900 house
in Maine, and passed down to me, was a pair of antique U.S. Army
binoculars she used to see which of her husband's employees was
visiting the liquor store.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't get kicked off a show. They got booted from their
jobs at the lumber mill.
</P>
<P>
   You really had to be tough to survive back then, and Big Aunt
was watching. Times haven't changed, just channels.

&HT;     SWINGING NUN MIXES NINE IRONS WITH THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By THEOLA S. LABBE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTAMONT, N.Y. _ Dominican Sister Dorothy Ederer doesn't sing,
she swings.
</P>
<P>
   To help her fellow golfers see spirituality in everything from a
missed putt to a hole-in-one, the swinging nun has written ``A
Golfer's Day with the Master: Spiritual Wisdom From the Fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ederer, co-director of the Altamont-based Joshua
Foundation, which offers retreats that focus on bringing out the
relevance of the Gospel in everyday life, golf is ``a great time to
really listen to God.''
</P>
<P>
   While other sports may have hustle and bustle, ``in golf you
have to be quiet when the other person is teeing off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And what might a golfer ponder when stepping up to the tee? Try
Psalm 16:7-11, which Ederer calls the Prayer Against Opponents,
where a player can ask God for guidance ``along a crooked fairway''
and protection against brand-new balls sinking into muddy waters.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the Ten Commandments for Golfers, such as, ``Thou
shall not covet thy neighbor's golf sweaters,'' and using God's
name only to praise. Another section of the book, Beatitudes for
the Golfer, offers lighthearted ways of looking at the ups and
downs of the game. In the book's Personal Reflections section,
Ederer uses game terms like handicap, dogleg, and sand trap to
teach life lessons that can be applied on and off the greens.
</P>
<P>
   Ederer started playing golf a few years ago after two knee
surgeries forced her to give up racquetball. She was working as a
campus minister at Western Michigan University and took lessons
from a golf pro in her parish. After getting a set of clubs for
Christmas, she started playing golf three days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I became addicted,'' she said. The idea to bring
God and golf together came to Ederer years later as a vision in the
middle of the night, when she reflected on Psalm 139 and turned it
into a psalm for a golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not rewriting Scripture,'' noted Ederer, who said she
shared her work with her brother, a priest, and he gave the idea a
hearty thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Ederer said she put together homemade copies of her
writings and gave them to friends as Christmas gifts. But demand
and interest grew so quickly that Ederer found herself filling book
orders for a book that, at the time, did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Ederer, a previously published author, already had an agent, so
when she mentioned the golf book to him, ``He thought it was a
great idea,'' she said. Doubleday, which published the book in May,
also published Ederer's ``Colors of the Spirit'' in 1998, which has
sold about 8,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   The golf book costs $15.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Corbin, a Doubleday editor, described Ederer as a
practical writer who gives people spiritual ideas to think about
``in concrete circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Ederer, who now is working on a third book about how God brings
surprises into our lives, said her latest book probably will not
improve someone's golf game, but that wasn't her goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is for people to stop and think about God more,'' she
said. ``Even when you can't get on the golf course, you can pick it
up and read it.''

&HT;     HOW TO BE A NETWORK SURVIVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television executives have a very simple blueprint for
programming, if not successful programming:
</P>
<P>
   Step One: Milk every last laugh, tear and cent out of
conveyor-belt dramas and sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   Step Two: When the critical yammering gets too loud, throw
something on of value and distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Step Three: Yank it after three weeks if the numbers aren't
there (two weeks if it's set in a mental hospital). Practice shrug
and pained expression in front of mirror before going out to
explain this decision.
</P>
<P>
   Step Four: See what's working in Britain, or Sweden, or Belgium,
or all those other countries that think Jerry Lewis is funny.
</P>
<P>
   Step Five: Steal it, Americanize it, promote the hell out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Step Six: If the other guy gets it first, copy it to death.
</P>
<P>
   Step Seven: When your facsimile of the facsimile fails
miserably, write it off the whole genre as a passing fad.
</P>
<P>
   Step Eight: Repeat Step One.
</P>
<P>
   After the success of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' last
summer on ABC, all the networks broke their ankles leaping aboard
the bandwagon by putting on game shows of their own. But they
missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted contestants, yes, but we craved the real-life drama _
or at least manufactured real-life drama. We wanted reality, and we
still wanted game shows.
</P>
<P>
   Put them together and we go nuts. Proving the enduring appeal of
backstabbing and rodent cuisine, ``Survivor'' has been this
summer's megahit, outpacing even ``Millionaire'' (often in reruns).
This week, ``Survivor'' got a brother in arms.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the castaway contest was teamed on CBS with ``Big
Brother,'' a voyeurfest in which 10 strangers are locked in a house
with each other as cameras record every move for both television
and the Internet (http://www.bigbrother2000.com). Last one standing
after the others are voted out by viewers wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' airs at 8 p.m. five times a week (taking off
Sundays and Wednesdays.) Between this and ``Survivor,'' you'll be
left with little time for your own reality. Depending on who you
are, that might be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, reality shows are just a blurred, manufactured
parallel to real life. Where things get really blurry is when the
CBS newsfolks, both at the network and the local levels, get into
the game by promoting the shows during newscasts. It is inevitably
wrong as is it inevitable in the infotainment era.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no place to hide,'' ``Big Brother'' host
Julie Chen intoned Wednesday night. How right she is: Chen
moonlights as a CBS morning news anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Stick with the day job, Julie. Normally, I have a high threshold
for news-entertainment crossover, but this blatant self-promotion
is just unseemly. Maybe it's because it's done without any trace of
guilt or shame.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Millionaire'' and ``Survivor,'' ``Big Brother'' was
stolen from Europe. (During this patriotic season, let's remember
that the ultimate American sitcom, ``All in the Family,'' was in
fact a remake of the British comedy ``Till Death Do Us Part.'')
</P>
<P>
   Their other common element is that all these shows allow us to
become couch participants, virtual contestants who watch them
either vicariously and/or with a sense of superiority.
</P>
<P>
   There's the ``What would I do?'' factor: Would I have the guts
to ride a motorcycle through a ring of fire? Would I jump into the
bear den to save a fallen child? Would I really think that a rat
cooked over an open flame tastes like chicken?
</P>
<P>
   Or we sit back with a ``what a moron'' smirk as we watch people
who were stupid or desperate enough to make fools of themselves on
national television. No, we wouldn't give lip to a cop when there's
a camera peering over his shoulder. No, we wouldn't eat beetle
larvae. No, we wouldn't cheat on our cousin-girlfriend with her
father's dentist. And c'mon, Regis: Everybody knows the democracy
with the biggest population is India.
</P>
<P>
   More reality is coming, even to sitcoms: In the new CBS comedy
``Bette,'' Bette Midler is essentially playing herself. But this is
not the death of drama or comedies; like the cockroach, they will
survive television Armageddonor ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire II,'' whichever comes first. Remember, it was the
news magazine that was squeezing dramas and sitcoms off the air.
But, like all ``next big things,'' this will eventually fade, and
everyone will be back to Step One.
</P>
<P>
   A final thought on a show that should have worked, but didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Extreme: When Things Go Wrong'' had everything. Disasters.
Crashes. Mayhem. The word ``extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem: Nobody dies, gets it, takes a dirt nap.
</P>
<P>
   Now, is that reality?
</P>
<P>
   The show didn't get picked up by enough stations, and it appears
it won't make the air. Serves 'em right.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     POLL SHOWS CONCERN ABOUT INVESTING IN TECH COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Americans are wildly enthusiastic about the
future of Internet companies. Just don't ask them to put their
money where their mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   So says a survey released by Scudder Kemper Investments Inc. of
Boston, which polled 2,900 Americans to gauge their confidence in
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While 71 percent of those surveyed said they believe Internet
executives are ``smart and well-educated individuals who can run a
successful company and succeed for their investors,'' 65 percent of
those polled said they have shied away from technology or Internet
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting. There are some real contradictions between
perception and behaviors,'' said Dianne Michael, a spokeswoman for
Scudder Kemper, an investment company. ``It's clear investors are
bullish on Internet stocks and digital investing. They feel Net
companies will be the largest and most influential in the future.
But, they are still reluctant to invest outright in technology
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, sponsored by Scudder Kemper, was conducted following
the mid-spring drop in technology stock prices, which could explain
why investors were hesitant. Dot-com riches are still fresh in
their memories, said Michael, and so are dot-com disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other findings of the survey:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly four in five Americans do not think executives of
Internet companies are ``too young and inexperienced to lead and
safeguard investors' money.''
</P>
<P>
   _ More than half of those surveyed (52 percent) do not think it
is foolish to invest in Internet and technology companies that have
not made a profit.
</P>
<P>
   _ While 59 percent express concern that the U.S. economy may not
be quite as healthy as it appears, 71 percent do not believe that
the bottom is going to fall out of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rich remain bullish. Of those surveyed with an annual
income exceeding $100,000 per year, 60 percent chose the statement,
``The economy is strong and will remain healthy'' over ``The
economy appears strong, but underneath it's not as healthy as it
looks.'' In contrast, fewer than half of middle-income Americans
and only one-quarter of those with household incomes below $36,000
had such a positive outlook.

   Arthur's workspace is pretty much like the others around him. He
has his own computer, his own chair and his own stash of goodies.
Still, his behavior isn't quite what you'd expect in the rarefied
intellectual atmosphere of the MIT Media Lab. He has a habit of
dropping chunks of chewed vegetable on the floor, and he sometimes
attacks visitors. But Arthur has an excuse _ he has a mental age of
about four. Oh, and he's a parrot.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that unusual to see animals in the Media Lab. After
all, lots of researchers bring their dogs. But Arthur is there to
work. Every day, his supervisor, Ben Resner, gives him a specially
designed clicker. One click changes the image on his computer
screen from a car to an owl. A second changes it again, to an image
of a woman. A third conjures up a picture of an African grey
parrot, the same species as Arthur. A fourth brings back the car.
And if you think that sounds a bit like browsing, you'd be right.
Arthur is learning to surf the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is to build a Web browser for
parrots,'' says Arthur's owner, Irene Pepperberg, a biologist from
the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg is currently at MIT as a visiting professor, and she
and Resner believe that by teaching Arthur to use the Internet,
they could liberate thousands of captive parrots from a life of
boredom and loneliness. It could also reveal something about parrot
behavior and cognition. And once they've got the birds online,
they're planning to do the same for dogs.
</P>
<P>
   For Pepperberg, the InterPet project is a natural extension of
her work with African greys. They are among the most intelligent
and communicative members of the parrot family, and she famously
taught one of her birds, Alex, to communicate using spoken
language. Alex is now 23, and can recognize and name around fifty
objects, identify seven colors and five shapes, count up to six and
understand the concepts ``same,'' ``different,'' ``bigger'' and
``smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg claims Alex's skills are proof that African greys are
at least as intelligent as chimps and dolphins, and may even be
able to outwit four-year-old children at certain tasks. This
intelligence, she says, is one reason they make good pets. The
other is their sociability.
</P>
<P>
   In the wild, parrots live in flocks and become extremely anxious
if they are separated from the rest. Captive birds constantly crave
attention. But the very characteristics that make parrots better
pets than, say, sparrows, also make them hugely demanding. Brainy,
friendly pets need stimulation and company. Take those away _ by
going to work nine hours a day, for instance _ and you get a bored
and lonely animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``These really are intelligent birds,'' says Liz Wilson, a
Pennsylvania-based parrot shrink who helps owners with their
delinquent birds. ``If they're forced to sit in their cages for
nine or ten hours a day with the same old toys, they get bored out
of their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, an understimulated parrot will become withdrawn and
start plucking out its feathers. At worst, its relationship with
its owner can deteriorate to the point of conflict. That's why
Pepperberg is so keen to get Arthur online. Although he's her pet,
she can't take him home because her roommate in Boston has a cat.
Poor Arthur has to spend his nights alone in a cage in the lab, and
he needs something to do. Pepperberg and Resner reckon that the Web
would be infinitely more interesting than a ball with a bell in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toys are okay, but we want to allow him to be social,'' Resner
says.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Arthur's browser consists of a crude plastic box
with two clickable levers. The left lever selects pictures, the
right lever lets him choose snatches of music. The images are
displayed on a liquid crystal screen above his perch. Arthur won't
look at a conventional cathode ray tube because to him it looks
like a strobe light. Parrots' flicker fusion rate _ the frequency
at which their eyes convert a series of still images into a
continuous motion picture _ is much higher than that of humans.
Unfortunately, Arthur doesn't yet seem that enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   The images were designed to produce distinct responses: the
woman ought to be a favorite (it's Pepperberg), while the owl _ a
natural enemy _ should be an instant turn-off. The car is supposed
to be neutral, while the picture of the parrot should elicit
different responses depending on Arthur's mood. The trouble is, the
pictures seem meaningless to Arthur _ he's not especially moved by
any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's acting like a child with an OK-ish new toy. He's not that
eager,'' Pepperberg says.
</P>
<P>
   But she's sure that some simple modifications can win Arthur
over. For one thing, at the moment his gear is right in the middle
of a busy, interesting lab. Pepperberg wants to put it in his cage
so he can explore it when he's bored and lonely. She also thinks
the system needs a general upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't got software that he is interested in yet,'' she
says. ``We need to get the ergonomics of the clicker right so he
plays with it more and enjoys it, and we need to put up images he
likes.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why she is planning to install a video camera at her
parents' house in Tucson, Ariz., where her other parrots are
staying while she is at MIT. She plans to feed the images into
Arthur's browser so he can contact his old friends at will. He
might even be able to videoconference them. If that works, then
it's a short step to setting up chat rooms where parrots can
socialize with one another in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Resner envisages special parrot pages on the Web.
They would have to be ring-fenced to keep the birds hooked up to
interesting sites, but child safety software like Net Nanny
suggests this would be easy. And what would be in these parrot
pages? Video-on-demand, perhaps. Sound boutiques with new and
exciting noises to imitate, jukeboxes and basic video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If parrots like it and owners want it, the service providers
would be moronic not to do it,'' Resner says. ``Parrots could be
really heavy users.'' &QL;

   There's nothing supernatural about ghosts, doppelgangers and
out-of-body experiences, says a Swiss neuroscientist. They are
simply phantom sensations like a phantom limb, he says, but spread
to the whole body.
</P>
<P>
   People experience phantom limbs _ the sense that an amputated
limb is still present _ when the part of the brain that normally
senses the limb loses those signals. Peter Brugger of the
University Hospital in Zurich says that doppelgangers, in which
people are aware of phantom ``doubles'' of themselves, have a
similar origin.
</P>
<P>
   Some people actually see their double, often as a mirror image.
This may be the result of damage to visual areas of the brain that
affect the way we sense our body, Brugger says. Others merely feel
the presence of a double without actually seeing one. He believes
that these doubles are generated when the parietal lobes, the
regions responsible for the distinction between body and
surrounding space, are damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-body experiences, where a person sees their body from the
outside, may be caused by temporary overactivity of certain brain
regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excitability of the temporal lobes seems to be a plausible
explanation,'' Brugger says.
</P>
<P>
   These regions are connected to the parietal lobes and are
sensitive to visual signals, low levels of oxygen and emotional
arousal. Brugger believes the brain could account for other
paranormal experiences: ``Ghosts are probably nothing more but also
nothing less than phantoms of the body.'' &QL;

   The bird virus that killed seven New Yorkers last year has now
spread all over the Americas, say U.S. researchers. They warn that
the Gulf coast of the United States will probably see the next
outbreak of West Nile virus. Despite the threat, U.S. authorities
have so far failed to provide the research funding to keep tabs on
the virus in wild birds. The scientists say that scrupulous
monitoring of bird populations is needed, otherwise it won't be
possible to identify and spray high-risk areas with insecticide to
kill the mosquitoes that transmit the virus to people.
</P>
<P>
   The infection is endemic to Africa, Asia and Europe, where it
resides harmlessly in many bird species but kills others, according
to Bob McLean, head of the National Wildlife Health Center in
Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Humans usually get the disease from mosquito bites when the
population of infected city birds is sufficiently large to infect
enough mosquitoes. In 1997, 527 people in Bucharest were ill with
West Nile virus, and 50 died. There is no specific treatment for
the infection.
</P>
<P>
   The virus may have reached New York last summer in a bird
imported from Israel. However, West Nile expert Zdanek Hubalek of
the Czech Academy of Sciences, suggests it may have originally
escaped from the Sloan-Kettering Institute in New York, where in
the 1950s, a strain of the virus was given to 95 terminal cancer
patients as an experimental treatment. But there is evidence that
the New York outbreak last summer which killed thousands of crows,
and caused encephalitis in 61 New Yorkers, seven of whom died,
resulted from a different strain. But what is certain, McLean says,
is that as early as last summer the virus had already spread to an
alarming extent in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had already infected more than half the local geese and
sparrows. That's scary,'' McClean says.
</P>
<P>
   And the discovery of the virus in birds in New York, New Jersey
and Delaware last month has dashed hopes that it would not survive
the winter. John Rappole and his colleagues at the Smithsonian
Institution's zoo in Front Royal, Va., have calculated that the
virus would spread far and wide from New York if there were
susceptible migratory birds congregating on mosquito-infested
wetlands nearby. In this month's issue of Emerging Infectious
Diseases, they and Hubalek report that there are 77 migratory
species there, including ducks, starlings, terns and gulls, capable
of carrying the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virus is probably in every corner of North America by
now'' as well as parts of South America, says Rappole. Another
outbreak could occur anywhere there are enough infected birds,
possibly this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the next outbreak will be along the Gulf coast, where
northern migrants remain concentrated,'' Rappole says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential to capture and test healthy local birds to
know where West Nile poses a threat,'' McLean says. ``Then mosquito
spraying can be targeted to protect people.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean's proposals to screen birds in the coming months have not
yet been funded. Eastern and Gulf states plan to test dead birds
and ``sentinel'' chickens _ caged birds used as an early warning
system. But this is much less sensitive, McLean warns. Caged
chickens are less likely to encounter infected mosquitoes than
free-range birds.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Ostroff of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta told New Scientist: ``Extensive screening of
wild birds in hopes of finding the virus would not be
cost-effective.'' &QL;

   For us, oxygen is a benign gas essential to life, but for a
developing fetus it can be a killer. One in six pregnancies comes
to a premature end, and oxygen may play a key role in these
miscarriages, say scientists who have measured levels of oxygen in
the placenta through the first third of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The results have encouraged senior obstetrician Lesley Regan of
Imperial College, London, to advocate testing whether high doses of
antioxidant vitamins could reduce the risk of miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the researchers, Graham Burton of Cambridge University,
says, ``There might well be women, not at high risk, who have
miscarriages for no known reason. This provides us with an
explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, with Eric Jauniaux of University College London, placed
a tiny monitor in the placentas of 30 women. They found that oxygen
levels in blood entering the umbilical chord tripled between the
eighth and 15th weeks of pregnancy. Because their technique might
harm the fetus, the researchers only studied women who had chosen
to terminate normal pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Most embryologists have traditionally thought that oxygen levels
rise gently throughout pregnancy. The new results confirm the
suspicion that oxygen levels suddenly shoot up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly shows us there are two distinct phases in
pregnancy,'' Burton says. ``In the first trimester in the placenta
there is a very, very low oxygen concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as showing that the fetus requires very low oxygen for
normal development early in pregnancy, the results suggest that the
change from low to high oxygen levels is a relatively sudden and
stressful event for the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 10 to 12 weeks, as oxygen comes in, this surge, combined
with any additional factors, may be enough to cause spontaneous
miscarriage,'' Burton says.
</P>
<P>
   Research by Burton and Jauniaux suggests that cells called
cytotrophoblasts, which anchor the placenta in the womb and invade
the blood vessels to limit oxygen supply to the fetus, dissipate at
around eight to 10 weeks. This would allow more oxygen in. Taking
antioxidant vitamins to mop up free-radical chemicals formed by
oxygen should help protect the fetus, Jauniaux says.
</P>
<P>
   Regan agrees that there should now be trials of antioxidant
vitamins. She has pledged to work with Jauniaux on such a study.
But she notes: ``There's no information in the literature to
indicate that vitamins C and E are safe in pregnancy.'' &QL;

 &HT;    MEXICO'S RULING PARTY DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO IN DEFEAT
 &HT;    With MEXICO-REVOLUTION
 &HT;    For Sunday, July 9
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ When it suffered public repudiation in 1968 for
gunning down students demanding freedom of speech, Mexico's ruling
party recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, when its top officials engaged in fratricidal
assassinations to settle scores and mismanaged the economy so badly
that the peso's value was slashed in half, the party regrouped.
</P>
<P>
   But after last Sunday, Mexico's legendary Institutional
Revolutionary Party, the PRI, is facing its ultimate test. Can it
survive the shock of finally losing Mexico's presidency _ its seat
of power _ for the first time in 71 years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said Rafael Oseguera, the PRI's vice coordinator in the
federal Chamber of Deputies. An optimist, Oseguera didn't let
defeat stop him from jetting off to Madrid, Spain, for a
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't reject any reforms as we consider our future,'' he
said before he leaving. ``The colors of the party, the name, the
symbol, everything. We have to have a revolution inside the PRI so
it can enter a new stage.''
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a crushing defeat Sunday to presidential
opposition challenger Vicente Fox Quesada, the long knives came out
at PRI headquarters, a stark gray cement complex in Mexico City
that matches supporters' funereal mood right now.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has lost governors races before, but seven decades of
control over the powerful federal government are not relinquished
easily or without rancor.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida, wept
after losing last Sunday's election. Insiders say PRI member were
utterly stunned. They fully expected its vaunted electoral machine
to muster enough voters who'd always marched to the polls like
sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, voters handed the PRI a crisis, and an already fragile
conglomeration of divergent political tendencies and interests have
exploded into warfare. The president and secretary general tried to
resign ``in the name of dignity,'' but were persuaded to stay until
the party holds a convention to chart its future.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI was born from the Mexican Revolution, and ever since
1929 it has remained in power by employing a flexible ideology
borrowed from socialism, capitalism, nationalism _ and most will
admit now, intimidation, favoritism and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   As it slides into second place _ second in Congress and the
Senate _ the party doesn't seem to have a clear message or reason
for being. The one thing it could surely offer _ access to
executive power _ is gone.
</P>
<P>
   If it can summon its warring factions, it may remake itself as a
center-left party with a huge task: convincing Mexicans it's become
a modern political party that will represent people's interests
instead of lining its pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the party's old guard, known as the ``dinosaurs,''
are furious at Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo for supporting
free-market economic reforms that extended the gap between rich and
poor and making the PRI look unrevolutionary. They are also upset
at Zedillo for appearing to cozy up to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo is a Yale-educated economist who was pushed into running
for president in 1994 when candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was
assassinated. Zedillo read the writing on the wall in Mexico, where
people were reaching their limit with an archaic political system.
He, along with the opposition, shepherded through pivotal reforms
that set up an independent institute to supervise elections.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms gave equal public funding to the PRI and its two top
competitors and opened up unprecedented access to commercial time
in the media. For his efforts to convince his party to accept these
changes, Zedillo has been praised by Fox and from abroad as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   But the dinosaurs are accusing the president _ traditionally an
untouchable authority _ with caring more about his personal image
as a reformer than the party's future.
</P>
<P>
   For many, a symbolic insult was seeing Zedillo congratulate Fox
before returns were officially in on election night and watching
the two embrace the next day in the presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI should distance itself from the current president of
the Republic because for six years he dedicated himself to changing
party leaders at will and dismantling the strength of our political
organization,'' said a stricken Manuel Fuentes, who resigned a
month ago from a top party post.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-PRI attitude of Zedillo has been manifested,''
Fuentes said. ``He played Gorbachev and ended up affecting our
party.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``technocrats,'' Zedillo's wing of the PRI _ some of whom
were in charge of Labastida's campaign _ say they prefer to
modernize the party and prepare it for competition, while
continuing to guide Mexico into global capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reach out to the new thinking of society _ and
young people with new values,'' said Javier Trevino, a
Harvard-educated international affairs advisor to Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   And outside the PRI, there are those who believe the party has
become, mostly, a collection of crooks.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who reveled in such attacks during the campaign, was
magnanimous in victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the great opportunity the PRI has to make itself a
real political party,'' Fox said. ``Certainly defeat is painful.
But defeat can also be a departure point for reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Edna Jaime, who studies the PRI, said a
bloodbath after defeat ``is totally natural. The first phase of the
PRI's restructuring is going to be one of lynchings and looking for
scapegoats. But if there is something we know about the PRI, it's
that it is pragmatic.''
</P>
<P>
   But already, signs are strong that the PRI governors of the
southern states, where the party still reigns and has a strong
machine, are rising to the top of the boiling cauldron.
</P>
<P>
   Tabasco governor Roberto Madrazo, who ran in second place
against Labastida in a gimmicky primary election last fall, appears
eager to capture the leadership that's up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately released a letter to the party urging it to
pursue ``the recuperation of our social essence'' as an alternative
to Fox's National Action Party, the PAN. Even among many voters who
choose Fox this time, the PAN is perceived as too conservative,
Catholic and indifferent to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But someone like Madrazo, who is so lean and hungry, knows he
can't win the presidency just on a populist platform,'' said
political analyst Federico Estevez. ``He's also got to re-invent
himself and appeal to a modern Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The technocrats, Estevez said, are the ones who could get their
marching orders right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always Cuba,'' he joked. ``They need people like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the southern governors are lining up with Madrazo, along
with the large PRI-affiliated teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   Other PRI labor unions, part of the party's old political
infrastructure, seem paralyzed, unsure of what to do next. The oil
workers' union issued a statement to Fox, reiterating its
opposition to all attempts to privatize Mexico's oil _ a move Fox
has already said he won't make.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows if this will happen, but the party would do well to
dissolve PRI associations such as the ``Peasant Torch,'' an
organization that mobilizes lower-income supporters to intimidate
the opposition in provinces, Estevez said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a band of ``Peasant Torch'' members in Mexico state
rose up in a violent but isolated protest against what they
charged, ironically, was electoral fraud against the PRI in local
mayors' elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're shock troops, `` Estevez said, ``so maybe now, like
good old soldiers, they'll just fade away.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's Cinderella economy has turned a fairy
tale into reality: Washington is taking in money faster than
politicians can spend it.
</P>
<P>
   But the country's glittering coach of budget surpluses could
turn back into a deficit pumpkin, some analysts say, if new plans
for federal spending and tax cuts collide with an economic
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   For now, everyone's focused on happy endings. Within a week or
so, the Congressional Budget Office will raise, once again, its
projections for future budget surpluses, already $4.2 trillion over
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even setting aside Social Security revenues, the White House
foresees surpluses totaling $1.9 trillion _ that's an entire year's
worth of federal spending _ in the decade to come.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton and his Republican adversaries in
Congress have both claimed credit for balancing the federal books
for the first time in a generation, the true slayer of the deficit
dragon has been the dazzling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Showing unprecedented strength beyond all forecasts, it is now
hurtling through its tenth consecutive year of investment-led
growth stretching back to March 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Far from losing steam, the economy grew at an inflation-adjusted
annual rate of 5.4 percent during the first three months of this
year, following a blistering 7.3 percent rate in the fourth quarter
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters, both government and private, believe the country's
economic metabolism has sped up, placing growth on a permanently
higher plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the long run, we think that the economy can grow faster
than in the past,'' said Gerald Cohen, senior economist with the
New York investment firm, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1973 and 1995, said Cohen, economic growth averaged
between 2.5 percent and 3 percent a year. Looking forward, he said,
Merrill Lynch projects growth rates averaging between 3.5 percent
and 4 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is huge. A swing in growth rates of one
percentage point is worth $99 billion in economic output.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, in its midyear review of budget data, the White
House projected that economic output would swell to a breathtaking
$16.1 trillion by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   That represents growth averaging about 3 percent a year, after
adjusting for inflation. That's nearly half a percentage point
higher than White House aides expected last February, when Clinton
submitted the 2001 budget proposals currently making their way
through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has been stronger over the last six months than
appeared likely in the late fall, when the budget was forecast,''
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers explained to reporters in
releasing the administration's midyear review of budget data.
</P>
<P>
   That means ``substantially more revenues this year and a higher
jumping-off point for future growth,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   A large pie yields large slices.
</P>
<P>
   For every dollar of activity the economy generates, the federal
government takes in 20 cents. That means taxpayers will pour a
projected $27 trillion into the U.S. Treasury over the coming
decade, the White House reckons.
</P>
<P>
   That's a full $1.1 trillion more than the administration had
dared hope for just six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far, spending hasn't kept pace with the rush of unexpected
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Between October and May, for instance, taxes paid by individuals
and corporations rose 15.2 percent from a year earlier. Government
spending, however, rose just 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a $120 billion surplus, up $80 billion from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But as the economy giveth, so it taketh away. A downturn could
have a vicious impact on the rosy projections of good times to
come.
</P>
<P>
   If growth slows much below 2 percent a year, for example,
economists would expect to see a rise in unemployment, now at a
generational low of 4 percent. As workers go off the payroll, tax
revenues decline even as federal payments for unemployment benefits
go up.
</P>
<P>
   In such an economy, the ambitious surplus numbers could quickly
turn around.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to predict what might put the brakes on the
runaway economy, or when it might occur.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices haven't hurt yet, but affordable energy
supplies are clearly critical to economic vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing trade imbalances _ the U.S. trade deficit soared to a
record $265 billion last year and is still growing _ could drive
down the value of the dollar against other world currencies.
</P>
<P>
   That would either drive up the price of imports or force a hike
in U.S. interest rates to strengthen the greenback, or both.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, and many others, Clinton has warned that the
country shouldn't eat its surplus chickens before they hatch.
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed using the Social Security surplus, projected at
$2.3 trillion over the coming decade, to help pay down the $5.6
trillion national debt accumulated during 30 years of deficit
spending.
</P>
<P>
   If the government could retire the $3.2 trillion of that debt
owed to banks and other public investors, it would mean hundreds of
billions of dollars in interest savings.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has spending as well as saving in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, what are we going to do with this'' surplus,
President Clinton told several thousand government workers gathered
a week ago in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``How a country handles its moment of prosperity and opportunity
is just as stern a test of our vision, our judgment and our
character as how we handle adversity,'' warned Clinton. ``We will
never be forgiven if we blow this.''
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed $460 billion in spending hikes over 10 years,
mostly to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and to extend
health care coverage to low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also has proposed tax cuts, mostly targeted toward
lower-income or middle-class workers, amounting to $360 billion
over 10 years. He would partly offset those programs, though, with
a long list of tax code changes that he calls loophole-closers, and
corporations call tax hikes, that would raise an estimated $96
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have their own plans for the surplus. Already, some
fiscal conservatives in Congress are complaining that next year's
spending bills are too bloated.
</P>
<P>
   The main GOP focus, though, is on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Congress approved a $492 billion tax cut, which
Clinton vetoed. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the expected GOP
presidential nominee, has proposed his own tax cut of roughly half
a trillion dollars over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have also called for sharp cuts in estate taxes paid
by wealthy Americans and for a $50 billion cut in taxes paid by
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are ``intolerably overtaxed,'' Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
</P>
<P>
   said in a radio address broadcast last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Official Washington now has too much money on its hands,''
Lott said. ``Government doesn't tax to get the money it needs.
Instead, it finds a need for the money it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the proposals can quickly eat up a surplus,
projected or real.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, that's really the swing factor,'' said Cohen.
``Once you start talking about spending this money, or lowering
taxes, then some of these surpluses go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, say budget stewards, the two parties haven't yet
agreed on either approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gridlock,'' concludes former congressional budget director
June O'Neill in the current issue of Policy Review magazine,
``seems to be good medicine for the economy.''

<P>
   Forget the gross scenes from ``There's Something About Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' barely compares.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Scary Movie,'' several of the Wayans brothers blend the
elements from recent rude comedy hits, horror spoofs and other
popular pictures to create the raunchiest movie of the summer.
Also, one of the funniest.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: Before you see ``Scary Movie,'' rent the following if
you have not already seen them: ``Scream,'' both ``I Know What You
Did Last Summer'' movies, ``The Matrix,'' ``American Pie,'' ``The
Usual Suspects'' and ``The Blair Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Scary Movie'' is funny on its own _ you don't have to
have seen the above films to laugh _ its fullest humor comes from
the exaggerated parody scenes re-enacted from the pictures it makes
fun of. Director Keenen Ivory Wayans and two of his brothers, Shawn
and Marlon Wayans (who also star and co-wrote), re-create
everything perfectly: camera angles, scenarios and even the bad
acting _ except this time it's intentional.
</P>
<P>
   Is it enough for a film only to poke fun at pop culture and
other movies? In this case, sure. The Wayans' previous parody
movies about urban life, ``Don't Be A Menace to South Central While
Drinking Your Juice in the Hood'' and ``I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,''
have the same immature-yet-smart ability to turn dramatic scenes
into hilarious ones. With ``Menace,'' the Wayans were limited in
comedic range, because the content of the movies they were poking
fun at was serious.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Scary Movie,'' however, they leave nobody unscathed. The
movie begins with a funhouse-mirror image of a scene from
``Scream,'' the film that ``Scary Movie'' mocks more than any
other. ``Baywatch's'' Carmen Electra plays the damsel in distress,
with all the details from ``Scream'' intact, but turned 180
degrees. The chase scene between Electra and the killer, wearing
the familiar ``Scream'' mask, quickly becomes something out of a
Playboy video, with Electra running in slow motion beneath
sprinklers. Midchase, Electra comes to two road signs. One points
to safety, the other to death. You can guess which path she
chooses.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the movie then starts, and the name game begins. It
gets confusing, so pay attention: Newcomer Anna Farris plays the
main character, Cindy Campbell (in ``Scream,'' Neve Campbell played
the lead role, named Sidney). Gale Hailstorm (Cheri Oteri of
``Saturday Night Live'') is the nosy reporter from ``Scream,'' who
in that movie was named Gail Weathers, while Electra's short
appearance gives her the name of Drew Becker (Drew Barrymore played
Casey Becker in ``Scream''). And a David Arquette look-alike named
Dave Sheridan plays the dimwitted Special Officer Doofy (Arquette
was ``Scream's'' Officer Dewey).
</P>
<P>
   The over-exaggerated acting and script keep the movie rolling,
and it all hits the fan in a scene with Cindy and her aptly named
gym teacher, Miss Mann. The boundary of tasteless sight gags is
pushed to the maximum when Miss Mann, by exposing parts of anatomy
she's not supposed to have, gives ``dodge ball'' a new definition.
The spoofs continue, with a scene out of ``Blair Witch'' showing
Oteri dropping softball-size globs of mucus onto the camera below
her crying eyes. A hilarious murder scene with Buffy Gilmore
(played by the scantily clad Shannon Elizabeth), together with a
quick jab at ``The Sixth Sense'' and an unexpected Budweiser scene,
keep the movie from being predictable or repetitive, a problem with
many slapsticks.
</P>
<P>
   Every character in the movie has at least one exaggerated
characteristic. Ray (Shawn Wayans) is an in-the-closet homosexual
who is beyond obvious with his actions. Shorty (Marlon Wayans) is
higher than a space shuttle throughout the movie, and Elizabeth
plays the ditzy girl we've come to expect in every horror movie.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and the weak-of-stomach, beware: The movie is lewd.
Flat-out lewd. No way around it. Whether dealing with the firehose
power of a character's bodily fluids or the object that Shawn
Wayans gets an earful of, the situations are astonishingly graphic.
</P>
<P>
   If gross humor and parody movies are what you're looking for,
``Scary Movie'' is for you. It has no great plot lines, no touching
emotions and no cinematic miracles. In other words, leave your
brain and moral objections at home and just enjoy the vulgarity.

ANIMATED EARNHARDT ISN'T RESTRICTED FROM SPEAKING HIS MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Dale Earnhardt sat comfortably in his
hauler at Daytona International Speedway, holding court with
several reporters during an interview last Friday, when the
seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion became clearly revved up _
if not agitated _ by the subject of restrictor-plate racing.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictor-plate racing, as far as Earnhardt was concerned, was
an oxymoron. They might as well just call it restrictor-plate
ridin'.
</P>
<P>
   And, as most drivers on the competitive Winston Cup circuit will
tell you, ridin' ain't racin'.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since NASCAR mandated the use of restrictor plates at its
superspeedway venues at Daytona and Talladega _ a move aimed at
slowing cars by reducing the amount of horsepower generated by the
engines _ it has become one of Earnhardt's pet peeves. It has
turned trips to those high-banked, high-speed, triovals from a
thrill ride into a visit to the dentist's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish we could just race,'' Earnhardt said before last
Saturday's Pepsi 400 at Daytona. ``We go to Pocono (Pa.) and to
Loudon (N.H.) and these places and race and have a good time. We
come here (to Daytona) and it's aggravation just to get through
inspection for qualifying. You qualify and it's even more
aggravation getting out of that mess and changing your cars over to
the race deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dang, let's just race. If they'll just take the restrictor
plates off, they won't have to worry about shocks and springs and
stuff. People will have those damn blades up in the air, hollerin'
`I need more spoiler.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there is no room for wimps on Earnhardt's track. You
either race, or you get out of the way. He doesn't suffer fools or
colleagues who complain about the high speeds at NASCAR's
superspeedways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard some drivers saying, `We're going too fast at
Charlotte. We're going too fast here (at Daytona).' Well, get the
hell home,'' he said. ``If you're not a race car driver and not a
racer, stay home. Don't come here and grumble about going too fast.
Stay the hell home.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, this weekend in the New England 300 at New Hampshire
International Speedway, Earnhardt will get his wish. The No. 3
Goodwrench Chevrolet Monte Carlo he has driven the last 16 years
for car owner Richard Childress will be liberated of its restrictor
plate and allowed to gallop unbridled around the 1.058-mile oval in
Loudon. And he'll get to race, finally.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of this, of course, will likely cause a devilish grin to the
curl beneath the Intimidator's trademark mustache.
</P>
<P>
   But Earnhardt has had more to grin about this year than he has
in the last five, a turbulent span in which he stumbled in the
points, going from fourth to fifth to eighth from 1996-1998. It was
all exacerbated by a winless 1997 that left many with the mistaken
impression the man in black had suddenly become the man in back.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at him now. At 49, he's running stronger than ever,
proving he's far from making a farewell tour. Earnhardt has reason
to smile as he arrives at NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   He's second in the Winston Cup standings, 52 points behind Bobby
Labonte. He has proudly watched his son, Dale Earnhardt Jr., a
rookie driver, win twice this season with the No. 8 Budweiser
Chevrolet, one of two cars Earnhardt fields as a Winston Cup car
owner. He has cemented a strong working relationship with his
second-year crew chief, Kevin Hamlin, and longtime car owner,
Childress, who last season awarded him with a three-year contract
extension that will make him driver of the No. 3 car through 2003.
He no longer drives in neck pain after undergoing preseason surgery
for an old disk injury that bothered him all last season. Most
important of all, he remains in the hunt for a record-eighth
Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Dale Earnhardt driving harder and more aggressive than
I've seen him the last three years,'' said Jeff Burton, 33, winner
of last week's Pepsi 400 and the last three July races at NHIS.
``Dale Earnhardt's in a great position to win the championship. He
may be the oldest active driver, I don't really get into age, but
he's sure older than me. But I don't see him bowing over by any
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Dale Jarrett, the reigning Cup champion who is third in
the points, 24 behind Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he has more experience at winning these
championships than Bobby and I put together, and we could take a
lot of other people and throw them into the mix and he'd still have
more experience,'' Jarrett said. ``We know that he's going to be
tough as this goes on and as the season winds down. If he can hang
around, and we certainly feel he will, it's going to be interesting
to see.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what if Earnhardt were to win his eighth championship? How
would it compare, say, with winning his first Daytona 500 in 1997?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I've won a lot of Daytona 499s,'' he chuckled. ``But I
don't weigh winning this race over that race or this championship
against that championship. I've really enjoyed them all, again,
I've been so damn fortunate to grow up in a family that raced _
with my dad (the late Ralph Earnhardt) _ then to get into it myself
and accomplish what I have in my life, is pretty awesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then to have your kids come along with you. I mean, I didn't
make Dale Jr. want to be a racer; the kid wanted to be a racer. I'd
just as soon him be a doctor or a preacher or whatever, but not a
lawyer _ then again that's another subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Has watching his son win points races at Texas and at Richmond
given him a different sense of satisfaction as a car owner?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're so proud of your kid, that's a given,'' Earnhardt said.
``You see that happen and you're proud of your kid, but when you
win a race as a driver, that's pretty damn exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I'm driven to do and that's why I get up in the
mornings _ it's to go race and win. Yeah, I'm proud of (Dale Jr.)
winning and I'm excited about it, but I'll probably get more
excited as I become a full-time owner instead of driver-owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reckon I've got to the best of two worlds: I'm a winning
driver and a winning car owner and have accomplished a lot. It's
hard. You look around and not many people have done it the way I
have; I drove for another guy and won while racing against his own
team.''
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't he strike out on his own and drive for himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I could drive for myself,'' Earnhardt
acknowledged. ``That would be tough. I'm pretty set in my ways and
I'm set to drive that 3 car as long as Richard's there and the team
that we have is there. We've got a great opportunity and a great
organization, and I've got to stick with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's competitive fire has largely been stoked by the move
Childress made to switch crew chiefs in June 1998, pairing Mike
Skinner with Larry McReynolds, Earnhardt's old crew chief, and
Hamlin with Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a very short time to see that we both had the same
mental focus,'' Earhardt said. ``Kevin is more my kind of style of
crew chief. He's a guy who's constantly thinking and he never quits
on making it better, but he's not the kind of guy who blows it up
and throws things and kicks and screams. He's the kind of guy who
comes back down here (to the garage) and listens to what I say and
talks about what we're doing and try to make an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much like Kirk Shelmerdine,'' Earnhardt added,
referring to one of his former crew chiefs. ``When I say something,
he's already thinking that way, and that's the way Kirk was. We're
thinking alike. I'm so happy that Richard made that change. I
haven't regretted it one bit. I love Larry McReynolds to death as a
person, and we won the Daytona 500 together, but day in and day
out, I work better with Kevin.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has the results to prove it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he finished seventh in the points after recording
three victories (including two at Talladega) and 14 Top 10
finishes. This year, with Hamlin's stewardship, Earnhardt has 15
Top 10s in the previous 17 races, including a victory at the
Cracker Barrel 500 March 12 in Atlanta. He moved into second in the
point standings after finishing second in the Kmart 400 at Michigan
International Speedway and has remained there for the last four
races.
</P>
<P>
   Earhardt might have vaulted into the lead the following week at
Pocono had it not been for Jeremy Mayfield's ``bump-and-run''
victory. Mayfield caused quite a stir when he bumped Earnhardt from
behind in the final turn, causing him to lose control of his car
and drop out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That deal was a racin' deal,'' Earnhardt said. ``I don't know
why he made such a big deal out of it, like he was guilty of
something. Then the fans all said stuff about it. Heck, it's over.
I mean I wasn't jumping up and down, screamin' and hollerin' after
the race. It happened, OK? I'm a big boy. I can take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had it in my mind to get into the corner the best I
could and get back on the throttle as best I could, but he got to
me, got into me and got me loose,'' he added. ``Then it was a
situation of controlling the car (to preserve a fourth-place
finish) . . . I will be bold and say this: There ain't many (guys)
who could've sat in that seat and not wrecked that car.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Earnhardt managed to bring it home in one piece,
retaining his solid second position in the points. It was much the
same last week at Daytona, where Earnhardt made the best of a bad
situation (a restrictor-plate race) and turned it into a
sixth-place finish to close the gap on Labonte in the points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of racing you've got to do,'' Earnhardt said.
``You've got to make a terrible day into a fair day. Bobby is doing
it and Dale Jarrett has won a championship doing it, (Jeff) Gordon,
all of us. You just have to keep going to each race with that
mindset, `I've got to go to the front, I've got to get to the
front, I've got to race in the front.' I've got to be serious all
day about where I'm at. I'm not guarding points. I'm just trying to
better my position as best as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Restrictor plates, be damned.

ALL-STAR GLITTER FADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Major League Baseball All-Star Game is yet another example
of declining ratings for network sports programming.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, the All-Star Game generated a 20.5 rating on
NBC, about 20 million households. The numbers have dropped
significantly over the years, largely the result of cable TV and
the emergence of the Internet. Last year, the All-Star Game
received a 12 rating, about 12 million viewers. In today's
television landscape, a 12 rating is still good.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in ratings has little to do with the product. Last
year, for example, the game took place at Fenway Park and featured
the dramatic return of Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Keith Olberman had it right. It was ``an epic moment''
when Williams was surrounded by Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Juan
Marichal, Carl Yastrzemski, Ken Griffey, and Mark McGwire. Joe Buck
had an even better line: ``Look at them all, smiling like Little
Leaguers.''
</P>
<P>
   Though this year's game is the first of the millennium, it won't
have anywhere near the same drama. For one thing, Atlanta's Turner
Field is no Fenway. And while Joe Morgan remains one of the better
baseball announcers in the game, his return to Atlanta is not a
tear-jerker. The last time an All-Star Game was played in Atlanta
was 1972. In the 10th inning, Morgan singled in San Diego's Nate
Colbert with the game-winning run. Morgan played in nine All-Star
Games during his 19-year Hall of Fame career and described the '72
game as ``my personal favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC spokesman Kevin Sullivan said the All-Star Game remains one
of the highest rated prime time sporting events of the summer and
will receive big-time coverage.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has about 125 people producing the game Tuesday, starting at
8 p.m. The network has 22 cameras, including remote control units
in each bullpen, a telestrator, a radar gun, and microphones on
three bases. Morgan and Bob Costas will call the action.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN also is devoting big-time coverage. The cable sports
network has Chris Berman, Mike Piazza, and Morgan calling the
two-hour coverage of the Home Run Derby Monday, July 10 at 8 p.m.
Griffey is the defending champion, but McGwire stole the show last
year with towering shots out of Fenway. Nothing better than Berman
calling home runs.
</P>
<P>
   And, this year, Berman will be aided by a new technology
developed by ESPN and Sportvision. ``ESPN True Track'' measures the
distance of home runs. Two cameras will be located in the upper
deck near the foul poles and will be equipped with sensors that
will follow the path of the ball. Computers will calculate the
distance an unimpeded ball would have traveled.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Run Derby also marks the start of ESPN telecasts of
baseball games in Spanish. The Spanish language simulcasts will
include graphics, commercials, player interviews, and on-air
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The simulcasts will continue with ESPN's seven remaining Sunday
night baseball games and conclude with the network's Division
Series games. ESPN International's Ernesto Jerez and Alfredo
Alvarez call the simulcasted games.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Coast Conference has signed a 10-year deal with
ESPN/ESPN2 to air a minimium of 23 mens' basketball games, starting
with the 2001-02 season. The deal calls for ACC teams to appear on
ABC at least 10 times per year.
</P>
<P>
   NBC airs the women's Wimbledon final Saturday starting at 10
a.m. with Ted Robinson, Chris Evert, and Bud Collins. The men's
final starts at 9 a.m. Sunday with Robinson, Collins, and John
McEnroe. Ratings for the first four days of the tournament are up
25 percent from last year.

BRICKS, BARS, ART ADORN NEW US EMBASSY IN MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Employees at the US Embassy in Moscow still refer to a
church across the street, where the Soviet KGB once installed
surveillance equipment, as ``Our Lady of Immaculate Reception.''
</P>
<P>
   Such dark humor reflects the embassy's troubled history in the
Russian capital. But on the day when officials proudly opened their
new chancery building to the public, US Ambassador James Collins
said the issue was no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't joke about security,'' Collins told reporters
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do the guards at the door. Anybody wishing to pass
through the embassy compound's red-brick walls and black-iron gates
must endure an airport-like security check. Mobile telephones,
laptop computers, personal digital assistants, and anything else
remotely electronic must be checked at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the measures are justified given past security
breaches. The embassy has been pelted with eggs, shot at with
grenade launchers, and broken into by a drunk soldier. And that was
after the Cold War ended.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the new embassy began in 1979 but was abruptly
halted in 1985 when listening devices were found throughout the
building _ including hundreds implanted in pieces of precast
concrete and around the steel reinforcing bars.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, some officials said the building had become a
``mammoth microphone.'' A Senate committee described it as the
``most massive, sophisticated, and skillfully executed bugging
operation in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1972 agreement between Moscow and Washington, Soviet
labor and materials were used initially. After the bugs were
discovered, only American workers and materials were used.
</P>
<P>
   In another Cold War-era security breach, an embassy guard,
Marine Sergeant Clayton J. Lonetree, was accused of espionage in
December 1986. In 1987 he was convicted of passing the names of
nine CIA operatives to a KGB agent. Lonetree was introduced to the
KGB agent by a female Russian translator at the Moscow embassy with
whom he had an affair.
</P>
<P>
   In May, after more than 20 years of construction work that cost
American taxpayers more than $240 million, the embassy's
1,200-member staff finally moved into a new chancery. It was
dedicated during President Clinton's visit to Moscow last month.
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials Thursday showed off the slick new 10-story
building, with its spiral staircases and walls decked out with
modern art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think of this as a very good, secure modern
building,'' Collins said. ``It was built by Americans, designed by
Americans, and overseen by Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In the time it took to tear down the bugged building and erect a
new one, the Cold War halted, the Soviet Union collapsed, and
Russian-American relations warmed up and then cooled off again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are entering a new era in our relations with the Russian
Federation, and this building represents what we are trying to do
in these relations,'' Collins said. He added that the new embassy
is private and secure enough for the embassy staff to ``work with
confidence,'' but also would be open and welcoming to the Russian
public. ``We are not just an observer anymore, but also a
participant,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   But viewed from the outside, the embassy still looks somewhat
like ``Fortress America.'' Russians bitterly complain of long lines
and what they call a demeaning screening procedure to obtain a US
visa. Some US citizens gripe about the tight security when they
have business at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy also has become a focal point for anti-American
demonstrations and sometimes violent attacks. Thursday, a small
group of environmentalists were protesting Washington's proposal to
build a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   During last year's NATO-led airstrikes against Yugoslavia, angry
Russians pelted the embassy with eggs and paint. Last March, men
armed with grenade launchers and an assault rifle sprayed the
building with gunfire before being hauled off by police.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1995, an attacker fired a rocket-propelled grenade
into an empty embassy office.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, a drunk 19-year-old soldier broke into
the embassy compound and reportedly tried to steal a car before
being shot and wounded by a Marine guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in an environment where you cannot take physical safety
for granted,'' Collins said.

   BRIMFIELD, Mass. _ The weather has gone from 90 degrees to
temperatures akin to February in just 24 hours. People dressed in
clothing suitable for the previous day's heat wave shiver as they
speak in hushed tones or into walkie-talkies. But there is an
excitement building.
</P>
<P>
   This is the lull before the storm on the opening day of the
first of the series of Brimfield Outdoor Antique and Collectible
Shows. The shows occur three times a year and are the largest of
their kind in the country, featuring more than 4,000 dealers. This
year's second show opens this week.
</P>
<P>
   The day is also typical of the fickle weather that bounces off
the Berkshires and into this bucolic town of 3,500 residents in
south-central Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers' tents are spread out over 22 fields along a mile-plus
stretch of Route 20, Brimfield's main thoroughfare. The opening of
each field is staggered, starting at 6 a.m., to give dealers a fair
crack at the buyers who make this pilgrimage three times a year.
</P>
<P>
   It's nearing the 9 a.m. opening time for the Heart-O-The-Mart,
the third largest field, boasting 550 dealers. Hundreds of people
are quietly queued up outside, some sipping hot coffee, some
checking their watches and waiting for the gates to part.
</P>
<P>
   There's a final countdown of the last 10 seconds when a bell
rings out in the cool and damp morning air, signaling the stampede
to round up pieces of antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   The double main gate flies open. Three other gates are just as
quickly pulled open by organizers, to accommodate the continuous
sea of flesh that is now cheering, smiling and waving at the
organizers and volunteers and racing through the isles of the
15-acre field to the treasures beyond.
</P>
<P>
   This throng is clearly on a mission, and continues to pour past
the dealers set up on both sides of the entrance isles.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers are armed with shopping carts, wagons, dog carts,
baby strollers and armfuls of sturdy opaque trash bags. No stopping
just yet to finger the goods. Not only might it be dangerous to try
to stop for a look, but there's actually a method to this mad rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening day at our field is like the running of the bulls at
Pamplona,'' laughs Tracey Houle, show manager for Heart-O-The-Mart.
``Opening day is like nothing else for the rest of each show, which
calms down a bit in the days that follow. Almost everybody has
their own plan of attack when they come here. Many of them know a
lot of the dealers and/or have been coming here for years. It's
almost like a family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many dealers, who are here to buy, know who and what they are
looking for and so they run from booth to booth, while the rest of
the crowd rushes to the back and works their way forward,'' Houle
explains. ``Sometimes families or dealers split up and work all
sides of the field toward the center. A good majority of the people
who come here already know what they are looking for and then often
discover other finds along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Harriet Bridges, owner of North Bridge Antiques in Concord, has
had a tent at the Brimfield show for 15 years and has requested the
same location just shy of the front gate for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really feel offended that they pass me by,'' Bridges
says. ``I know that they will check me out when they are leaving. I
enjoy watching them rush in and they are always careful not to
knock anything over or off tables.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brimfield show, which is billed as the world's largest
outdoor antiques and collectibles megafair, evolved from George
Reid's small flea market, which he began holding on his auction
grounds in 1959. His daughters continue the family business, J&AMP;J
Auction Acres, which has grown to be the largest field at
Brimfield, with 700 dealers.
</P>
<P>
   As Brimfield's reputation grew, it became a well-known trade
secret, drawing other antiques dealers who purchase for their
shops, and architects and interior designers shopping for clients.
But as word spread, Brimfield quickly became a show for collectors
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The show runs for six days three times a year beginning on a
Tuesday and ending the following Sunday in May, July and September,
and draws 60,000 or more people per show.
</P>
<P>
   With each show, some dealers are open each of the six days,
while others open for selected days or move their booth from field
to field. Show operators in charge of each of the major and
secondary fields maintain lists of dealers and only they can
distribute dealer information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the size, it's almost impossible to see it all in
one day,'' stresses Pam Moriarty, who began Heart-O-The-Mart with
her husband, Don, in 1984 with 46 dealers. ``It really takes two to
three days. The best three days where you get to see all of the
dealers is Wednesday through Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking for something in particular and don't see it
early in the week, inquire with a dealer who carries similar items,
according to Moriarty. They may know where to get it or have what
you are looking for still packed in a box at their booth.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers need to take enough inventory to last the show and they
will often add or replace items to keep their booths fresh,
especially for those who attend several days in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Brimfield draws dealers from all around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had dealers from Germany, France and Africa,''
Moriarty says. ``It's all very educational and the dealers are very
knowledgeable. You'll see just about anything at this show, from
the bizarre to the elegant, and prices from 50 cents to $50,000 or
more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Check out the red vintage Coca-Cola machines in the back of
the field,'' adds Moriarty. ``You might say, `So?' But I'll tell
you, they sell like crazy. People come to Brimfield to buy, sell,
bargain, barter or to simply check it out and have fun. And many
dealers expect you to bargain. You never know what you'll find or
see!''

VIETNAM ALL OVER AGAIN: THE COLOMBIA DRUG WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Small, poor, remote country.
</P>
<P>
   History of political instability. Rich people still screwing
over poor people as they've done from the Year One. Decades-old
guerrilla war that began with machetes and shotguns now escalating
to big-time weapons. US government sends money. Political advisers.
Military advisers. More money. Now it's two kinds of military
helicopters. Haven't we seen this movie before?
</P>
<P>
   The Americanization of Columbia's civil-drug war looks and
smells like Vietnam all over again. Twenty-five years after Saigon
fell like a rotting plum from the grasp of Uncle Sam and the
corrupt and incompetent South Vietnamese regime, we're trying the
same dumb thing all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did I mention the herbicide? Just as we blanketed Southeast
Asia's jungles and peasantry with Agent Orange, we're getting ready
to contaminate the hillside drug crops of Columbia with a
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   All in the name of preventing American drug addicts from
smoking, swallowing, snorting, shooting, and otherwise making
themslves first very high and then very low with cocaine and
heroin.
</P>
<P>
   We are exporting the wrong solution to a problem we won't face
up to right here at home. Money is no object. Here, we pay any
price, bear any burden, right? Wrong. The $1.3 billion Congress
just approved for Colombia on the Clinton administration's say-so
is good money after bad.
</P>
<P>
   The loot was wrapped up in one of those fiendishly concocted
congressional stews: big bones for farmers; medium-sized cutlets
for emergency aid for hurricanes and forest fires from last year;
lavish dollops of this and that for lobbyists from here and there;
add a little pork, a lot of seasoning to kill the smell, and
presto, you have an omnibus spending bill that legislators want in
an election year to grease their return to the trough.
</P>
<P>
   So the money for Colombia was on rails. It was wired. There was
no way you were going to stop it. Too many lawmakers were turned
into sausage-makers, grinding up the scraps to serve up one giant
kielbasa of a spending bill, pork sausage by the trainload. Too
many of our solons had catheters running into their gluteus maximus
from the intravenous bank labeled ``pork/saline solution.'' A drip
here, a drip there, and now 60 brand-new US military helicopters
are on their ponderous way south, ready to zap guerrillas on the
orders from somebody in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a sound track to accompany this script, it would be
the ``duh-duh, duh-duh, duh-duh'' of ``Jaws,'' the ominous
incantation of something very bad about to unfold. Yet again we
embrace a pricey, high-tech solution to a problem that is rooted in
human nature, not in the chemistry lab of the herbicide
cooker-uppers. I am not some fungicidal maniac on the point. I've
never been anywhere near Colombia. But we're making their problems
our problem _ big mistake. Our drug fighting civil servants, our
military, and our biological warfare researchers have concocted
this scheme, and the environmental people are dubious in the
extreme, according to the New York Times exclusive unmasking the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the exquisite vulnerability of the politician _ any
politician _ to the deadly taunt of being ``soft on drugs,'' many
otherwise sensible legislators panic and bolt when confronted with
honest choices about the human propensity to self-dose with
mind-altering chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   This particular virus is at its most virulent in election years,
peaking in the fall. So rare is the congressman who proclaims that
this whole approach is a fraud, a massive, expensive, hollow, and
cynical exploitation of parental fears designed to reward cunning
lobbyists and careerists in cushy slots. It won't work. Can't work.
</P>
<P>
   It's the wrong war, in the wrong hemisphere. The enemy is
within, not without. The enemy is human nature. The problem, dear
Brutus, is not within our stars but in the gene pool of frail and
fragile drug addicts here who will lie, cheat, steal, and murder
for a chemically induced endorphin rush.
</P>
<P>
   Because our politicians refuse to recognize the drug debacle is
a crisis of demand and not of supply, we externalize the problem.
We are trying to build a fortress around Colombia and contain the
problem there. It cannot work. What about Mexico? Southweast Asia's
Golden Triangle? There are not enough soldiers and helicopters and
narco informers to keep track of the flow. We already know we
cannot keep contraband narcotics out of our maximum security
prisons. How are we going to do it in a jungle 6,000 miles away?
</P>
<P>
   The most honest and practical solution is to decriminalize the
use of all narcotics. Tax its distribution. Furnish detox beds for
everyone willing to try to shake the demons. And recognize there
will be casualties. Just as some Americans cannot tolerate alcohol
and kill themselves, we'll have to accept drug-related slow-motion
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Some will say ``never!'' But that same old old argument will
pitch global society into an ever deepening cycle of corruption,
exploitation, and erosion of honest government if we allow the
fantastic flows of drug money to gain more traction. Human nature
cannot resist the lure of fortunes to be made dealing drugs
illegally. The poor farmers who get more for coca leaves than
coffee beans will keep doing it no matter how many choppers fly
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   And our addicts will keep snorting, shooting and swallowing what
they crave until their inner spritual emptiness is filled. We can
poison the Andes and slaughter peasants and reelect the same tired
politicians every other year. It's Vietnam redux: if it's not
working, double the tonnage.

EMBRACED IN THE ARMS OF SISTERHOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the big event approaches, Melanie Harris and her sorority
buddy Denise Kahn talk of sisterhood, but I imagine something more
akin to a big family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions, I've attended. But a gathering of Alpha Kappa
Alphas is a whole other matter for this sister. It never occurred
to me to pledge in college, not even when the Delta Sigma Theta
sorority was courting me.
</P>
<P>
   So I let them speak of their excitement, breathe the
anticipation of another annual gathering of pink-and-green-clad
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you meet someone with similar experiences, it's a
wonderful thing,'' Kahn said. ``Whether you're 18 or 88, we share a
common history. There is a bond.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris is 20 and Kahn is, well, old enough to know better than
to tell her age. She is also president of the Fort Worth chapter of
AKAs, the oldest and largest black Greek sorority in the country.
</P>
<P>
   That, Kahn says, makes her sorority all the more special.
</P>
<P>
   So is this week in the sorority's nearly 100-year history, when
an estimated 10,000 sorority sisters are gathering for their 59th
national convention in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The convention will run through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There will be the normal convention fare: workshops to attend,
connections to make, issues to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   But the women will also celebrate their triumphs, the community
services the group has rendered in the past year. Chapters will be
recognized for work with at-risk children, part of the ON TRACK
program that national President Norma Solomon White began in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the community service organization also collected
20,000 coats for the needy and distributed brochures on women's
health, medicines and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more projects, including local efforts that don't
have the same national appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are women still devoted to community, serving mankind
and being part of the sisterhood,'' said Harris, a member of the
Kappa Psi chapter at the University of Oklahoma, where she is a
junior.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see, perhaps, why Harris is so excited. But just as
important as the services they render, she and Kahn said, are the
sisters they meet, the relationships they build.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited because I get to meet women with the same
mind-set, same goals, and also women I can look up to,'' Harris
said. ``I can't really explain the feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   But this being her first convention, Harris is also nervous. It
can be intimidating, she said, being around women who have such
long histories with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said that 39 women who have been AKA members for 75 years
will be at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   She knows, she said, that the sisterhood bit ``sounds corny,''
and maybe it does, but I understand. Conventions can be much like
family reunions. It's how I feel when I attend the annual gathering
of the National Association of Black Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' mother, Debra, is an AKA. Her stories about the sorority
sparked an interest in her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 150,000 women strong,'' Melanie Harris said. ``I wanted
to be a part of that. I wanted to feel the sisterly love.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know much about sorority life, but sisterhood and family
I understand. There's nothing quite like them.

PUTTING NEW ZING IN SWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer-enhanced rhythms are changing the sound of rock 'n'
roll and hip-hop. That's a given. But they're also about to change
a more unlikely genre _ the nostalgic, retro-obsessed world of big
band swing music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like year 2000 swing. I'm really happy with the way
it came out,'' says Brian Setzer, the Grammy-winning big band
leader, referring to four songs on his new album, ``Vavoom!,'' to
which he added computer-altered beats to the Brian Setzer
Orchestra's classic swing and jump-blues sound.
</P>
<P>
   Setzer put ``some cha-cha beats and hip-hop beats into the
computer and came up with something that's really different to me''
on the album's opening track, a cover of Glenn Miller's humorous
``Pennsylvania 6-5000.'' The computer processing doesn't harm the
song, but gives it more resonance, for the beats merge with those
of Setzer's drummer.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a young computer whiz named David Darling,
Setzer also punched up a new, horn-dominated original tune,
``Americano.'' Says Setzer: ``David was interested in taking what I
had recorded and putting it into a computer and making it sound
sort of scuffed up. He changed the sound of the horns. We actually
took the horns and reversed them. We made them go backwards into
the chorus on `Americano.' And we put different beats in there,
electronic beats. That was my first experience with anything like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I say, it gives it a real year 2000 sound, as opposed to
1940s music,'' says Setzer, who still sings and plays guitar with
the enthusiasm of a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   On stage, Setzer will do the new songs without computer
enhancement: ``You really don't miss it live. It's more for when
you're sitting down _ things to catch your ear. Live, it's more
about the performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Setzer, formerly with the once-hot rockabilly band the Stray
Cats, has spurred a swing revival in recent years that has seen the
emergence of not just his own 17-piece band, but of such acts as
Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, the Squirrel Nut Zippers (now broken up), the
Cherry Poppin' Daddies, and Boston's Four Piece Suit.
</P>
<P>
   But where some swing revivalists are ``uptight'' (Setzer's word)
and treat the music like museum pieces, Setzer believes in keeping
the integrity of the sound, but also in shaking things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people can make a big mistake of getting caught up in
playing something exactly the way it was done, rather than messing
with it,'' he says. ``They get so caught up in the retro thing. I
think you've got to take chances with it and fool around with it.
You don't have to be period-perfect about it. That's not what it's
there for. That stuff was made for you to take little pieces of it
and go somewhere else and do your own thing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   On his new album, which comes out Aug. 1, Setzer experiments
further by adding doo-wop singers 14 Carat Soul to a spicy new
original, ``That's the Kind of Sugar Papa Likes.'' ``I'm from New
York and I'm a big doo-wop fan,'' he says. On another song,
``Gloria'' (a cover of a 1954 song by the Cadillacs, not the Van
Morrison tune), Setzer offers a fresh twist by having his horn
section replace the doo-wop harmonies of the original version. He
says he partly got the idea from a conversation with pop legend
Dion of Dion &AMP; the Belmonts fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dion came to see us in Florida and said, `Oh, man, I love this
big band. You know, when we (the Belmonts) first started, we
couldn't afford players like that, so we just got neighborhood guys
and we would try to sound like horns.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I thought,'' says Setzer, `` `Wow, maybe I'll make my
horns sound like your singers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The result is remarkably effective, as are most of the
experiments on the first-rate ``Vavoom!'' It's a worthy successor
to the Setzer Orchestra's ``Dirty Boogie'' CD (in 1998), which sold
2 million copies at the height of the neo-swing craze and earned
Setzer two Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Setzer is always experimenting with the big band swing
idiom. On the new disc, he also chooses to do a near-exact replica
of Bobby Darin's jive-snapping, storytelling hit, ``Mack the
Knife.'' Notes Setzer: ``People have been yelling for me to do that
song, so I said, `OK, I'm going to give it to them.' But I didn't
want to scuff that up, as opposed to the other ones. I wanted some
real traditional stuff on there, too, so I just left that one
alone. It was my tribute to Bobby Darin.''
</P>
<P>
   Setzer, who grew up on Long Island, enjoyed his first taste of
swing music as a child by listening to Doc Severinsen's big band on
``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.'' Some people think
Setzer learned swing music from his parents' record collection, but
that wasn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``My folks were really '50s rockers. My dad was a rockabilly guy
into Carl Perkins. And my mom was an Elvis lady. She had an Elvis
poster above her bed. My dad used to joke, `I don't mind Elvis
above the bed, but I bet Elvis got his supper on time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After Setzer's Stray Cats folded, he opted to try the big band
format eight years ago _ well before the swing revival took root.
``At our first show (at the Roxy in Hollywood), people didn't know
what a big band was. I think we sold 34 tickets and the promoters
wanted to cancel the show. I said, `Look, I've come all this way
and I've got charts and I know this is good. You're not going to
cancel this show. I'll pay the band out of my pocket.'
</P>
<P>
   ``From there, we just kept moving up because of word-of-mouth
from fans,'' says Setzer, who now lives in Malibu and proudly notes
his band was selling out the 6,000-seat Greek Theatre in Los
Angeles on word of mouth, before his last album went big.
</P>
<P>
   Because of ceaseless touring over many years, the Setzer
Orchestra has also been better insulated from the ups and downs
that have hit the more recent, bandwagon-jumping swing groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really follow the other bands' careers,'' he says.
``But I know the scene is still there. I can turn on the TV and
still hear swing music behind TV ads. And I'm still out there doing
well, luckily. People are buying a lot of tickets to our shows.
We're doing well all over, and our new album isn't even out yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say, though, that swing falls into a fad. There's
nothing you can do about it. But swing music is great music. It's
based in jazz, so it's always going to be there. And it struck a
chord bigger than rockabilly did. I guess because, back in the day,
it was more prevalent. It was really popular for 10 years (in the
'40s), where rockabilly was never popular. Rockabilly was always an
underground music.
</P>
<P>
   ``So swing definitely struck a bigger chord in people. That's
why I'm probably still playing places like the FleetBoston
Pavilion,'' says Setzer. ``People are still coming down.''

FALLING INTO THE US TOURIST TRAP 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEYSTONE, S.D. _ And to think how smoothly things had gone
before I crossed the border into this seemingly innocuous state. I
had driven more than 3,200 miles, paused in the great industrial
behemoths of the Great Lakes, helped an appreciative rodeo
announcer broken down on a lonely stretch of Nebraskan highway, and
survived a night in a roadside establishment called the Settle Inn.
Seattle beamed brightly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Then I entered the Black Hills. It was there, amid the towering
pines and plunging canyons that I came face to face with the
vilest, most rudimentary creature imaginable, the exact beast I had
so fastidiously been trying to avoid: the American tourist.
</P>
<P>
   They travel in herds, or prides, or schools. They don a uniform
of Fannie Paks, white sneakers, and ill-fitting T-shirts emblazoned
with the name of a destination they had just visited, like, for
instance, Reptile World. They scrunch their brow when they
encounter the word ``salad,'' as if they've been presented with
French. They love nothing so much as a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   I raise this point after visiting Keystone, a place so
laughably, ludicrously fake that it of course draws gratified
tourists in droves. It makes Route 28 in Hyannis look like Rodeo
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Keystone is also, unfortunately, home to Mount Rushmore, a
stunning tribute to American history and ingenuity just a mile or
so from downtown. Rushmore is located within the beautiful Black
Hills National Forest, where I patted a wild burro and came within
feet of a herd of grazing buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   But such things appear to be lost on most tourists, who would
make the necessary trip to the miraculous monument, snap a few
pictures, pay homage to the snack bar, stampede the gift shop, then
exchange relieved looks with each other as they descended the hill
for something more comforting: blinking lights and schlock.
</P>
<P>
   And there was plenty of it. As I sat on the boardwalk of a faux
western restaurant called ``Ruby's House,'' I looked past a throng
of tank-topped humanity toward a shop called ``Dakota Gold,'' which
sits beside ``The Gold Mine,'' which sits beside ``Old-fashioned
fudge.'' Half a block away, the ``World's Greatest Bargains,'' the
``Bargain Store'' and ``Discount City USA'' were clustered within a
lasso throw of each other. What might Thomas Jefferson, or the less
tactful Teddy Roosevelt, say about this?
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, a graybearded cyclist with a Levi's jacket and
an Anheuser-Busch gut started his Harley with a thunderous boom
that created waves in my sarsaparilla. Helicopters giving tourists
aerial views of Rushmore buzzed implacably overhead. In the street,
the constant flow of RV traffic came to a sudden halt when a
pseudo-gunfight broke out between two men wearing pleather chaps,
causing the the slump-shouldered tourists to fall silent with
appreciative glee.
</P>
<P>
   And then they were off, these tourists, some to the nearby
Flintstone's theme park complete with Brontosaurus Burgers and Dino
Dogs, others to Yogi's Jellystone Park campgrounds and swimming
hole, still more to Bear Country USA (``Where beauty is alive and
natural''), not to mention Everything Prehistoric (``It's a blast
from the past!''). Mount Rushmore, which took more than 14 years to
sculpt, seemed little more than coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   It was like that, too, in the nearby Badlands, where ancient
rock formations rise from the prairie in haunting shapes that
extend for miles. Tourists would invariably breeze through the
national park, then head straight for Wall Drug, which bills itself
as the world's largest drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   And I have no doubt that it is. In the middle of absolutely
nowhere, in room after added room, jostling tourists grab for
rhinestone cowboy figurines, T-shirts that declare they were there,
candles shaped like moose. They push quarters into a slot to see
stuffed bears dance and sing a song.
</P>
<P>
   I pumped a dollar's worth of quarters into the El Toro machine,
where you literally grab the bull by its horns in a test of
strength, twice achieving the unfairly unimpressive designation of
``Athlete.'' The well-fed tourist after me brought the bull to its
knees, causing lights to flash, alarms to sound and my navigator to
look at me with something that resembled shame. Time to put South
Dakota in my rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   So I found a quiet stretch of two-lane road and headed west
toward safety, toward Wyoming. Seattle, thankfully, is but a few
days away.

<P>
   BARRE, Mass. _ Silence is a little bit frightening to Tatyana
Tenenbaum, not yet 16. Free time is something she usually avoids.
</P>
<P>
   Tenenbaum, from Amherst, uses extracurriculars like dance, music
and theater to camouflage a host of teenage woes. Her parents
recently divorced. Then there is stress at school and conflict
among friends, says the soft-spoken young woman.
</P>
<P>
   When she does slow down at the end of a hectic day, Tenenbaum
senses that the noisy din of daily life that fills her life, and
her friends' lives, provides a distraction, but no ultimate
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy for me to hide behind all this,'' said Tenenbaum.
``Even though I do a lot, I still feel empty in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   With the summer season in full swing, most teens are looking for
ways to keep busy. Horseback riding camp, SAT prep, sailing
lessons, scooping ice cream: all, at least in part, are about
chasing boredom, staying occupied.
</P>
<P>
   But here, at Insight Meditation Society, one of the only places
in the country to offer a meditation training program especially
for teens, the idea is that young people can benefit from doing
virtually nothing. During the five-day program, they spend hours
sitting cross-legged on cushions in a long meditation hall, eyes
closed, following the rise and fall of each breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you can't lie anymore and tell yourself everything's
OK,'' said Caitlin Sullivan, 19, of Weymouth. ``You face how you
really feel, even if only briefly.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Michele McDonald-Smith said that the course, attended
this year by 58 young people between the ages of 14 and 19, is a
sorely needed opportunity for those at a critical time of life _ a
chance to slow down and explore their inner selves. Adolescence
``is a spiritual crisis, and our culture doesn't really deal with
that,'' said the Hawaii-based teacher.
</P>
<P>
   As they fret about whom to sit with at lunch, or how to dress,
teenagers also confront existential questions _ and suffer real
anguish, said McDonald-Smith. What does life add up to? What good
is their presence in the world?
</P>
<P>
   Many people _ young or old _ have never stopped to notice what
happens when the television is off, no one is talking, and the
chatter in their own heads dies down, said New York meditation
teacher Soren Gordhamer. When they do, they often find that ``doing
nothing,'' can be transformative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about the silence that enriches us,'' said
Gordhamer. ``People can hear their heart beating. It's a really
powerful experience of being alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Insight meditation is a discipline that emphasizes
moment-to-moment awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Large chunks of the day _ including some meals _ are conducted
in silence. Hours are devoted to meditation, usually in half-hour
blocks of sitting or walking. In walking meditation, they do
snails-paced laps in empty rooms, focusing on the soles of their
feet meeting the floor. Participants also attend discussion groups,
workshops, and some camp-like bonding activities, such as a bonfire
on the final night.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the young people attending the course are from
privileged backgrounds, but advocates say meditation has much wider
application.
</P>
<P>
   Through a nonprofit called the Lineage Project, Gordhamer
teaches meditation to offenders incarcerated in the New York
juvenile justice system. Most of his students are affiliated with
gangs; some have committed murder.
</P>
<P>
   They tell him that their only experiences with peace or
relaxation have been drug-induced, that in detention, their
environment is never quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Although these troubled teens are a tough audience, Gordhamer
said, some have sent him letters of appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these kids, the world is very confusing. To be able to
find something simple like a breath, a place of stillness, it is
useful,'' said Gordhamer. ``It's radical, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Meditation has the power, advocates say, of connecting people
with feelings often covered up in the clamor and tumult of daily
life. Western education ``is deficient in helping people become
self-reflective about their emotions, and control them,'' said
Robert Thurman, professor of Buddhist studies at Columbia
University and a prominent spokesman for Buddhism in America.
</P>
<P>
   Such inward-focused discipline is a normal part of upbringing in
some Asian countries, said meditation teachers. In Burma, for
example, McDonald-Smith has met 9-year-olds who have already
completed monthlong meditation retreats.
</P>
<P>
   It was in fact a Burmese monk who suggested the teen retreat at
IMS 11 years ago. American teenagers may not have much in common
with their Burmese counterparts, but at least some of them fall in
love with the simple and slow life during the course.
</P>
<P>
   Insight Meditation Society, founded in 1975, is housed in a
former Christian monastery set on 80 wooded acres. The teenagers
live in tiny, bare rooms with little more than a mattress and sink.
They pledge to follow the Buddhist ``Five Precepts,'' which means
absolutely no alcohol or drugs, and no sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   There is little or no indoctrination into Buddhism as a
religion. The focus, rather, is on meditation's applications to
modern life.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the teen participants have returned for several years in
a row. They say over and over that concentrating during meditation
is extremely difficult _ that their minds wander, their bodies hurt
and their emotions rage. But each seeks, in the silence, his or her
own refuge.
</P>
<P>
   For Sullivan, who just finished her freshman year at Boston
College, meditation provides a way to approach the panic disorder
she suffers from, and it is preferable to the tactics employed by
mainstream medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `The girl can't eat, the girl can't sleep. Give her
a pill. You won't feel like yourself but you'll be able to
breathe,' '' said Sullivan, who added that when she meditates she
can separate herself from her anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   For Elisabeth Donnelly, 18, the retreat is a relief from the
pressure of her first year at Boston University, where she
struggled to maintain grades high enough to keep her scholarship.
``Here, I don't have to be perfect,'' said Donnelly. ``I don't have
to be a superwoman.''
</P>
<P>
   Underneath all these teenagers' pursuits is a yearning for
something that can seem maddeningly elusive in their lives:
happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Morey, 21, of Nashua, N.H., a volunteer at this year's
retreat, has taken spiritual exploration further than most _
meditating in Burma and India, and even briefly taking vows as a
Buddhist nun. Morey, who attends Dartmouth College, turns to
meditation to help her grapple with life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm at school I'm like, `What's the point of this?' ''
Morey said. ``I don't want to just get an engineering degree, get a
job, have kids and die, and I feel like a lot of people are living
on that level.''

$300 MILLION OVERHAUL EYED FOR CRAMPED WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To the thousands of tourists who troop each day
through a few of its elaborate rooms, the White House is a grand
mansion suited for a head of state. But get behind the public part
of the president's house, deep in the bowels of the 132-room
estate, and professionals come to a different conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   What a dump.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities are out of date, the meeting rooms too small, the
storage spaces cramped. There is no recreational area in the East
Wing where the first family lives _ no place to relax in private or
for children to play _ though there is a movie theatre and a
bowling alley on the compound. The White House press corps is
jam-packed into two small, musty rooms. Parking is near-impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Something, the Clinton administration decided, has to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been comprehensive planning for the site in
the site's history,'' said Ann Bowman Smith of the National Park
Service, which has developed a massive renovation plan.
</P>
<P>
   The solution the service has come up with is a 20-year, $300
million overhaul of the White House itself and the grounds
surrounding the building.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on ever-tightening security, the inevitable aging of
the structure, the wear and tear of serving as both the seat of
presidential power and a major national monument. The White House
is, after all, 200 years old, and well over a million visitors,
lobbyists, foreign dignitaries and guests tramp through it every
year.
</P>
<P>
   It has housed 41 families, many of whom had small children and
pets ranging from ponies to a goat. And the architects who designed
the presidential mansion did so in the era of the carriage and
horse, and at a time when presidents could take an unaccompanied
evening stroll, feeling no need for elaborate security measures.
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes an expanded, 60,000-square-foot visitors
center, a recreation room for the first family, an underground
press room and briefing area, a subterranean parking garage, new
meeting spaces and a overall of the building's pre-computer age
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of plan that should have been done a long time
ago, but wasn't,'' said Charles Atherton, secretary of the
Commission of Fine Arts, which is also involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed overhaul would be just the second major
rehabilitation of the country's most famous home since 1814, when
the White House was repaired after being burned by British troops
in the War of 1812. The interior of the building was extensively
repaired under President Harry S Truman; Truman also added a
balcony to the building.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of construction, which could begin in several
years, would add new parking facilities, including 290 spaces under
Pennsylvania Avenue for staff and dignitaries, and underground
meeting space under West Executive Avenue west of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors center would be next on the construction schedule
and would include a museum, videos and other multimedia exhibits
about the White House and its inhabitants. From the visitors center
_ planned as an enlargement of the existing one in the Commerce
Building near the White House _ tourists would glide to the grounds
surrounding the White House on a moving underground sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Later, another 850 parking spaces would be constructed under the
Ellipse _ the green oval park south of the White House _ for staff
and visitors, reducing traffic congestion that now mars what early
planners had meant to be a grand park.
</P>
<P>
   Congress must approve the construction, spelled out in a
500-plus-page design plan released recently by the Park Service.
Taxpayers would bear the cost, although the government is likely to
accept some private donations, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lengthy approval process _ including a debate over
what to do with the streets bordering the White House grounds _
construction won't be starting soon.
</P>
<P>
   But to many people who work, walk through, or have lived in the
White House, the work can't start soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of tourists routinely wait outside for hours, in
Washington's unbearably humid summers and wet winters, to get in
the White House. A special crossing guard is needed to escort the
crowds across E Street from the Ellipse, as frustrated motorists
often refuse to stop, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The new vistors center, where time-specific tickets would be
issued, will solve that problem, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like an awful lot of money, but it is a national
shrine,'' said Texas tourist Gail Wilson, 53, as she craned her
head to examine the antique sofas in the White House's ornate Red
Room.
</P>
<P>
   The planned recreation room, enthusiastically backed by former
White House residents interviewed by the park service, would be
either inside or underneath the White House.
</P>
<P>
   President Abraham Lincoln was one who could have used such a
designated recreation room. The 16th president let his children
have the run of the place, according to White House historical
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   When Lincoln was holding a Cabinet meeting, young Tad Lincoln
bombarded the door with his toy cannon. The child also reportedly
stopped his father's guests to sell refreshments, and he pressed
them for money for war charities at stands he set up in the
executive mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roosevelt's children slid down the stairways on trays
snatched from the White House pantry, and they bicycled and skated
on newly-polished floors.
</P>
<P>
   With no small children, Bill and Hillary Clinton haven't
encountered those play-time crises (though Buddy, the president's
chocolate Labrador, can sometimes be seen scampering around the
gardens, sniffing at plants). Still, the next president with young
children is going to want a safe, secluded place for the youngsters
to play, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very formal house,'' she said. ``There's no interior,
secure, recreation space. The day is coming when someone will say,
`I can't live here like this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The news media would also have upgraded facilities, including a
new briefing room, underground between the White House and the Old
Executive Office Building. The media would still retain part of its
old space, in the colonnade area linking the West Wing to the main
house, appeasing worries by the press corps that they would be
moved far from the presidential offices.
</P>
<P>
   Proximity to the president ``is one of the most important and
dramatic symbols of American democracy and of the First
Amendment,'' Helen Thomas, the former UPI reporter and longtime
dean of the White House press corps, wrote to the Parks Service.
</P>
<P>
   The media's basement workroom _ now a poorly ventilated, crowded
space where radio reporters work _ would be used for storage,
another serious White House need. With little on-site storage
space, the White House must now cart tables and other items into
the building every time there is an official event, adding to the
security burden of the Secret Service, which must search all
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Still open is the question of what to do with the stretch of
Pennsylvania Avenue along the north side of the White House. The
street was closed in 1995 after the Oklahoma City bombing. The fate
of the space will be dealt with later, following a study by the
Treasury Department, which oversees the Secret Service and security
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Public response to the long-term project has been mixed. While
many acknowledge the need to modernize, they also complain about
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are in no position to build a palace to
humor the president and his lady,'' Sheridan Arnold wrote in a
public comment to the Parks Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always wondered how the first family can relax in such
a formal atmosphere,'' said a more-sympathetic Steve Adams. ``These
folks definitely need a place inside to get away and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Other writers _ none of their hometowns were identified _ had
different gripes. Why should staff get the first shot at parking
spaces? Why not move the media out of the White House grounds
completely? What can be done to help the homeless people who now
reside in Lafayette Park, north of the White House?
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton, whose administration spearheaded the
renovation project, won't be in office to benefit from the changes,
he still was the target of some dissatisfied taxpayers skeptical of
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it looks real good as it is now,'' an anonymous writer
said in an e-mailed comment. ``The only improvement I could suggest
would be a new tenant in the White House.''

   RK Panditi?

   Actually, before Hollywood stars propelled its popularity into

Panditi was practicing the ancient art of uniting mind and body:
yoga.

   Each morning, the president of Eagle Technical Systems in Plano

   Then he eats.
</P>

   ``What meditation and yoga aims at is the highest spiritual goal

fitness center brochures could leave the impression that yoga is
all about sculpted arms and tight rears.
</P>
<P>
   For many, physical fitness and relaxation are the goals of yoga,
and certainly those are lofty aims in a culture of traffic jams and
fast-food drive-throughs.
</P>
<P>
   But yoga can also have a spiritual effect, one that may exceed
the bounds of religious denomination, Panditi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps me in shape,'' said Panditi, who began practicing
yoga 31 years ago. ``But there is much more beyond the physical
being. I think that is what we need to realize in yoga.''
</P>
<P>
   Practiced widely in fitness centers, studios and homes, yoga can
be seen as a global phenomenon with Indian roots that stretch back
at least as far as 200 B.C., said Andrew Fort, professor of Asian
religions at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Yoga _ the kind with a capital Y, or Patanjali Yoga _ is one of
six formal schools of Hindu thought, Fort said. It was codified in
the Yogasutra written in about 200 B.C. However, yoga in various
forms stretches back even further.
</P>
<P>
   Patanjali Yoga is aimed at distinguishing between ordinary,
physical awareness and a greater consciousness, and then learning
to leave behind ordinary awareness, Fort said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What yoga is the practice of is seeing beyond your physical
reality and seeing beyond your mental blocks and detaching yourself
so you can be a passive witness, merely observing, not suffering,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patanjali Yoga as set out in the Yogasutra has eight parts, or
limbs, which can be divided into three general categories: living a
moral life; assuming right postures or breathing; and conscious
mental control, Fort said.
</P>
<P>
   Within those categories are many kinds of yogas that include
recitations, seeking of knowledge and the practice of physical
postures.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal may be conscious mental control, but it cannot
be achieved without a moral life or physical health, Fort said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is way beyond what people do when they say they are `Going
to do some yoga,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who arrive at the doors of Yoga for Health in
Arlington enter not because they are looking for religion but
because they are seeking a way to relieve stress, said Leonard
Jefferson, who owns the studio.
</P>
<P>
   In his classes, Jefferson said, he does not emphasize the
spiritual aspects of yoga but concentrates on the physical
postures, exercises and breathing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   But the form of the exercises is transforming, Jefferson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone gets what they come here for,'' Jefferson said. ``If
you are coming here to be more spiritual, you will be more
spiritual. If you are coming here to look better, you will look
better. You will get what you put into it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kari Rollins of the Wellness Center in Fort Worth, yoga is
clearly not a religion. As an osteopathic doctor, Rollins uses it
in her medical practice and teaches it as preventive medicine, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone with any religion can practice yoga,'' said Rollins,
who teaches some of the center's 19 weekly classes. ``It has a
spiritual side to it, but not a religious side.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort would agree that the common practices of yoga, popularized
in the United States in the 1960s and being revived in local gyms
and studios, do not constitute a religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it a religion is that it comes out of a
centuries-old system that is committed to enlightenment or perfect
liberation,'' he said. ``... The vast majority of what's going on
isn't religion.''
</P>
<P>
   However, even for those who practice yoga to improve their
health and release stress, spiritual elements can surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be used strictly on a physical level,'' she said. ``But
that spiritual element creeps in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that feeling at peace with yourself would enhance your
relationship with the divine, however you see that,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   For Panditi, the practice of yoga helps break down a false
distinction between mind and body, he said. It helps him empty his
mind of impurities and leads to a sense of peace and harmony, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think yoga teaches us to remove this false illusion and
perceive our true divine nature,'' he said.

FRANCE AND U.S. TOLERATED GENOCIDE IN RWANDA, NEW REPORT CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ An independent panel assembled by the
Organization of African Unity said Friday that a ``significant
level of reparations'' should be paid to Rwanda by nations and
institutions that failed to prevent or stop the 1994 genocide that
killed up to 800,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of seven international experts singled out France, the
United States, Belgium, the United Nations and the Roman Catholic
and Anglican churches as those most guilty _ in addition to
Rwanda's Hutu-led government _ of complicity or negligence when
Hutu militias rampaged through the country, massacring ethnic
Tutsis and moderate or anti-government Hutus who defended them.
</P>
<P>
   In a report full of stinging rebukes issued here Friday, the
panel asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to establish a
commission to name the countries that owe Rwanda the money to
rebuild a devastated country, and to formulate an appropriate scale
of compensation. The report, ``Rwanda: The Preventable Genocide,''
also demanded the cancellation of Rwanda's international debts.
</P>
<P>
   The events of 1994 cannot be assigned to history, the panel
said. The long-term effects of those weeks of horrific bloodshed
and brutality continue to be felt throughout the region, especially
in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1994 genocide in one small country ultimately triggered a
conflict in the heart of Africa that has directly or indirectly
touched at least one-third of all the nations on the continent,''
the report said. It added that Rwanda should no more be assigned to
``ancient history'' than the Nazi Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which goes over the same ground and reaches many of
the same conclusions as another independent experts' study
commissioned by Annan, takes a deeper look at the roots of the
ethnic conflict in Rwanda, beginning with 60 years of Belgian
colonial rule that it says exacerbated, if not manipulated, ethnic
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of African Unity report is also far harsher in
its criticism of Security Council members, especially France and
the United States, saying that the former could have prevented the
genocide and the latter could have stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there would have been no genocide if certain
Rwandans had not organized and carried it out; there is no denying
that fundamental truth,'' the report said. ``But it is equally true
that throughout the past century external forces have helped shape
Rwanda's destiny and that of its neighbors.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report does not absolve the present, Tutsi-led government in
Rwanda of sometimes failing to meet challenges it inherited,
despite the ``resilience and vigor'' shown by the survivors in
rebuilding the country and their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandans still confront human rights abuses under the Tutsi-led
government formed from the Rwanda Patriotic Front, which seized
power in the summer of 1994. The country, struggling with refugee
resettlement, is still at war in Congo, where ethnic Hutu militias
remain a menace, the Rwanda government says.
</P>
<P>
   Those militias instigated the genocide in April 1994, after a
Hutu president, Juvenal Habyarimana, was killed in a plane crash in
Kigali, possibly caused by a missile attack. The report
characterizes the four-year period leading up to the outbreak of
violence as ``the triumph of ethnic radicalism'' among the majority
Hutu population that set the scene for the nightmare that followed.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the report found, France had ``unrivaled
influence at the very highest levels'' of the Hutu-led government
in Rwanda and chose not to exercise it to derail well-laid plans
for the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, Ambassador Stephen Lewis, a
Canadian member of the OAU panel and a former deputy executive
director of Unicef, said that the new report chose to focus more
heavily on the role of the Security Council, especially France and
the United States, than the report prepared for Annan last year.
Lewis said that French behavior was particularly indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We repudiate the position of the government of France, the
position that asserts they had no responsibility,'' he said. ``They
were closer in every way to the Habyarimana regime than any other
government. They could have stopped the genocide before it began.
They knew exactly what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Lewis said, the French peacekeeping mission eventually
sent to the region allowed a huge number of Hutu attackers to flee
the country to neighboring Congo, then Zaire, ``thereby ushering in
the larger Great Lakes catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost no redemptive feature to the conduct of the
government of France,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the United States, which blocked the Security Council
from sending peacekeepers to Rwanda once the massacres had begun,
Lewis said its role was ``an almost incomprehensible scar of shame
on American foreign policy.'' Speaking personally, he said, ``I
don't know how Madeleine Albright lives with it.'' Secretary of
State Albright was then the U.S. representative at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, on a subsequent visit to Africa, apologized
to Rwanda for the lack of international response, as has Belgium.
France has never expressed remorse or accepted blame.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of African Unity report is very critical of the
Roman Catholic Church. ``We were shocked by the role of the
church,'' Lewis said Friday. Although priests and lay Catholics
were among those who tried to save Tutsis, there were other church
officials who did not; some helped lure Tutsis to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   There were ``leaders of the church who did not speak out
strongly and take stands,'' Lewis said. ``Since Rwanda is a very
Catholic country, we felt we had to say something.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lewis, who introduced the report here Friday, the
panel consisted of Sir Ketumile Masire, a former president of
Botswana and the panel leader; Ahmadou Toumani Toure, former
president of Mali; Lisbet Palme, a Swedish child psychologist and
expert on the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child; Ellen
Johnson-Sirleaf, former finance minister of Liberia; P.N. Bhagwati,
former chief justice of India's Supreme Court; and Hocine Djoudi,
an Algerian judge and diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Anglican church authorities have apologized for ignoring human
rights abuses or for acts that encouraged Hutu death squads. The
Roman Catholic Church has not, the report said.
</P>

HIT-OR-MISS JOKES CAN'T KILL THE FUN OF `SCARY MOVIE' 
</HEADLINE>

SCARY MOVIE 
Directed by: Keenen Ivory Wayans 
Screenplay by: Shawn Wayans &AMP; Marlon Wayans &AMP; Buddy Johnson &AMP; Phil
Beauman and Jason Friedberg &AMP; Aaron Seltzer 
Starring: Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra, Shannon Elizabeth, Anna
Faris, Kurt Fuller, Regina Hall, Lochlyn Munro, Cheri Oteri, Dave
Sheridan, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans 
Running time: 85 minutes 
Rated: R (strong crude sexual humor, language, drug use and
violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's summer gross-out movie envelope-pusher isn't ``Me,
Myself and Irene.'' It's ``Scary Movie.'' There's nowhere it won't
go, no taboo or body orifice beyond its rude and sometimes very
funny reach. Essentially, it's a parody of the parodies that the
``Scream'' movies were, played out in the lively style of ``In
Living Color.'' The common denominator of course is the Wayans
brothers _ three of them in this case: Keenen Ivory, who directed,
and siblings Shawn and Marlon, doing double duty as screenwriters
and actors. ``Scream'' is hardly the only movie being spoofed. ``I
Know What You Did Last Summer'' is fair game here, too, and a
couple of hilarious jabs are reserved for ``The Matrix'' and ``The
Blair Witch Project'' (one not-so-hilarious bit takes a shot at
``The Sixth Sense'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie'' peaks pretty early when an endangered teen flees
her house, gets as far as her swmmming pool, then sees two traffic
signs. One says ``Safety,'' the other says ``Death.'' Fans of the
genre will know which she'll heed. Ever since ``Friday the 13th,''
``Halloween,'' and ``The Evil Dead,'' the genre has rested on a
solid, if inexplicable, base of teens rushing to dark, lonely
places where they know violent murders occur. Certainly the
teenaged students (played by actors in their 20s and early 30s) who
attend B.A. Corpse High School know every cliche of the horny teen
horror genre, with its jocks, sex kittens, know-it-alls, and fringe
characters like the student pothead and the doofus cop.
</P>
<P>
   They're all trying to dodge the knife-wielding maniac in the
black hooded cape and, in this case, white molded plastic mask
dominated by a big smile, as if the killer left the costume shop in
a hurry and grabbed the mask of comedy instead of the mask of
tragedy. Cheri Oteri makes the most of the by-now obligatory
exploitative TV reporter role, shoving her mike into the faces of
the glazed teens and shrieking at her cameraman while trying to
harvest material for a sequel to her best-seller, ``You're Dead,
I'm Rich.'' The new face in the cast is Anna Faris as a sweet girl
with a drug-dealer father. Carmen Electra, of ``Baywatch'' fame,
has most of the flatulence jokes. Shannon Elizabeth, the ``American
Pie'' dish, plays Buffy, hottest of the hot.
</P>
<P>
   The question facing the target audience for ``Scary Movie'' is
whether the funny bits will be enough of a payoff for sitting
through the tedious stuff between them. ``Scary Movie'' reminds us
repeatedly that not every joke involving bodily functions, or
malfunctions, is automatically funny. Its structure is, to put it
softly, ramshackle. Much of it plays like a weekly TV show, where
the hope is that the laughs will be enough to compensate for a
thrown-together quality. With the Wayans brothers doing the
throwing, the satire is sharp and knowing. Obviously, they've sat
through a lot of prurient slasher movies. Even though it's a little
late in the genre's history (most slasher movies these days parody
themselves), they are quick enough on the draw to yank laughs from
this less-than-fresh subject matter before genre cliches and this
film's flimsiness close in for the kill.

`JESUS' SON' PARALLELS DRUGGIE'S HIGHS, LOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
JESUS' SON 
Directed by: Alison Maclean 
Screenplay by: Elizabeth Cuthrell, David Urrutia and Oren Moverman
(based on Denis Johnson's book of short stories) 
Starring: Billy Crudup, Samantha Morton, Denis Leary, Jack Black,
Will Patton, Greg Germann, Holly Hunter, Dennis Hopper 
Running time: 109 minutes 
Rated: R (graphic drug use, strong language, sexuality and some
violent images) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The downside of drugs, William S. Burroughs once said, was that
you spend hours on end zonked out somewhere, staring at the tips of
your shoes. ``Jesus' Son,'' Alison Maclean's film of Denis
Johnson's short stories that hopscotch around the 1970s drug scene,
is too honest not to face up to the fact that it's often a downer,
with a sweet but largely passive protagonist. The film's strategy,
not unlike that of drugs, is to hook you on the highs so that
you'll be willing to ride out the lows. Certainly the cast couldn't
be more diverting. Billy Crudup draws on an endless supply of
vacant charm and sweetness as the protagonist, FH, short for a
nickname that cannot be printed in these pages.
</P>
<P>
   His convincing innocence makes you hope he survives this
fractured, episodic narrative that fitfully aspires to be a cross
between ``Drugstore Cowboy'' and ``Natural Born Killers,'' although
the only ones FH and his pals seem likely to kill are one another.
The film begins with FH in voiceover, recalling a hitchhiking
episode about which he had a bad feeling. Not that it stopped him
from getting into the car anyway. FH is that kind of guy, never one
to buck his karma. The film stumbles through a series of violent
collisions and encounters that FH always seems to walk away from,
including a bad drug trip that kills one of his acquaintances.
Brains are not FH's strong point, but he does bring to his druggy
odyssey a gift for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Maclean, a transplanted New Zealander from Canada, keeps the
film afloat by surrounding FH with a string of vivid diversions,
most notably Samantha Morton's dazzlingly harrowing turn as a
cocaine addict, Michelle, for whom FH falls heavily. Following her
extraordinary performance as Sean Penn's mute but eloquent
girlfriend in Woody Allen's ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' Morton confirms
the impression she made as an electrifying actress in ``Under the
Skin.'' She has no hard edges; her intensity crackles from within.
Her performance here is thrillingly fearless, stripped of all the
kinds of sentimentality with which drug addicts (especially women)
are usually portrayed. Morton's Michelle is open-eyed, powered by a
doomed desperation into which you're quite willing to believe
Crudup's dimwitted latter-day Candide would be swept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus' Son,'' as its title implies, is not entirely divorced
from the idea of redemption. Yet it's a long time coming, and until
it does, the film relies almost entirely on this or that character
coming along to inject dramatic fireworks. Some are overt, such as
Jack Black's manic, pill-popping emergency room orderly and kindred
soul to FH. It's a juicy follow-up to Black's motor-mouthed record
store clerk in ``High Fidelity.'' We may, I think, consider Black's
movie career launched. And just when the film seems ready to
subside like a punctured balloon, along comes Holly Hunter with an
extraordinarily graceful performance as an unexpected dance partner
for FH. The good news is that ``Jesus' Son'' has some delicious
diversions. The bad news is that it constantly needs them.

WILLIS AMUSES IN INNER-CITY BUDDY PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE KID 
Directed by: Jon Turteltaub 
Screenplay by: Audrey Wells 
Starring: Bruce Willis, Spencer Breslin, Emily Mortimer, Lily
Tomlin, Jean Smart, Chi McBride, Daniel Von Bargen, Dana Ivey 
Running time: 101 minutes 
Rated: PG (mild language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Kid,'' charm goes to war with sentimentality, and
sentimentality wins. But before the film succumbs to a gelatinous
pace that hangs its rigging out to dry, Bruce Willis brings a
becomingly deft economy to his performance as a prosperous but
unhappy image consultant named Russ who would rather not get in
touch with his inner child, but does. Strictly speaking, his
8-year-old self, Rusty, makes contact with him, all in the name of
therapy. When Russ shows up with a chronic twitching eye at a
therapist's and tells her he left his childhood in the past, she
replies, ``It doesn't want to stay in the past, does it?''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Russ doesn't want to be reminded of the pudgy loser he
was as a kid. Not that the time-traveling kid is all that impressed
with the 40-year-old he has become, either. Young Rusty thinks old
Russ is a loser because he isn't married and doesn't even have a
dog. It takes Russ a long time to figure out that their interface
isn't about him going back in time and helping the kid replay a
scuffle with bullies in a schoolyard, but about taking a cue from
the kid and learning to lighten up and loosen up. Although ``The
Kid'' contains fleeting resemblances to ``Back to the Future'' and
``Big'' and, for that matter, ``A Christmas Carol,'' it never
generates the sense of lift those films have. It's a reluctant
buddy comedy, with both halves of Russ's bifurcated self stumbling
toward integration as they learn to cut each other some slack.
</P>
<P>
   While Willis is busy keeping the older Russ's consternation
comically viable, young Spencer Breslin projects a screenful of sad
pre-pubescent clarity as he removes any doubt that the older Russ's
troubles have their origin in those of the younger Rusty. Perhaps
significantly, the shrink drops out of the picture moments after
she enters it. Clearly, it's up to Russ to heal himself, or,
perhaps more accurately, his selves. One helping hand comes from
Jean Smart's good-hearted TV anchorwoman, whom he meets on an
airplane. Others come from Lily Tomlin, underutilized in a generic
role as his overburdened assistant, and from Emily Mortimer as a
photographer who's soft on him and is gamely trying to hang in
there until he grows up.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, we have a handful of women graciously, patiently
waiting for a man to grow up, a scenario far from unknown in
Hollywood, not to mention other quarters. ``The Kid'' has to work
hard to convince us it's the stunted man who deserves our sympathy,
not the women. It isn't every man who gets the opportunity to
behave both figuratively and literally like an 8-year-old. Willis
and Breslin manage it ingratiatingly. Willis underplayed to very
funny effect in his recent farce, ``The Whole Nine Yards.'' He
repeats the feat here, although marginally less hilariously, while
Breslin cements his hold on our sympathies. Too bad ``The Kid''
gets bogged down in its sentimental manipulations. It has more
going for it than you might suppose.

A WINNING EMILY WATSON STRIVES TO SAVE `TRIXIE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
TRIXIE 
Written and directed by: Alan Rudolph 
Starring: Emily Watson, Dermot Mulroney, Nick Nolte, Nathan Lane,
Brittany Murphy, Lesley Ann Warren, Will Patton, Stephen Lang 
Running time: 117 minutes 
Rated: R (some language, sexuality and violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Trixie'' is a film that needs to be carried past its
imperfections, and Emily Watson almost succeeds in carrying it.
It's an Alan Rudolph film, which is another way of saying that it's
an idiosyncratic mood piece. It's too elliptical to be the
screwball noir Rudolph set out to write. It's just too wispy. But
like the dogged waif named Trixie, with a Chicago working-girl
accent and a determination to succeed as a professional sleuth,
Watson perseveres even though everyone Trixie meets seems almost
eager to morph into someone unexpected. Trixie is the kind of girl
who talks in malapropisms, yet is a pretty straight thinker who
makes herself understood.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's Trixie, bright eyes burning like coals in her pale moon
face, is at her best when she sits down at an old-boy restaurant
with Nick Nolte's state senator who's pickled in his own corruption
and incapable of talking straight talk. He simply babbles on in
double talk (much of it taken, Rudolph says, from actual political
speeches) until the problem goes away. She doesn't understand his
empty rant; he doesn't understand her fractured English. And yet
when their mutual non-communication is over, he understands that
her righteous anger is a threat to him and she understands that the
corrupt pol has done some pretty awful things.
</P>
<P>
   Trixie is determined to bring to justice the killer of Lesley
Ann Warren's crumbling cabaret singer, who before her death was
humiliatingly used by the pol and a rich developer played by Will
Patton, in one of his sinister turns. The guy's henchman, played by
Dermot Mulroney, considers himself a ladies' man, but Trixie thinks
she detects something sincere beneath the verbal oil slick of his
mechanical advances. All this is a sideline to Trixie, whose
sleuthing ambitions take the form of a security job in a drab
lakefront casino. There she befriends the house comic, played by
Nathan Lane with a gloss of sentimentality on his Broadway belter
persona. Even he has his secrets, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trixie'' might have proved more enticing if Trixie had a few
secrets. She's the only one in the film who doesn't. There's
nothing to be revealed about Trixie. She isn't given enough range
in this script, where promising element after promising element
dwindles into nothingness. Yet Watson, against the odds, keeps
finding ways to wring appeal from Trixie's bruised working-class
sparrow, even when Rudolph sends the mixed metaphors and
malapropisms into overdrive. They'd count for more if there were
fewer of them. Just as the film would count for more if there were
more of it.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many wonderful moments in ``Trixie'' and so few
films like it that you wish Rudolf had given it a few more
rewrites. Even though this latest film stalls out, even when he
isn't on his best game, Rudolph remains a simpatico filmmaker. He's
a romantic, determined to persist in believing in victories of the
heart. Watson says she chose to do the role because it gave her a
chance to play a comic role for once, a woman discovering her own
strength. Obvious as the limits of the script may be, it's
impossible to dislike Trixie and her tinny little voice, especially
when she narrows her eyes and says things like ``The sword of
Damocles is hanging over Pandora's box.''

MAKE TIME FOR THIS CLOCK SAGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
LONGITUDE 
Starring: Michael Gambon, Jeremy Irons, Ian Hart, Gemma Jones 
Directed by: Charles Sturridge 
On: A&AMP;E 
Time: Sunday at 8 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compared to the no-brainerism of TV voyeurism, a four-hour
British movie about two men fixated on clocks sounds like a night
at the SATs. Tick-toxic.
</P>
<P>
   But I urge you not to let the plot description of ``Longitude,''
with its 18th-century search for a pendulum-free timepiece that
could keep true time on a ship, scare you away. Directed by Charles
Sturridge of ``Brideshead Revisited,'' ``Longitude'' is a
surprisingly terrific saga whose easy-to-follow scientific themes
are simply the backdrop for two stirring stories about passion,
obsession, and madness. And driving those two stories are
picturesque ocean adventures, clocks that look like fragile
sculptures, the coming specter of World War II, and a pair of
beautifully paced performances by Michael Gambon and Jeremy Irons.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant plot, set in the 1700s, follows a Yorkshire
carpenter named John Harrison (Gambon), who is bent on building a
clock that will help sailors determine their longitude. It's easy
to underestimate the importance of measuring longitude dependably,
but at one time, inaccurate longitude readings were a common cause
of gruesome disasters at sea. Harrison is motivated by the desire
to save lives, but also by Parliament's promise of a 20,000-pound
prize to anyone who can solve the longitude problem. He is assisted
in the rigors of his miniaturized work by his son (Ian Hart), a
loyal boy with whom he seems to have a nonverbal connection. In
scenes that range from the comic to the horrifying, the haughty
Parliament board continually sets up unfair obstacles for the
Harrisons, as though it would prefer that they fail.
</P>
<P>
   The Harrisons' struggle, which threatens their father-son bond,
is interwoven with the 20th-century struggle of a World War I
veteran officer named Rupert Gould (Irons), who is obsessed with
Harrison's clocks. Having recently survived a nervous breakdown,
Gould pours his hope into the reassembly and restoration of the
clocks. It's as though he identifies with the complex mechanisms
and their need for protection from the coming upheaval of World War
II. As he refuses to turn away from his unpaid work on the Harrison
clocks and pursue a living, his marriage and his ability to cope
begin to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Irons is incredible, underplaying the strains on Gould until
those critical moments when Gould can no longer contain himself.
It's the kind of performance that shifts and deepens in the course
of the movie. But ``Longitude'' surely belongs to Gambon, who gives
a sympathetic turn as the impolitic, genius carpenter. While the
cracks in Gould's modern consciousness are compelling, Harrison's
unending ingenuity and willpower make the movie rousing from scene
to scene. You feel the weight of his achievement, not only in his
devoted work but in his persistence in the face of those in
authority.
</P>
<P>
   As it moves back and forth between the two plots, ``Longitude''
never loses direction. Sturridge cleverly plays the two men's lives
off each other, and the parallels click despite the differences in
the time periods. Clocks may change over the centuries, and
Harrison's time of hope may fade to Gould's time of dread, but the
heart remains the same.

IN HUMOROUS ESSAYS, SEDARIS GOES TO PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN CLEGG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
Me Talk Pretty One Day 
By David Sedaris 
Little, Brown, 288 pp., $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growing up in North Carolina, David Sedaris felt betrayed by his
own tongue. Relegated to speech lessons for a lisp, he bought a
pocket Thesaurus and memorized an s-free vocabulary, much to the
dismay of his therapist. (``If I wanted to spend my life as David
Thedarith, then so be it.'')
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for readers, Sedaris has found his voice. In ``Me Talk
Pretty One Day,'' the National Public Radio humorist has written a
savagely funny laugh track for his own life. Following two popular
books, ``Naked'' and ``Barrel Fever,'' his latest collection of
essays moves him to Paris and continues to come to terms with his
fractured family history.
</P>
<P>
   Sedaris fleshes out the characters who surround him: his
tough-talking, truth-telling mother and his IBM engineer father,
the one with the yen for Blue Note jazz artists. His profane
brother Rooster, who ``by the time he had reached the second grade,
spoke much like the toothless fishermen casting their nets into the
Albemarle Sound.''
</P>
<P>
   He comes to term with his own oddness early on. Back to fifth
grade speech lessons: ``None of the therapy students were girls.
They were all boys like me who kept movie star scrapbooks and made
their own curtains. `You don't want to be doing that,' the men in
our families would say. `That's a girl thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What's new for this gay Greek sort-of scion of Carolina is the
Continent. With scornful honesty (``. . . according to several
reliable sources, I tended to exhaust people''), Sedaris
reconstructs his relationship with boyfriend Hugh and a certain
house in Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see this as a romantic idea,'' he writes. ``It had
nothing to do with France itself, with wearing hats or writing
tortured letters from a sidewalk cafe. I didn't care where
Hemingway drank or Alice B. Toklas had her mustache trimmed. What I
found appealing in life abroad was the inevitable sense of
helplessness it would inspire.'')
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving New York, Sedaris enrolls in a beginning French
course, where he memorizes the kind of dialogue that never, ever
materializes when traveling abroad. Characters steer clear of the
past tense. Skies are often blue. Sedaris despairs. ``Taken one by
one, the assorted nouns and verbs were within my grasp, but due to
drug use and a close working relationship with chemical solvents,
it's all I can do to recite my zip code, let alone an entire
conversation devoted to the pleasures of direct sunlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Language, as always, is a snare. ``Hugh and I returned to
Normandy the following summer, and I resumed my identity as the
village idiot. `See you again yesterday!' I said to the butcher.
`Ashtray! Bottleneck!' . . . On the following trip I sanded the
floors and began the practice of learning ten new words a day.
Slum, facial swelling, death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every essay hits the mark. His attempt at toilet humor
(``Big Boy'') falls flat, and his riff on nouvelle food in New York
seems dated. ``A Shiner Like a Diamond,'' about his father and
sister Amy, is too disjointed to resonate.
</P>
<P>
   But Sedaris, the twisted American in Paris, is still pretty
funny by any standard, and somewhere, there is meta- in the
madness. Much of his writing is arch, over-the-top, and frankly
gay. But like ``Will and Grace,`` the television sitcom starring
gay characters, Sedaris swims in the mainstream. There's nothing
underground about NPR or NBC; gay sensibility can be unpacked,
unwrapped and laughed at. Ethnic Jewish humor, after all, moved
from the private confines of family and tribe to the public art of
Sid Caesar and Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of his self-loathing and super-sibilant past, David
Sedaris is fomenting the same sort of revolution. As he himself
puts it, ``Paris, it seems, is where I've come to dream about
America.''

PAINT OVER THE OLD STAIN ON STUCCO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July   09, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I splashed oil stain/sealer on my stucco wall. How can I
repair it without damaging the paint or the stucco? Some friends
recommend acid wash.
</P>
<P>
   BENEDICT, Tracy, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's hope you read this soonerr or later, because my e-mail
answer to your e-mail question got hurled back in the handyman's
face.
</P>
<P>
   So, the answer is: Getting an oil-based stain off stucco or any
other concrete is virtually impossible, unless it is just minutes
old. It can be dissolved with paint thinner when it is still wet,
but once it dries, that's all she wrote. You have to let it wear
off, which would take years. An acid wash won't work because the
stucco is painted, and acid takes off only lime in the stucco.
Chemical paint remover will remove the stain, but also take off the
paint.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is to paint the stain with a latex house paint or
a latex solid color stain. If the stain is quite dark, apply a
stain killer such as latex-based Kilz first. Otherwise the stain
might bleed through paint or stain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I need a new burner. The oilman wants to sell me a rebuilt
burner, which will cost $400 vs. $700 for a new one. Is that
reasonable?
</P>
<P>
   SUE SAVARESE, South Hamilton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, that is reasonable. It is reasonable if there's a
guarantee with it, and if it falls under your service contract,
which you should have anyway. No guarantee, no deal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The linoleum in my kitchen, hall, and den is worn out, and
the only thing I can do for the moment is to put a rug over it.
Could I cover it with the stick-on vinyl tile? A floor man offered
to install hardwood over the linoleum for $5,000. I thought that
was high.
</P>
<P>
   RUTH FOSTER, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can put the stick-on tile over the old linoleum, as long
as the old material is flat and even, and not coming loose. It is a
jury rig of sorts, but will do well enough, and you can still put
down your favorite carpet.
</P>
<P>
   The price for the hardwood floor job sounds high, although I
don't know how much flooring would be used. But I think you could
save a bundle if you install prefinished hardwood. With prefinished
flooring, you eliminate the sanding and three coats of polyurethane
varnish or any other finish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some asphalt shingles made several tarry marks on my
bluestone steps during a roofing project. In fact, a lot of little
marks. How can I remove them?
</P>
<P>
   MAUREEN McNEIL, Marblehead, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try pressure washing the stains; it will not hurt the
bluestone or any mortar between stones. If that doesn't work, try
scraping off any that will come off with a putty knife. Then sand
the rest of it off; sanding will leave light marks on the
bluestone, but weathering will even them out in a short time.
</P>
<P>
   If the tar is really stubborn, dissolve it with paint thinner,
then put baking soda on the stain to absorb the dissolved tar.
Leave it for half an hour, and sweep it off. Repeat as necessary.
The bluestone will absorb almost anything, and if you do not use
the baking soda, the dissolved tar will go deeper _ and more
permanently _ into the bluestone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The ceilings in my 1950s house are skimcoated with calcimine;
they are smooth but peeling off the plaster. The ceiling is full of
shallow craters, 10 inches in diameter. Can I fill them with joint
compound to smooth out the ceiling before repainting?
</P>
<P>
   MARJ NEEDHAM, Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If it is calcimine, it is probably paint rather than a
skimcoat. Calcimine was popular before and after the war, and an
inexpensive, good-looking finish. But it was not compatible with
any paints; people would paint over calcimine with latex or oil
paint and the paint would come right off on the roller.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot fill those craters with anything; the joint compound
may stick to the plaster but will not stick to any calcimine;
nothing sticks to calcimine except more calcimine or a calcimine
substitute.
</P>
<P>
   You can do one of two things: Scrape, sand, and wash off all the
calcimine, revealing that fine old plaster. Real plaster. The
calcimine should wash off with one or more washings, and you must
get rid of every trace. Then paint with a latex ceiling paint.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is to sand the ceiling smooth, feather-edging
the borders of the craters to even them out. Then paint with
Kal-Coat or other calcimine substitute.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You suggested using Era with oxygen bleach to clean mold off
my semitransparent stained shingles. I can't find it; I can only
find Era with a bleach alternative. Where can I find it with oxygen
bleach?
</P>
<P>
   J.F., Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe the bleach alternative is oxygen bleach. Try it; if
it works, fine. If it doesn't, go to the next best thing: one part
household belach and five or more parts water.
</P>
<P>

FIGHTERS FOR THE INTELLIGENT FAN'S ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For fans of intelligent rock, the pairing of the Red Hot Chili
Peppers with Foo Fighters is manna from heaven. For Foo Fighters'
frontman Dave Grohl, it's something more than simply a fine tour
match. Grohl played drums in a group that opened up for the Peppers
nearly a decade ago, as both alternative rock and Grohl's former
band _ Nirvana _ were poised to revolutionize mainstream rock
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I saw these guys were nine years ago, when
Nirvana and Pearl Jam opened up for the Peppers,'' Grohl recalls in
a phone conversation from his manager's office in L.A. ``Yeah, it
brings back memories. This has been the most exciting tour, besides
the first one, that we've ever done. I guess most of all I feel
good about myself, because I know in some way I've kept the ball
rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Grohl is equal parts facetious and sincere _ devoted to music
while at the same time harboring a healthy cynicism about the music
industry machinery, and a healthy sense of humor about himself. In
November, Foo Fighters released its third CD, ``There Is Nothing
Left To Lose.'' Since then, the band has fielded tour offers from
Oasis, No Doubt, and Korn _ all of which Foo Fighters graciously
declined. When the Peppers called, there wasn't a moment's
hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peppers came up from punk, but they have hard rock
elements and ballads, too,'' Grohl says, pointing up similarities
between the two bands. ``It seems like they're about music, not
about image or roaring, crazy, dangerous youth dynamics. With the
other bands, we weren't sure the styles were compatible. I'm a fan
of those bands. But if we were to get out in front of Korn's
audience and play something that sounded like the Eagles, we'd get
our (butts) kicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Grohl and bandmates have ventured into more sophisticated,
melodic, sensitive-guy terrain on the latest Foo's album, and
Grohl, a veteran of punk bands, has no shame. On the contrary:
``I'm a little unhappy with popular music these days, and the lack
of introspection is my biggest problem. People aren't inspiring
audiences to reach inside themselves. When I was younger I was in
hardcore bands that were about being hard, fast, and loud. Then I
was in a band (Nirvana) that was hard, fast, and loud with feel and
melody. It was an awakening. Kurt made it seem so simple, simpler
than it is. ''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Grohl stepped out from behind the drum kit and released
Foo Fighters self-titled debut, made up mainly of material he began
writing and recording before Nirvana ended with Cobain's suicide in
1994. He then formed a band to promote it. And that, Grohl says,
was the genesis of the many personnel changes Foo Fighters has seen
in its brief life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bass player (Nate Mendel), the intellectual of the group,
came up with a theory that makes sense,'' says Grohl. ``We've never
really had time to grow up as a band. The first record was a fluke:
a demo tape recorded and then used as an excuse to have a band.
After about a year of touring the drummer didn't want to play
someone else's drum parts, then Pat (guitarist Pat Smear), who's
never been in a band for very long, said `you guys should be a
three-piece'. (Two more guitarists have followed in his wake.) Most
bands go through that sort of thing before they even make a record.
We finally feel like the band is what it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The current line-up _ Grohl on vocals and guitar, Mendel,
drummer Taylor Hawkins, and guitarist Chris Shiflett _ recorded
``There Is Nothing Left To Lose'' in the studio Grohl built in his
suburban Virginia home _ lovingly described as ``kind of the '70s
hippie house amid the Colonials.'' Grohl credits the casual,
comfortable atmosphere _ no label executives offering suggestions,
no clock ticking, and most of all recording his guitar parts
sitting on the couch he's owned for eight years _ for the album's
natural, breezy feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what I hated about L.A. (where Grohl relocated from
Seattle after forming Foo Fighters) was brought on by missing
Virginia,'' says Grohl, a native Virginian who also has an
apartment in New York City. ``At a time in your life when you feel
lost, and are searching for things that are real, L.A. is the worst
place to be. Here, noone questions anyone's intentions. People live
for the sake of being happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Foo Fighters, which has been on the road for nearly a year, will
tour for another six months, Grohl says, before retreating to his
house to record another album. ``I think the new record will come
out a lot sooner than people expect; maybe early next year,'' says
Grohl. ``With a studio in the basement, we could make one once a
month!''

   Free Love Making good on a promise she made at the Digital
Hollywood Conference last month, Hole frontwoman Courtney Love is
making a generous quantity of her band's material available for
free download at the Hole Web site (www.holemusic.com). The 50
available MP3 tracks include live cuts and outtakes in addition to
album tracks that span Hole's career. Said the outspoken Love in a
lengthy manifesto posted on Salon.com: ``Since I've basically been
giving my music away for free under the old system, I'm not afraid
of wireless MP3 files. If record companies aren't going to do for
me what I can do for myself with my 19-year-old Webmistress on my
own Web site, then they need to get the hell out of my way.''

   Attention: budding lyricists British pop brat Robbie Williams is
having an uncharacteristic spasm of altruism, most likely inspired
by his deep-pocketed Internet sponsors. The winner of a contest to
write lyrics to a new song on Williams' Web site,
www.robbiewilliams.co.uk, will get 1,000 British pounds and a
publishing contract with EMI. Don't get any fancy ideas about
raking in the bucks from sales of the Robbie Williams album with
your song on it, though. Williams isn't making any promises that
he'll actually record the future masterpiece.

</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Saturday, July 8:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-TEST (Washington) _ On a test of the U.S. missile
defense system that is scheduled for Friday night, between 10 p.m.
and 2 a.m. EDT. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   RWANDA-REPARATIONS (United Nations) _ An independent panel
assembled by the Organization of African Unity said Friday that a
``significant level of reparations'' should be paid to Rwanda by
nations and institutions that failed to prevent or stop the 1994
genocide that killed up to 800,000 people. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-CRIMINAL-COURT (United Nations) _ Developments in the
effort to get United States to sign on to international criminal
court. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-BANK-CHINA (Washington) _ The World Bank is scheduled
Friday to vote on a $40 million loan to China that would involve
relocating 58,000 farmers to land that is traditionally used by
Tibetan herders. By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   SWISS-ISRAEL (Geneva) _ Switzerland's highest court sentenced a
confessed Israeli spy Friday to a one-year suspended prison
sentence for his role in a bungled 1998 wiretap attempt by the
Mossad secret service. By Elizabeth Olson.
</P>
<P>
   WAR-CRIMES-DEFINED (Undated) _ From the grisly amputations of
the hands of innocents in Sierra Leone to the systematic sexual
abuse of women in Bosnia and Rwanda _ or, some would say, to the
bombing of Kosovo refugees by NATO war planes _ modern conflicts
raise new and complex issues. There still is not total agreement on
universally accepted moral codes. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   Editors, this story is from the Culture Desk's Ideas Page.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   EPISCOPALS-LUTHERANS (Denver) _ The General Conference of the
Episcopal Church, meeting here, is to take up a proposal that would
unite the 2.4 million members of the Episcopal church and with the
5.2 million members of the Evangelical Lutheran churches. Church
leaders see the proposal for ``full communion,'' which the
Lutherans have already approved, as a landmark step for the two
denominations. It would be more a pact than a merger, but would
allow the churches to recognize each other's sacraments, share
clergy and pool resources, particularly in inner city and rural
areas where congregations are often small and financially
hard-pressed. Although the two churches are close in matters of
theology and liturgy, and both ordain women, they have had
significant differences over the role and authority of bishops,
which has been a sticking point. By Michael Janofsky and Laurie
Goodstein.
</P>
<P>
   ALCOHOLICS-MODERATION (Seattle, Wash.) _ After she founded a
self-help program called Moderation Management seven years ago,
Audrey Kishline became a national spokeswoman for the notion that
problem drinkers could be taught to cut back without abstaining
altogether. Having recently pleaded guilty to two counts of
vehicular homicide after a binge drinking episode last March,
Kishline said through her lawyer that she has a new message:
Moderation Management ``is nothing but alcoholics covering up their
problem.'' By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHERS-FELDMAN (Undated) _ Public lives on Sandra Feldman,
president of the American Federation of Teachers. By Jodi Wilgoren.
</P>
<P>
   SF-GAYS (San Francisco) _ Gay activists challenge health
department contention that AIDS cases on the rise in San Francisco.
By Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   JAMAICA-MISSING-EDITOR (Negril, Jamaica) _ Frederick and Mary
Ann Kirschhoch have made two trips to Jamaica, where their
daughter, a travel editor, vanished around May 27. They came
because they believed they could describe their daughter to
Jamaicans in a way that only parents could. By Edward Wong.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (``p'' code)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-ABORTION (Austin, Texas) _ There's little doubt that the
next president will have a major role in shaping the make-up and
prevailing attitudes of the Supreme Court. Republicans expect, and
Democrats fear, that Gov. George W. Bush will use his appointments
to the court to restrict women's access to abortion. But if his
appointments to the Texas Supreme Court are any indication, those
expectations may not be fulfilled. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-PLATFORM (St. Louis) _ Democrats release draft of their
party's platform.
</P>
<P>
   GORE (Pittsburgh) _ In western Pennsylvania, Al Gore talks about
women and health care.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-BRIEFS (Undated) _ News and notes on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Just 11,000 jobs were created in June,
much fewer than expected and the smallest increase in four years,
in the latest sign that the U.S. economy is slowing. The nonfarm
payrolls number, however, reflected a loss of 195,000 government
jobs as Census workers completed their work. That offset a gain of
206,000 jobs in private business. Still, the unemployment rate
slipped to 4 percent from 4.1 percent, matching expectations and
bring the rate closer to April's 30-year low of 3.9 percent. And
private business is now averaging growth of 177,000 jobs a month so
far this year, a slowdown from last year's pace of 220,000 jobs. By
Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-BANK-RUSSIA (Washington) _ The World Bank says that an
internal investigation has found no proof that a former Russian
official passed confidential information to a Russian bank in 1993.
By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   SEASIA-ECON (Singapore) _ Despite Southeast Asia's economic
recovery from the crisis that began three years ago this month,
foreign investors have been dumping stocks and currencies from the
region. Its markets this year are the worst-performing in the
world, having dropped more than 22 percent on average. By Wayne
Arnold.

   LINCOLN-HOUSE _ President Clinton will announce plans for
restoring Abraham Lincoln's summer retreat home, three miles from
the Capitol. The14-room Gothic-Revival cottage is where Lincoln
drafted the Emancipation Proclamation. David Long, history
professor at Eastern Carolina University in Greenville,N.C., will

<P>
   BLACKS-UTEXAS _ Free airfare and a good time apparently worked
in favor of the University of Texas Law School. The number of
African-American students who plan to attend UT in the fall is
double the number from last year and officials believe it's because
of an outreach effort this spring that brought accepted students to
campus for a look-see. They want to expand to hispanic students
next spring. (Jayson, Austin American-Statesman). 15-18.
</P>
<P>
   LATIN-FORUM _ATLANTA _Expectations were high in parts of
Georgia's Latino community six months ago. Four people appointed by
Gov. Roy Barnes were recommending changes to state laws and
policies to help Georgia's growing Latino population. They held a
press conference to give their report to the governor, but his
staff said Barnes was too busy to attend.
</P>
<P>
   His absence frustrated some Latinos. Now some Latinos are more
frustrated because not much has become of recommendations made by
the Latino Forum that Barnes appointed. It's a different story in
North Carolina, another state with a fast-growing Hispanic
population where thousands of Latinos work in construction,
poultry, agriculture and hotels and restaurants as they do in
Georgia. Latino leaders in North Carolina meet regularly with
high-ranking state official and the governor. In fact the Office of
Hispanic/Latino Affairs, is part of the governor's office. (Bixler,

``Tips for a Lifetime.'' Most of these tips, although useful, would
be more appropriate for someone who ran a Martha Stewart-styled
household. That's not me. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald)
MOVEDMINTER-COLUMN _ Our cousin, Don Harp, is a preacher. He knows
exactly what to say when a family member crosses the Jordan. One of
the things he pointed out at Aunt Ida Mae's funeral was that we are
running out of what Tom Brokaw and a lot of us think of as The
Greatest Generation. ``Who among us is going to take their place?''
Don asked. It is a worrisome question. (Minter, Atlanta

SOME THINGS CHANGE, SOME STAY THE SAME AT SPECIAL PLACE CALLED
NOTRE DAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL RECORD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago I told of my return to Notre Dame with my dear
friend, Don Hellinghausen of Midland, Texas, for the 50th reunion
of our class.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the column focused on memories of our undergraduate
years stirred by our return to the place we called home from 1946
until 1950. Today's focus will be on the university Don and I found
on our return last month and the reunion itself.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 buildings have been added. But all have been built on
the perimeter of the campus we knew 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Little has changed about the campus that existed then.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a change in the student body. It is larger, smarter
(I doubt if I could meet today's scholastic requirements) and
better diversified.
</P>
<P>
   The camaraderie that existed in our days is alive and well
today. The athletes still do not receive special privileges, other
than the training table, during the season of their sports. It is
difficult to distinguish between the rich and the not-so-rich.
</P>
<P>
   I was impressed by the students I encountered on my return. The
university provided 30 vans to transport the returning exes around
the campus. They were driven by students who were attending summer
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure that members of the Class of '50 appeared ancient to
them. That's OK. They appeared so very young to us.
</P>
<P>
   I found each to be gracious and prepared to go out of his or her
way to make the oldtimers' visit as pleasant as possible. As I was
getting out of a van, the driver noted my nametag and said,
``You're from Fort Worth. I'm from Grapevine.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Frost undoubtedly is the brightest chauffeur I ever had
_ she will receive her doctoral degree in civil engineering next
month. When she learned I was still writing a column for the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram, she wanted to know if I ever knew Ellen
Thornley.
</P>
<P>
   I said that not only did I know her, but I was instrumental in
hiring her as a copy editor many years ago when I was managing
editor. Heather explained that her mother used to babysit for
Ellen's son.
</P>
<P>
   I informed Heather that Ellen had done very well in the news
business. Today she is a managing editor of this newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame went out of its way to welcome back the Class of '50,
which it described as its ``beloved sons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Edward A. ``Monk'' Malloy, the university's president,
was present at many of the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   So was president emeritus, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh,
credited by many with elevating the academic reputation of the
university. Most people know Father Ted as an outstanding
administrator. Many in our class also knew him as an outstanding
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The most important part of the return was the opportunity to
embrace classmates we had not seen since graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Note the use of the verb ``embrace.'' Fifty years ago, we were
more comfortable with a manly handshake, confining embraces to
family members. Some changes are good.
</P>
<P>
   There was an embrace for the Rev. Len Constantini and
recollections of the nights we tried to evade our Zahm Hall floor
monitor, ``Creeper'' Murray, who would prowl darkened halls with a
flashlight after lights-out at 11 p. m.
</P>
<P>
   There was an embrace for Don Derivaux, who became a Trappist
monk after leaving Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   I listened in almost disbelief as he described how a dentist
taught him to perform dental work _ including the extraction of
wisdom teeth _ on fellow monks. Fortunately they also taught him
how to give deadening injections.
</P>
<P>
   Father Don finally gave up the silence of the monastery _ and
his unlicensed dental practice _ to become involved in parish work
in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   There was a note of sadness when we received the list of nearly
400 classmates who had died. A number fell during the Korean War,
which started three weeks after our class of 1,100 graduated.

   It also was sad to see how many classmates had been slowed by
strokes, heart ailments and other afflictions faced by those in
their 70s. This made me realize how blessed I am to be able to
still get on the tennis court two or three times a week.

   When I graduated half a century ago, I knew I had been fortunate
to have been a part of a special place called Notre Dame. When I
returned 50 years later, I quickly determined it is still a very
special place where its ``beloved sons (and daughters)'' become
devoted to God, family, country and Notre Dame.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   FOOTBALL LEASE  _ Finishing its football stadium lease with the
county, NFL team and rodeo is the second most important piece of
business the sports authority faces this year. But like its arena
deal, a completed lease has been delayed for months. If delays last
much longer taxpayers will be hit for millions because of spiraling
interest rates. Moreover, by August or September the sports
authority, which needs to sell bonds but can't do so without a
lease, will run out of money to pay the contractors. An analysis of
what's holding up the lease, and its repercussions.  Eric Berger . 
 
 DOCTOR _  One week after her father was acquitted on charges of
sexually molesting her over a period of 11 years, a 20-year-old
Houston college student says that her father bought the not guilty
verdict with his money, power and high-priced attorneys. Dr.
Bradley Wertman says that's silly and that even though he was found
not guilty that he still hopes his daughter can get help. Wertman's
three-week trial was a fascinating study of how a family can be
torn apart by sexual abuse charges and the defense says it shows
how a psychologist can reinforce ``manufactured memories'' of
sexual abuse. Good stuff. Reax from all sides. Developing. Steve
Brewer 
 
  SETTLE  _ City wants to pay a former customs agent $100,000 to
settle a lawsuit over his arrest in connection with the ``party
planning service'' known as the Salad Sisters. Edwin Heitschmidt
has accused the city, and local law enforcement, of false arrest,
malicious prosecution and of causing nerve damage to his wrists by
keeping a pair of handcuffs on him for three hours during a search
of his girlfriend's home. He was convicted of promoting
prostitution, but that conviction later was overturned.  Matt
Schwartz  
 
 LAWRENCE  _ Lee Wells-Flowers has observed her only child's
birthday without him for eight years now. Lawrence Wells' body has
never been found, and his killer has never been charged.
Wells-Flowers discovered the only thing that got her through the
grief and anger was tireless work on behalf of victims' rights, and
haunting the prime suspect in her son's death, a multi-convicted
felon who is presently on the lam again. w/art  S.K. Bardwell 
 
AUTOS  _ As part of its technology upgrades, the Harris County Tax
Assessor-Collector's Office will now allow county residents to
register their cars and trucks on the Internet. This will require
payment by credit card, but visits to the tax office or mailings
are no longer necessary. Joe Stinebaker.  
 
 RECORDS  _ The state Supreme Court ruled psychologists don't have
to reveal a child's mental health records to parents if it isn't in
the child's interests to do so. The decision overturns a court of
appeals' decision in a Houston case. The appeals court had ordered
a psychologist to divulge a child's records to a father.  Bill
Murphy  
 
 JAILDEATH  _ Court of Appeals affirmed a district court decision
that the family of an inmate who died at Harris County Jail has no
basis to sue the county for the man's death. The man, who suffered
from high-blood pressure, died after a doctor gave him cold
medicine that raised his blood pressure. The county can't be sued
because the doctor was an independent contractor, not a county
employee, the courts have said.  Bill Murphy  
 
 CRAWFORD  _ The family of tow truck driver Steven Hardin got some
satisfaction Friday when they saw his murderer hauled off to jail.
But it still angers the family that Houston firefighter Barry
Crawford will only spend six months behind bars as a condition of
the probated sentence given to him by jury in April 1998. Crawford
had appealed his sentence and the terms of probation couldn't be
enforced until his appeal was heard. That happened and state
District Judge Ted Poe laid down the strict conditions again for
Crawford. Reax from defense and family of victim, who is fighting
to change law that allows murderers without criminal records to be
eligible for probation. Developing.
 Steve Brewer  
 
 LARONIA  _ The wife of an ex-Houston police officer convicted of
rape pleaded guilty Friday to attacking her husband's victim after
he was sentenced to prison. Laronia Haywood was placed on probation
and given a very hard time in court by Judge Poe. Developing.
 Steve Brewer 
 
LIBRARY  _ Houston Public Library customers who are connected to
the Internet can forget about library hours for the next six
months. Twenty-four hour access to some 1,500 books is now
available electronically in a pilot program with netLibrary, a
provider of eBooks and an Internet-based content and collection
management service. Using the new service, any person with a
Houston Public Library card can gain access to an eBook, or
electronic book. w/art.  Raffat Rashid 
 
GENOME  _ In an attempt to secure patients' medical privacy in the
age of human genetic code mapping, Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston,
Thursday explained proposed legislation that would limit financial
institutions _ particularly those affiliated with insurance
companies _ from sharing information about a person's genetic code.
``If we can forecast from an individual's genes that he or she is
likely to get cancer or heart disease, how could this information
be used?'' Bentsen said. ``Unless we provide legislative
protections, employers could decide to save millions of dollars by
not hiring individuals likely to get sick.''  Kelly Pedersen  
 
 THAI  _ A guilty plea coming out of a federal case of an Asian
prostitution smuggling ring. Jo Ann Zuniga  
 
 METRO RAIL  - U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay is not likely to change his mind
about allowing the Metropolitan Transit Authority to receive
federal funds for a light rail line on Main Street, but the
powerful congressman will fight for the agency's other funding
requests for fiscal year 2001, Metro board members were told in a
briefing Friday. The board's main goals now are to protect funding
for its bus and HOV projects, get the rail line built by other
means, and persuade DeLay not to continue the rail funding ban into
future years. A hoped-for tool of persuasion will be a study of
regional congestion, to be funded by the Greater Houston
Partnership and performed by the traditionally pro-highway Texas
Transportation Institute at Texas A&AMP;M University. About 10 inches.

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ No matter who is president, the
church vs. state controversy will continue, especially after the
Supreme Court's ruling last month outlawing student-led prayers at
public high school football games. The next chapter could come when
the court decides, probably next year, on statutes, such as one
recently passed Virginia, that permit a moment of silence in public
classrooms. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (Filed Wednesday.)

WORLD BANK REJECTS CHINA RESETTLEMENT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under heavy pressure from the United States and
several other wealthy nations, the World Bank on Friday scrapped a
sensitive antipoverty project that critics argued might have
reinforced China's claims to Tibetan lands, said people informed of
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, part of which would have spent $40 million to resettle
58,000 ethnic Chinese in Qinghai province, an area once dominated
by nomadic Tibetan herders, divided some of the bank's leading
borrowers, including China, from several major donor nations,
including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has any World Bank project aroused as much internal
dissent and outside protest.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal became a test of the power of developing nations to
resist pressure from rich countries and some private lobbying
groups when allocating World Bank money. But it also tested the
bank's internal procedures for approving projects and the power of
rich donor nations to insist on strict compliance with those rules.
</P>
<P>
   An internal World Bank inspection panel reported last month that
the bank had violated its own guidelines when it approved the
Chinese proposal to aid poverty-stricken farmers in Qinghai. The
bank's board, which consists of both rich donor nations and poor
borrowers, ordered the inspection panel to examine how the project
was handled last year.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is a defeat for James D. Wolfensohn, the bank's
president, who had pushed the board to approve funding. Wolfensohn
favored the project despite efforts by the Clinton administration
to kill it. Clinton recently backed Wolfensohn for a second term as
World Bank president.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of
Tibet, who was born in the proposed resettlement region, have
argued that the World Bank would contribute to the Sinification of
the Tibetan region by agreeing to help move mostly Han Chinese
farmers into a largely unsettled area of western Qinghai, which
some Tibetans claim is part of their homeland. The Dalai Lama
called the project a ``source of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Several protesters from the Campaign for Tibet have camped out
in front of the bank's steel-and-glass headquarters in downtown
Washington for several days, calling for cancellation of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   But the main arguments inside the board's chambers were about
the World Bank's own procedures.
</P>
<P>
   China and other developing companies have argued that rich
nations are trying to dictate terms for loans based on political
considerations. Critics of the project, including the United
States, Japan and several European nations, argued that the bank
sometimes ignores its own guidelines for assessing the social,
political and environmental impact of loans to developing nations,
according to people involved in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The 160-page inspection panel report, a copy of which was
provided to The New York Times by a person critical of the project,
said the bank originally classified the project as needing a
relatively low level of review when in fact it should have required
the highest level of scrutiny. The report strongly implied that
China had intimidated bank managers to expedite approval.
</P>
<P>
   Because China's per capita income has risen rapidly, the Qinghai
project is the last antipoverty effort in that country eligible for
the bank's most subsidized loans.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials had argued that China has an excellent track
record of using World Bank loans to lift its people out of poverty.
They said that the Qinghai project, part of which would have moved
farmers who live in arid eastern Qinghai to irrigated lands in an
underpopulated part of the same province, was a sound way to better
the lives of a small number of desperately poor people.
</P>
<P>
   People who favored the project also argued that Qinghai, which
was part of China even before the 1951 Chinese invasion of Tibet,
is already predominantly Han Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said that Beijing is less interested in helping
poor people than in securing its historic claim to areas on the
Tibetan plateau. They said the project would serve to dilute
Tibetan influence in a rural part of Qinghai once inhabited largely
by roaming herdsman from Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like moving people from Denver to a native American
reservation in Colorado,'' said John Ackerly, president of the
International Campaign for Tibet, which has fought the project.
``This is an area where Tibetans have lived for generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Japan and the United Kingdom, among others,
were critical of the way the bank handled the project. They
demanded that if the project were to go forward, it should first be
subjected to a rigorous test of the social impact and then
resubmitted to the board for a new vote.
</P>
<P>
   China and Wolfensohn objected to those terms, arguing that the
bank could ensure proper compliance with its rules. When it became
clear that they did not have enough votes under the board's complex
voting structure to ensure that outcome, China withdrew the project
for consideration, people involved in the deliberation said.

&HT;     BRUCE WILLIS' KID FLICK: CALL `WHINE-1-1' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what will stand as the middle flick in the unofficial
yet-to-be-completed Bruce
Willis-and-small-metaphysically-gifted-boy trilogy, ``The Kid''
follows the ``The Sixth Sense,'' pitting Willis against another
problem child. This time the boy has wandered into Willis' fortress
of solitude from his childhood, and captures his heart in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   This being Disney's ``The Kid,'' look out that he doesn't walk
off with yours as well. In his Kevin Spacey-est role yet, Willis
plays Russell Duritz, a Los Angeles image consultant who cruises
around town concocting bogus but salable personas for the imperiled
and self-esteemless. Russell says things like ``somebody call the
wahbulance,'' which happens to be the movie's favorite line. And
it's not long before it seems unlikely that the makers will call
whine-1-1 on themselves. Russell is one of those grown-ups who,
through some boyhood tragedy starring his father, is divorced from
his sense of fun, his ability to love and his capacity for
humility. His childhood is way in the past _ you know, ``where it
belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pudgy little Rusty (Spencer Breslin) has mysteriously traveled
30 years into the future more or less to tell his older self ``ah
ah ah'' in the waning days before his 40th birthday. Breslin often
belts out his lines as if the script was written by Okeh records.
He's more charming than the film deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Russell, though, seems to grasp why the boy is there, so
they spend the duration of the film trying to get to the bottom of
this puppy, confounding women like administrative assistant Lily
Tomlin and sort-of girlfriend Emily Mortimer in the process. A
puzzle for them is all-too-evident to us. Russell is inexplicably
estranged from his father and sister, he has no wife and is an
unsparingly crotchety 39-year-old in navy blue power suits. If you
don't smell an allegory, you've accompanied your child on a
bathroom break.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Jon Turteltaub and written by Audrey Wells, ``The
Kid'' is self-satisfied: a dishonest baby-boomer melodrama of
inner-selfness and increased sensitivity for yuppie dads. Somehow,
young Rusty goes straight for the 39-year-old Russell and his first
midlife crisis, instantly disapproving of his impatient workaholic
bachelor status. What about the story of his first time, his first
bong hit and the story of those four piercings dotting Russell's
left ear? Surely it wasn't all poker-face moodiness.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, this being Disney at their most unapologetically
Disney, ``The Kid'' wields its Middle America values and moralistic
flogging of idiosyncratic lifestyle choices like a flipped bird.
(Matthew Perry commits a cameo as a shaggy hippie whom Willis says
must shed his growth in order to be taken seriously as a finance
guy.)
</P>
<P>
   It's friendly, but a flagrantly judgmental experience akin to
being accosted by a variety pack of Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormon
elders, Scientology majors, Jews for Jesus and Robert Bly fiends.
</P>
<P>
   There's no rest for a middle-aged white guy content to drift
through life. This is the kind of family-outing movie Fred
MacMurray made for Disney 40 years ago; this time, there's
finger-pointing and a score by Marc Shaiman that in itself thinks
it's good for you. It's some Randy Newman-John Williams prefab that
never stops, but simply shape-shifts from one form of schmaltz to
the next until you feel you've been transported to a medley of
score nominees at the Oscars. That's too bad. At least the Academy
provides more schmaltzy music to drown out the speechifying.
Where's a wahbulance when you need one?

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Shameful battle rages for hallowed
ground
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICKSBURG, Va. _ During the Civil War, four battles were
fought here for the control of this strategic area. Another one is
under way.
</P>
<P>
   These battlefields _ chief among them, Chancellorsville _ are
considered the bloodiest ground in all of North America, ``the
cockpit of the Civil War,'' says Robert K. Krick, chief historian
for the Fredericksburg and Spotslvania National Military Park.
</P>
<P>
   As costly as it was in lives, today the land is even costlier,
property values being what they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hallowed ground is going to be full of townhouses if we
don't do something to protect it,'' Krick said.
</P>
<P>
   This time the threat isn't federal troops. It's a new federal
highway bypass, creating yet another ``epicenter for nacho parlors
and tanning spas,'' Krick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine,'' he said. ``A whole corridor through undeveloped
country. That's a lot of convenience stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Krick, 56, a veteran of 33 years with the park service and
author of 12 Civil War books, is hoping otherwise. Through the work
of both private and government sources, efforts are under way to
raise funds to preserve the battlefields that so many soldiers,
North and South, died fighting for.
</P>
<P>
   The National Trust for Historic Preservation agrees that a
crisis exists. Last year, it listed this area among the 11 most
endangered sites in North America.
</P>
<P>
   You can see it along the highways approaching Fredericksburg.
For all its history, the outer city looks like any other in
America, surrounded as it is by strip mall after strip mall.
</P>
<P>
   Not until you reach downtown do you find the historic
Fredericksburg that George Washington knew as a boy. Here,
according to legend, young Washington sailed the dollar across the
Rappahannock River, 420 feet, and chopped down the cherry tree but
couldn't lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, this is Civil War country, located as it is
midway along the 100 miles that separate Washington, D.C., and
Richmond, Va., the capitol of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting for this area began early in the war. The effort to
preserve the battlefields came late. Not until the 1920s did the
government begin buying strips for roads that follow those sites.
</P>
<P>
   What sites they are!
</P>
<P>
   There is the spot among the pines where Robert E. Lee and
Stonewall Jackson met for the last time, on the eve of the battle
of Chancellorsville, the first week of May, 1863.
</P>
<P>
   Here it was agreed that Jackson should take the mass of their
force, 30,000 troops, and circle to the West, flanking the Union
Army of some 80,000 and _ in perhaps the Confederacy's greatest
victory of the war -- sending the Yanks fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   On hearing the disastrous reports from the battlefield,
President Lincoln was beside himself. ``My God, my God,'' he
moaned. ``What will the country say? What will the country say?''
</P>
<P>
   But with the South's victory also came its greatest individual
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, shot by mistake by his own men during a night
reconnaissance, first had to have his left arm amputated and then
developed pneumonia. He died May 10.
</P>
<P>
   The outbuilding where he spent those final few days _ a small
office located behind a plantation that was serving as a
Confederate hospital _ is still here, though the plantation house
is gone. Tourists can see his death bed and the shroud that covered
him.
</P>
<P>
   The very first tourist, history notes, was Gen. Ulysses S.
Grant, who stopped here in 1864 to pay his respects. Britain's
leader in World War I, David Lloyd George, on visiting the site,
said: ``Here, too , died the Confederacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's Jackson's last words that are best remembered.
</P>
<P>
   As the delirium of the fever passed away and a calm relief
seemed to settle over him, he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us cross over the river,''he said, ``and rest under the
shade of the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   To which I would only add the words of historian Krick,
surveying the prospects of encroaching urban development:
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people need to get their poodles trimmed somewhere, but
why on this battlefield?''
</P>

SWISS GIVE ISRAELI SPY ONE-YEAR SUSPENDED SENTENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Switzerland's top court found an Israeli
spy guilty of espionage Friday and gave him a one-year suspended
sentence for his part in a botched 1998 wiretap attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The court, the Swiss Federal Tribunal, also barred the man,
known only by an alias, Issac Bental, from Switzerland for five
years. The sentence means he will not serve any time in jail and
can return to Israel, an outcome welcomed in a statement issued by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The wiretapping mission occurred in February 1998, as Swiss
officials were in negotiations with American Jewish groups over the
bank accounts of Holocaust victims languished in Swiss banks for 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the agent trying to install electronic
eavesdropping equipment to bug the apartment of a Lebanese-born car
dealer suspected by Mossad, the Israeli spy agency, of having links
to the anti-Israel Hezbollah movement in Lebanon was an
embarrassment for Israel and the agency. Four other people were
apprehended with him but were released, the police said, because
there was no evidence they were engaged in any illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had to pay nearly $2 million in bail to guarantee that
the agent would return for trial. In an unheard-of concession,
Swiss justice officials allowed him to use an assumed name for
trial on grounds that disclosing his real one would endanger his
life. The agent, a short man with closely cropped hair, sat
undisguised in open court during the four-day trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the agent was spying, conducting illegal
activity on behalf of a foreign country and using forged identity
papers _ charges the agent admitted were true.
</P>
<P>
   His Swiss lawyers, who also did not know his true identity,
urged acquittal because, they said, he was carrying out his
assigned duty of preventing terrorist attacks against Israel.
Prosecutors urged a 15-month prison sentence, and argued there had
been no immediate danger to Israel because investigators had found
nothing to link the car dealer, Abdallah el-Zein, with militant
actions by Hezbollah. Zein, who runs a center supporting Shiite
Islamic beliefs, also testified that he had not taken part in any
extremist activity against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The five-judge tribunal convicted the agent on all three
charges, with the chief judge calling his actions an
``intolerable'' violation of Switzerland's sovereignty. The judge
said that the punishment was commensurate with that given in other
spy cases.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there was speculation that Swiss and Israeli
authorities had cut a deal for a light sentence to avoid further
diplomatic strains. Israeli radio reported that Mossad agents were
angry that one from their ranks had to submit to trial in a foreign
country.

&HT;     INVESTMENT MANAGER PLEADS GUILTY IN FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An investment manager has pleaded guilty to
securities fraud in the operation of a hedge fund that allegedly
cost his investors nearly $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Timothy Higgins, 36, of San Anselmo, admitted Thursday
that he lied about the performance of Ballybunion Capital Partners
and provided false documents to lure investors between November
1998 and April of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said Higgins raised over $7.6 million by
telling investors the fund was making impressive gains. The fund's
assets had dropped to $750,000 by March of this year, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Nanci Clarence said Higgins based the fund's
investment strategy on his belief that the technology stock bubble
would soon burst. When that failed to happen as quickly as he
thought, he misrepresented the fund's returns in hopes of
recovering its losses, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all accounts he has led an exemplary life and this is the
only transgression,'' Clarence said.
</P>
<P>
   A hedge fund is a private, largely unregulated investment
partnership, which caters to wealthy investors and often adopts
strategies that allow it to profit when the market drops.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement requires Higgins to make his best efforts to
repay his investors. Clarence said federal sentencing guidelines
call for a term of 33 to 41 months in prison, but she will ask U.S.
District Judge William Alsup for a lower sentence. Sentencing is
scheduled Dec. 7.

 &HT;    EVEN HAPPY PEOPLE HAVE MOSTLY BAD DREAMS, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's apparently no escape for the stresses of
life, even while you're asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people generally have more negative dreams than positive
dreams,'' said Mark Blagrove, vice president for the Association of
the Study of Dreams and co-author of a new report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although our study found that people who were happy had more
positive dreams than people who are unhappy, happy people still
have more negative dreams than positive ones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blagrove issued his study at the International Conference for
the Association for the Study of Dreams here this week.
</P>
<P>
   Nightmares and other bad dreams can be caused by negative waking
emotions, such as stress, anxiety, fear and sadness, Blagrove said.
He added that traumatic experiences, such as divorce or surgery,
can also lead to more frequent nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   A separate 1998 study also found that there is a connection
between particular negative emotions, such as fear and sadness, and
bad dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, co-authored by Cerri Price of the University of
Wales Swansea, also found that older people have more bad dreams,
but Blagrove couldn't offer a definite explanation for this
finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be because older people wake up more when they are
sleeping, and that would lead to them remembering more of their bad
dreams,'' Blagrove said. ``But it also could be that older people
simply have more bad dreams than younger people, which is
surprising because young children seem to have a lot of
nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the study were rated on the frequency that they
could recall their past dreams, Blagrove said. The average rate of
recall was 2.4 dreams per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our results have implications on whether dreams mirror the
full range of waking emotions or are instead more responsive to
negative emotions or challenges and threats,'' Blagrove said. ``And
we found that people, even those who consider themselves happy,
tend to have more bad dreams than good ones.''

could recall their past dreams, Blagrove said. The average rate of
recall was 2.4 dreams per week.

   ``Our results have implications on whether dreams mirror the
full range of waking emotions or are instead more responsive to
negative emotions or challenges and threats,'' Blagrove said. ``And
we found that people, even those who consider themselves happy,
tend to have more bad dreams than good ones.''

WOOING AS FAST AS THEY CAN TO LAND HILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture the Knicks' Scott Layden, the Nets' Rod Thorn, Miami's
Pat Riley, San Antonio's Gregg Popovich and Chicago's Jerry Krause
standing in a hotel lobby making small talk while each nervously
awaits his turn to speak with the coveted Grant Hill. The goings-on
in Detroit this week have not been that dramatic, but that is
essentially what is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from those five teams visited Hill this week to
attempt to sell the Detroit Pistons star on their franchise.
</P>
<P>
   With Hill having all but slipped into an Orlando Magic uniform
after last weekend's visit to Disney World, the extra efforts may
be wasted time, but even in the National Basketball Association,
teams must give it that old college try.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful,'' said an official from a team that recently
met with Hill. ``We're obviously hoping that the reports of him
going to Orlando are not true. We want him to take his time to make
a decision. He owes it to himself and his family to take a long,
hard look at his options.''
</P>
<P>
   Options abound for the five-time All-Star, who will likely turn
his team of choice into an immediate conference contender. The
Knicks met with Hill in a suburb of Detroit on Wednesday, and the
San Antonio Spurs met with him later that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, a surprise entry in the Hill sweepstakes, made their
pitch Thursday morning, and Miami and Chicago are believed to have
met with Hill Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of those teams is a long shot to land Hill, who has
stated publicly that he is ``leaning strongly'' toward signing with
Orlando. Proof of his preference for the Magic is the fact that he
flew to Orlando on Saturday and went house hunting with his wife,
Tamia, on Monday. Unlike everyone else, the Magic did not have to
run to Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great, but it will feel greater when we _ if we _ can
sign him on Aug. 1,'' Orlando General manager John Gabriel said
Thursday of the privilege his team was afforded. ``We expected
there would be interviews by all of the candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Knicks to acquire Hill, a sign-and-trade deal most
likely involving Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby would have to be
worked. What is unfounded is the talk of the Knicks' signing Hill
for the $2.25 million midlevel exception and then giving him a
maximum money contract the next season. The Knicks will not have
the salary cap room to make such an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Layden and Coach Jeff Van Gundy confirmed that they had met with
Hill but would not comment. The Knicks are hoping to get him to
visit New York soon, but no date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who are in the process of revamping their franchise,
would also have to work a sign-and-trade deal for Hill. Keith Van
Horn would likely be involved, and the Nets would also have to
throw in a couple of other players, perhaps Jamie Feick and Elliot
Perry, to satisfy base-year compensation rules.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio and Miami are in similar situations. Both offered
Hill the $2.25 million exception for this season and then will be
in position to give him a six-year contract worth at least $90
million next season. Several players around the league have said
that Hill's top priority is playing with a top-flight big man; both
San Antonio and Miami would qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, of course, are hoping to keep Tim Duncan from going
to Orlando, and though he denies it, Hill's decision may hinge on
Duncan's. If Duncan decides to go to Orlando, Hill will almost
certainly join him there. If Duncan stays in San Antonio, Hill may
decide to play with Duncan in San Antonio or to play for Riley and
with Alonzo Mourning in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, despite its ability to pay Hill a maximum money
contract this year, is perhaps the longest shot of them all. But
the Bulls, whom Duncan apparently is not even considering, placed
their bid as well.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS ...
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have little chance of obtaining BRIAN GRANT from the
Portland Trail Blazers, a person with knowledge of the teams'
discussions said. The Blazers were not interested in the Knicks'
offer of MARCUS CAMBY and CHRIS CHILDS and the Knicks are not
willing to give up either LATRELL SPREWELL or ALLAN HOUSTON, one of
whom Portland wants, to obtain Grant ... Two league officials said
the Knicks spoke with the Los Angeles Clippers about MAURICE
TAYLOR, but a deal is unlikely because the teams can not agree on
the players for a trade ... The Nets are looking to sign the
Orlando shooting guard RON MERCER as a free agent with the $3.8
million disabled player exception they are expected to receive for
JAYSON WILLIAMS' retirement.

(For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By ALEX BERENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Worried about corporate profits?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be.
</P>
<P>
   Confession season arrived last week, as it does every quarter,
as predictable as rain in April or ozone alerts in July, with a
parade of companies giving Wall Street their sorry earnings news,
scaring traders who should know better.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-luck cases this time included Informix, BMC Software
and other companies whose names have never crossed most investors'
lips, with the possible exception of Computer Associates, an
Islandia, N.Y.-based software company known only too well for the
gargantuan pay packages it lavishes on its top executives. The news
from Computer Associates and BMC helped send down the Nasdaq
composite index more than 3 percent on Wednesday, though it
recovered its losses by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   But forget the losers. Think about the dogs that did not bark,
the companies that did not preannounce bad news last week.
Hewlett-Packard? Nope. Microsoft, Pfizer, Wal-Mart Stores? Uh-uh,
uh-uh, uh-uh. Exxon Mobil? Cisco Systems? Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   For them, no news likely means good news, because companies that
do not preannounce shortfalls nearly always meet or beat analysts'
forecasts when they do report their earnings. And with only a few
days to go before most publicly traded companies are due to report
their profits for the second quarter, earnings warnings are down
substantially, compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
   So profits are likely to be way up, according to Charles Hill,
research director for First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks
corporate earnings and analysts' forecasts. Hill says analysts are
expecting year-over-year earnings growth of 19.3 percent for the
quarter for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies. He figures that
the real growth rate will be closer to 23 or 24 percent, because
analysts typically give companies a bit of room to beat their
estimates. Those increases come on top of gains in the first
quarter, when earnings at S&AMP;P 500 companies rose 23.7 percent, and
in 1999, when earnings soared 18 percent, the best rate in five
years. By comparison, the long-term earnings growth rate for big
publicly traded companies has averaged just 7 percent over the last
two generations, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a pretty mild preannouncement season, he said.
There's no reason for people to be overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is likely to continue, at least until the end of
the year. Joseph Kalinowski, equity strategist for IBES
International, which also tracks earnings forecasts, said analysts
were still raising their estimates for third- and fourth-quarter
profits. ``I think we're going to be in for a good second
quarter,'' Kalinowski said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the engines that have powered the stock market's
decade-long boom are still largely intact. Capital spending on
technology remains strong worldwide, and although increases in
short-term interest rates and oil prices have slowed U.S. growth
slightly, consumer confidence remains high, and inflation appears
mild.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors have combined to push operating earnings for the
S&AMP;P 500 from $32.68 a share in 1994 to an estimated $57.70 this
year, Hill said. In 2001, analysts are expecting earnings to rise
an additional 15 percent, to $66.65. If that optimistic forecast
comes true, it will mean that earnings at America's biggest
companies will have more than doubled in seven years, an impressive
feat.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, investors have bid up stock prices even faster over
the last seven years, so that by many measures stocks are fully
valued. But with inflation quiet, bonds solid and the federal
government running a huge surplus, the continuing strong growth in
earnings is another piece of good news for investors hoping to get
through the summer doldrums intact.

AN OPPORTUNITY IN RISING RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By CAROLE GOULD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For fixed-income investors, there appears to be a silver lining
in the cloud of rising interest rates: Buying opportunities among
closed-end municipal bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their particular structure, closed-end funds were
affected by higher rates in several ways _ leaving many at
attractive prices.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares, which may trade
at a discount or a premium to their net asset value. Moreover,
closed-end municipal funds often leverage their portfolios by
issuing short-term preferred stock at a low rate and reinvesting
the proceeds in longer-term issues with higher yields. So fund
investors in leveraged bond funds fetch higher yields than they
would in nonleveraged portfolios when interest rates are falling.
</P>
<P>
   But because long-term issues are generally more vulnerable to
rising rates than shorter-term debt, the leverage tends to backfire
when rates kick up, as they have been doing recently. That has made
it difficult for some closed-end bond funds to maintain their
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the only issue weighing on closed-end muni funds.
Many of them were started in the early 1990s, and the call
protection on bonds they bought then has begun to expire. Call
protection prevents issuers from refinancing existing bonds,
protecting bondholders' yields for a fixed period, typically 10
years; as these higher-yielding bonds are called, many funds are
replacing them with lower-yielding alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of factors has prompted many of the funds to
reduce dividends. The cuts began after the Federal Reserve began
nudging up short-term interest rates last year, and the pace of the
reductions accelerated sharply last month.
</P>
<P>
   In June, all nine of the Eaton Vance closed-end municipal bond
funds cut their dividends by 10 to 12 percent. Soon thereafter,
Nuveen Investments reduced dividends on 43 of its 59 municipal bond
funds. Over all, 66 closed-end municipal bond funds cut dividends
in June, according to Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, closed-end fund
specialists in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But that is where the buying opportunity comes in. Dividend cuts
worry shareholders, who typically react by selling shares.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the selling pressure depresses share prices in two
waves: One comes several days after the announcement of the
dividend cut, and the other comes several months later, when
investors who did not hear the announcement receive smaller
dividend checks.
</P>
<P>
   What investors often fail to understand, Herzfeld said, is that
because bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices, the
sales have the effect of pushing up yields on closed-end bond
funds. A result is that yields are now roughly equal to what they
were before the latest round of dividend cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Putnam Investment Grade Municipal Trust cut its monthly
dividends 8 cents a share on June 4, when shares traded at $12.625,
roughly a 22 percent premium to net asset value. The annual
dividend before the cut was 96 cents a share, and it yielded 7.6
percent. A week later, the share price dropped to 9.75, or a 7
percent discount. At that point, the fund's yield was 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson for investors is to evaluate closed-end bond holdings
closely. If you find that a fund holds bonds yielding more than 10
percent, check to see if the call protection will soon expire.
</P>
<P>
   Also find out if net income per share is falling short of
current dividends. In either case, the fund may be a candidate for
a dividend cut and may be ripe for a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, you could consider buying shares of funds that have
recently cut dividends and that trade for discounts of 10 or 15
percent or more, Herzfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   A Roster of Value All-Stars
</P>
<P>
   Litman/Gregory Fund Advisors of Orinda, Calif., is known for
putting together all-star funds _ portfolios divided among
successful, well-known outside fund managers. Masters' Select
Equity, for example, is managed by seven domestic fund managers
overseeing six portfolios, while Masters' Select International is
managed by five managers of five foreign stock portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Now previously beleaguered value managers are getting their
turn, as Litman/Gregory introduces the Masters' Select Value. The
managers are Mason Hawkins of Longleaf Partners, William Miller of
the Legg Mason Value Trust, Bill Nygren of the Oakmark fund and
Larry Sondike of the Franklin Mutual Series funds.
</P>
<P>
   Each manager will assemble a portfolio of 8 to 15 stocks, mainly
in mid- and large-capitalization American stocks. The minimum
investment is $5,000, and $1,000 for individual retirement
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All four managers use a value approach to stock-picking,
looking for companies whose stocks they deem undervalued,'' said
Craig Litman, director of Litman/Gregory. ``But each of them has a
slightly different idea of what constitutes value.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins and Miller are two of the seven managers of the flagship
Masters' Select Equity, which has returned 21.7 percent,
annualized, from its inception at the end of 1996 through June 30,
compared with 19.7 percent for its category of large blend funds
and 23.1 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index,
according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly Disclosure Sought
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds should be required to disclose to investors on a
quarterly basis the fees charged to their individual accounts, the
General Accounting Office said in a report to Congress last week.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said the Securities and Exchange Commission should draft
rules instructing mutual funds to include in quarterly reports the
specific dollar amount of each investor's share of operating
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation was contained in a report requested by Reps.
Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, and chairman of the House Commerce
subcommittee on finance, and John D. Dingell, D-Mich., and a
ranking member of the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the SEC, Oxley and
Dingell urged him to ``take the necessary steps'' to put the
report's recommendations into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors deserve to know exactly what they are paying for
mutual fund services on a regular basis,'' Oxley said in a
statement. ``You shouldn't have to have a degree in high finance to
figure out whether your mutual fund is giving you a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund fees paid by investors include the day-to-day costs
of running a fund, called operating expenses. Also, some mutual
funds charge investors sales charges, called ``loads,'' which can
be paid at the time of purchase or over a specific period or when
shares are redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   Current disclosure practices inform investors only of the fees
they are likely to incur, Oxley said. Specifically, the disclosures
list only percentages of fees and hypothetical examples in
prospectuses, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual fund industry organization, the Investment Co.
Institute, responded that mutual funds already make extensive
disclosures about fees and that funds compete on the basis of
performance, according to comments included in the GAO report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reservations about the account statement
recommendation,'' Matthew Fink, president of the Investment Co.
Institute, said in a letter to Thomas McCool, the GAO's director of
financial institutions and market issues. ``This requirement could
erode the value of the standardized, all-inclusive fee information
in the prospectus.'' The letter said such a rule could ``diminish
rather than enhance investors' overall understanding of fund
fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry researchers are concerned that although the fund
industry has been growing rapidly, funds themselves are not
operating more efficiently and fees are not declining enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth in the mutual fund industry has been powerful,
particularly in the last decade,'' Oxley said. ``This growth gives
mutual fund companies economies of scale, and investors ought to
know whether these benefits are being passed on to them.''

EDITOR TAKES LEAP TO WEB, AND PETS' WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Let's skip the gamut of canine cliches _ ``he's gone
to the dogs'' keeps trotting to mind _ and cut to the reaction that
Arthur J. Browne's wife had when Browne, until last Friday the
senior managing editor of The Daily News, told her that he was
thinking about surrendering his 27-year tenure to join
PetPlace.com, an Internet start-up dedicated to pet health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the dog has driven you crazy!'' howled Gretchen
Browne, director of the Rockville Centre Public Library and
Browne's spouse since 1973, the year he signed on as a Daily News
copy boy for $119 a week plus tips (those were the days when copy
boys fetched food and drink for reporters in addition to
hot-footing copy from typewriter to typesetter; Browne recalls them
fondly because they stoked a romance for the newsroom that cured
his post-adolescent apathy).
</P>
<P>
   Regarding that perceived threat to his sanity, the dog is a
15-month-old yellow Labrador retriever, Grady, Browne's jogging
companion (most mornings they do a five-mile swing through
Hempstead Lakes State Park near their home in Rockville Centre in
Long Island), stress reducer, and yes, his unofficial consultant.
</P>
<P>
   When Browne, who often converses with Grady as they chug along,
solicited the dog's take on the quantum career leap that presented
itself in June, three months after he was _ again _ passed over for
promotion to editor in chief, he's sure the dog said, ``Go for it,
dude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That dog has changed my life,'' Browne, 49, admitted Wednesday
afternoon as he cleaned out his corner office, retaining just a few
framed front pages (``My Secret Life With Bill'' and ``Farewell
Yankee Clipper'' were keepers). ``But he's not the reason I'm
leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the newspaper install and discard top editors, none of
them him, four times in the last four years, was the reason.
Besides noticing that his head hit a glass ceiling once he became
senior managing editor two years ago, Browne felt it was only a
matter of time before he wore out his welcome with whatever
hierarchy came next. And the wheel, as he says, keeps on turning at
The News: ``I'm just like a piece of furniture that's always been
there that's not there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Choice metaphor, Browne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fortunate to have lived through all the changes, but any
rational person in my place would question if that was going to
hold forever,'' said Browne, who survived nine regimes, made
enemies when he kept the paper going in the 1990 strike, but had a
reputation as a square-shooter with a clear sense of the paper's
role with its readers.
</P>
<P>
   As for his role on the editorial staff, which was unprecedented
in its longevity, Browne said, ``You serve at the pleasure of the
editor and publisher, and at some point some person is likely to
say, `I don't want Arthur Browne around,' so better to go out
standing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, he informed Edward Kosner, the newest editor in
chief, and Mortimer Zuckerman, the publisher, of his resignation in
a brief meeting with no negotiations or recriminations. He did not
tell them that he was following Kosner's predecessor, Debby Krenek
(her two-year stint as editor of The News ended acrimoniously) to
PetPlace.com, where she is the chief creative officer and he (at
last!) is editor in chief. He just said his decision was
``irrevocable,'' and money or catchy titles wouldn't change it.
</P>
<P>
   He did not even give the standard two weeks' notice. Not that he
burned his bridge to The News, but he did burn rubber as he crossed
it: resigned on Friday, took a four-day weekend in Cutchogue,
cleared out of his office on Wednesday, announced his affiliation
with PetPlace.com, and the site's affiliation with America Online,
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could be jumping out of an airplane without a parachute for
all I know,'' Browne said. ``It's time to do something radically
different.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Browne wasn't always the enterprising, button-down
guy in the corner office, the up-and-comer who worked days in the
Queens bureau and earned a 1978 St. John's law degree by night to
make himself a better investigative reporter, not a lawyer: radical
was his middle name in his teens.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brooklyn, he grew up in Freeport on Long Island, with
two better-behaved siblings and patient parents. He attended a
Jesuit high school but went haywire the summer he was 15: wrecked
the family's new car, sank the family boat, and when he couldn't
find any other capitalist trappings to trash, set fire to his
bedroom. ``If my kids did that to me, I don't know what I'd do,''
mused Browne, who has four.
</P>
<P>
   He grew his hair to his shoulders, went to Woodstock and,
terrified of the draft and Vietnam, allowed his parents to drop him
off at Boston College, from which he emerged in 1972 with an
English degree but no career clues. He was a lifeguard, bummed
around Europe, and then, at 22, went to The Daily News, which had
impressed him at 10 when he visited a relative who worked there, to
ask for a copy boy position while he figured out a real career step
elsewhere. The editor who hired him told him that he'd be better
off, with his nice suit and college degree, going straight to Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me copy boys never get promoted to reporter, that
there was no career in it for me,'' said Browne, who proved him
wrong within a year and kept it up for a quarter century. He's
hoping for something similar at PetPlace.com.

   Remember junk bonds?
</P>
<P>
   They were the play stuff of Michael Milken, the mother's milk of
the 1980s leveraged-buyout craze and eventually a symbol of that
decade's decadence.
</P>
<P>
   This year, junk bonds, also known as high-yield bonds, have
posted some of their worst performance in almost a decade. A total
of $7.92 billion flowed out of junk-bond funds from January through
May this year, according to estimates by AMG Data Services, a fund
tracker in Arcada, Calif. They returned a negative 0.32 percent on
average last quarter and negative 1.4 percent over the last 12
months, according to Morningstar Inc. For the five years through
June 30, the funds' average annualized return was just 6.5 percent,
only half a percentage point more than long-term government bond
funds. So far this year, investors who crave the extra yield of
junk are actually worse off than they would have been in
Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost feel like an ostracized asset class,'' said Peter
Andersen, portfolio manager of the Conseco High Yield fund. The
sector's returns have previously fallen two years in a row, he
said, but ``now we're entering our third year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investor is saying: `I'd be better off putting my money
somewhere else, like a CD,''' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Problems arose for junk bonds in the Asian financial crisis of
1997 and 1998, as collapsing demand for shipping, paper and oil on
the Pacific Rim pummeled those sectors and led to bond defaults.
About the same time, junk was also becoming a crucial source of
financing for risky technology, telecommunications and Internet
companies; when the default rate began rising last year, investors
fled junk bonds for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the high-yield market really didn't finance
technology companies,'' said Martin Fridson, senior high-yield
strategist at Merrill Lynch. ``Portfolio managers preferred
companies that had established cash flows, so that recoveries were
likely to be high if a company failed.'' By contrast, he said,
there is little chance of recovering anything if a technology
start-up with no revenue defaults.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, the Federal Reserve's efforts to head off
inflation with increases in short-term interest rates have forced
junk bonds to move in lock step to maintain an attractive spread.
</P>
<P>
   The spread is the interest premium that investors demand to
compensate for the greater risk of default or interruption of
interest payments. When yields on investment grade bonds rise,
junk-bond prices must fall to keep their yields at an appetizing
altitude above them.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a typical bond rated a notch or two below investment
grade yielded 10.05 percent, or 426 basis points _ hundredths of a
percentage point _ above the 5.79 percent to be had on a 10-year
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Fed has pushed up short-term rates by 175 basis
points, and junk-bond yields have had to follow, with that same
typical bond's yield climbing to 11.81 percent. Longer-term
government rates have not risen nearly as much as short-term rates,
so the spread over 10-year Treasuries has widened considerably, to
577 basis points.
</P>
<P>
   The implication of all that arithmetic is that junk-bond prices
have fallen much more sharply than long-term government bond
prices, as is evident in the performance of the funds that hold
these bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of default on junk bonds has also worsened lately and
is unusually high for good economic times. Today, 18 percent of
junk bonds are considered distressed, meaning that default is a
real possibility, Fridson said. That is the highest rate since
January 1992, when 22.3 percent were called distressed.
</P>
<P>
   A rising default rate is bad for bond prices, of course, so
holders of junk bonds suffer, just as they do when spreads over
Treasuries widen. But the allure for new buyers is increasing. ``We
think the high-yield market is attractively valued and that the
high default rate is priced in,'' said Tom Price, co-portfolio
manager of the Strong High-Yield Bond fund, which has returned 0.75
percent this year. ``Those credits that have been struggling have
been taken out to the woodshed, and if they default, it won't
affect the overall rate.''
</P>
<P>
   One difficulty in analyzing the junk-bond outlook is in
measuring the default rate with precision. Experts differ markedly
on how to go about it. Moody's Investors Service includes the
high-yield debt of developing nations, as well as convertible
bonds, which are often below investment grade; it draws the bearish
conclusion that defaults will worsen in coming months. But Sam
DeRosa Farag, director of global high-yield portfolio strategy for
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, argues that including those asset
classes skews the default rates upward, and that investors should
look at the domestic corporate high-yield market by itself.
Donaldson's forecast is for falling default rates.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is important for investors, because the junk-bond
market is extremely cyclical, and the payoffs for those who call
the bottom accurately can be big.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a quiet storm about this, and most indicators are
that the worst isn't over,'' said David Hamilton, an analyst at
Moody's risk-management services. ``There is still a large
proportion out there at risk of defaulting.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody's version of the default rate for speculative-grade issues
was 5.4 percent for the 12 months ended May 31, more than three
times the 1.5 percent in the same period three years earlier. By
June 2001, Moody's expects the default rate for the trailing 12
months to peak at 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty big deal,'' said Hamilton, who estimated that
junk-bond downgrades outnumbered upgrades by three to one in the
first quarter of this year. Defaults have been widely distributed
among industry sectors, he said, though price-sensitive commodity
and shipping companies were among the first to default on their
junk debt in the first quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, DeRosa Farag said, returns and defaults have
tended to reach peaks together. ``There is this assumption that if
default rates go up, the returns are going to be poor,'' he said.
``But the historical pattern is that whenever defaults peak, this
is when we have the best returns ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Junk bonds are now ``attractively valued,'' he said, because the
average issue is trading at less than 85 cents per dollar of face
value, the lowest rate since July 1991. He attributed last year's
surge in defaults to the 1997-98 Asian woes, conditions that have
since eased; by his estimation, the default rate is now falling
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever view best describes the bigger picture, an important
day-to-day issue bothers the junk-bond market: Liquidity. Junk-bond
funds have experienced cash outflows in 18 of the last 23 weeks,
according to AMG. ``Week after week of outflows from the funds is
an insurmountable barrier'' to a recovery in prices, said Fridson,
at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   So there may be a glint of light in the figures for the last
three weeks, which show the flow turning positive. Some hardy
investors may be responding anew to the siren call of those fat
yields.

<P>
   WEDDING-PHOTO-OP (New York) _ The brides were tacking in white
satin, trains billowing, veils lofting like the topsails of the
Tall Ships entering New York harbor. A Salvadoran bridal party
sailed toward a Custard Beach outlet, breaking through a throng of
tourists gathered for the 18th Annual Brown family reunion. The
setting for this odd apparition was the World Financial Center's
Winter Garden. This sort of thing takes place here all the time;
the midpoints of winter and summer are high season for wedding
photography in this vast lobby, a de facto chapel of love that also
happens to be a corporate headquarters for Dow Jones and others. By
Patricia A. Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   BERGDORF-BOOKSELLER (New York) _ Tucked all the way in the back
of the top floor at Bergdorf Goodman is a book-filled nook titled
Jane Stubbs. And tucked behind the stacks of rare and vintage books
is a woman tucked behind an enormous shirt and thick glasses, with
the milky complexion of an attic-dwelling bookworm who seems
perennially startled at the notion of visitors. One shopper,
surveying the mounds of books jumbled on tables and ladders and
chairs, spotted her and asked, ``Do you ever look through them?''
Stubbs, 42, peered at her nervously. ``Oh, goodness, it's what I do
all the time ... It's my life's mission to uncover the flotsam and
jetsam of the publishing world and force people to have libraries
of same. It tickles me so much.'' By Alex Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   SHOP-NATASHA-LYONNE (New York) _ Natasha Lyonne sat on a bench
outside a coffee bar near her studio apartment, shuddering slightly
even in the 90 degree heat. She was detoxing from Hollywood.
``Welcome to breakfast,'' said the 21-year-old actress whose quirky
performances in `Slums of Beverly Hills,` `American Pie,` and `But
I'm a Cheerleader,` which opened this weekend, have marked her as
the New York doppleganger of such plump-lipped ingenues as Neve
Campbell and Jennifer Love Hewitt, a sort of anti-starlet. By Nancy
Hass.
</P>
<P>
   FAKE-HANDBAGS (Undated) _ A look at a new breed of sidewalk
shopper: consumers of evident style and means who can afford to pay
retail but enjoy the thrill of adding a $30 counterfeit or two to
their wardrobes. Where the shoppers stooping to inspect street
merchandise were once mainly office workers and tourists, now they
are as likely to be chic passers-by, clutching a genuine Prada
shoulder bag style or a tote emblazoned with real Gucci double G's.

<P>
   There were swoons and rebounds, and then more again of the same.
But by the end of the second quarter, the stock market had provided
enough bad news to push every major category of U.S. diversified
equity funds into negative territory for the period. Over all,
domestic diversified stock funds lost 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What funds managed to shine as stormy weather lashed the
markets? Generally, the winners owned shares in companies in
old-economy sectors, like oil and gas, as well as in health care
and some financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Managers of three top-performing funds talked about the
resurgence of once-beaten-down sectors and what they expect from
the stock market during the remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by a U-Turn
</P>
<P>
   Cheap, small stocks propelled the $262.7 million Ariel fund into
second place among funds for the quarter, with a return of 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stocks were so extraordinarily cheap at the beginning of
the quarter that they were really poised to move up sharply,'' said
its manager, John W. Rogers Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, 42, looks for companies that sell for a discount of at
least 40 percent to their private market value (what they would be
worth to an acquirer), and whose shares trade at less than 14 times
projected earnings for the next year. The fund holds just 35
issues.
</P>
<P>
   One big winner was Central Newspapers of Phoenix, owner of The
Arizona Republic, The Indianapolis Star and other papers.
``Newspapers are cheap because investors are worrying about the
impact of the Internet,'' Rogers said, ``and publishers worry about
rising paper prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's share price was so depressed, he added, that
management put the business up for sale. Last month, Gannett agreed
to buy it for $2.6 billion; the stock rose 89 percent for the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Another holding, Hussmann International of St. Louis, agreed to
be acquired during the quarter by Ingersoll-Rand for a premium of
more than 100 percent, Rogers said. The company makes refrigeration
equipment for supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an industry that no one cared about earlier in the year,
when people were enamored of dot-com companies,'' he said. ``And it
missed a few quarters' earnings, which gave people an excuse to
neglect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers also made money on Littelfuse, the fund's only technology
stock. The company, based in Des Plaines, Ill., is a leading
provider of miniature electrical fuses for the automobile industry;
it recently began making fuses for cell phones, personal digital
assistants and other electronic devices. The stock rose 33.6
percent in the quarter, helped by improving earnings and the move
into the new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Rogers sees more gains for small- and
mid-capitalization value stocks, even after their second-quarter
sprint. ``So many boards of directors and CEO's are saying that the
stock price of their company doesn't reflect the value of the
business,'' he said, ``and they're taking steps to realize that
value.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy and Health Care Bets
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. von der Linde took the No. 13 place for the quarter
with his $456.4 million Lord Abbett Mid-Cap Value fund, with a gain
of 8.4 percent. ``As the market broadens out and diversifies away
from large-cap growth stocks,'' said von der Linde, 40, ``investors
have gravitated to the types of stocks that we buy.''
</P>
<P>
   One big winner was EOG Resources in Houston, up 57.6 percent,
helped by rising natural-gas prices. ``Investors are realizing that
gas producers haven't been able to keep pace with demand,'' he
said. Enron is more leveraged to natural-gas price increases, he
said, than any other domestic gas company.
</P>
<P>
   He also made money in Caremark Rx, a Birmingham, Ala., company
that organizes drug benefit programs for health insurers and HMOs.
The stock rose 62.7 percent in the quarter. The drivers of its
performance included the divestiture of its unprofitable physician
practice management business and the settlement of litigation
involving a convertible bond issue. ``The company has annual
revenue growth of 20 percent,'' von der Linde said, ``so once the
clouds were gone, the stock price began to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Jude Medical, a St. Paul maker of heart valves and
pacemakers, rose 77.8 percent. Investors began bidding up the price
in anticipation of the Food and Drug Administration approval,
expected by year-end, of a new, lightweight cardiac device, he
said. Moreover, a new chief executive, Terry Shepherd, who took
over in 1999, has smoothed out the company's problems meeting
earnings expectations. ``He is communicating with Wall Street and
rebuilding the earnings numbers,'' he said, ``which is generating
confidence in the company as it moves toward its new product
introduction.''
</P>
<P>
   von der Linde is optimistic about the stock market. ``I wouldn't
be surprised to see the rally in the old leaders continue for
another few months,'' he said. ``Investors suddenly seem to be
taking notice of earnings. The next logical step is that they'll
pay attention to valuations, which will broaden out leadership in
the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Profiting From Credit Risk
</P>
<P>
   Buying companies with strong earnings growth while keeping a
sharp eye on prices pushed the $200 million Wasatch Core Growth
into the No. 7 place, up 10 percent. ``In the last three quarters,
we've seen the strongest earnings growth in our portfolio companies
that we've ever seen,'' said J.B. Taylor, 28, co-manager of the
fund with Sam Stewart, 55.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the annual earnings growth of the companies in the
fund has been nearly 30 percent, even though their trailing
price-to-earnings multiples have been less than 20, which is
relatively low. ``With high-tech investments in vogue,'' he said,
``a lot of great, solid companies are being passed over.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them, he said, is Rent-a-Center, in Plano, Texas, which
rose 50 percent in the quarter. The company operates a
``rent-to-own'' business that leased electronics, appliances,
furniture and other goods to consumers, including those without
credit cards or checking accounts or with poor credit histories.
Its earnings are growing at an annual rate of 25 percent, while
shares trade at about 10 times its earnings for the previous 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Another company that caters to people with poor credit is
Americredit, a consumer finance company in Fort Worth whose stock
rose 4.3 percent. Americredit's customers ``are good loan
applicants now, because they've turned around or they're willing to
pay premiums for their loans,'' Taylor said. Annual earnings growth
exceeds 25 percent, and shares trade for about 13 times trailing
12-month earnings.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Express Scripts of St. Louis, a drug benefits
management organization. Its cash flow has been growing 20 percent
a year, Taylor said, but its share price was depressed because of
the general downturn in many health care stocks. It rose 47.9
percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Taylor expects value stocks to dominate. ``I see
an increasing focus _ or return to focus _ on fundamentals, because
so many investors have been burned by hyped stocks,'' he said. ``In
the last couple of months, Wall Street has been shifting its focus
to earnings.''

TO PUNISH WAR CRIMINALS, THE WORLD MUST DEFINE WAR CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In first-century Rome, where historians knew a glorious war when
they saw one, Lucius Annaeus Seneca raised a troubling question: on
the battlefield, do whole nations go mad and lose their humanity?
``We check manslaughter and isolated murders,'' he wrote in his
Epistles, ``but what of war and the much-vaunted crimes of
slaughtering whole peoples?''
</P>
<P>
   Almost since the first rock was thrown in anger, international
legal experts say, people have tried to rein in the excesses of
conflict and make them punishable. Benjamin Ferencz, a legal
scholar who was a young prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials for Nazi
war crimes after World War II, goes back to Ecclesiastes for an
early Biblical guide to good behavior. ``You weren't supposed to
kill your enemy and his suffering babes,'' he said. ``You take them
as slaves. That was a big advance forward for the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, Abraham Lincoln commissioned the first
modern war crimes code, which was duly written by Francis Lieber,
the president's chief counsel during the Civil War. Next came the
1949 Geneva conventions, which codified rules for the humane
treatment of civilians and combatants, including prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Now another historic step has been taken. A week ago, legal
delegations from more than 100 nations gathered at the United
Nations and agreed to an exhaustive catalog of acts that will
constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide for the
world's first permanent International Criminal Court, now in the
final stages of creation. The definitions of crimes cover dozens of
pages in an effort to list unambiguously the most terrible things
that people do to each other in the course of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But from the grisly amputations of the hands of innocents in
Sierra Leone to the systematic sexual abuse of women in Bosnia and
Rwanda _ or, some would say, to the bombing of Kosovo refugees by
NATO war planes _ modern conflicts raise new and complex issues.
There still is not total agreement on universally accepted moral
codes.
</P>
<P>
   It was easier at Nuremberg, and at the Tokyo trials for Japanese
war criminals. The war crimes were more or less traditionally
defined, and the victorious allies were in charge. Today, most
experts say, crimes are less easy to define, violations less easy
to agree on. More actors are on the stage as well: human rights
groups and other nongovernmental organizations are now instrumental
in collecting information and lobbying for trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen in modern wars, especially many internal
conflicts, is that war crimes and crimes against humanity are
layered upon each other,'' said Michael P. Scharf, the director of
the Center for International Law and Policy at the New England Law
School in Boston, who is studying the changing face of atrocity.
``It's not just the military. You get neighbor fighting neighbor.''
Civilian culpability in what were once thought of as military
crimes is a concept being thrashed out in tribunals for the Balkans
and Rwanda, Scharf said. Along the way, he added, ``a whole new
jurisprudence is emerging.''
</P>
<P>
   Scharf has been asking questions about how important trials are
to peace and reconciliation. ``There is a conventional wisdom that
if you could have a credible, neutral trial for war criminals, that
would create a historical record that everybody could agree on and
that would withstand the forces of revisionism,'' he said. ``This
theory really emerges from the Nuremberg precedent.'' Scharf
decided to test it in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many towns in Bosnia where there was the worst ethnic
cleansing,'' he said, ``the Muslims and Serbs, victims and
perpetrators, have moved back into their old houses and are living
once again as neighbors.'' They know about the war crimes trials at
the Hague, because the George Soros Foundation is having them
broadcast into Bosnia with the idea that if people ``actually saw
the testimony of the victims and the perpetrators, they couldn't
deny it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Scharf found instead was that both local people and
outsiders who spoke with them could come away with very different
interpretations of what the trials proved or did not prove. Scharf
matched some of these reactions with his own research on what he
calls ``the myth of Nuremberg'' _ that is, that all you have to do
is establish an international tribunal, create an historical record
``and that's that.'' He said that polls taken in Germany only 10
years after the Nuremberg trials, by which time many Nazi sentences
had been commuted, showed that ``90 percent of the people thought
that these were show trials, political trials.'' It took another
generation or two to change that perception, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It does not help when governments introduce their own national
interests into the discussion. Ferencz, who at 80 still writes on
war crimes and has been active in debates surrounding the
International Criminal Court, says that during the Cold War neither
side wanted itself or its friends or clients held up to scrutiny.
And Scharf notes that groups defined as ``political'' are not
protected against genocide because the writers of the genocide
convention of 1949 wanted Stalin's Russia on board, and Stalin had
annihilated political and social groups. ``Your very definition of
genocide has been corrupted from the very beginning by the
necessity of Cold War politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War is over but the story continues. Take Saddam
Hussein's gassing of his troublesome Kurdish minority in 1988, and
the world's response. ``Rather than simply going after rebel
fighters,'' said Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human
Rights watch, Saddam ``would drop chemical weapons on Kurdish
villages, killing some people and driving others out, and then
rounding up those who were fleeing and bringing them to a series of
concentration camps. Virtually every male of fighting age was
executed _ about 100,000 people.'' But this crime, Roth said, ``was
inconvenient for the international community to address.''

BOOK GUIDES THE SPIRITUAL TRAVELER TO RELIGIOUS SITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traveling is one of my favorite pastimes; I like to see what's
over the next hill.
</P>
<P>
   When I visit a place, large or small, I'm likely to end up
visiting religious sites.
</P>
<P>
   In England, I've sought out famous churches of which Charles
Haddon Spurgeon, noted Baptist evangelist, and John Wesley were
pastors.
</P>
<P>
   While in Kerrville, Texas, visiting friends and playing tennis
recently, I took a side trip to Bandera and visited St. Stanislaus
church, one of the state's oldest Roman Catholic parishes founded
by Polish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   I sometimes write about what I see. But sometimes I go just for
the fun of learning about the amazing diversity of religious
experience that exists.
</P>
<P>
   So I was intrigued by a recently released book, ``The Christian
Traveler's Companion: USA and Canada,'' Fleming H. Revell ($14.99).
</P>
<P>
   I was expecting to find some new places to visit on my travels.
</P>
<P>
   And I wasn't disappointed. Amy S. Eckert, an enthusiastic
traveler and free-lance writer, and William J. Peterson, a
Christian author and editor with Revell, list more than 3,000
destinations in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The authors called upon their own travel experiences, convention
and visitors bureaus, and personal research in compiling the
paperback volume. The authors are more interested in pointing their
readers toward the spiritual than just the obviously
religious-related site.
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual travel may include finding a place to worship while
visiting a city, touring a museum with religious significance or
just finding a quiet place to read the Bible, Eckert said this
week.

   The paperback book has highly interesting entries about places
in both the United States and Canada. For example, I learned that
the Notre-Dame-de-Quebec I visited in Quebec City last summer is
the oldest Catholic basilica in North America, dating from 1647.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that Jonathan Edwards' sermon ``Sinners in the Hand of
an Angry God'' was first preached in Enfield, Conn. We are told
that the old hymn ``Jesus Paid It All'' was scribbled by Elvina
Hall on the flyleaf of a hymn book during worship at the Monument
Street Methodist Church in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   But the book is not simply a storehouse of religious sites in
North America. Other books, including ``America's Religious
Treasures,'' a 1976 effort of Marion and Pierre Vuilleumier
published by Harper &AMP; Row, give more details on special religious
places.

   ``What we mean by Christian travel is travel that rejuvenates
your spirit as well as your body, travel that doesn't leave your
spiritual life behind on the coffee table,'' Eckert and Peterson
wrote. ``Christian travel is not necessarily ... a vacation to the
Holy Land. It doesn't have to be a service trip where you
participate in mission work. ...''

   The United States was supporting Iraq in a war against Iran at
the time. ``The U.S. became interested in the crime only after the
gulf war,'' Roth said. ``At this stage, the U.S. does support a
tribunal, but there is no chance of getting it past Russia, China
and France on the Security Council.'' All three have, to one degree
or another, backed Iraq in its standoff with the United Nations and
the United States. The Security Council set up tribunals for the
Balkans and Rwanda but not for Saddam or, for that matter, for Pol
Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader responsible for the deaths of more than
a million Cambodians. ``The Security Council can't be trusted to
bring criminals to trial,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, many have turned their attention to the U.S.-led
bombing in 1999 of Serb targets in Yugoslavia to stop Serb
atrocities in Kosovo. Some groups, like Amnesty International, say
they have found evidence of war crimes. Human Rights Watch, while
not accusing NATO of war crimes, has been concerned about the use
of cluster bombs near populated areas, attacks on civilian targets
like factories or a major power plant, the bombing of a bridge near
a busy market during daylight hours and air strikes against mobile
targets (among them a column of refugees) from 15,000 feet without
solid assurances that the targets were military. Roth said that
advanced technologies required new ways of looking at the conduct
of war.
</P>
<P>
   Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the Balkans war crimes
tribunal, decided against an investigation of NATO's conduct of the
war, but even the idea that she would explore such a move raised
tempers in the Pentagon. This only contributed to the U.S.
military's determination never to have anything to do with the
International Criminal Court, fearing it would single out Americans
for political or ideological reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Wedgwood, an expert on international law at the Yale Law
School, sees some justification in those fears. She said that it
was sometimes harder to make judgments on military behavior than
one might think just by looking at the results of any given action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say that NATO should rethink some of its war
plans and find ways to fight better,'' Wedgwood said, ``and it's
another thing to instantly criminalize them. There seems to be a
rush to the most extreme category.'' The issue is complicated, she
added, by the absence of military expertise on criminal tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   Wedgwood said that attempts to include sanctions _ the Clinton
administration's weapon of choice after precision bombing _ in the
loosely defined area of war crimes opened another range of issues.
Opponents of sanctions on Iraq, imposed in 1990 after the invasion
of Kuwait and still in place, say that they are killing thousands
of Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have seriously argued,'' Wedgwood said, ``that just as
in the law of war, you can't target civilians for their own sake,
by that same logic, sanctions that try to press civilians to
overthrow their leaders should also be forbidden.'' She went on:
``Some people will argue that enemy morale as such has always been
and must be a military objective. Other people say that leads you
down the path where you would actually seek to terrorize
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   No one says bringing clarity or universality to an understanding
of war crimes will be easy. ``It's all imperfect,'' said Ferencz,
who has watched the world grapple with elusive war criminals for
half a century. ``But I see progress. We are crawling toward
civilization.''

 &HT;    SUV's toughness a product of its truck roots
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although the 2000 Isuzu Rodeo is a quite civilized
sport-utility vehicle, it will issue reminders that Isuzu is a
truck manufacturer and not a carmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is noticeably trucklike, and not even Isuzu's
Intelligent Suspension Control system (ISC) prevents that. It's a
heavy SUV (about 4,000 pounds), and once it starts flexing its coil
spring suspension's 7.9 inches of travel, body motion sets in. It
also leans and rolls in corners.
</P>
<P>
   But the Isuzu, even in line-topping LSE trim, looks and drives
like a very competent off-roader. It seems safe to say that its SUV
characteristics are going to be underutilized.
</P>
<P>
   Pricewise, the Rodeo, which is rebadged and sold as Honda's
Passport, is hardly a bargain. The base model S with four-cylinder
engine (129 horsepower) and five-speed transmission is $18,080,
while the LSE lists for $31,265. The test LSE came to $31,820, and
it had all the features expected of a sedan: all-power, leather,
CD/cassette players and air conditioning, albeit one that struggled
to cope with recent 90-degree weather.
</P>
<P>
   Between its height _ ground clearance is 8.2 inches _ and the
fact the Rodeo has enough glass to give a window washer nightmares,
visibility is really good. The rear mirror view is limited and can
be reduced to almost nothing by rear seat passengers, but the power
side mirrors are large enough to facilitate lane changes and
checking clearance when going off-road.
</P>
<P>
   With the 205-hp V-6 engine making 214 pounds-feet of torque, the
Rodeo's acceleration is better than that of many of today's
fuel-saving cars. The penalty comes in fuel mileage, however, with
the V-6 carrying EPA figures of 16 and 20 mpg. They must have been
obtained by a very light-footed driver, because the test LSE fell a
couple of mpg short of matching them.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodeo's interior offers plenty of room for adults, even in
the rear. The rear cargo room is easily utilized because the rear
glass opens upward and the bottom portion swings open to the left.
Fold the rear seat, and cargo room jumps from 33 cubic feet to
81.1.
</P>
<P>
   The ride, in addition to not matching the comfort level of some
SUVs in the Rodeo's price range, can be noisy with both wind and
road noise coming into the cabin. The standard CD/cassette stereo,
although relatively low on the center dash, is easily operated and
provides decent sound.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the amenities, the Rodeo does remain a truck at heart,
and while that may offend some SUV buyers, those who really need or
want four-wheel drive with toughness, the Rodeo will make sense.

 By CAROLE GOULD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a way, it has been a seven-year cold shower for the idea that
an ordinary investor can do any better than the market, even with
expert advice.
</P>
<P>
   Because saving for retirement had become a crucial issue for
Americans, The New York Times in 1993 asked five mutual-fund
experts how they would invest a hypothetical nest egg of $50,000
for someone who planned to retire in 20 years or more. Each quarter
since then, the five portfolios have been reviewed and fine-tuned
and their performances compared in these pages.
</P>
<P>
   With results from the second quarter of 2000, the exercise
concludes, and the participants discuss what they, and investors,
have learned along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five participants tripled their money in the seven
years ended June 30. The portfolio overseen by Eric Kobren,
president of the Kobren Insight Group and editor of Fidelity
Insight in Wellesley Mass., did the best over all, with a
cumulative gain of 210.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Close behind were the portfolio of ``socially responsible''
funds assembled by Jack Brill, vice president of Natural Investment
Services in San Diego, with a cumulative gain of 204.42 percent,
and the portfolio managed by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-load
Fund Investor, in Irvington, N.Y., at 200.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In fourth place was a portfolio tended most recently by Russel
Kinnel, editor of Morningstar Fund Investor in Chicago, at 146.97
percent. The fifth entry, managed by Harold R. Evensky, an
investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla., finished at 123.63
percent, according to Lipper Inc.
</P>
<P>
   None of the portfolios, however, managed to outperform the
market over the seven-year period. In retrospect, simply investing
the whole stake in the Vanguard S&AMP;P Index 500 fund and letting it
ride would have done better, yielding a gain of 277.51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But overall performance was intended to be just one dimension of
the exercise. Investors also had a chance to explore the thinking
behind mutual fund management as the managers discussed strategies,
styles and selections each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The object lessons were limited by the unexpected way the
economy and the stock market have moved over the last seven years _
almost exclusively straight up. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index returned an annual average of 20.25 percent over the period;
by contrast, stocks returned an annual average of 12.1 percent in
the 65 years from 1926 to 1990, according to Ibbotson Associates in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Big growth stocks dominated the stock market for much of the
last seven years, lifting the performance of large-capitalization
index funds and dragging down the returns of actively managed
mutual funds, which tend to own smaller stocks. According to
Morningstar Inc., just 17.2 percent of 970 actively managed
domestic diversified equity funds in its database outperformed the
S&AMP;P 500 over the period.
</P>
<P>
   And the stock market has become more volatile in the 1990s,
jumping or slumping abruptly _ as a whole or sector by sector _ in
hard-to-predict ways. Fast-moving markets stumped the experts
several times along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, stocks _ and funds that hold them _ are still the best
way to meet long-term financial goals like retirement, the experts
said, because they have always outperformed other investments over
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exercise shows what a prudent, diversified mutual fund
portfolio can return, given time and compounding,'' Kobren said.
``It isn't necessary to dart in and out of the market, take foolish
risks in the hopes of scoring a home run or get overly complicated
by owning dozens of funds.''
</P>
<P>
   All five participating managers continue to recommend
diversified fund portfolios, even though diversification was a far
from optimal strategy during much of the last seven years.
Carefully balancing big stocks with smaller ones, or American
issues with international issues, turned out to be
counterproductive because of the relentless market leadership of
the big-growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no way of knowing if the same will be true in the
future. ``I still thoroughly believe in diversification for my own
portfolio and for my clients,'' Kobren said, ``because you can
never know with certainty which sectors of the market will yield
the biggest returns in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to a diversified portfolio while market favorites come
and go can be trying, the experts conceded. ``Long-term investing
is my mantra and my faith,'' Evensky said, ``but I will admit that
sometimes, long-term seems interminable.''
</P>
<P>
   The exercise also reaffirmed the power of the financial markets
to confound expectations, said John Rekenthaler, now director of
research at Morningstar, who started the portfolio that was later
managed by Susan Dzuibinski and then Kinnell. He stuffed his
initial portfolio with funds holding small stocks, value issues and
overseas holdings; they had been superior performers over the long
term but had slumped around the time the exercise began, and
Rekenthaler thought they looked ripe for a rebound. As it turned
out, though, none caught up with the large caps. ``Expect to be
surprised,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rekenthaler said his own results occasionally caught him off
guard. ``I remembered my good picks,'' he said, ``and then forgot
the fact that I had a big stake in emerging-markets funds as the
whole sector tanked.'' The lesson: Track your investment results
carefully, so you can learn from your decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Brill's success ratifies an investing approach that seemed
unorthodox and untried in 1993. ``Socially responsible investing
works,'' he said. ``We have competitive returns because our
screening identifies high-quality, well-managed companies.'' He
added, ``I never tried to outsmart the market or get in on hot
sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   When he started, he said, there were only about 15
comprehensively screened social-investing funds, plus an additional
25 funds without the social label that qualified based on the types
of stocks they held. Those 40 choices have grown to more than 150
today, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evensky recommends diversifying within asset classes. In that
vein, he used to include in client portfolios three funds run by
managers who choose large-cap growth stocks. In his hypothetical
portfolio for this exercise, though, he felt he had room for only
one, and chose the Yacktman Fund, whose subsequent performance was
disappointing. These days, he prefers index funds for large-cap
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Evensky said he learned another lesson the hard way: Not to make
a big bet on a new fund idea. At the outset he allocated some of
his portfolio to the Barr Rosenberg Market Neutral fund, which aims
to neutralize market volatility through a mix of long and short
sales. The idea fell flat; Evensky said the fund's managers told
him its undoing was a run of extraordinary behavior by the stock
market that no one could have anticipated. Now, Evensky said, he
advises waiting for a few years until a new concept has proved
itself in different market environments.
</P>
<P>
   Realigning a portfolio periodically is wise, all five experts
said, because strong performance in one area could lead to an
ill-advised concentration of assets. The five hypothetical
portfolios could be rebalanced quarterly, and generally were; once
a year is probably often enough for most long-term investors.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't be too quick to sell, Evensky said. After he
researches a fund and buys its shares, he will stick with it
through two years of bad times if performance seems likely to
improve. But he dumps funds immediately when managers change their
stripes, say by adding big overseas positions or by switching style
from growth to value-oriented.

FLOWERING SCREENS: PERENNIALS FOR PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By PATRICIA A. TAYLOR  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Little did I realize the price to be paid that fall when my
neighbors told me the dying maple tree edging our property line
would be cut down. All I could think of was the sunshine that would
bathe the garden borders I had been trying to create. But then, the
following spring, I realized that the gift of sunshine had led to
the loss of privacy between our small lots.
</P>
<P>
   To recapture some feeling of our own space, my husband replaced
the 4-foot wire fence with a wooden lattice fence 6 feet tall, as
high as allowed in our community. That helped, but not enough. So I
turned to giant perennials, plants that would form a wall of
greenery and soar above the fence with colorful flowers. I reasoned
that they would be a stopgap while I decided on an appropriate tree
for the area.
</P>
<P>
   To add a bit of flair, I chose little-known flowers. To guard
against gaps in my privacy screen, I made sure the plants were all
easy-care natives. This unusual, relatively inexpensive planting _
perennials cost much less than trees or shrubs _ has been so
successful that I've never changed it. Indeed, I've added perennial
screens in several other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Two Joe-Pye weed cultivars (in the Eupatorium genus) are
essential components of these screens. Magnets for bees and
butterflies, both feature flower clusters that form huge umbrellas
crowning each 7- to 8-foot plant for at least four midsummer weeks.
Gateway is doused with rosy purple, and Bartered Bride is covered
with white. When their flowers are cut for arrangements (in the
early morning to beat the insect rush), new blossoms take their
place in about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The stalks can be cut back in late spring to hold the final size
of the plants to 5 feet. I do this to get a layered look: stalks
nearest to the front of the border are cut, and those in back reach
their full height.
</P>
<P>
   These are supposed to be moisture-loving plants. Yet, to my
great delight, they performed splendidly (although with a shorter
bloom period) in last year's severe drought.
</P>
<P>
   Adding three more giant perennials, I can decorate my privacy
screens with uninterrupted color through summer and often into
fall. They are tough prairie plants, ones that can take both
drought and deluge in their stride.
</P>
<P>
   The first to bloom, usually by late June, is the regal
Queen-of-the-Prairie (Filipendula rubra Venusta). This magnificent
plant bears cotton candy plumes of pink flowers for two to three
weeks and grows to 6 or 7 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   In its natural habitat, Queen-of-the-Prairie wanders through
tall grasses and has to be a bit aggressive to compete. Where there
is no competition, as in my border, it takes off. I've finally
hemmed it in by surrounding it with orange day lilies.
</P>
<P>
   The lemon-yellow flowers on cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum)
start their four- to six-week bloom period in mid-July, decorated
by myriad butterflies. Undecorated, they look like 2-inch-wide
daisies and are lovely in arrangements. When they finish flowering,
they leave seed heads that are goldfinch favorites.
</P>
<P>
   The cup plant, which grows up to 8 feet, gets its name from the
unusual configuration of its leaves. These fold out from set
intervals on stout stems, forming small cups. Hummingbirds have
been known to quench their thirst from these troughs after a light
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The equally tall yellow coneflower (Rudbeckia Herbstsonne) is an
example of an American native that has been refined by German plant
breeders; the cultivar name means autumn sun in English. In my
garden, however, the flowers usually open in late July, a week or
so after the first cup plant flowers unfurl. The coneflower's bloom
period is much longer, often up to 10 weeks, and its flowers are a
richer yellow.
</P>
<P>
   The two plants look lovely together or as attractions in their
own right. Both have rich, dark green leaves that form a handsome
backdrop for the shorter plants placed in front.
</P>
<P>
   All these perennials get a bit top-heavy when in flower and need
some propping up. I slip dark green garden string through holes in
the lattice and tie it around the plant stems once they have
reached 5 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Queen-of-the-Prairie, all increase slowly over time,
both through self-seeding and through root spread. This has allowed
me to tinker with the color combinations over the years. The plants
are all easy to move in spring when new growth starts to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Which all goes to show that you can have your sunshine and enjoy
your privacy, too.
</P>
<P>

through www.garden.com or (800) 466-8142. Bartered Bride and
Queen-of-the-Prairie are also offered by Forestfarm, 990 Tetherow

   Rhododendrons require good drainage: their shallow roots may
suffocate in waterlogged soil, and in heat they're susceptible to
Phytophthora wilt, an overall wilting that begins with new growth.
If drainage is improved, the plant may fight this fungal disease.
If it succumbs, remove and destroy it, and do not plant another
rhododendron (or azalea) in the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   Horticultural oil is now recommended for treatment of powdery
mildew _ as well as for control of soft-bodied insects like aphids
and mites. At the first sign of infection, begin spraying plants
weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Control slugs with organic bait containing iron phosphate.
Diatomaceous earth will also control both slugs and ants, but must
be reapplied after rain.

 &HT;    For Sunday, July 9

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Stunned observers around the world are calling
Mexico's historic elections the Second Mexican Revolution, Mexico's
Berlin Wall or the Electoral Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   By any name, what happened on July 2 is more like a dream for
average Mexicans. They're pinching themselves, waking up to the
fact that for the first time in their 500-year modern history - and
after 71 years of the same party in the presidency - they're headed
for a peaceful transition of power from one political force to
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me by surprise. The forces of fraud were gathering,
but in the end, honesty and decency prevailed,'' said Homero
Aridjis, 60, a former ambassador, poet and environmental activist
who voted last Sunday for Vicente Fox Quesada and against Mexico's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned to defeat the PRI,'' Aridjis said. ``And now we all
have to learn how to live in a real democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Fox, who has beefed up his bodyguard detail, is
already facing rumblings of potential difficulties just ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Marginal, rock-wielding PRI supporters upset at losing in local
mayors' races attacked opponents and electoral officials in Mexico
state Wednesday, claiming fraud in those elections.
</P>
<P>
   Among political interest groups, grassroots environmentalists
were the first out the chute, pressuring Fox not to name a
political ally _ the controversial president of Mexico's small
Green Party _ to his cabinet. And the leftist Democratic
Revolutionary Party, which refused to join Fox's coalition, has
implied it could be a thorn in the new president's side.
</P>
<P>
   But since Fox's election as a centrist candidate of change,
Mexicans seem prouder and more confident. Even many voters who were
assumed to be a fountain of PRI support _ such as federal workers _
are also welcoming a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for Fox and so did most of my friends at work. But we
never said we were going to do that openly in our office,'' said
Roberto Torres, 35, a lawyer at the federal Treasury Department.
After Sunday he no longer feared speaking publicly about his
preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support change and I'm not afraid to lose my job now that
Fox has said he wants the best people for the government. I
consider myself capable,'' Torres said, referring to Fox's
ambitious plans to accelerate improvements of Mexico's civil
service and crack down on corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1929, no one in the federal government has ever labored
under an administration other than one run by the PRI. The world's
longest-ruling party until last Sunday, the PRI built up an
infrastructure of inertia or coerced loyalty over the decades by
offering favors to public workers and through unions and other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   That old-fashioned system was already on its knees before the
election. It now appears headed for its deathbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those in Treasury who seem deflated,'' Torres said,
``but that's normal if they were PRI supporters to the core. And to
tell you the truth, some of them aren't that brilliant for the
positions they're in. Maybe they're afraid because they won't fit
the profile of the new government.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox supporter Carolina Galinda, a secretary at the Social
Services Institute for Government Workers, said, ``For me this
change is like the real independence of Mexico. I think even the
PRI will be helped by its defeat and learn to fight cleanly.''
</P>
<P>
   A non-union worker, Galinda said her unionized colleagues were
given extra days off if they agreed to go to PRI rallies.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer at a government food subsidies program said she
supported Fox, too. ``But everybody here thought that (PRI
candidate) Francisco Labastida would win,'' she said, ``I did
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she still
is afraid of reprisal because there are five more months of PRI
government left. ``Those who supported the PRI are in total pain,''
she said. ``They look like they're in mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   The employee said she was forced by supervisors _ who kept lists
of cooperative employees _ to don a Labastida jacket and cap and
join other government workers passing out election propaganda and
balloons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so degrading,'' she said. ``People would roll their car
windows up. The only people who would take the propaganda were the
poorest people. And after a while even they weren't interested.
Just kids who would take the balloons.''
</P>
<P>
   Since February, she said, the directors of her office had been
withholding raises for the employees. They were so sure that
Labastida would win, she said, that by Monday _ the day after the
election _ the back pay had suddenly appeared in her bank account.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of system has to end now,'' she said. ``This
election was marvelous for Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled public employees were part of a silent majority of
young, middle-class workers in Mexico who took advantage of the
secret ballot and gave Fox a victory margin of roughly seven
percentage points over Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   That was a much higher margin of victory than most professional
American and Mexican pollsters believed Fox would win by, if at
all.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of two privately commissioned polls that went
unpublished in the media here, most surveys showed Fox and
Labastida in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coercion of the vote worked in some places, but overall it
didn't,'' said Dan Lund of MUND Opinion Services, whose exit
polling revealed that some people who were given traditional PRI
handouts of food or building supplies voted their conscience.
</P>
<P>
   In response to polls, some people declared for the PRI but ended
up being very ambiguous, Lund said. ``We found that in extended
families, there were people who wanted to vote against the PRI. But
they wanted to talk about it with their families and know they
weren't alone.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Lund said, Fox, Mexico's new Congress and
election officials will have to address coercion and vote buying to
achieve truly clean elections. In some of Mexico's poorest southern
states, like Guerrero, Tabasco and Hidalgo, where the regional PRI
remains strong, Lund found a distinct link between votes and
coercion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Elections Institute failed in that regard,'' he
said, ``but where the elections institute had muscle _ the secret
ballot _ it used it beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican broadcast media and some newspapers, Lund pointed
out, took a leap toward independence with this election cycle. But
they still offered biased news coverage more favorable to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials quantified and denounced the bias, but
couldn't do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   But what a difference a day made.
</P>
<P>
   Newscasters are now eager to interview Fox and are effusively
congratulatory. So much so that a popular television comic
performed a sketch pretending to be a newscaster who had donned
black cowboy boots, Fox's trademark, and a silver belt buckle that
said FOX, another trademark of the president-elect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been with you, Vicente,'' comic Adal Ramones
gushed to guffaws from his live audience.
</P>
<P>
   Irreverent political humor on Mexican television is still young
and cautious. Under Fox, it has a chance to take off, just as news
organizations now have an opening to push for freer and more
independent coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Only within the last 10 years have editorial cartoonists
gradually started lampooning Mexican presidents in print.
Television and movies are a final frontier.
</P>
<P>
   After Ramones performed his newscaster sketch last Tuesday, he
called Fox from his set and got him to play straight man. Fox, a
showman himself, sternly hinted that Ramones deserved to be fired.
Then he burst into laughter and congratulated the comic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Constructive criticism accepted,'' Fox said as the audience
went wild and flashed Fox's symbol, the victory sign.

   WORLD-BANK-CHINA (Washington) _ _ Under heavy pressure from the
United States, the World Bank's board on Friday overruled the
bank's leaders and denied funding for a sensitive Chinese
antipoverty project that had sparked a North-South struggle over
development aid. The $160 million Chinese project, part of which
would have resettled 58,000 ethnic Chinese in an area that nomadic
Tibetan herdsman once dominated, divided some of the bank's leading
borrowers from rich nations, including the United States. Rarely
has any World Bank project aroused as much internal dissent and

DESPITE THE MEDIA HYPE, DEATH PENALTY STILL ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm always reading or hearing on television that the public has
turned against capital punishment, that it's only a matter of time
until Death Row is a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you saw the article in USA Today:
</P>
<P>
   ``From Oregon to Maryland, grass-roots efforts to abolish or
impose a moratorium on the death penalty are multiplying rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Church-based groups are lobbying city councils. Prominent
former and current members of Congress are speaking out on the
issue and heading ballot initiatives. Death-penalty opponents
looking at the national political landscape have rarely been more
encouraged...''
</P>
<P>
   Gee whiz. Maybe I ought to just throw in the towel. Maybe I
should forget about capital punishment and the pure form of legal
and social justice that it represents.
</P>
<P>
   Yep. It must be time to kiss the death penalty goodbye. Long
live the serial killers. Long live the vermin who gun down cops for
the sheer sport of it. Long live the murderous sociopaths who rape,
rob, torture, mutilate, shoot, stab _ the list could go on, but you
get the idea _ and then claim that their own precious lives should
be spared because they couldn't afford to hire Johnnie Cochran to
defend them in court.
</P>
<P>
   The American people, it says here, have decided that capital
punishment is bad.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. If everyone thinks the death penalty is bad, why do I
keep hearing from readers who say it's good?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to commend you for your recent article, `Gary Graham
got what he deserved,' which was printed in the opinion section of
the Los Angeles Daily News dated June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your voice is a breath of fresh air to offset ... those who
favor the miscreants over ... the victims in our crime ridden
society. Your point of view is seldom heard above those who favor
criminals' rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The column that this reader found so refreshing had to do with
my reaction to the long overdue lethal injection of Texas murderer
Gary Graham, who stalled the executioner for nearly two decades
before sanity prevailed against the bleeding-heart hysteria of the
anti-death penalty lobby.
</P>
<P>
   I'm far too humble to quote myself, of course, so in case you
missed the column I hereby offer a nutshell summary. ``Columnist to
Graham: Good riddance.''
</P>
<P>
   Several California readers replied in a similar vein, which was
interesting since big-deal members of the Hollywood acting
fraternity were prominent among the weepers and gnashers demanding
mercy for the merciless Graham. Danny Glover led the pre-execution
clamor to spare Graham's life while post-needle mourning was
provided by the likes of Susan Sarandon and Mike Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   Ubiquitous headline-grabber Jesse Jackson and jet-setting
activist Bianca Jagger hauled their bleeding hearts and mindless
slogans all the way to Texas to witness Graham's demise. Now that's
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your characterization of the `famous' people was a delight to
read,'' wrote another L.A. reader.''
</P>
<P>
   Humility notwithstanding, I'm inclined to agree. What could be
more fun than dismissing Bianca Jagger as a ``dilettante''?
</P>
<P>
   I did hear from a reader or three who took issue with such
characterizations, but the naysayers were vastly outnumbered by
positive responses such as this one from a reader in Alabama:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness there's a level-headed media columnist still
around! It's a real relief being able to read a sensible op-ed
column in a left-wing rag such as the Birmingham News.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you ever notice how many people are convinced that the
hometown newspaper _ any hometown newspaper _ is a left-wing rag?
</P>
<P>
   That reader who called me level-headed, by the way, said he
taught journalism for 12 years at three different universities.
</P>
<P>
   Finally. Some respect from academia.
</P>
<P>
   Back here in the hinterlands, meanwhile, the evidence is
overwhelming that the death penalty is alive and well. Just plain
folks are unambiguous in their belief that the Gary Grahams of this
world should be dispatched from this world.

POPULAR CHILDREN'S BOOKS HAVE ROOTS IN ANGUISH 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDEN ROSS LIPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All across the United States today children and adults are
lining up at bookstores, clamoring to begin reading J.K. Rowling's
fourth Harry Potter adventure.
</P>
<P>
   All across the country, too, untold numbers of would-be Rowlings
are sitting at home feverishly typing, trying to turn out a
best-selling children's book, perhaps hoping that it will become a
children's classic. Many if not most of them assume that writing
children's books is simple _ easier, surely, than writing for
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As those who do it best have testified, writing well for
children is, first and last, very difficult. Adults who read ``The
Tale of Peter Rabbit'' as children remember the images of
blue-jacketed bunnies hopping through the cabbages in Mr.
McGregor's garden as sweet and funny, but children generally grasp
the fact that Beatrix Potter was writing about life and death.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as memoirs and biographies have shown, the great
children's works have often been the products of personal
difficulty and stress, a narrative distillation of anguished
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics have observed the central role of outsiders in
children's literature. The heroes are typically underdogs, youngest
children, orphans or, like Harry Potter, some combination of these.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there have been many cheerful storytellers who have
beguiled young readers with what the biographer and critic Leonard
Marcus has called ``innocent thoughts, and happy endings, and
little more than that.'' But the masterpieces, those often tough
tales that people chew over long after they turn out the lights,
are commonly survivor literature, for both the teller and the tale.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to modern scholarship, we know that many of the 19th- and
early-20th-century greats were beset by trauma. There was Hans
Christian Andersen, broody and reclusive, and Louisa May Alcott,
who romanticized the confusion of her own childhood in the
self-portrait of Jo in ``Little Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Carroll's obsession with little girls has become a staple
of academic commentary, discussed in greater detail than almost any
reader of ``Alice in Wonderland'' would ever want or need. And
Beatrix Potter's diaries show us a young woman determined to resist
the stifling environment of her boorish, wealthy family. As the
novelist and critic Alison Lurie has put it, Potter ``escaped from
prison with the help of a rabbit'' _ Peter Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at a shelf of modern classic titles for children from
babyhood to early adolescence indicates how little has changed.
Those who tell the tales that endure have struggled. Many
contemporary writers whose best-known work is deceptively
lighthearted have written troubling, even depressing, memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Boy,'' published for children, and ``Going Solo,'' for
children and adults, Roald Dahl set out his childhood in terms as
stark as any fairy tale. Although his biographer, Jeremy Treglown,
has demonstrated that he exaggerated and misstated some points, the
reality of his boarding school misery _ the cruel teachers, wicked
shopkeepers and nasty pranks _ and of his strangely intense
relationship with his widowed Norwegian mother remain unmistakably
disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   For many children and adults Ramona Quimby is the quintessential
modern American heroine of early-grade fiction. Beverly Cleary's
affectionate family novels about Ramona, her sister Beezus, her
parents and her friends on Klickitat Street are beloved as much for
their characters' ability to deal calmly with misfortune as for
their accounts of comic mishap.
</P>
<P>
   Cleary's sunny prose seems to have been hard won, because in her
two memoirs, ``A Girl from Yamhill'' and ``My Own Two Feet,''
written for older children and adults, she recounts a fairly grim
childhood in Portland, Ore., during the Depression. The strain of
living through hard times with a severe, demanding mother who never
hugged or spoke of loving her is set out plainly.
</P>
<P>
   Transforming early childhood stress can take many forms.
Everyone today understands that Maurice Sendak's ``Where the Wild
Things Are'' is about early childhood temper tantrums and
permission, but when it was published in 1963 it was stunningly new
and was quickly understood in Freudian terms. Sendak, who spent
many years in psychoanalysis, has explained that the book's fanged
creatures were, in fact, his relatives who came for his mother's
Sunday dinners and patronized the children.
</P>
<P>
   Sendak has also described the frightening impact on him, as on
so many others raised in the 1930s, of the kidnapping of Charles
Lindbergh's baby son. It was one of the explicit sources for his
lushly illustrated and alarming tale of Ida and her baby sister,
``Outside Over There.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Paterson, the internationally acclaimed novelist whose
fiction has ranged widely from feudal China and Japan to the
Industrial Revolution in 19th-century Vermont, has been open about
the painful experiences that inspired two of her most widely
admired contemporary novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Gilly Hopkins'' emerged from a brief spell as a
foster parent. The 1978 Newbery Medal novel, ``The Bridge to
Terabithia,'' now considered a classic, is about an improbable but
powerful friendship between a boy named Jess and a girl named
Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   Young readers often find themselves sobbing over the section of
the novel after Leslie's accidental death. Accepting the Newbery
Medal, Paterson explained that the book was her way of dealing with
the death of a friend of one of her sons and with her own recovery
from cancer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The sustained popularity of Gary Paulsen's 1987 novel
``Hatchet,'' about a 13-year-old boy who spends 54 days alone in
the Canadian wilderness with only a hatchet for a tool, along with
its sequels, ``The River,'' ``Brian's Winter'' and ``Brian's
Return,'' leaves it poised to become a children's classic.
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen's prose is Hemingway-terse, and his plots tend to
involve tests of endurance. He has talked about his miserable
childhood with alcoholic and abusive parents. As a boy he spent
much of his time escaping _ staying with relatives, building
himself a hiding place in the cellar behind the furnace, fleeing
into the woods. ``Whenever I went into the woods, all the hassles
of life were very quickly forgotten,'' he has said.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Jo Rowling? The story of a young divorced mum on the
dole, sitting in Edinburgh cafes with her infant daughter and
writing ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' in 1994 is
legend. It omits the fact that she'd begun sketches for some
characters as early as 1976, when she was a teen-ager, and
continued working on them steadily thereafter; the Harry Potter
character came into her mind more than five years before the first
novel was finished.
</P>
<P>
   In its sketchy portrayal of a difficult life, the legend is not
wrong; it just skips over the 10-year struggle of Rowling's mother
with multiple sclerosis before her death in 1990 at age 45,
Rowling's bad marriage to a television journalist, her bouts of
depression and the very hard work that went into plotting the world
of Hogwarts.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a full generation for a book, no matter how successful,
to shift into classic status, and the jury is not even out on the
unfolding Harry Potter. Time will tell. For the moment it's a
phenomenon. But hard work, luck and travails like those of Rowling
may be the stuff of which a children's classic is made.

&HT;     MAYOR BEHIND CHARLESTON'S REVIVAL SHARES HIS WISDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 &HT;     (Eds: Stands for MAYOR-RILEY)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If there's such a thing as civic plagiarism,
Joseph P. Riley Jr., the six-term mayor of Charleston, S.C., and
architect of that city's downtown revitalization, did nothing on a
recent visit to upstate New York discourage it.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings, Troy Mayor Mark
Pattison and Cohoes Mayor John T. McDonald III seemed to be on the
same page with Riley, whose philosophy is that beautiful urban
design is the way to revive dying downtowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fan of Mayor Riley's and have been for a long time,''
said Pattison, who read Riley's writings promoting urban rebirth
for years before he became the mayor of Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's reputation preceded him. He was named municipal leader
of the year in 1991 by American City and County magazine.
Washington Post columnist David S. Broder said that ``what has been
achieved here under his (Riley's) leadership is extraordinary.''
Newsweek magazine recently named Riley one of the 25 most dramatic
mayors in America.
</P>
<P>
   For a coastal city with a population of 100,000 and
approximately 500,000 in its tri-county metro area, Charleston
boasts a broad array of attractions and historic texture that have
earned it recognition as one of the most vibrant and livable cities
of its size in the country _ as well as a strong tourist
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Riley's leadership, numerous historic buildings have been
renovated and reused in the downtown historic district. Affordable
housing has been built. A picturesque Waterfront Park has been
developed. A major hotel and retail shopping complex that includes
a Saks Fifth Avenue store has opened.
</P>
<P>
   The Spoleto Festival U.S.A. draws arts lovers and extends the
tourist season. A minor-league baseball team plays downtown in a
baseball park named for Riley. A new aquarium is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminded us that we all share similar problems, but he
helped point out that we need creative solutions to make things
happen,'' said Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent tour of downtown Albany following a breakfast
meeting with the quartet of mayors, an off-the-cuff remark by Riley
that he'd gamble on an Albany rebound and snap up available
property downtown wasn't lost on Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very impressed with what he saw here,'' Jennings said.
``He said it took him 10 years to begin to turn things around in
Charleston. It's frustrating to all of us as mayors that we can't
get things done more quickly than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Experience has taught Riley, who was first elected mayor in
1975, that reviving a moribund downtown is a marathon, not a
sprint. ``The Charleston miracle,'' as its civic boosters like to
characterize it, has been a quarter-century in the works.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, Charleston was in a sorry state of decay.
``Downtown Charleston was in total disarray, overgrown and weedy,
home to drug dealers, with 1.2 million square feet of vacant
commercial space on the main street through downtown,'' recalled
Ken Gifford, who ran Charleston's downtown revitalization program
from 1975-1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made it work is that we marshaled forces in real estate
and development, took away the incentives in the suburbs and made
it more attractive to do projects downtown,'' said Gifford, a
landscape architect by training who oversees an $87 million
expansion on the campus of the State University College at
Purchase, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other factor was Joe's genius in working the
chicken-dinner circuit, selling our vision and knitting together
coalitions among blacks downtown and white suburban voters,''
Gifford said. ``It was just a lot of hard work block by block,
project by project. That's why it's taken 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In an engaging drawl, Riley displayed his Southern charm and a
talent for wringing emotion and conveying passion out of a
discussion about old buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful and invigorating cities are vital to the future of
this country,'' he said. ``What goes on in the center, the city,
sparks and shapes life for the entire region around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley drew comparisons between Albany and Charleston for their
similar size, founding in the 17th century, proximity to rivers and
the fact both have been named an All-America City. (Riley didn't
gloat about his city's temperate climate, robust recent economy,
bustling port and the Atlantic Ocean at its doorstep.)
</P>
<P>
   Riley, 57, harkened back to his childhood and a time when ``the
hysterical society'' allowed the landmark historic Charleston Hotel
to be torn down to make way for a drive-through motel. Also, the
nation's first orphanage was razed for a Sears department store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the stories of those buildings we didn't save that will
make you cry,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Historic preservation, he declared, ``has made Charleston what
it is today'' and saved downtown from ``the bland streets of
sameness'' found in most recent suburban development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historic buildings are what give a community memories,
texture, a rhythm and a pleasing scale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley recounted how he said no to high-rise public housing
projects and built them to a smaller scale and sprinkled them
throughout city neighborhoods, causing controversy. ``I can show
you beautiful public housing that started the rebirth of certain
neighborhoods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley turned thumbs down, too, on ``a big, ugly parking garage''
in downtown and made a huge drainage pump station downtown ``to
look beautiful, the way the Romans did their public works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good urban design works every time,'' he said, creating a
vibrant and diverse downtown where the poor, working-class, wealthy
suburbanites and tourists shop and linger in grand public spaces.
``There's no excuse to build anything that does not add to the
beauty,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a dead downtown and transformed it into one of the
liveliest you'll find anywhere, with billions invested and more
than 150 buildings restored,'' Riley said. ``The heart of our city
now engenders pride and nourishes our people. That's why we did
it.''

`CITIZEN COORS': A COMPANY THAT WAS SLOW TO CORRECT ITS MANY
ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, July 9) 
 By ALECIA SWASY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In scanning the bookstore shelves, I have long hoped to find a
series of books called ``Corporate Stupidity.'' This multivolume
set would make the collected works of James Michener look like
Cliff Notes, considering the number of business blunders that are
committed daily.
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorites are the sins of chief executives who
ignore their managers or the workers on the factory floor. Or the
debacles that follow when they tune out the most important audience
_ their customers. There is no shortage of material from every
industry, ranging from the Edsel to New Coke.
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar scene: Company fouls up, chief executive rants
when the headlines chronicle their foul-ups, six-figure consultants
are hired to figure out who fouled up. If only these consultants
would suggest that CEO's create a new office called the CSO _
common sense officer. Its job description: The lone voice in a
company who can tell the boss he might be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A recent example of a hefty dose of arrogance and the absence of
anyone willing to apply some common sense comes from the Coors
family, which started brewing beer in Golden, Colo., in 1876 and
continued until the younger generations nearly ran the company into
the ground by the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Citizen Coors: An American Dynasty'' (William Morrow, $27),
Dan Baum wisely singles the family out. Baum builds a strong
narrative from the tale of how this big dysfunctional family made a
lot of cold beer and money that ultimately financed conservative
causes via the Republican Party and the Heritage Foundation. There
is no lack of drama, starting with the patriarch Adolph Coors, who
committed suicide by jumping out of a hotel window.
</P>
<P>
   Succeeding generations had their problems, too, as Baum
describes them. Pity his grandchildren, who must have dreaded
Sundays. Adolph Jr. kept notes on his children's weekly misdeeds,
then spanked them each Sunday. One of the offspring also committed
suicide, also by jumping out of a hotel window.
</P>
<P>
   But this book also gives corporate America a primer, as valuable
as any business school case study, on how not to run a company.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Baum documents thoroughly how Coors abused
workers. Sure, paternalism is sweet when it's served up as free
lagers during break time in the brewery. But no amount of alcohol
takes the sting out of being subjected to lie-detector tests, used
to screen out what the book describes as ``thieves, radicals and
homosexuals.'' Some workers were asked if they had sex the previous
night. At times, employees were forced to see psychologists.
Brewery workers regarded themselves, in the words of one, as
``overworked animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Equal rights took a while to catch up with Coors. Women lacked a
bathroom in the brewery. There was one in the office for
secretaries, but women working in the brewery were docked for time
off if they left the plant to use it. One Coors family member said
that a woman's place was ``in the beauty parlor.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that management was spared from the odd behavior and whims
of the Coors clan. When Bill Coors, in the third generation, caught
the transcendental meditation bug, all executives were ordered to
take classes in the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Coors company, meanwhile, showed an amazing lack of
knowledge about behemoth competitors like Anheuser Busch. Members
of the Busch family in St. Louis knew that their company was driven
by the relentless marketing of Budweiser and other brands. But
Coors didn't get it _ and balked at spending money on ads.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, marketing executives had short tenures at Coors. Some
did manage a few hit ads, like one using ``Elvira, Mistress of the
Dark'' to sell beer at Halloween. But Jeff Coors, a born-again
Christian and member of the fourth generation, ordered an end to
Elvira's selling of Coors because he considered her satanic.
</P>
<P>
   Other ads were ludicrous. Senior family members once ordered the
company's advertising agency to make a commercial featuring Eva
Gabor, a family friend who was generous to the Republican Party.
Men in the focus group, viewing the aging actress, yelled: ``What's
she doing selling beer?''
</P>
<P>
   Even product introductions lagged behind the competition. Coors
was so behind the curve that it introduced a light beer three years
after Miller Lite hit the shelves. The company botched other
product introductions because it failed to do market research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizen Coors'' clinches the story by telling how the blunders
caught up with the company. It went public in 1975 at $32 a share.
By 1978, investors lost half their money. Earnings were once 30
cents for every dollar of beer sold, but slipped to just a penny by
1990. Boycotts by unions and even barley farmers hurt its image and
sales. Market share wilted everywhere, even in its home state of
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   What did the Coors brothers do about it? They continued to focus
on pushing conservative political causes in Washington. And they
bought themselves a Lear jet.
</P>
<P>
   What did the board members do? They dozed off during
presentations on the demographics of beer drinkers. One of the best
lines of the book likens a Coors board meeting to an Idi Amin
cabinet meeting: Nobody objects.
</P>
<P>
   Senior management did seem to pay attention to one event _ the
pollution of its famous Rocky Mountain spring waters. Clear Creek
was the primary reason that Adolph Coors built his brewery in
Golden. Trouble was, his brewery was responsible for contamination
of the once-pristine waters. The book spends far too few pages on
this environmental mess. Coors knew for nine years during the 1980s
that it was destroying the spring water, but covered it up,
according to Baum.
</P>
<P>
   To help ease the bad public relations, Peter Coors, also in the
fourth generation, coughed up a $30 million check for a baseball
stadium in Denver. For the money, the team would play at, you
guessed it, Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The book's final pages chronicle the Coors men stepping aside
and hiring an outsider to run the company. More than a century
after the brewery was founded, the arrogance and indifference had
caught up with them. Baum says they would have made more money by
closing the place in the early 1980s and putting their money in a
passbook account.

 (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By RUTH LA FERLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last year, Anri Yasuda bought a Fendi baguette, the
most coveted bag of the season. In a matter of weeks her purchase
had lost its allure, becoming about as exciting to her as a
plateful of warmed-over cabbage. ``With a luxury bag, you're bored
of it after one season,'' said Yasuda, a philosophy major at
Columbia University. ``That's when the new ones come out.''
</P>
<P>
   So nowadays, Yasuda, 19, feeds her passion for style and novelty
by prowling the stands of the street vendors dotting Manhattan from
upper Madison Avenue to the Lower East Side and Canal Street. A
counterfeit python cowboy hat, a rayon ``pashmina'' _ if it looks
good and the price is right (no more than $30), she'll take it.
Recently, she expanded her list of desirable knockoffs to include
high-status handbags. She's on the lookout for a fake Hermes Birkin
bag (priced at $4,800 to $5,500 for the real thing).
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get tired of it, I'll put little stickers all over it
to make it look special,'' she said. ``And if everyone has the same
bag, so what?''
</P>
<P>
   Like Yasuda, Selma Scheinbach scours street vendors' stalls for
bargains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street accessories are cheap and accessible,'' she said. ``You
don't have to run all over the stores to find them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm walking, I'm shopping,'' Scheinbach, who is in her
60's, added. ``Whether it's a hot dog or a handbag, if I see what I
want on the corner, it's mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women are typical of a new breed of sidewalk shopper:
consumers of evident style and means who can afford to pay retail
but enjoy the thrill of adding a $30 counterfeit or two to their
wardrobes. Where the shoppers stooping to inspect street
merchandise were once mainly office workers and tourists, now they
are as likely to be chic passers-by, clutching a genuine Prada
shoulder bag style or a tote emblazoned with real Gucci double G's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real shopper, you can tell who they are by their designer
labels,'' said Christian, a vendor selling bags last week at
Madison and 59th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The new upscale customer seems to be responding to an upgrade in
the counterfeit merchandise that's available and a trend among
done-it-all shoppers for cheap ``trophy'' purchases.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, sidewalk fakes were limited mainly to
generic-looking black nylon ``Pradas'' and impostor ``Louis
Vuittons.'' But styles today are more diverse, sophisticated and
authentic-looking, among them the currently sought-after Prada
bowling bag shapes, Kate Spade-style straw totes and minuscule
evening bags that imitate Fendi and Judith Leiber designs.
</P>
<P>
   The counterfeits sell on the street for $20 to $50 or more, as
against $250 to more than $5,000 for the designer originals. Where
once only a handful of peddlers catered to the status-starved, now
they crop up on every other block, staking out turf along Madison
Avenue between 50th Street and 70th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, there is a certain badge value in getting
things at a reasonable price,'' said Richard Leonard, vice
president of the Zandl Group, a New York consumer research firm.
``If that item is actually counterfeit, bought in the street, to
that consumer it really doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have been describing Lauren Stax of Houston, a student
at the University of Texas. Stax says she owns a genuine Kate Spade
canvas bag.
</P>
<P>
   She also has a handsome Spade impostor, bought on the street.
Poring over a table strewn with handbags at 59th Street and Madison
Avenue, she said, ``I don't care if these are real or fake, and
most people I know don't care either.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do many shoppers appear to be concerned that the vendors
they buy from are flouting the law. Counterfeit accessories _ those
with the logo or the identifiable colors and designs of brand-name
bags and accessories _ violate Federal and local trademark laws.
Moreover, the vendors who sell them are often unlicensed, subject
to periodic sweeps by the New York City police, who confiscate
their wares.
</P>
<P>
   But the laws are enforced only fitfully. On Madison Avenue on
Thursday, a security guard hired by the Madison Avenue Business
Improvement District looked on serenely as, just yards away on 66th
Street, a vendor peddled ``Tod's'' fake patent leather shoulder
bags, plastic ``Vuitton'' clutches and canvas ``Gucci'' slings.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury makers are not amused. The International
AntiCounterfeiting Coalition in Washington says counterfeiting has
tripled in the last 10 years and now costs legitimate businesses
$350 billion in annual sales. That figure encompasses auto parts as
well as fashion accessories and is somewhat inflated, since many
people who buy bogus goods might not have purchased the
higher-priced originals. Nevertheless, counterfeit accessories
cheapen the image of legitimate brands.
</P>
<P>
   Most high-end handbag look-alikes are made in China or Korea,
the anticounterfeiting coalition says. Often, bogus logos and
signature hardware are later glued, sewn or riveted on in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Such telltale signs of counterfeiting as poorly sewn labels,
inferior stitching and materials that reek of petroleum don't seem
to deter many shoppers, especially the young. Ever alert for a
bargain, ``they're more independent and less easily manipulated
than some older shoppers are,'' said Leonard of the Zandl Group,
``and they are increasingly likely to shop in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Many shoppers turn to counterfeit wares out of disenchantment
with legitimate brands. Posting a message at Hintmag.com, a fashion
Web site aimed at young women, one disgruntled shopper wrote:
``Kate Spade bags are rectangular totes, done in different
materials . . . yawn. They're very easy to make, no wonder all the
counterfeits.''
</P>
<P>
   Most days of the week, such shoppers are likely to be found
perusing the wares spread on sheets on Lexington Avenue near
Bloomingdale's. There, imitation Prada ostrich purses and impostor
Fendi baguettes lure shoppers young and old. But at the first hint
of trouble _ the appearance of a security guard _ the merchandise
goes under wraps, vanishing faster than Brigadoon.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Christian, who declined to give his last name for
fear of arrest, displayed Coach and Kate Spade look-alikes. ``We
had a police sweep yesterday, so I don't have by best
merchandise,'' he said. ``On good days, we have Fendi, Prada,
Gucci, you name it. And they sell for about $35.''
</P>
<P>
   As he talked he kept watch for potential customers, the ones
already displaying designer labels, whom he claimed to be able to
spot a half-block away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to stop the real shoppers,'' he said. ``The others, you
try to get them, too. But you're not going to stress yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely he would put himself out to attract Samantha
Adam, a young tourist who writes for Madame Figaro, the French
style weekly. She was eyeing the bags a little furtively as she
stood on a corner waiting for a friend. Adam, who was simply
dressed and showing no logos, said she shuns counterfeit bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer to pay for the real one,'' she said. ``Even if it
goes out of the trend right away.''
</P>
<P>
   But she conceded that certain kinds of merchandise might tempt
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoes make me crazy,'' Adam said. ``Imagine if these people
sold them in the street. A woman could really get wild.''

A WORLD CLASS SETTING FOR WEDDING ALBUMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, July 9) 
 By GUY TREBAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The brides were tacking in white satin, trains billowing, veils
lofting like the topsails of the tall ships entering New York
harbor. Gliding across a marble expanse, Guatemala circled Korea,
with Jamaica and China close at hand. A Salvadoran bridal party
sailed toward a Custard Beach outlet, breaking through a throng of
tourists gathered for the 18th annual Brown family reunion.
Briefly, the wedding group changed course to join the Browns in
slurping French ice cream from Belgian waffle cones.
</P>
<P>
   The setting for this odd apparition was the Winter Garden of the
World Financial Center on the Fourth of July weekend. Just as a
light breeze bellied the white sails floating up the nearby Hudson,
blasts of freon-treated air puffed the many net tulle spinnakers
indoors. It was a special moment for the people involved, but no
special occasion. This sort of thing takes place here all the time.
The midpoints of winter and summer are high season for wedding
photography in this vast lobby, a de facto chapel of love, which
also happens to be a headquarters for Dow Jones, American Express
and the accounting romantics at Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sometimes counted 10 white stretch limos parked at
once,'' said Melissa Coley, the World Financial Center's vice
president for arts and events. The Winter Garden's photo op appeal
is obvious to anyone. With a 14-story vaulted atrium paved in
tricolor marble, a tiered and platformed Loretta Young stairway and
an anomalous grove of 16 50-foot palm trees, it might be the
grandest photo studio in New York. Although corporations pay as
much as $33,000 to rent it, as a public space it is essentially
free. Unlike Conservatory Garden in Central Park, the Angel of the
Waters statue on Bethesda Fountain or the Vale of Cashmere in
Prospect Park _ other wedding photography favorites _ it is
weatherproof. As a bonus, the sun bouncing off the World Trade
Center tends to fall through the atrium's glass ceiling, bathing
the Winter Garden lobby in lambent pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wedding picture thing has been going on since before the
palm trees were even here,'' Coley said, or since 1988. On a good
day there can be as many as two dozen marital parties trooping
through. They pose on the stairs, on the plaza, even on escalators,
and then proceed to the covered footbridge vaulting Liberty Street,
where a floor of coral marble reflects flattering light on brides.
``You see them sitting in the windows looking wistful,'' Coley
said.
</P>
<P>
   So what if it is not Bachrach Studio? So what if your wedding
pictures may contain scores of people you have never met? Does it
necessarily detract from the day that perfect strangers stop to ask
if you have carefully considered what you are about to undertake?
Relatives won't do that. (Well, all right, Uncle Al will.) And
relatives are not typically as cute as, say, Nari Lee, 5, and Seri
Lee, 3, sisters who insinuated themselves into numerous wedding
shots as they twirled down the stairs in petal pink skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it possible that the grandkids will enjoy the wedding
narrative more if it involves the appearance of unhinged strangers
making wisecracks at the tenderest moments? Take the bystander who
stopped a bridesmaid during the Jones-Davis wedding photo shoot to
ask what is black and white and red all over. The man was wearing a
Bazooka-color baseball cap, lime green hot pants and an Abe Lincoln
goatee. ``I don't know,'' replied the bridesmaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newspaper,'' said the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really,'' the bridesmaid said. ``I was thinking something more
along the lines of a skunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Wing Zhong Lam lifted a bouffant-gowned and radiant Mei
Mei Liu onto a planter so a friend could videotape her in the
round. Lam and his wife chose the Winter Garden for their wedding
pictures, he said, ``just for, like, a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lam wedding party was small, principals only, plus a maid of
honor in a tinsel tiara and six friends talking on cell phones. If
their casual clothes made them look, as David Sedaris once remarked
of Americans abroad, as though they had come to mow somebody's
lawn, they certainly fitted into the Winter Garden's gorgeous
mosaic.
</P>
<P>
   There was the usual mini-General Assembly on hand: people in
saris, in salwar kameez, in skullcaps and side curls, in safari
outfits and in crisp white nautical uniforms. There were
representatives of the 50 states, most wearing cargo shorts, many
packing Snugli baby carriers, all trooping through the atrium in
happy surprise as they observed the nuptial costumes and folkways
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been variable over the years,'' Coley said of trends in
wedding-party costume. ``There was a peach phase in the early '90s.
Then that went into pink. Lately, everyone's into purple and a lot
of red.''
</P>
<P>
   For the wedding of Maurice Rico and Judy Lombardi, the four
bridesmaids had chosen dresses in
always-tasteful-if-shocking-for-daytime black chiffon. The actual
nuptials, which had not yet occurred, would wait until a lunchtime
ceremony at Windows on the World. The photo session was scheduled
first to capitalize on midday light, gloriously diffused on the
stairway between the lobby's revolving doors and the Coco Marina
``outdoor'' cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to do marriage pictures here,'' said Edgardo
Jiminez, a photographer who uses the Winter Garden for modeling
shoots. ``It gives the people a lot of luck. With the water right
outside, it's got kind of a holy feeling for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the mood Rudy Pollack, a 35-year veteran of the wedding
photography trade, was trying to capture. Sprawled on his stomach
across the stairs, he had Lombardi and her uncomfortable
bridegroom-to-be framed in the viewfinder of his Hasselblad. With a
series of almost imperceptible hand waves, he subtly managed to
direct their poses to the great wedding album cliches: the ``I Got
You, Babe'' handclasp, the ``We've Only Just Begun'' embrace and
the ``My Heart Will Go On'' middle-distance gaze.
</P>
<P>
   Then he abruptly waved Rico out of the frame and got down to the
business of commemorating the dress _ a custom-designed strapless
confection with an impressively cantilevered bodice and a cloth
rose pinning the train. ``I had a vision of something that's good
for evening after you detach the train, so you can wear it to a
black-and-white affair,'' Lombardi explained, as an attendant
draped satin across the lobby steps in light that caused the fabric
to glow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I do think it's nice getting married in here,'' remarked
Charlene Brown, part of the Brown family reunion, happening upon
the scene. ``Yes, she is looking really, really cute,'' added
Charlene's twin sister, Zoelene, who tactfully waited until she was
out of earshot to voice her doubts about the wisdom of using your
best dress to buff a lobby floor.

STRETCH THOSE PATRIOTIC MUSCLES AND SING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL HARRAL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' my wife said Tuesday, ``that I've ever seen
anybody fluff a flag before.''
</P>
<P>
   We were watching the posting of the colors at the Fourth of July
service at First Presbyterian Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth of July should cause reflection on the founding
principles on which the United States was established; it should
elicit thanks for the sacrifices of many who fought first for
independence and then to continue that independence; and it should
celebrate who we are and what we stand for.
</P>
<P>
   First Presbyterian's service does all that.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a holiday tradition for many, mostly a sing-along with
a pickup choir. Best you get there early if you want a seat, in
part because of the added benefit that the sidewalk area outside
the church is an excellent vantage point from which to view the
city's fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Airman James Horan of Grapevine, Texas, and Master Sgt.
Sean Baumgartner of Fort Worth of the 136th Airlift Wing Honor
Guard, Air National Guard, posted the colors.
</P>
<P>
   That's always a solemn occasion, since the flags are being
handled by men and sometimes women who have sworn that they are
ready to give their lives in their defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Baumgartner, handling the Stars and Stripes, did something
extra. After he had placed the flagstaff in its stand, he wasn't
satisfied with the way the flag was draped. So he arranged it the
way he was taught at Air Force honor guard school at Bolling Air
Force Base in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   When he was finished, the stripes to the audience's right were
horizontal and tucked beneath the field of stars on the audience's
left. The gold fringe on the flag's edge cut diagonally and
precisely across the display from upper left to lower right and
then tucked under the cascade of red and white stripes on the left.
</P>
<P>
   It was beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   We said the Pledge of Allegiance. And then we sang ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how the National Anthem is meant to be sung _ not solo
by some name-brand star but by people with ordinary voices, some
straining to hit those impossibly high notes.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know when the trend to listen rather than sing started,
but I've noticed in the last few years that fewer and fewer people
sing at public gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because someone decided that the ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' ought to be a presentation by someone well
known instead of the common sharing of heritage that it always used
to be.
</P>
<P>
   But when we only listen, we miss part of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday we sang an armed forces medley, made up of songs from
all of the branches of service, and as we sang each song, audience
members who had some connection with that branch _ their own
service, the service of a relative, the loss of a loved one _ were
asked to stand.
</P>
<P>
   I was never in the military, but my wife and I stood during the
Army song in honor of her father who served in World War II, my
father who served in World War I, my brother who served in Vietnam
and our son who is a member of the Army National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way the invitation was issued, everyone in the
audience had the opportunity to stand at some point.
</P>
<P>
   I raise this issue because I suspect that love of country is
like a lot of things _ the more you practice it, the better you are
at it.
</P>
<P>
   You never completely forget how to hit a baseball, but you can't
go long periods of time without swinging a bat and expect to be a
good batter.
</P>
<P>
   I'm afraid that we aren't practicing patriotism quite enough.
Too many people do not stand and remove their hats when the flag
passes by. Too many talk while the ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is
being performed and too few sing.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Smart, a friend who has spent some time outside the United
States, told me recently that you don't realize how patriotic you
can be until you've lived somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   At home, we've let patriotism become routine.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a suggestion: If you are staging an event, don't bring a
name singer in to perform the Anthem. A band, sure. Perhaps a
chorus.
</P>
<P>
   But the point is that for the 60 seconds that it takes the
audience sing the first verse of the National Anthem we are, in
fact, ``one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice
for all.''
</P>
<P>
   And we need to be reminded of that regularly.

 By DANNY HAKIM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Keith Brown, the top marketing executive for the $512
million Amerindo Technology fund, one of the most prominent stars
in the firmament of technology offerings, the second quarter was,
if not the best of times, then not too shabby. Investors deposited
some $12 million into his fund during the quarter _ even amid the
gyrations of the technology-driven Nasdaq composite index.
</P>
<P>
   For his boss, the money manager Alberto Vilar, the second
quarter was, by contrast, definitely disappointing: The fund lost a
stomach-churning 26.7 percent for its investors.
</P>
<P>
   The story played out much the same at other mutual funds with a
sweet tooth for technology _ whether aggressive-growth funds that
populate so many 401(k) plans, the scores of technology sector
funds that run tens of billions of dollars or the dozens of
Internet funds that have emerged virtually overnight over the last
two and a half years. For these fund groups, the second quarter of
2000 turned out to be a tale of two executives.
</P>
<P>
   While the honeymoon ended for techno-centric money managers,
their marketers still seem to be enjoying a surprisingly easy sell.
No matter that the average technology sector fund was down 11.2
percent in the quarter. Or that the Nasdaq composite index lost
13.3 percent. Or that Internet companies were forced into a round
of belt-tightening, layoffs and, in the case of online retailers
like Boo.com and Toysmart.com, into bankruptcy. Or even that
institutional investors seemed to be displaying a distinct coolness
to the sector.
</P>
<P>
   Indefatigable individual investors kept buying technology funds.
Cash flow into technology sector funds totaled $1.97 billion for
April, the worst month of the technology sell-off, according to AMG
Data Services, a research firm in Arcata, Calif.; investors sank an
additional $1.09 billion into the funds in May. Although that is
far below the record $10.97 billion that flowed into such funds in
February, the month before the Nasdaq composite peaked, it is in
line with what investors were putting into the funds in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly figures compiled by AMG, which cover a smaller universe
of funds, show the trend continuing in June: Cash flows increased
assets by an estimated 2 percent for the month.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, individual investors have not turned tail from
technology in the way that scores of institutional money managers
and analysts had predicted they would in the event of a market
correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What surprises me about the numbers is that they've held up so
well,'' said Robert Adler, president of AMG. ``Investors haven't
abandoned the market, and they haven't abandoned technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with investors' behavior during another period of
market extremes, the emerging-markets meltdown of 1998. According
to AMG, outflows from emerging-markets stock funds totaled $4.05
billion for the year, 12.3 percent of total assets.
</P>
<P>
   In a market environment that many people see as increasingly
driven by individual investors, sentiment is crucial. Even as
institutional investors _ pension and hedge funds in particular _
showed signs of retreat, individuals are charting their own
direction. If their money continues to pour into technology and
aggressive-growth funds, the shocks of April and May may well
register as only a breather in the aging bull market.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is still perceived, correctly or not, as the
likeliest indicator of the market's future direction, if for no
other reason than that more than one-third of the market
capitalization of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index is in
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Technology, of course, takes several avenues into the American
portfolio. Sector funds are only one, accounting for only about 2
percent of the $7 trillion mutual fund industry. Far more important
are the nation's growth funds, the 800-pound gorillas of the
industry that form the backbone of so many portfolios and
retirement plans. During the meteoric run-up in technology stocks
in 1998 and 1999, many growth funds became de facto technology
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the $29.8 billion Fidelity Growth Co. fund, the sixth
most popular fund in defined-contribution retirement plans,
according to a study by Pensions &AMP; Investments magazine. At the end
of the first quarter, 53.2 percent of the fund's portfolio was in
technology, more than double the fund's position a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the $28.2 billion Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund,
another top 10 retirement fund, was 43.4 percent invested in
technology, up from 26.2 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Other popular growth funds were even more heavily weighted in
the sector. At the end of the first quarter, the $31.8 billion
Janus Twenty fund had nearly 60 percent of its portfolio in
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continue to strongly favor these growth funds over
funds whose managers practice a value strategy, which emphasizes
stocks that are priced at a discount relative to their intrinsic
worth. Though the sales gap between value and growth narrowed in
the second quarter, value-oriented funds still suffered net
outflows of $6.6 billion in April and May, while growth funds took
in $31 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big picture is that people are still playing where the
action has been,'' said Donald Cassidy, a senior research analyst
at Lipper Inc. ``They haven't panicked and they're not bargain
hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rekenthaler, research director of Morningstar Inc., added:
``I don't think anybody's faith in aggressive-growth investing has
been rocked, or fundamentally changed. Two months doesn't change
people's belief system.''
</P>
<P>
   So are investors showing foresight or folly in their continuing
rush into technology? Or have investors just become used to buying
on dips in volatile markets?
</P>
<P>
   Avi Nachmany, president of the consulting and research firm
Strategic Insight, called it ``a renaissance of national
optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory I have, why the commitment to new-economy investing
transcends the price level, is that in the end, you look at your
own personal experiences and ask, `How has my life changed with the
Internet?''' Nachmany said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many experiences that are fundamental to your
well-being. The e-mail you get from your grandmother in Florida,
the health advice you can get before you go to the doctor, the
cheaper plane tickets. We're just in the beginning of these kinds
of experiences. They will continue, regardless of the prices on the
Nasdaq.''
</P>
<P>
   Vilar, whose fund remains one of the top 10 performers over the
past three years despite last quarter's drubbing, agreed. ``The
trading in Internet stocks has been dominated by individuals. A lot
of people who bought the AOL's, the eBays or Yahoos were the people
who used them, the clients,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It seems natural, of course, that if investors continue to buy
technology stocks, technology stock prices will keep going up.
Perhaps that was one reason the Nasdaq recovered in June, gaining
16.6 percent. But James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate
Observer and known for his bearish views, says continued flows into
technology will just make the day of reckoning that much more
painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disappointment will be sharper,'' Grant said. ``Artificial
support under a fundamentally deteriorating market does not change
the fundamentals. It deepens the ultimate disappointment. We do
live in an age of technological miracles, but that does not change
the cyclical nature of markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flows will help at the margins, but they can't perpetuate a
trend indefinitely,'' Grant added. ``They can't perpetuate
technology indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as individuals went in, institutional investors showed
signs of pulling back. In May, $315.4 million flowed into the
technology sector from small trades _ those of less than 10,000
shares _ according to Birinyi Associates, which tracks money flows
in and out of the market; such small trades generally come from
individual investors. But larger block trades from institutional
investors took $502.4 million out of the sector in May; it was the
fourth month of outflows in the last five.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a total surprise. Institutional money managers are
more prone to short-term portfolio shifts, because they are usually
judged on a quarterly basis and adjust their allocations to conform
with risk benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say retail investors will play the tune for the
current market. ``I don't think investors will go on strike,''
Vilar said, ``and the reluctant brides, the institutional
investors, will be dragged to the altar.''
</P>
<P>
   It is testimony to the resilience of technology fund investors
that fund families have had the confidence to add technology
offerings _ and be rewarded for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   When Munder Capital Management, the company that runs the
nation's largest Internet fund, Munder NetNet, started an
international Internet fund, Munder International NetNet, on April
10, into the teeth of a collapsing market, investors still poured
money in. By the end of May, despite losing money in the market,
the fund had $367 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   And Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund
company, filed on June 30 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to start Fidelity Select Networking and Infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   To John C. Bogle, the retired founder of the Vanguard Group,
America's continued infatuation with technology sector funds has
not brought out the best in the mutual fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has had fads all through its history,'' Bogle
said, citing bursts of interest for atomic energy funds in the
1950s and biotechnology funds in the early 1990s. Last quarter also
saw the start of a genomics-only fund, tapping into enthusiasm over
the mapping of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to sell what we made,'' Bogle said. ``Now we make what
sells.''

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If there's such a thing as civic plagiarism,
Joseph P. Riley Jr., the six-term mayor of Charleston, S.C., and
architect of that city's downtown revitalization, did nothing on a
recent visit to upstate New York to discourage it.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings, Troy Mayor Mark
Pattison and Cohoes Mayor John T. McDonald III seemed to be on the
same page with Riley, whose philosophy is that beautiful urban
design is the way to revive dying downtowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fan of Mayor Riley's and have been for a long time,''
said Pattison, who read Riley's writings promoting urban rebirth
for years before he became the mayor of Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's reputation preceded him. He was named municipal leader
of the year in 1991 by American City and County magazine.
Washington Post columnist David S. Broder said that ``what has been
achieved here under his (Riley's) leadership is extraordinary.''
Newsweek magazine recently named Riley one of the 25 most dramatic
mayors in America.
</P>
<P>
   For a coastal city with a population of 100,000 and
approximately 500,000 in its tri-county metro area, Charleston
boasts a broad array of attractions and historic texture that have
earned it recognition as one of the most vibrant and livable cities
of its size in the country _ as well as a strong tourist
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Riley's leadership, numerous historic buildings have been
renovated and reused in the downtown historic district. Affordable
housing has been built. A picturesque Waterfront Park has been
developed. A major hotel and retail shopping complex that includes
a Saks Fifth Avenue store has opened.
</P>
<P>
   The Spoleto Festival U.S.A. draws arts lovers and extends the
tourist season. A minor-league baseball team plays downtown in a
baseball park named for Riley. A new aquarium is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminded us that we all share similar problems, but he
helped point out that we need creative solutions to make things
happen,'' said Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent tour of downtown Albany following a breakfast
meeting with the quartet of mayors, an off-the-cuff remark by Riley
that he'd gamble on an Albany rebound and snap up available
property downtown wasn't lost on Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very impressed with what he saw here,'' Jennings said.
``He said it took him 10 years to begin to turn things around in
Charleston. It's frustrating to all of us as mayors that we can't
get things done more quickly than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Experience has taught Riley, who was first elected mayor in
1975, that reviving a moribund downtown is a marathon, not a
sprint. ``The Charleston miracle,'' as its civic boosters like to
characterize it, has been a quarter-century in the works.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, Charleston was in a sorry state of decay.
``Downtown Charleston was in total disarray, overgrown and weedy,
home to drug dealers, with 1.2 million square feet of vacant
commercial space on the main street through downtown,'' recalled
Ken Gifford, who ran Charleston's downtown revitalization program
from 1975-1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made it work is that we marshaled forces in real estate
and development, took away the incentives in the suburbs and made
it more attractive to do projects downtown,'' said Gifford, a
landscape architect by training who oversees an $87 million
expansion on the campus of the State University College at
Purchase, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other factor was Joe's genius in working the
chicken-dinner circuit, selling our vision and knitting together
coalitions among blacks downtown and white suburban voters,''
Gifford said. ``It was just a lot of hard work block by block,
project by project. That's why it's taken 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In an engaging drawl, Riley displayed his Southern charm and a
talent for wringing emotion and conveying passion out of a
discussion about old buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful and invigorating cities are vital to the future of
this country,'' he said. ``What goes on in the center, the city,
sparks and shapes life for the entire region around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley drew comparisons between Albany and Charleston for their
similar size, founding in the 17th century, proximity to rivers and
the fact both have been named an All-America City. (Riley didn't
gloat about his city's temperate climate, robust recent economy,
bustling port and the Atlantic Ocean at its doorstep.)
</P>
<P>
   Riley, 57, harkened back to his childhood and a time when ``the
hysterical society'' allowed the landmark historic Charleston Hotel
to be torn down to make way for a drive-through motel. Also, the
nation's first orphanage was razed for a Sears department store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the stories of those buildings we didn't save that will
make you cry,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Historic preservation, he declared, ``has made Charleston what
it is today'' and saved downtown from ``the bland streets of
sameness'' found in most recent suburban development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historic buildings are what give a community memories,
texture, a rhythm and a pleasing scale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley recounted how he said no to high-rise public housing
projects and built them to a smaller scale and sprinkled them
throughout city neighborhoods, causing controversy. ``I can show
you beautiful public housing that started the rebirth of certain
neighborhoods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley turned thumbs down, too, on ``a big, ugly parking garage''
in downtown and made a huge drainage pump station downtown ``to
look beautiful, the way the Romans did their public works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good urban design works every time,'' he said, creating a
vibrant and diverse downtown where the poor, working-class, wealthy
suburbanites and tourists shop and linger in grand public spaces.
``There's no excuse to build anything that does not add to the
beauty,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a dead downtown and transformed it into one of the
liveliest you'll find anywhere, with billions invested and more
than 150 buildings restored,'' Riley said. ``The heart of our city
now engenders pride and nourishes our people. That's why we did
it.''

&HT;     NATIONAL DATABASE NEEDED TO REVERSE RISING CANCER RATES, GROUP
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Metropolitan Los Angeles and the San Francisco
Bay area continue to be among the top 10 locations in the world
with the highest known breast cancer rates.
</P>
<P>
   Yet California health officials won't be able to effectively
reverse the increase in cases of cancer or asthma and other
diseases until they find the causes, experts agreed at an
environmental health forum here this week.
</P>
<P>
   The missing link is a national database that would allow tracing
of chronic diseases to environmental factors such as air pollution,
pesticides, plastics and household chemicals, said community
leaders and health officials who testified at the hearing at City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have a right to know what they're carrying around in
their bodies, a right to know what they're passing along in their
breast milk,'' said Andrea Martin, founder and executive director
of the Breast Cancer Fund in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Yet people have little information, she said. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention can monitor 200 chemicals in the
human body but this year will release a study on only 25 of them,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists would like to see the United States follow the
practice of other countries of routinely monitoring breast milk,
which can contain DDT, PCBs, dioxin, PVC plastics, pesticides and
polyaromatic hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisor Michael Yaki and Rep. Nancy Pelosi
conducted the hearing as a way of drawing attention to particularly
high cancer rates here and outbreaks here and elsewhere of
childhood asthma.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the World Health Organization's International Agency
for Research on Cancer published data showing that from 1988 to
1992 non-Hispanic white women in Los Angeles County had the highest
breast cancer rate among those in monitored localities worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The bay area _ according to data on cancer rates in San
Francisco, San Mateo, Marin, Alameda and Contra Costa counties _
ranked second for non-Hispanic white women. Central California's
non-Hispanic white women ranked 13th, and black women in those
counties of the bay area ranked 20th.
</P>
<P>
   Without close surveillance, public health officials don't have
necessary data to make decisions regarding the creation of
environmental health laws, said Dr. Gina Soloman, senior scientist
at the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   She said it is difficult to link asthma to bad air days, for
instance, because it isn't a disease that doctors are required to
report.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking the disease is also spotty when it comes to such
factors as indoor pollution from mold, household chemicals, dust
mites, cockroach parts and pets. Most health databases don't
include occupational exposures, Soloman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the government phased out the insecticide
chlorpyrifos also sold as Dursban or Raid, because officials found
it in children's blood and urine in the 1980s and 1990s. They also
linked it to asthma.
</P>
<P>
   National figures show that 17 million Americans, including 5
million children, suffer from asthma, which rose 75 percent in the
United States between 1980 and 1994. The rates for children 4 and
under rose 160 percent. Health-Track, a nonprofit monitoring group,
found that 27 states don't monitor for asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Most of San Francisco's industrial sites lie in southeast San
Francisco in Bayview-Hunters Point, home to the largest minority
population. The two Superfund sites, Hunters Point Naval Shipyard
and Bay Area Drum, are located there.
</P>
<P>
   A new study conducted by Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco
revealed that people living in that area had the highest rate of
asthma hospitalizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush is making plans to put his own stamp on the
Republican convention in Philadelphia, including an unusual midweek
arrival and a push to limit attack speeches. While the convention
is slated to begin on Monday, July 31, USA Today reports that Bush
will not arrive until Wednesday, the night he is scheduled to
become the GOP's official presidential nominee. On the first two
nights of the convention Bush is expected to make visits to nearby
states that would be beamed into the convention hall by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN FOCUS ON WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore went to Pittsburgh today to appeal to core Democrats,
and said he'll fight for ``every woman in the land'' by pushing his
agenda for health care reform. He noted that women pay more for
prescription drugs, live longer and earn less than men, and have
higher overall health costs, making them the biggest winner under
his proposal to bolster Medicare. Gore's health care proposals
benefiting women, according to his background papers, include a
$3,000 tax credit for the 9 million women caring for sick or
disabled relatives.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY HIBERNATION ALMOST OVER
</P>
<P>
   After months of political hibernation and a less than
enthusiastic embrace of Al Gore, defeated Democratic presidential
candidate Bill Bradley is about to meet publicly with his former
rival in a show of solidarity. Democratic officials said Gore and
Bradley are expected to make a joint appearance next week, possibly
in Green Bay, Wis., where Bradley is expected to demonstrate his
support for the vice president. ``We are getting close on nailing
this down, but nothing is yet set in stone,'' said Eric Hauser, a
Bradley spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   THEY ALL WANT TO PLAY CENTER FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's presidential campaign is brushing aside concerns from
the Democratic Party's liberal wing to write a platform affirming
centrist stands on trade, education reform, debt reduction and
foreign intervention. Such positions in the proposed platform being
unveiled in St. Louis today underscore the Gore campaign's
determination to regain the political middle after a primary season
in which he moved to the left to beat back a challenge from Bill
Bradley. In some ways, the maneuvering by the Gore campaign
resembles efforts by George W. Bush to wrest control of his party's
platform-writing process from the most ideological elements of the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK REFORMISTAS GO FOR HAGELIN
</P>
<P>
   Positioning itself firmly against Pat Buchanan, the New York
Independence Party, the state branch of the Reform Party endorsed a
little-known physicist for president. John Hagelin hopes to wrest
the nomination from front-runner Buchanan in the nationwide,
mail-in primary that started this week. He is a founder of the
Natural Law Party, which grew out of the teachings of
Transcendental Meditation leader Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Since party
founder Ross Perot declined to run, Hagelin has emerged as the sole
challenger to Buchanan for the nomination and $12.6 million in
federal election funds.
</P>
<P>
   NADER CANDIDACY SWINGING VOTES
</P>
<P>
   George Bush is leading Al Gore among likely voters in Michigan
with an assist from Ralph Nader in a big state the Democrats won in
the last two presidential elections. Bush drew a 46-34 percent edge
in poll conducted by EPIC/MRA of Lansing (4 percentage point margin
of error) and published today in the Detroit Free Press. Green
Party candidate Ralph Nader was backed by 8 percent and likely
Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan by 3 percent. When Nader's name
was omitted from the choices, it was Bush 45 percent, Gore 40 and
Buchanan 4. Michigan has 18 electoral votes, eighth most in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   A PENNY SAVED IS A _
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore accused George W. Bush of neglecting poor children at
home in Texas because the state could lose $449 million in federal
funding for a children's health insurance program. Texas is among
dozens of states that have not used all of the federal funds
allotted them in 1997, when Congress authorized $48 billion in
matching funds for the Childrens' Health Insurance Program. The
Dallas Morning News reported that Texas has not spent $449 million
of the $561 million it received in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   SEEING DOUBLE
</P>
<P>
   Call them hedge-betters, fence-sitters or maybe just folks with
lots of money who can't make up their minds _ but at least 169
Americans have given large campaign donations to both of the major
presidential contenders. The double donors were identified through
a computer analysis of Federal Election Commission campaign records
conducted by Scripps Howard News Service. The study found that they
have given Al Gore a total of $163,000 while also handing $152,000
to George W. Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE PUSH FOR THE UNDECIDED
</P>
<P>
   Who's undecided about the presidential election? Whether it's
one in 20 or one in three depends on the poll and how much people
were pushed to make a decision. Some pollsters say nudging voters
toward a decision often yields more reliable results. ``There is a
high correlation between actual voting behavior and what they tell
you when you force the undecideds,'' said Frank Newport of the
Gallup Poll. ``The behavior you're trying to learn is the behavior
of a voter who is forced to pull a lever.'' Andrew Kohut of the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press, agrees: ``If you
don't push, you find a lot of people who won't make up their minds
even close to the election.''
</P>
<P>
   CHOOSING UP SIDES WITH TEACHERS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore appealed to the nation's teachers to make his election
fight their own, saying his race with George W. Bush boils down to
a simple question: ``Whose side are you on?'' Gore was given a
rousing reception by thousands of delegates at a convention of the
National Education Association in Chicago, as he had been a day
earlier by the American Federation of Teachers in Philadelphia.
``We are the mainstream majority,'' he declared as he sought to
energize the teachers to play a big role in battleground states
that could decide the presidential election in November.
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL BIRTHDAY `GIFTS'
</P>
<P>
   On the occasion of his 54th birthday, George W. Bush received
from Hispanic Democrats a gift of two prepaid phone cards and a
round-trip bus ticket to visit housing developments for the poor on
the Texas-Mexico border. Frumencio Reyes, vice chairman of the
Texas Democratic Party and a member of the Tejano Democrats of
Harris County, said his group hopes Bush will use one of the phone
cards to call on Texas' Republican Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey
Hutchison and ask them to rescind their opposition to El Paso
lawyer Enrique Moreno's appointment to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   PUSHING FOR OPEN TRADE IN PLATFORM
</P>
<P>
   Reaching an agreement on trade language won't be easy, but
Democrats working on party policy for the next four years insist
it's possible. Alan Blinder, an adviser to Al Gore and a former
Federal Reserve vice chairman, urged the drafting committee to
embrace open trade: ``America gets cheaper, better and more
preferred goods, and that raises the standard of living.'' He said
it isn't true that open trade causes unemployment. Blinder was
among about 50 witnesses who addressed the committee at the
University of Missouri-St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   A STAB AT CAMPAIGN REFORM
</P>
<P>
   A bill to limit California's virtually unrestricted campaign
contributions won approval in the Legislature. The Assembly passed
the measure 42-21 and sent it to Democratic Gov. Gray Davis. The
Senate already approved it 32-2. If Davis signs it, the proposal
will be put before California voters in November. Under the bill,
donors could give no more than $20,000 to a candidate for governor,
and lesser amounts for other statewide offices and the Legislature.
Political parties could contribute unlimited amounts. The limits
would not apply to any federal offices.
</P>
<P>
   FISHING FOR MORE THAN CLUES
</P>
<P>
   While political operatives and journalists fish for information
about the status of Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating in the Republican
vice presidential sweepstakes, Keating is actually set to go
fishing in Alaska next week. And it turns out that he was supposed
to have been accompanied by Dick Cheney, the man charged with
helping George W. Bush select a running mate. A few days ago,
according to the New York Times, Keating called Cheney and offered
to stay home, lest their trip set too many tongues to wagging. But
Cheney had already decided he was too busy to go.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS' CASH COLLECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee raised $60 million in the
first six months of the year, nearly half of it at a huge dinner
honoring President Clinton in May. The party had $30 million in the
bank as of July 1. The Democrats raised $26 million in the first
three months of the year and $34 million from April to June. On May
24, the party reaped $26.5 million at a single event: a tribute to
Clinton orchestrated by Terry McAuliffe, the Democrats' most
prolific fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   BLANKET PRIMARY AT ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Democratic Party in Washington state, Paul
Berendt, has threatened to go to court unless state election rules
are changed before the Sept. 19 primary to prevent a ``blanket
primary.'' Washington has long used such a system, under which
voters may choose any candidate for any party in the primary. The
Supreme Court recently struck down such wide-open primaries in a
ruling involving California. But Gary McIntosh, the Washington
elections director, said only the Legislature can change the
system.
</P>
<P>
   BOOMER DADS IN FULL
</P>
<P>
   You have your soccer moms and waitresses, but the latest
must-have voter is the boomer dad. The Christian Science Monitor
reports that sensitive, middle-aged guys will make the critical
difference in this year's presidential contest. So far, they are
swinging George W. Bush's way, despite being more in step with Al
Gore and the Democrats' views on ``soft'' issues like health care
and education.

MY MONEY, MY LIFE: LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S TRADING DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By LINDA CARROLL MARTIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am tempted to blame O.J. Simpson. It was his trial, after all,
that led me to discover how addictive live television can be.
Perhaps he is also to blame for my current, more obscure obsession.
Obscure, because I am not a broker, a financial adviser or even a
day trader. Heck, I don't even own a single share of stock
outright. So why can't I stop watching CNBC?
</P>
<P>
   First, it was idle curiosity. At home with young children during
the recent years of market fury, I wondered what financial drama
could possibly warrant minute-by-minute coverage by a cable
channel. (A silly question, considering that even the weather gets
24-hour reporting.) I quickly found CNBC's morning program,
``Squawk Box,'' to be a fair place to grab the early news. Before
long, and between my children's play dates, I was peeking in on the
Dow's ups and downs. Eventually, ``Market Wrap'' became essential
at day's end. I mean, what's news without analysis?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you just miss working in an office,'' a friend responded
to my confession. That is an interesting hypothesis, because it has
occurred to me that the CNBC staff more closely resembles a typical
office staff than the usual buffed and polished news crew. The
banter seems real and unrehearsed, and I can even pick out the
familiar workplace personalities, like the professorial fellow who
makes the pithy end-of-day comments and the guy who I suspect is
constantly primping.
</P>
<P>
   I enjoy the coverage even if I can't tell you why. I enjoy the
more peripheral content, too, like the trivia questions. (Sample:
What year did Pan Am's financial troubles ground its planes?)
Mostly I entertain myself by trying to envision the type of person
who can answer such questions. (The answer, by the way: 1991.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the commercials. I can't find a better
self-esteem boost. This channel appears to advertise only to
successful mavericks, visionaries too bright to be stifled by
conventional news sources. No ads for macaroni and cheese here, or
for toilet bowl cleaners. But you might find a pitch for Jaguars,
or a new online trading service.
</P>
<P>
   So when I watch, I, too, feel a blue chip on my shoulder. I
might even feel a little richer, too.
</P>
<P>
   I reason that my viewing habits may well be a result of a
budding midlife crisis. Aren't 40-year-olds supposed to know what
the market did yesterday? Apparently so. One morning I saw the
former drummer for Todd Rundgren (of the famed rock 'n' roll title
``Hello, It's Me''), dressed in collar and tie, offering investment
advice. Need I say more about what's become of my generation?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, I am fast becoming a wealth of eccentric
information. Eccentric, because I have not once heard mention of
the Hang Seng index in my social circles. Fortunately, market news
does occasionally seep into my real life. I am pretty sure, for
example, that I will know of breakthrough diabetes medication even
before my diabetic sister-in-law, because of reports of drug trials
that influence pharmaceutical stocks. (Just ask me about the liver
toxicity problem.)
</P>
<P>
   I am also fascinated by the reports that may be good news for
the market but bad news for most everyone else, especially to us as
consumers. Before OPEC met last month, for example, Algeria said it
was refusing to step up oil production _ a boost for the oil sector
but a signal of continuing price increases at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I am tempted to act on some of my newfound lessons by
trying my own market trades. But I can't think of a finer example
of the old saying, ``a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.''
After all, my viewing adds up to about an hour a day; if I were an
active trader _ one who subscribes to all the insider newsletters
advertised on the channel _ I would probably want to live my entire
life within view of CNBC's stock ticker. So for now, though with an
ever watchful eye, I'll leave it to the mutual fund managers to
secure my retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But I confess to one personal wish: I want to be asked for a
stock tip. Not because I have one to offer, but because, thanks to
CNBC, I know just how to deliver it _ with just the right tone,
blending swagger and style, and speaking in the plural form like
all the pros. ``We're bullish on health sciences,'' I'd say with a
nod and a furrowed brow. ``We see them on the upswing.''

&HT;     STRIKING HOSPITAL WORKERS RETURN TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Unionized hospital workers returned to work
Friday after a 24-hour strike to protest staffing levels.
</P>
<P>
   State health monitors said the hospitals were adequately staffed
during the daylong work stoppage by 4,000 members of the Service
Employees International Local 250. The walkout affect 10 hospitals
in the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Officials confirmed that unionized workers were returning to
eight of the hospitals as the strike ended at 6 a.m., although a
union spokeswoman said a lockout or extended striking remains a
possibility at two medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   Picket lines thrown up early Thursday by technicians, licensed
vocational nurses, respiratory therapists, clerks and cooks were
honored by many nurses in the California Nurses Association, who
had just settled their own contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospitals, which had 10 days to plan for the one-day
work stoppage, coped by canceling elective procedures, re-deploying
staff and, in some cases, sending patients to other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the dispute, which has been fought bitterly through
radio and television advertising, is not about wages and benefits,
but about staffing, union representatives said.
</P>
<P>
   The union charges the hospitals have not been staffing adequate
numbers of workers, resulting in work-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the strike brought Local 250 and the 10 hospitals
closer to settling their differences remained an open question.
Local 250's contracts with the hospitals expired in May, and
federal mediators are running negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The strike left the union claiming victory in educating the
public about its problems with staffing levels, which they say
threaten patient care, and other issues. The hospitals continued to
maintain their public position that the staffing issue is just a
ploy to sway public support to the union side during negotiations
over pay, benefits and job security.
</P>
<P>
   The strike involved three Catholic Healthcare West hospitals in
San Francisco, five Sutter Health medical centers, including Alta
Bates and Summit in the East Bay, and Children's Hospital in
Oakland and Alameda Hospital in Alameda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been just a very, very successful day all the way
around,'' SEIU President Sal Roselli said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did our members unite and strike unanimously,''
Roselli said, but they won support from pharmacists and physical
therapists at Catholic Healthcare West's St. Mary's, St. Francis
and Seton and from registered nurses at many of the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``So from our point of view, it's a historic day for patients
and consumers, because health care workers are uniting to force
these corporations to change the way they provide health care,''
Roselli said.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Healthcare West spokesman Robert Polzoni responded by
calling the strike by 1,600 workers at its three San Francisco
hospitals reckless and irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations will continue July 14 between the union and
hospital managers under a federal mediator.

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Miss.)  (For release on Sunday, July 9) 
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tucked all the way in the back of the top floor at
Bergdorf Goodman, behind the pillows and the coffee tables, the
Manon chocolates and the tins of caviar, is a book-filled nook
titled Jane Stubbs. And tucked behind the stacks of rare and
vintage books is a woman tucked behind an enormous shirt and thick
glasses, with the milky complexion of an attic-dwelling bookworm
who seems perennially startled at the notion of visitors. One
shopper, surveying the mounds of books jumbled on tables and
ladders and chairs, spotted her and asked, ``Do you ever look
through them?''
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs, 42, peered at her nervously. ``Oh, goodness, it's what I
do all the time,'' she answered in her soft-spoken Southern drawl.
``It's my life's mission to uncover the flotsam and jetsam of the
publishing world and force people to have libraries of same. It
tickles me so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Which would explain why this is the place to find books like
``Candy Hits'' by ZaSu Pitts, billed on its cover as ``The famous
star's own candy recipes.'' Or Edith Head's ``How to Dress for
Success,'' with the subtitle: ``In business, in love, in society,
in marriage, in school, in old age, for your husband, for your
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Book-savvy New Yorkers know Stubbs from her previous business,
Stubbs Books and Prints, which she owned with her former husband,
John Stubbs. The store, which closed in 1997 after the couple's
marriage ended, specialized in architectural books and prints,
though, as time went on, its inventory had started to include
Stubb's ``flotsam and jetsam.'' As she said, ``I'd go to book fairs
and think, If I see one more copy of `The History of American
Houses' I'll die. I looked for books that amused me and started
selling them.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's somewhat surprising to find someone like Stubbs on
the premises with Prada, but many department stores have been
searching out attractions and novelties to compete with the boom of
downtown boutiques that entice customers with everything from DJs
to computerized dogs roaming the racks.
</P>
<P>
   At Bergdorf, vintage books aren't that odd an offering; the
store already sells vintage hotel silver and tea-themed
merchandise, all of which qualify as one-of-a-kind gifts. Stubbs'
boutique has also proved popular with the store's bridal registry.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Manville, the buyer for Bergdorf's decorative home
department, says that the store's next Christmas catalog will
feature a ``well-rounded library'' assembled by Stubbs that will
include ``75 linear feet of vintage cloth and leather volumes,
first and later editions covering art, fashion, travel, gardening,
food and wine, poetry, literature and reference.'' That comes to
about 750 books. Price tag? $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Well, style-challenged men and women aren't above seeking the
counsel of a personal shopper when they need guidance getting
dressed. Why not have someone who can fashionably outfit the life
of the mind?
</P>
<P>
   ``I interview people and find out their interests,'' Stubbs
explained, settling at a table in the store's employee's cafeteria.
``I recently did a little project for Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre
Berge, for their house in Tangier. There were books on Morocco, fun
guest room things. I'm not a good houseguest myself. I hate the
idea of waking up at 3 a.m. and the panic of not finding anything
to read.'' She ran her hand through her bluntly chopped hair. ``A
lot of this business has come from my own neurosis. I traveled
around with two big bags of books for so long it was ridiculous.
I'm trying to be braver.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Stubbs' favorite projects was creating a library for Greg
Jordan, a decorator based in Manhattan. ``He wanted books on
revolution,'' she said, ``so I started with revolution in thought _
classical ideas, political thought and philosophy and ended with
modern-day armed revolutions, which included biographies and
decorative arts of an era under that umbrella. I was given a
deadline of six weeks to fill 150 feet. It was hard but a great
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs finds her merchandise at book fairs, flea markets,
sometimes even on the Internet, though there is nothing else about
her that seems remotely contemporary. She seems to have stepped out
of a story by Flannery O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Natchez, Miss., she described her mother,
with a demure smile, as ``absolutely barking, howling mad.'' She
continued: ``My earliest memories are of going to country auctions
with her. She had a little antique shop she ran from time to time,
unless she couldn't get out of her bed. We lived in a very
beautiful house and she had a remarkable eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs' father died when she was 12. ``My mother had her pilot's
license, and she flew me to summer camp in her little airplane,''
she recalled. ``I got to steer. It was so dramatic. But then she
forgot about me. I stayed with the owner of the camp for three days
after it ended. She was off somewhere _ what could you do?'' She
sighed. ``She was a combination of highs and lows. At that early
age I learned that everything had a price.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite escape was reading. ``It's all I've ever really
done,'' she said. ``I came to New York in 1981 with a suitcase and
13 boxes of books.'' She planned to attend film school, but instead
married John Stubbs, a distant cousin, and their business began.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Between the store's demise and her reincarnation at Bergdorf,
which started last December, Stubbs mounted exhibitions for the
Municipal Arts Society. ``I had a little sinking spell, and then I
bounced up,'' she said with a shy smile. ``It was hard to turn 40,
have my husband leave me for a younger person and have my business
close. But they all were the best possible things. I never would
have had the courage to go out on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   We returned to the book nook so she could help me assemble a
theoretical collection. Though her custom-made libraries are
ordered by the linear foot, individual books here sell mostly in
the $75-to-$300 range _ which is why I was sticking to the
theoretical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people to choose what reflects their interests,''
Stubbs said. ``It's crazy to have just what is considered to be
classic literature if it has nothing to do with people's interests.
You have to make a library a living thing. One of the goals is to
have it in place, then add to and subtract from it as the household
grows and acquires new interests. I'm as fond as the next person of
beautiful bindings, but it's boring to have pristine fancy bindings
of books that never leave the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   I told her that I liked reading cookbooks, biographies,
especially about show business, and anything about behavior, past
and present.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant there was a pile before me:
</P>
<P>
   ``How to Do It, or the Lively Art of Entertaining'' by Elsa
Maxwell was first. I paged through and read, ``In someone else's
house, above all leave the furniture alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was ``Our Favourite Dish: The Theatre Recipe Book,''
a compilation of 250 recipes contributed by members of the
``British Theatrical Profession.'' One look at Adele Dixon's
``Stuffed Rashers of Bacon'' convinced me to put it right down.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the idea of staying in bed with ``The Heart Has Its
Reasons: The Memoirs of the Duchess of Windsor,'' and I also loved
``The Working Girl Must Eat,'' whose cover read: ``This cookbook,
with its menus, recipes and instructions for almost a hundred
easy-to-get dinners, was written especially for this girl and the
thousands like her who hold down jobs and also do some
housekeeping. Open it anywhere and see why she is still smiling
when dinner is on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs also suggested ``The Top Drawer: Random Recollections by
One Who Was Born in It.'' Published in 1928, its author remains
anonymous. Then she found ``Reno,'' a novel about divorce by
Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr., and ``The Title Market,'' a novel by
Emily Post, about the fine art of marrying a man with a title.
</P>
<P>
   She had read all these books and described each one lovingly. I
asked what she was reading now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curious Punishments of Bygone Days,'' by Alice Earle, she said
promptly. ``It's a history of public punishment in America. I'm in
the dunking chapter now. I was reading it while I had a pedicure
yesterday.'' She sighed. ``It just gives me so much pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably doesn't even occur to her to shop at places like
Barnes &AMP; Noble, much less worry about them as competition.

<P>
   DULUTH, Minn. _ On the street here these days you hear French,
Swedish, Russian, Japanese and at least half a dozen other foreign
tongues. It's not tourists who give the city this cosmopolitan air,
but business executives slinging around expressions like
``informationsteknologi'' (Swedish for ``information technology'')
and ``keizai kaihatsu'' (Japanese for ``economic development'').
</P>
<P>
   Not too bad for a city that 80 years ago, under the alias
Zenith, was branded as hopelessly small-minded and provincial by
Sinclair Lewis in his novel ``Babbitt.''
</P>
<P>
   Duluth is still no New York or Los Angeles, of course. Or even a
place like Rochester, home of the Mayo Clinic. But it has focused
more on the wider world not just because of its shipping trade
through the Great Lakes but also because of its sister-city program
_ the nonprofit city-to-city network inspired by President Dwight
D. Eisenhower's suggestion in 1956 that citizen diplomacy might
lessen the chance of future world conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which really took off around the United States in
the 1970s and '80s, began largely with international cultural
exchanges, and support for health and education. Now the emphasis
is changing to a more bottom-line approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new interest in business and economic
development,'' said Lewis F. Harwood, a spokesman for Sister Cities
International, the U.S. service association based in Washington
that administers the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see it last April at an international conference in
Merida, Mexico, where representatives from about 20 American cities
came looking for international business links and trade
opportunities with other municipalities throughout the Americas,''
Harwood said. ``We think they were quite successful at making these
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic development has long been pursued at the national level
by the Commerce Department, Harwood acknowledged. And states and
large municipalities, which can afford to have offices of economic
development and send trade missions around the world, have long
been doing business internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, more and more cities are reaching out
internationally through city-to-city relationships. ``It's
definitely a trend,'' Harwood said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some people think the program is a waste of time and
money. In the early 1990s, for example, an editorial writer in
Duluth wondered aloud what the city's mayor was doing in Japan on
what the writer called a sister-city ``junket'' when he ought to be
at home in Minnesota minding the store. But despite such sniping,
this city and many others are hoping to use the program more
actively to pursue development projects in a globalizing economy.
</P>
<P>
   And in the case of Duluth that switch in emphasis to
international business seems to have been, at least in part, a
recognition of problems in the local economy. Between 1980 and
1990, for example, the Duluth-Superior, Wis., region lost more than
26,000 people, increasing the incentive for local officials to take
advantage of every possible program.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1999, about 1,280 U.S. cities were involved in the
sister-city program, some more deeply than others. Seattle, for
example, has 20 sister cities around the world, from Christchurch,
New Zealand, to Haiphong, Vietnam. New York City has six, including
Madrid, Spain, and Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Duluth now has four: Thunder Bay, Canada; Ohara, Japan;
Petrozavodsk, Russia; and Vaxjo, Sweden. These partnerships have
generated over $10 million in direct revenue for the city over the
last few years, according to Duluth's mayor, Gary L. Doty.
</P>
<P>
   More important, programs that started as cultural ties have
become profit-centered enterprises. The Duluth-Vaxjo link, for
example, resulted in an ambitious project that its investors, who
anted up $24 million, hope will make Duluth a major port for
information technology as it has long been for timber, grain and
iron ore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Doty led a delegation to Vaxjo seeking to expand
cultural exchanges based on the Swedish heritage of a large segment
of the city's population. But it was something they stumbled on in
the nearby town of Ronneby that provided the big inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, the city of Ronneby had been host to a technology
campus that brought together under one roof about 100
high-technology businesses, branches of academic institutions,
professors working as research-and-development consultants, and
students taking classes and serving internships. Such interactions
at the campus, Soft Center Ronneby, provide among other things a
sorely needed supply of well-trained information technology
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we should be doing,'' Doty exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. McNamara, who had joined the delegation as a
representative of the Duluth Chamber of Commerce, got the message,
too. ``It's a school-to-work model for the information-technology
industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, a four-story technology campus rose in downtown
Duluth, financed by city, state and private money. It is one of a
growing number of such centers throughout the world based on the
Ronneby model.
</P>
<P>
   Christened Soft Center Duluth, the enterprise held an open house
for prospective tenants last month. Visitors came from England,
Scotland, France, Norway, West Africa, South Africa, Canada and
many parts of the United States. The building is now 30 percent
occupied, by tenants including academic institutions,
high-technology concerns and a big-name investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center is attracting the kind of tenants they want at a
somewhat slower rate than anticipated,'' said Kjell Knudsen, dean
of the School of Business and Economics at the University of
Minnesota-Duluth, who once served as an unpaid board member of the
Soft Center. ``But the prospect is that it will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those working at the video terminals in the new building
recently was Joe Allert, 19, a sophomore majoring in business at
the Soft Center branch of the University of Minnesota-Duluth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here because I like the idea of having educational
institutions in the same building as employers and even Salomon
Smith Barney and other business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Duluth's sister-city partnerships are focused on
hard-headed business plans. The relationship with Petrozavodsk is
thus far purely philanthropic, recently involving an effort to
raise funds for clothing and supplies for children in orphanages.
And the link with Thunder Bay, only a few hours away by car, is
largely cultural.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But another tie that may result in a business deal is Duluth's
relationship with Ohara, which set the stage for all four of
Duluth's sister-city partnerships. This tie began during the U.S.
occupation of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   One night, a gang of sailors from the heavy cruiser Duluth
returned from shore leave with a 750-pound, medieval temple gong in
tow. The bronze gong, covered with ancient inscriptions and
fanciful dragons, is recognized in Japan as a national treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The captain considered the gong a legitimate war trophy and
arranged to have it delivered to the ship's namesake: the city of
Duluth. For the next decade, the gong was on display first in City
Hall and then suspended in a shuro, or gazebolike structure, in
Duluth's Enger Park.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, a visiting Japanese college professor happened to see
the gong. He explained to Duluth's mayor how important it was to
Japan, and asked to have it returned.
</P>
<P>
   A lengthy correspondence followed, and eventually the gong was
sent back to Ohara _ a small fishing village 90 miles southeast of
Tokyo from which it had been taken. In gratitude, the Japanese
delivered a full-scale replica of the gong for display in Enger
Park.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Duluth and Ohara became sister cities. And last month a
group of 15 visiting Japanese dignitaries and several dozen
Duluthians held a ceremony in Enger Park to rededicate the replica
as a symbol of peace and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
   A soprano sang the Japanese national anthem and then the
American. Next, Doty and Soichiro Oya, a petroleum entrepreneur who
led the Japanese sister-city delegation, jointly clanged the gong
with a huge striker in the name of everlasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, the conversation turned to golf.
</P>
<P>
   While golf is an expensive sport in Japan, where the links are
crowded and reservations hard to come by, Duluth, by contrast, is a
golfer's paradise, ranked by Golf Digest as the best of the United
States' 309 small cities for access to good, affordable links.
</P>
<P>
   So why not market golfing vacations in Duluth for Japanese
tourists?
</P>
<P>
   Carl Seehus, Duluth's director of parks and recreation and a
former director of the city's sister-city program, was talking up
the idea. And Oya, an avid golfer, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last decade was for cultural exchanges,'' Oya added. ``The
next decade will be for business.''

DOES OUR ENERGY POLICY HAVE SPINE OR SPIN? (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat
it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ George Santayana
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems we can't learn for forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   The energy crunch of the 1970s confronted American political
statesmanship with its severest test since World War II. Yet, for
all the lessons it taught, some of us might as well have amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   How may of us remember 1973? '79?
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices tripled while motorists queued up for blocks to
get a tank full. New England couldn't get sufficient home heating
oil; big northern cities suffered natural gas shortages, utility
rates in rural Texas went through the roof. Driven by soaring
energy prices, the inflation reached double digits.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC cartel was showing it could jerk our economy up and
down like a yo-yo.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we muddled through and launched bold comprehensive plans
to avert any future repetition of that experience. They were good
plans, long-term bipartisan plans. Members of both parties
participated, working with Presidents Ford and Carter. It was a
matter of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Never more would America be hostage to foreign oil producers, we
swore. We'd become energy independent, whatever the cost!
</P>
<P>
   Then, the crisis past, we began thinking that some of the plans
were a trifle uncomfortable. New political leaders and consumer
trendsetters began plucking the leaves, one by one, from the flower
of energy independence.
</P>
<P>
   Energy was old hat, and, after all, who cared?
</P>
<P>
   Tax incentives for energy-efficient homes, cars and factories
fell to a new idol of tax ``reform'' in 1986. The 55 mph speed
limit saved energy and lives but became politically inconvenient
and was abolished. Inducements for domestic oil exploration;
investment in alternate energy sources; plans for quality mass
transit: all fell like so much grass before a mower.
</P>
<P>
   With steady resolve, we could have been energy-independent by
now. Instead, we're more dependent on oil imports than we were in
the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   We're driving SUVs, and hinting at placating motorists by
suspending the taxes that build our highways. We're counting on
diplomats to talk Arab producers into selling us more crude.
</P>
<P>
   So here sits America, like a pitiful alcoholic at the bar,
pleading with OPEC for just a little more of the joy juice. A hair
of the dog!
</P>
<P>
   Oil is addictive, surely enough. And the politics of oil seem
inherently divisive. They split consuming states from producing
states.
</P>
<P>
   But we're a nation, after all, and a transcendent national
interest is at stake. The three Es _ energy, economy and
environment _ are inseparably interlinked. And price is a function
of supply.
</P>
<P>
   The only way we can control our own destiny in the long run is
to adopt a long-range plan and stick with it until we do achieve,
or at least approximate, domestic energy-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Pandering to voters in an election year by offering to suspend
the gasoline tax _ which builds American highways and public
transportation systems _ would be, it seems to me, the very worst
form of a copout.
</P>
<P>
   The pay-as-we-go Highway Trust Fund is one of America's great
success stories. It has built the world's greatest highway system
without adding a penny to the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Our interstate highways, which it finances, have generated
private job-creating investments along their routes of easily $50
for every tax dollar that went into their construction.
</P>
<P>
   If we were foolish enough to wipe those taxes out, we'd shave
mere pennies off the price of gas at the pump _ and have to come up
with some new tax to pay for our roads. It's a non-policy.
</P>
<P>
   A balanced energy policy must include incentives to maximize
domestic exploration and ultimate recovery, and promote fuel
conservation, public ground transportation and alternate
environment-friendly fuels. And we'd have to stick with it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately I see no comprehensive plan emerging from
Congress. I hear none advocated. The prevailing mood in the GOP
House is to avoid doing anything bold. It is better, present
congressional leaders think, just to appear to do something while
actually doing very little.
</P>
<P>
   Recent House votes have been shams, masquerading as real
campaign finance reform, actual Medicare coverage of prescription
drugs and effective authority to sell medicines to sick people in
Cuba. The bills are illusory as mirages. None of the three does
what it pretends to do.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the public sees through the pretense.
</P>
<P>
   Congress needs leadership with spine, not spin.

MUCKING ABOUT BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July   09)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the high drama of the impeachment saga we have lurched down
into low comedy. How low can we go? Try this:
</P>
<P>
   The media flack for Kenneth W. Starr, President Clinton's
persecutor, is now going to trial on criminal charges that he
leaked sensitive info from the Starr chamber inquisition to The New
York Times. The Justice Department is accusing Charles Bakaly III
of telling the Times that Starr had concluded in January of last
year that he had constitutional authority to indict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal. A press secretary leaking something to The New York
Times. Happens hundreds of times a day. Before it becomes ``all the
news that's fit to print'' it is probably going to be leaked, if
it's juicy enough. Been going on that way since the printing press
was invented.
</P>
<P>
   What's different now is the way judges twist and turn and
wriggle their way into the great mass of things that should be left
untouched. Stewing in their own juice is quite often the proper
remedy for things political. But Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of
the federal district court in D.C. is one of the many federal
judges who seem bent on making a career out of the Bill-and-Monica
romp. She ordered Bakaly to trial over his bit part in the farce.
</P>
<P>
   So the flack gets hung out to dry, joining such characters as
Linda Tripp and Julie Hiatt Steele as footnotes in this endless
circus. Federal judges have wide powers, and apparently wider egos;
their penchant for keeping this scandal-pot boiling at monstrous
cost to the taxpayers is incredible. The news biz plays its part
dutifully. ``Editors at The Times have said they do not and will
not discuss the sources for the article,'' the Times intoned
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This comes at a time when we need to see and hear less about
judges, it seems to me. The loftiest judge of New Hampshire has
just been recommended for impeachment by that state Legislature's
Judiciary Committee. Chief Justice David Brock stands accused of
trying to fix cases by intervening with other judges. Justice David
Thayer resigned rather than face charges he tried to fix his own
divorce trial. A third justice claimed his fellow judges routinely
took part in discussions of cases from which they were
disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not just the buttinsky judges of the Clinton Scandal
Machine era who are playing favorites and putting their money on
partisan political horses. With 1 million lawyers practicing in
America, it seems judges are trying to find work for all of them.
Why do they call it ``practice'' anyway? Isn't practice supposed to
make perfect? Do they ever get it right?
</P>
<P>
   The proper place for a lot of this stuff to be evaluated and
either acted upon or ignored is in the political process. Let the
voters pass on Clinton and his associates, his fund-raising, Al
Gore's culpability, Hillary's carpetbagging nerve, etc. Junking up
the legal process with these two-bit cases that waste court time
and cost taxpayers money is a fruitless exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The voters are not short of opinions. A recent column in which I
praised Clinton's job performance sparked a flurry of responses.
Some sample excerpts: ``I would vote for Bill Clinton in a minute.
He is one of the smartest presidents we have ever had. One stupid
mistake. So if we checked around the others I am sure we would find
mistakes in their lives. I am 80 years of age plus. . . . I am from
Texas but Al is my man. Dorothy Warren.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Texan read the column in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram,
``lovingly known as the StartleGram which is why your column is
printed, I am sure. . . . We do not need King Billy or his Queen
any longer. We can really thank the conservative leadership in this
country for `his' accomplishments by keeping `him' in check and
pointing out the truths about him. Carey Rector.''
</P>
<P>
   That dim view was echoed by Amos Cliff of Texas. ``Good God,
man. What is in the air in Boston? . . . I can understand how
living in a state that elected and reelects a clown like Ted
Kennedy must warp your perception of reality. . . . (I)n spite of
your prediction about his approval ratings, the majority of the
American people and history will remember Bill as just another dark
period we came through together.''
</P>
<P>
   James Harper of Everman, Texas, read it in the Stephenville
(Texas) Empire Tribune. His comments: ``Dear David:,
HHHhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiya! (Pause. Budweiser sip ) HHHHhhhhhhiiiiiiiya!
Many Texans are not charmed by the Clintons, as birds out of the
Oleander bush and Johnson (LBJ) Grass. Not one dog on my street
could be talked off of the meat wagon by Bill Clinton or Slick
Hillie (as we call Hillary R.) . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Equally unconvinced was Dennis Roberson of e-mail land, who is
recovering from gastric disturbance: ``I just read your column. . .
. (I)t made me vomit. I want a president who will not look me in
the eye every day and willfullly lie to me over and over (and do
the same thing to his wife, daughter, cabinet, vice president,
etc.). (Clinton) is a self-serving, lying snake. Sure, you and your
kind will be wanting Slick Willie back in the year 2001. Because
you're weak.''
</P>
<P>
   To Dick Gibbs Ellis, Maximum Bill is ``The Great Prevaricator.''
Ellis believes in Ronald Reagan and Louis Rukeyser and The Wall
Street Journal editorials. Clinton was smart? ``So was Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   To Jim Lockwood of Hot Springs, Ark., Clinton is ``the most
skilled manipulator of our time, also the luckiest. . . . We would
be where we are today with him or without him. . . . I can never
respect him for what I perceive to be expediency . . .
insincerity.''
</P>
<P>
   The mail on that column was about evenly divided, but I give the
critics more space today because I had my shot last time. The point
is that the voting booth is the place to decide these issues. Not
the courtroom, nor the judge's chambers.

 &HT;    CLINTON DECLARES LINCOLN'S RETREAT A NATIONAL MONUMENT
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To escape the brutal heat of the 19th century White
House, President Abraham Lincoln would venture a few miles north,
to a 14-room Gothic-revival cottage surrounded by trees.
</P>
<P>
   The residence, where Lincoln wrote the final draft of the
Emancipation Proclamation, in more recent years has led a less
prominent existence as office space in a beautifully landscaped
housing complex for military retirees.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared Lincoln's summer home a national
monument Friday, ensuring that the residence will no longer be home
to conference tables, fax machines and copiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is fragile, vital history in this house,'' Clinton said.
``Today we come to reclaim it, to preserve it, and to make it live
again.''
</P>
<P>
   At a morning ceremony, the president also announced $15 million
in grants by Save America's Treasures _ including a $750,000 award
for the cottage _ to preserve historic sites nationwide. The
cottage site was renamed the President Lincoln and Soldiers' Home
National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the residence ``has almost been forgotten for more
than a century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, more than 1 million people visited Ford's Theater
alone. But barely 100 made it here to Anderson Cottage, where
Lincoln lived and worked; where his son played and his wife found
solace.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ceremony culminated a five-year quest for David Long,
professor of history at East Carolina University in Greenville,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   On a private tour of the residence in 1995, Long said he
experienced an epiphany as he stood in the room where Lincoln
drafted the Emancipation Proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: 'We're sitting in a place as important to American
liberty and independence as Independence Hall, Philadelphia, and
nobody knows about it. Something has to be done to preserve the
historic importance of this building.''
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, a member of the tour group was a close
friend of Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   Moe immediately became interested in the project and called
Long, who flew to Washington to make a presentation that started
the process.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's ceremony, Long marveled that the cottage ``sat here
unknown'' for 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even most Lincoln historians didn't know of the existence of
this place. It's absolutely amazing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Long said that Lincoln spent one-fourth of his presidency at the
summer house and that the family loved staying there, especially
Lincoln's wife, Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the one place that she found happiness during that
presidency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cottage also provided the president and his family relief
from the environment around the White House, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington was an awful place in the 1860s,'' he said. ``They
had an open sewer that ran next to the White House. You have to
remember this thing was built on swampland. In the summer it would
get hot and muggy and almost unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   Long said that ``if everything comes to fruition,'' the grounds
will eventually be home to a center for the study of the Lincoln
presidency, with the cottage as a centerpiece. He hopes the final
project will include a shrine that celebrates Lincoln and the
central act of his presidency _ the Emancipation Proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the national monument designation under the 1906
Antiquities Act, designed to protect sites and objects of antiquity
on federal land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservation applies not only to places of great natural
splendor, but to places of great national import. This cottage in
its way is just as precious as a giant sequoia, as irreplaceable as
the ruins of cultures long past,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government purchased the land in 1851 to establish a
home for invalid and disabled soldiers of the U.S. Army, the first
such attempt to provide for members of the regular army.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Soldiers Home, it was also used as a summer retreat
by Presidents Buchanan, Hayes and Arthur. It is known as Anderson
Cottage in honor of Major Robert Anderson, the commanding officer
at Fort Sumter at the outbreak of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The grants announced by the White House are being awarded by
Save America's Treasures, a partnership of the White House
Millennium Council, the National Park Service and the National
Trust or Historic Preservation.

 &HT;    MEXICO'S RULING PARTY DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO IN DEFEAT
 &HT;    RESENDING TO FIX TRANSMISSION GARBLES
 &HT;    With MEXICO-REVOLUTION
 &HT;    For Sunday, July 9
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ When it suffered public repudiation in 1968 for
gunning down students demanding freedom of speech, Mexico's ruling
party recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, when its top officials engaged in fratricidal
assassinations to settle scores and mismanaged the economy so badly
that the peso's value was slashed in half, the party regrouped.
</P>
<P>
   But after last Sunday, Mexico's legendary Institutional
Revolutionary Party, the PRI, is facing its ultimate test. Can it
survive the shock of finally losing Mexico's presidency _ its seat
of power _ for the first time in 71 years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said Rafael Oseguera, the PRI's vice coordinator in the
federal Chamber of Deputies. An optimist, Oseguera didn't let
defeat stop him from jetting off to Madrid, Spain, for a
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't reject any reforms as we consider our future,'' he
said before he leaving. ``The colors of the party, the name, the
symbol, everything. We have to have a revolution inside the PRI so
it can enter a new stage.''
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a crushing defeat Sunday to presidential
opposition challenger Vicente Fox Quesada, the long knives came out
at PRI headquarters, a stark gray cement complex in Mexico City
that matches supporters' funereal mood right now.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has lost governors races before, but seven decades of
control over the powerful federal government are not relinquished
easily or without rancor.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida, wept
after losing last Sunday's election. Insiders say PRI member were
utterly stunned. They fully expected its vaunted electoral machine
to muster enough voters who'd always marched to the polls like
sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, voters handed the PRI a crisis, and an already fragile
conglomeration of divergent political tendencies and interests have
exploded into warfare. The president and secretary general tried to
resign ``in the name of dignity,'' but were persuaded to stay until
the party holds a convention to chart its future.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI was born from the Mexican Revolution, and ever since
1929 it has remained in power by employing a flexible ideology
borrowed from socialism, capitalism, nationalism _ and most will
admit now, intimidation, favoritism and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   As it slides into second place _ second in Congress and the
Senate _ the party doesn't seem to have a clear message or reason
for being. The one thing it could surely offer _ access to
executive power _ is gone.
</P>
<P>
   If it can summon its warring factions, it may remake itself as a
center-left party with a huge task: convincing Mexicans it's become
a modern political party that will represent people's interests
instead of lining its pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the party's old guard, known as the ``dinosaurs,''
are furious at Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo for supporting
free-market economic reforms that extended the gap between rich and
poor and making the PRI look unrevolutionary. They are also upset
at Zedillo for appearing to cozy up to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo is a Yale-educated economist who was pushed into running
for president in 1994 when candidate Luis Donaldo Colosiouchable
authority _ with caring more about his personal image as a reformer
than the party's future.
</P>
<P>
   For many, a symbolic insult was seeing Zedillo congratulate Fox
before returns were officially in on election night and watching
the two embrace the next day in the presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI should distance itself from the current president of
the Republic because for six years he dedicated himself to changing
party leaders at will and dismantling the strength of our political
organization,'' said a stricken Manuel Fuentes, who resigned a
month ago from a top party post.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-PRI attitude of Zedillo has been manifested,''
Fuentes said. ``He played Gorbachev and ended up affecting our
party.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``technocrats,'' Zedillo's wing of the PRI _ some of whom
were in charge of Labastida's campaign _ say they prefer to
modernize the party and prepare it for competition, while
continuing to guide Mexico into global capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reach out to the new thinking of society _ and
young people with new values,'' said Javier Trevino, a
Harvard-educated international affairs advisor to Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   And outside the PRI, there are those who believe the party has
become, mostly, a collection of crooks.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who reveled in such attacks during the campaign, was
magnanimous in victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the great opportunity the PRI has to make itself a
real political party,'' Fox said. ``Certainly defeat is painful.
But defeat can also be a departure point for reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Edna Jaime, who studies the PRI, said a
bloodbath after defeat ``is totally natural. The first phase of the
PRI's restructuring is going to be one of lynchings and looking for
scapegoats. But if there is something we know about the PRI, it's
that it is pragmatic.''
</P>
<P>
   But already, signs are strong that the PRI governors of the
southern states, where the party still reigns and has a strong
machine, are rising to the top of the boiling cauldron.
</P>
<P>
   Tabasco governor Roberto Madrazo, who ran in second place
against Labastida in a gimmicky primary election last fall, appears
eager to capture the leadership that's up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately released a letter to the party urging it to
pursue ``the recuperation of our social essence'' as an alternative
to Fox's National Action Party, the PAN. Even among many voters who
choose Fox this time, the PAN is perceived as too conservative,
Catholic and indifferent to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But someone like Madrazo, who is so lean and hungry, knows he
can't win the presidency just on a populist platform,'' said
political analyst Federico Estevez. ``He's also got to re-invent
imself and appeal to a modern Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The technocrats, Estevez said, are the ones who could get their
marching orders right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always Cuba,'' he joked. ``They need people like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the southern governors are lining up with Madrazo, along
with the large PRI-affiliated teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   Other PRI labor unions, part of the party's old political
infrastructure, seem paralyzed, unsure of what to do next. The oil
workers' union issued a statement to Fox, reiterating its
opposition to all attempts to privatize Mexico's oil _ a move Fox
has already said he won't make.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows if this will happen, but the party would do well to
dissolve PRI associations such as the ``Peasant Torch,'' an
organization that mobilizes lower-income supporters to intimidate
the opposition in provinces, Estevez said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a band of ``Peasant Torch'' members in Mexico state
rose up in a violent but isolated protest against what they
charged, ironically, was electoral fraud against the PRI in local
mayors' elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're shock troops, `` Estevez said, ``so maybe now, like
good old soldiers, they'll just fade away.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: ART CAN BE TRANSPORTING, EVEN IN SONGS OF
MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   by ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The song starts like a horror movie, before the credits roll:
the family at home, Daddy tucking in Baby, safe and sound. Then the
music turns from tender to creeping, and the listener realizes that
Daddy is the monster. ``Kim,'' one of the songs that has made
Eminem's second album, ``The Marshall Mathers LP,'' a summer
scandal, is a view of horrific domestic violence from inside the
mind of the abuser.
</P>
<P>
   With no names changed to protect the hardly innocent, Eminem
relates a fantasy of murdering his real-life wife in revenge for
her leaving him for another man. The rapper performs both his own
rant and the woman's screams; sometimes the voices of victim and
killer are nearly interchangeable. Spewing enmity, confessing love,
Eminem fully occupies the mind-set of rage, his hysterical tone
belying any justifications he utters. The song records damnation,
not triumph. This is Frankenstein batting dead the human he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim'' is no fun as a listening experience; unlike most Eminem
songs, it offers few jokes and no distance from its grisly
viciousness. Eminem doesn't let himself off the hook this time; he
even calls himself by his given name, Marshall, instead of Slim
Shady, the pseudonym he usually invokes to suggest he doesn't mean
all the awful things he says.
</P>
<P>
   This willingness to engage in ``Kim'' makes it the best track on
``The Marshall Mathers LP.'' That's not to say it is morally
uplifting or good educational material. But because it stays with
the hate Eminem usually deploys with a casual sneer, ``Kim''
reveals something about such rancor: that it comes from weakness
and breeds despair. ``I don't want to go on living in this world
without you,'' Eminem wails flatly in the chorus, even as he makes
that horrible solitude his reality.
</P>
<P>
   As another media-based campaign against popular music grows
after assaults on women in Central Park last month, it is useful to
remember that songs like ``Kim'' follow a respected path in popular
music. ``Kim'' is a murder ballad, like ``The Banks of the Ohio''
or ``Pretty Polly,'' favorites sung for a century by
family-oriented folk singers. Its closest antecedent may be
``Delia's Gone,'' which Johnny Cash transformed from a traditional
narrative to a psychological confession in 1962 and which reappears
on the Man in Black's new box set, ``Love, God and Murder''
(Legacy). ``If I hadn't shot poor Delia, I'd have had her for my
wife,'' intones a grim Cash, now unhappily mated to her ghost.
</P>
<P>
   To our ears, the murder ballads of old can sound quaintly
formal, but when they first emerged, they were chillingly
immediate, functioning as both journalism and myths that many
people believed. Artists like Cash and Nick Cave, whose 1998 album,
``Murder Ballads,'' translated the form into macabre gothic rock,
touch the form's forbidding core. Eminem updates it further by
avoiding the moral that usually comes at the end of folk songs,
which leave their murderers in jail or at the gallows. ``Kim''
better suits a time when morality is in flux and, in fantasy at
least, the killers often get away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killer in me is the killer in you,'' Billy Corgan sang in
``Disarm,'' another song about perilous eroticism. The murder
ballad form endures because it offers vivid insight into the
confusion of desire. This is one thing popular music can do:
because of the immediacy of artists' voices and the compact
structure of songs, they can cut to the heart of feelings that
remain subservient to narrative in fiction or film. And because
songs blare everywhere from radios and stereos, they make those
emotions possible to talk about and symbolically try on.
</P>
<P>
   Two other murder ballads were hits this year, both from a
viewpoint many contemporary listeners consider justified instead of
corrupt. ``Earl,'' by the Dixie Chicks, turned the murder ballad
comic with its peppy tale of a woman's bloody revenge against an
abusive husband. ``Love Is Blind,'' by the rapper Eve, more closely
resembles ``Kim'' in its unflinching account of homicidal fury,
again in revenge, for a friend killed by her boyfriend. These songs
raised cheers from women who felt empowered by them, yet they, too,
traveled to muddy gray areas of the psyche, where the battle of the
sexes becomes a bloody mess.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits can't resist speculating that all this hate in music
fuels line-crossing behavior like that in Central Park. Several
reports have suggested that the men who assaulted women there
chanted hip-hop lyrics while doing it. Yet hateful lyrics may not
be the biggest musical inspiration for lewd behavior. For that,
consider another time-honored song form: the bawdy blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thong Song,'' by Sisqo, a jumpy, bumpy account of a man's near
nervous breakdown at the sight of a woman's underwear, may be the
single of the year, complementing Eminem's chart-topping album.
It's become the veritable MTV theme song, the perfect accompaniment
to all that bikini jiggle on the network. Along with Lou Bega's
``Mambo No. 5'' and the endless pandering display of girlish flesh
in fashion and on teen-age-oriented television, ``Thong Song'' is
emblematic of the current peep-show mood, one that may help explain
group behavior like the spree in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   For a feminist critic like me to defend ``Thong Song'' seems
absurd. Yet as fluffy and crude as it is, this hit, with its
quadruple-time beat and breathy vocal, does a fine job of capturing
the queasiness of lust. It is as American as a murder ballad, with
its roots in the barroom come-ons of icons like Bessie Smith and Ma
Rainey and the eye-rolling humor of Louis Jordan and Cab Calloway.
</P>
<P>
   Murder ballads and bawdy blues open avenues of desire that are
usually repressed: jealousy and humiliation in the former,
untrammeled lust in the latter. Right now, these emotions run high
in our culture, not only because many Americans have long repressed
them with an essentially puritanical view of sex, but also because
the long sexual revolution that has counteracted that legacy
remains incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Women continue to assert themselves more strongly, sexually as
well as in every other way, but rarely do they or men have the
tools to deal with genuine sexual openness. Some men still respond
to women's liberation with anger or juvenile excitement. And on
occasion, either in the privacy of their abusive relationships or
in the madness of a crowd, they decide it's okay to want to kill
those bold women, or they want to rip their clothes off and see the
thong.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial songs of this spring and summer not only
reflect those impulses; they also uncover them. But that is one
essential function of art _ to transport its audience to the places
within their own souls that they might otherwise avoid. The
artist's responsibility is to accept the job of a guide _ not a
role model or an educator but a messenger in the playful style of
the ancient Hermes, the trickster who nonetheless must be careful
when taking his charges into the psychic underworld. As for the
fans, it's important to remember that their fantasies may not have
a place in other people's lives and to use the utmost care in
opening up to the gray areas that music touches.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Unusually hot weather will linger over most of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley, where high temperatures of more than 95 degrees
will be common. The central and southern Rockies will not be as hot
as in recent days because the arrival of moist air will promote
increased afternoon clouds and scattered thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of thunderstorms will gradually dissipate early
Saturday over the northern and central Great Lakes states. But a
new area of thunderstorms will erupt over northern Minnesota late
Saturday and will drift east into Wisconsin and Michigan Saturday
night. Locally heavy rain will heighten the risk of flooding,
especially where recurrent thunderstorms pass over ground saturated
by recent rain.
</P>
<P>
   After a chilly dawn in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states,
ample sunshine in most areas will increase temperatures to
comfortable levels Saturday afternoon. A few light showers will
linger in the cool air mass over northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: PALL OF SMOKE
</P>
<P>
   Near Fairbanks, Alaska, where the peaks of the Alaska Range more
than 100 miles away are usually visible, smoke from forest fires
has blocked the view since June 23. Gently sinking air associated
with high pressure has limited the vertical dispersion of the
smoke, resulting in the persistent pall. Fires are common over
interior Alaska in summer when lightning from scattered
thunderstorms ignites dry vegetation.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Mike Masaoka wrote in 1940 that he was
proud to be ``an American citizen of Japanese ancestry'' and loved
his country, he was a brash young idealist expressing a lifelong
devotion that some say made him an important civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   But 60 years later, the late Masaoka has become the focus of a
seething controversy over a national monument that will carry his
name and the words he wrote long ago _ words that critics say mask
the painful legacy of his disputed wartime leadership in the days
following Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka is among seven individuals including the newly nominated
commerce secretary, former Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., whose
quotations will grace the $11 million National Japanese American
Memorial to Patriotism, which will be dedicated in Washington,
D.C., on Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The privately funded memorial honors the valor of 33,000
Japanese Americans who fought in World War II, including 800 who
died. It also tells the story of 120,000 people of Japanese
ancestry, forced from their West Coast homes and imprisoned in
desolate inland camps during the war.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, critics of Masaoka's role during the war have
been fighting to get his name removed from the memorial. With the
memorial's dedication just four months away, the controversy seems
far from dissipating, as letters, pro and con, fill the pages of
the Japanese American Citizens League's weekly newspaper, the
Pacific Citizen, and other Japanese American publications.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Committee for a Fair and Accurate Japanese
American Memorial submitted a petition with 707 signatures to
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, asking for a review of the
memorial's ``problematic and controversial inscriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   While the National Park Service could not be reached for
comment, sources on the memorial board say they have been told
Masaoka's name will remain on the monument.
</P>
<P>
   The matter is also expected to be debated once again at the
National Japanese American Memorial Foundation board's quarterly
meeting in San Francisco on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, Masaoka and other leaders of the JACL advocated
complete cooperation with the government, squelching protest by
labeling as troublemakers and dissidents those who questioned the
abrogation of their civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   In his zeal, Masaoka even suggested a ``suicide battalion'' of
Japanese Americans who would prove their loyalty as soldiers while
having their families held hostage by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   The JACL, according to its wartime records, also provided
information on community members to the FBI and other federal
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of Masaoka's name with an excerpt of his creed on
the memorial is abhorrent to those who say it puts in the limelight
someone who evokes decades-old pain and anger.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Masaoka and his words, later adopted as the JACL
Creed, do not reflect the wartime resistance and protest of other
Japanese Americans, which many feel have long been muzzled in the
name of patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's going on is a reflection of the divisions that
occurred among Japanese Americans during the war partly between
those who wanted to cooperate and those who wanted to resist,''
said Dale Minami, a San Francisco civil rights attorney. ``Most
people felt compelled to cooperate. In hindsight, it's hard to
fault that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``But looking back with today's standards, we've come to respect
those who did protest, those who did resist. The memorial omits
that diversity of responses from Japanese Americans, and to that
extent, it does not reflect a true history.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Clifford Uyeda, 83, of San Francisco was more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it seem like what Japanese Americans want is a pat on
the back from white people, saying, `You're nice little Japs,'''
said Uyeda. ``That's the wrong message to give to the public. Mike
Masaoka made a big mistake. Why should that be remembered as an
expression of Japanese Americans forever, inscribed in stone?''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Hosokawa, 85, an author, historian and former Denver
Post editor, said the charge that Masaoka ``colluded with the
government is a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Hosokawa added, ``I know the vigor and intensity with which we
opposed the evacuation. The military came and said, `Get out or
else.' So I think the opposition to Mike is unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one deserves to be on that wall more than Mike Masaoka,''
said Grant Ujifusa, 57, a book editor from Chappaqua, N.Y. ``What's
going on here is there are still those resentments from that period
of pain, and we can't deal with it. Mike cut such a powerful
charismatic figure. So let's not think of the Chandlers or the
McClatchys or the Hearsts, who sold a ton of papers s - - - - - - -
on Japanese Americans. Let's blame one of our own. Let's think of
Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Rita Takahashi, a San Francisco State University
professor of social work, Masaoka's inclusion on the monument is
``a total contradiction of what the memorial is about.``
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi is one of eight dissidents on the 42-member memorial
board, who have questioned how the names and inscriptions were
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Other individuals, besides Mineta, who will be on the
monumentare former Presidents Harry Truman and Ronald Reagan; Sen.
Dan Inouye and the late Sen. Spark Matsunaga, both of Hawaii; Rep.
Robert Matsui, D-Calif., and poet Akemi Matsumoto Ehrlich.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Rear Adm. Melvin Chiogioji said the memorial board he
chairs has voted on the matter five times: ``The last vote was 27
to 6. Not even close. But these people just won't let loose, no
matter what. Anyway, it's a fait accompli. It's being carved right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, the JACL apologized to the resisters for failing
to recognize their loyalty but also strongly supported including
Masaoka's inscription.
</P>
<P>
   His backers look at his postwar leadership and achievements in
Washington, where he was respected by influential congressional
leaders who liked his upfront style.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka successfully fought for the Walter-McCarran Act in 1952,
which allowed issei or immigrant Japanese to finally become
naturalized citizens. And though he initially opposed redress for
camp survivors, Masaoka later worked to win $1.2 billion in
reparations.
</P>
<P>
   He also lobbied hard for the 1964 Civil Rights Act and helped
found the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.

SYCAMORE NETWORKS IN MAJOR DEAL WITH CANADIAN COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: 360networks is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sycamore Networks Inc. has made its biggest sale to date of
optical networking gear, a deal valued at up to $420 million that
includes the first reported sale of the Chelmsford, Mass. company's
premier optical switch.
</P>
<P>
   360networks of Vancouver, B.C., a ``carrier's carrier'' that
handles wholesale traffic for telephone and data communication
companies, said it will use Sycamore's gear to build out what is
planned to be by the end of next year a 100-city, 56,000-mile
global network. The system will handle up to 10 gigabits per
second.
</P>
<P>
   For Sycamore _ tabbed by Wall Street as the star of a pack of
Massachusetts optical communications start-ups _ the deal provides
revenue to help justify its $31 billion market valuation.
</P>
<P>
   News of the 360 pact, announced Friday, sent Sycamore's stock
soaring $16.75 to $126.9375 in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   The $420 million figure, representing planned purchases over
several years, was described as a likely ultimate contract value.
But it's not guaranteed. It includes the first reported sales of
Sycamore's SN 16000 switching device.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sycamore went public in October, its shares have soared by
a factor of 10, on Wall Street's faith that it will compete with
Nortel Networks, Lucent Technologies, and other giants to become a
leader in fiber-optic communications.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction was described by both companies as one of the
world's largest deployments of a so-called optical mesh network,
providing a credibility boost for a radically new way of designing
international calling networks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most phone and data traffic moves over interlocking
fiber-optic rings of sometimes different capacities. That requires
telecommunications companies to spend weeks or months working out
how to establish a specific capacity link between different cities
over a series of rings.
</P>
<P>
   Among other features, Sycamore's switches use advanced software
to map out their own connections over fiber-optic lines, creating a
mesh of overlapping voice and data routes.
</P>
<P>
   That capability should make it possible for 360networks to
connect customers in days rather than in months, and almost
instantaneously reroute traffic if lines are damaged, said
Harminder Gill, the company's director of engineering and planning.
</P>
<P>
   Within several months, 360 customers may be able to order their
own increased bandwidth if, for example, they suddenly need to
handle more traffic between two cities.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore faces strong competition from dozens of other
start-ups. But ``There are very few vendors out there who have real
products,'' Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   Other major contracts, previously announced by Sycamore, include
a $400 million, four-year sale to Williams Communications and a
three-year, $200 million deal with Enron Broadband Services, a unit
of the Houston energy giant. There have also been major deals in
England and Scandinavia.

It's hard to pin down diva Audra McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to the three-time Tony winner on July 4 by phone from
Washington, D.C., she was about to rush off to rehearse for that
night's big concert at the Capitol Building which was being
broadcast live on PBS. Coincidently, at that very moment you could
hear her singing tunes on a local National Public Radio station as
part of a tribute taped last month for Stephen Sondheim.
</P>
<P>
   After the concert she would be heading back to Toronto to
continue filming an adaptation of Jim Lehrer's ``The Last Debate''
with James Garner for Showtime. Then she would be off to Los
Angeles where she headlines tonight's Hollywood Bowl concert.
</P>
<P>
   All this flying around is in keeping with singer-actress who has
taken Broadway by storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned about planes early,'' quips McDonald, explaining
that growing up in Fresno, where she started doing dinner theater
at the age of nine, was not a drawback in her ambition to make it
on the Great White Way. ``I grew up in a musical family,'' she says
of her parents who are educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd be nearby if I got to a school in New York,''
McDonald says. Of course, never doing anything halfway, she went to
Julliard. Not long afterward she made her mark in the 1994 Nicholas
Hytner revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ``Carousel,'' for which
she won her first Tony. She subsequently won Tonys for Terrence
McNally's ``Master Class'' in 1996 and for Ragtime in 1998, the
musical adaptation of the E.L. Doctorow novel.
</P>
<P>
   All this before she turned 30, which which happened on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the soft-spoken McDonald you would never know that
she has one of the most extraordinary singing voices to come around
in years _ ``a force of nature,'' esteemed critic John Lahr calls
her.
</P>
<P>
   And that praise seems restrained compared to some. Here's
Stephen Holden in the New York Times: ``When Audra McDonald ...
unfurls her operatic mezzo soprano with its bright, quickening
vibrato, then breaks into a triumphal cry before dipping into an
ominous funk-tinged blues shout, a better musical future seems not
only possible but upon us, right here, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew _ a heavy burden, but it also describes McDonald's penchant
for taking chances. Earlier this year she was nominated for a Tony
for her lead role in ``Marie Christine'' by composer Michael John
LaChiusa, an edgy musical retelling of the myth of Medea. But the
show, described as difficult work about race, betrayal and the role
of women, closed early despite McDonald's drawing power, and there
was no fourth Tony.
</P>
<P>
   Though she has ``no plans at the moment'' to returned to
Broadway, McDonald has other worlds to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   In February, she released her second solo album, ``How Glory
Goes,'' to critical acclaim. While the album has its share of
familiar songs _ ``Anywhere I Hang My Hat Is Home'' and
``Somewhere'' from ``West Side Story'' _ McDonald doesn't just
stick to easy standards, highlighting lesser known numbers like
``Come Down From the Tree'' from ``Once on This Island.'' She also
opens herself up to comparisons with two singing greats in ``A
Sleepin' Bee,'' which Barbra Streisand recorded, and one of Judy
Garland's signature tunes, ``The Man That Got Away.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald talks about about admiring Garland for living life to
the fullest, but you hear a difference in the way the song is
interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get into the character,'' McDonald says about how she
approaches a song. In Garland's version of ``The Man That Got
Away'' the pain is evident, but McDonald's is more wistful,
contemplative. Something like McDonald, who seems to put as much
thought as she does passion into what she performs.
</P>
<P>
   As for tonight's show, which is only McDonald's second
appearance in southern California ever, she will be teamed up with
another Broadway superstar, Patti LuPone, along with John Mauceri,
who will be conducting his 200th concert at the Hollywood Bowl, for
a night that promises plenty of musical fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, McDonald has turned her attention to acting. In the
spring, she guest-starred NBC's ``Law and Order: Special Victims
Unit,'' and co-starred in the ABC/Disney production of ``Annie.''
After ``The Last Debate,'' she'll co-star with Emma Thompson in the
filmed adaption of Margaret Edson's acclaimed play ``Wit,'' being
directed by Mike Nichols for Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she was attracted to the two cable-TV movies, McDonald
says they offered roles that weren't stereotypical for an
African-American woman. But by now you realize there is nothing
stereotypical about McDonald or her career.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Well, there's a wedding. McDonald has been engaged
to bassist Peter Donovan for about a year. And she's going back to
the studio to record another album with _ get this _ a big band.
``It should be fun,'' she says.
</P>

AVOIDING SPOTLIGHT, DAVENPORT EASES INTO FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ She's still being treated like the answer to a trivia
question, but she does not decry this affront to her regal status.
Lindsay Davenport rather prefers traveling beneath the radar,
actually.
</P>
<P>
   It's the inconspicuous course she followed to the Wimbledon
women's singles title last year, and here she comes again, having
slipped through the side door to Centre Court of the All England
Lawn Tennis &AMP; Croquet Club to face Venus Williams in Saturday's
final.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone else was distracted by various commotions,
particularly Thursday's seismic sibling semifinal between Venus and
Serena Williams, Davenport was busy tiptoeing to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, that's the way I like it,'' she said after
carving up unseeded 17-year-old Jelena Dokic, 6-4, 6-2, in the
semifinal nobody noticed. ``I don't really like to have a lot of
hoopla and a lot action and activity around what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At 24, the 6-foot-2-inch Californian stands out as a weirdo on
the women's tour because she evidently is so normal. She has no
intrusive, abusive parents pulling the strings, she never raises a
ruckus like the divas around her, and, unlike the Williamses,
there's only one of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said that the only reason why I'm here is just to
play tennis, get through it, see personally what I can achieve, and
leave all the business to the other players and let them deal with
it,'' said Davenport. ``That's always been my take on it. I think
that's what has helped me play better. I don't have to really deal
with a lot of the outside things and just really concentrate on my
tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been more than enough to occupy her time. Davenport,
who also owns the 1998 US and 2000 Australian Open crowns, missed
two months on the WTA Tour with back problems. She has been
struggling to regain her form here.
</P>
<P>
   The opening round of her title defense was truncated by a fall
that forced her doubles partner, Corina Morariu, to retire from the
match. In her first full go, Davenport dropped the opening set to
Yayuk Basuki. And Monica Seles took her to the limit in the
quarterfinals before Dokic fell in 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   So much the better, the champion reckons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny to look at the difference between this year and
last year,'' said Davenport, ``because last year came so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   And quietly. Her semifinal and final victories in 1999 were
overshadowed by Alexandra Stevenson's roots and Steffi Graf's
retirement, respectively. This time around, the suspense has
involved her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seemed like I was playing so well (last year) in the
matches,'' said Davenport. ``Just everything clicked from the first
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Wimbledon, I've had to fight a lot harder, come back in a
few situations and matches, really hang in there. In some ways,
this is much more satisfying because I got through the first week
not playing well, really fought it out, got to the position where
in the second week, I started to play a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   She's been able to work things out in the background. Meanwhile,
Venus Williams has had no place to hide. Because of her captivating
game and personality and the novelty of the sibling clash _ the
first time in the 32 years of open tennis sisters met in a Grand
Slam semifinal _ the No. 5 seed has encountered nothing except
glamour and glare.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether she can remain at a psychological peak
following the challenge presented by top seed Martina Hingis in a
three-set quarterfinal and the trauma of having to rough up Serena,
6-2, 7-6, in the semis. And just in case she doesn't have enough on
her mind, Venus will be trying to become the first African-American
women's champion here since Althea Gibson in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   She thinks she's up to the demands. Asked if she would find it
difficult to prepare for Davenport after what she's been through,
Williams said, ``No, I don't think so, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena dolefully touted her sister's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she plays the way she did against me,'' said Serena, ``then
she should have a pretty good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve more than that, Venus, who has missed much of the
season with tendinitis in both wrists, knows she can't let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's had injuries just like I have,'' said Williams, ``so
we're kind of in the same boat. Definitely we are going to want to
raise the level of our games. I feel like I've raised the level of
my game already, especially (against Serena) and in the last match
(against Hingis) also. When the final comes, it's a grand occasion.
I think we're both going to go at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is an inch taller than Williams but can't match her
power. She must find ways to get around that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played her a lot of times in the past,'' Davenport said.
``A lot of times, I found the key was to find a way to get her
serve back, get them back deep so she obviously doesn't have
put-away shots. On grass, that's going to be a little more
difficult than on other surfaces. I'll have to concentrate on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Experience favors Davenport, who is three years Williams's
senior. Williams has been in one Grand Slam final, losing to Hingis
at the 1997 US Open. Davenport has been in three and won them all.
They've hardly jaded her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm psyched to get into another Grand Slam final,'' she said,
``especially the second year here in a row. That means a lot to me
to be able to come back and do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone may have been looking the other way while she was doing
it, but once again, ultimately they can't avoid Lindsay Davenport.

RAFTER SENDS DISGRUNTLED AGASSI PACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It was riveting theater, a two-man show featuring
dueling virtuosos. It bedazzled the critics. It enraptured the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   There were metronomic rallies filled with one acrobatic return
after another. There were improbable volleys highlighted by sublime
athletic grace and cast-iron wills. There were sideline-to-sideline
and baseline-to-net (or vice versa) dashes, gravity-defying dives,
lethal leaping smashes. And most of all, there was endless
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurpassed artistry and entertainment. What superlatives could
possibly describe it all?
</P>
<P>
   Well . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned,'' said Andre Agassi, ``the match
sucked.''
</P>
<P>
   There's always one grouch in the bunch, isn't there?
</P>
<P>
   But Agassi could be forgiven his ornery assessment. This
five-act thriller had an unhappy ending for the world's top-ranked
male tennis player, who acknowledged, ``I have no objectivity''
regrading the match's quality after he was outperformed by No. 21
Patrick Rafter, 7-5, 4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3, in the Wimbledon
semifinals Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That means there will be no encore of last year's championship
showcase, when Agassi lost to Pete Sampras. Only Sampras will get
to repeat his role, because he completed his cakewalk to history's
doorstep with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, 6-4 disposal of Vladimir Voltchkov.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Sampras should have an asterisk beside his name in the
billing for Sunday's final at the All England Lawn Tennis &AMP; Croquet
Club, because he didn't face a single seeded player. But all that
matters is that if he beats Rafter, Sampras will share the record
for the most Wimbledon men's singles crowns (7) and own it outright
for the most Grand Slam notches in his belt (13).
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was shoved into the background on Centre Court because
of the Agassi-Rafter spectacular that preceded him there. And even
the perennial champion expected a different outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (Agassi) was the slight favorite,'' said Sampras.
``But it wasn't a guaranteed win.''
</P>
<P>
   It was close to it, according to the consensus. Agassi was
seeded ahead of everyone except Sampras, and no one has a more
multifaceted repertoire than the Las Vegas casino greeter's son.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's prospects were more unpredictable than realistic. The
two-time US Open winner was rated No. 1 in the world for a brief
spell last year, but in his return to New York, he suffered a
first-round injury to his serving shoulder that forced him to
abdicate and eventually required surgery. His right rotator cuff
was repaired Oct. 24, he was on the mend for an extended period,
his ranking plunged, and while he came here seeded 12th, that was
considered a gift. Even though he had won a tuneup event on grass
in the Netherlands the week before Wimbledon, he was hardly
regarded a threat, even by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's had its ups and downs,'' Rafter said of his
postoperative experience. ``But it's always hard to say how well
you're going to play here. I really hadn't had a lot of runs on the
board coming into Wimbledon. Obviously, the week before was very
successful. (But I) still hadn't proved myself in a big-match
situation yet. I guess today it shows that I'm probably coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   To Agassi's everlasting dismay. The Australian showed him right
away that he could handle anything Agassi threw at him. He
neutralized Agassi's vaunted returns with aggressive rushes to the
net and matched him slashing volley for slashing volley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he played pretty much like I expected him to,'' said
Agassi. ``He served real well. There are times when you're
surprised by things and other times that somebody really executes a
little bit better at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter picked the perfect time to play the executioner at the
start, holding serve through 6-5 and then breaking for the first
set when Agassi double-faulted and hit a two-hand backhand long.
</P>
<P>
   That showed Agassi that Rafter would not go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like he's found his game,'' said Agassi. ``I thought
he was playing well. At the crucial times of the match, he was the
same player (as before the surgery). He was playing tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Both were as the intrigue built to a climax.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi counterpunched in the second set, allowing Rafter to
break him to 2-0, then answering with one of his own in the next
game and the decisive one to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   And on the give-and-take went, Rafter eking out the third set,
Agassi answering in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I was feeling pretty good that I was in the fifth
set there after losing the third,'' said Agassi. ``But it's hard to
feel like you have the momentum in the fifth until you get that
break of serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he got broken, reflecting Rafter's serving advantage
(74-40 percent) in the stretch. The turning point came when Agassi
ended yet another extended rally with a forehand into the net,
putting Rafter up a break, 4-2. Rafter clenched his fist as he
sensed the kill, then served out the match and punched the air with
both fists as the crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of the fourth, I just started finding the rhythm on my
serve,'' said Rafter. ``When I'm serving well and playing well,
that's the way I serve.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next match, Voltchkov, the bargain-basement Belarussian
who got here without an invitation or endorsements, served notice
that he may be a force in the future.
</P>
<P>
   He was a surprisingly worthy adversary for Sampras, holding
serve through the first set until the tiebreaker, in which Sampras
won three of the last four points to prevail, 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras dominated the second set, then had his hands full in the
third until taking a five-deuce game and breaking to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to fight, but he was just too good,'' said Voltchkov.
``I mean, I didn't have one chance on his serve, except in the
tiebreaker in the first set, where things could go either way.''
</P>
<P>
   They're still going the Californian's way as he has survived a
lingering injury _ tendinitis in his lower left leg that developed
before the second round _ that was tougher than his draw. He
received treatment for it yet again in the third set from ATP Tour
trainer Doug Spreen.
</P>
<P>
   But it was nothing that another victory wouldn't cure. ``I feel
great,'' said Sampras. ``It wasn't an easy match, playing Vladimir.
I was really a heavy favorite. Not having really seen him play much
or not having played him, it wasn't an easy match. But I got
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was more than Agassi could say, no matter how memorable
his effort. Told what a hit the match had been, he said dryly,
``Good. I'm glad you enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   His tone indicated that he obviously hated it.

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-$ADV09 _ ONI, Georgia _ High in still snowy
mountain passes separating Russia from its southern neighbors,
Chechen rebels have found a near
</P>
<P>
   impenetrable lair. From these hideouts, the rebels have
unleashed a new round of fighting their almost yearlong war against
the Russian army. The worrisome problem is that the rebels have
moved across the international border, to the Republic of Georgia,
threatening to escalate what Russia has always called a ``domestic
issue'' into a regional war. (Coker, Cox News Service). WITH

   MEXICO-REVOLUTION _ MEXICO CITY _ It's being called the second
Mexican Revolution, the Revolution of the 21st Century, Mexico's
Velvet Revolution, the electoral earthquake. To the surprise of
virtually all political observers here, Mexicans rose up last
Sunday and decisively ended 71 years of domination by the world's
longest-reigning political party. In just one week, life in Mexico
has changed spirtually if not materially. Many people sense a
mantle of control has been lifted. A federal employee here who was
forced to pass out literature for the ruling party said she hopes
such coercion is dead in Mexico. A TV comic pushed the envelope on
freedom of expression by performing a sketch using amusing video of
President-elect Vicente Fox, and then bantering with the real Fox
in a live telephone interview. The audience went wild. Mexico is
enjoying a democratic fiesta, even though
</P>
<P>
   there are rumblings of how tough Fox's job is going to be as he
struggles to shape a new government here. (Ferriss, Cox News

   MEXICO-PRI _ MEXICO CITY _ The worst of times for Mexico's
freshly defeated ruling party included the 1968 student massacre,
several crippling peso devaluations and spate of fratricidal
assassinations. And now the ultimate _ unexpected defeat at the
polls of 71 years in power. Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party is in the throes of a crisis, as its leaders squabble among
one another and stunned supporters wonder what will happen to their
special favors. President Ernesto Zedillo, who accepted the PRI's
defeat and won praise from abroad and the opposition here, is being
reviled within his own party as a traitor. The PRI will now be a
minority power in the Senate and Congress, and a minor voice in
Mexico City and other key areas. Can the dinosaur survive?

   MIDEAST-SUMMIT _ JERUSALEM _ As they head into a summit meeting
Tuesday, Israelis and Palestinians are closer than they've ever
been to making peace. But, they're still readying themselves for
war. The solutions are out there. Israeli officials have leaked
proposals that would be the largest concessions Israel ever offered
and Palestinians have shown increased flexibility in living next to
the Jewish state. The toughest issues are Jerusalem, resettlement
of refugees, borders and water. Each has a number of possible
solutions. But, peacemakers on both sides face stiff opposition
from their own publics. Should the summit fail, no one knows what
will follow but it could be violence. Palestinians are preparing to
declare statehood and are said to be gathering weapons. Israeli
officers are threatening to use ``tanks and planes'' against a
Palestinian uprising. A look at the issues and risks of the summit.

   SURPLUS _ WASHINGTON _ Like Uncle Sam finding a $20 bill in the
pocket of his striped pants on laundry day, the U.S. government
last month came up with an extra $100 billion in revenue over the
next 10 years. While this boost in the projected federal surplus
certainly sounds like good news, it raises some disquieting
questions. How can revenue estimates change so quickly, and can
they go down as fast as they went up? And could the new revenues
lead lawmakers to create spending or benefit programs that would be
hard to roll back if the windfall evaporates? (Deans, Cox News

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ How would Southern politics change _ or would it
change at all _ if we knew all the dire predictions about global
warming were really true? With all the scientific controversy over
that subject we can't be sure. But if there's one area which could
be looked at as a present-day laboratory for the consequences of
such an unprecedented crisis, it lies along the Carolina coastline.
That's because whether global warming affects it or not, there is
convincing evidence that over the next 30 years, storms like the
one which caused record flooding in North Carolina last year will
increase in frequency. That increases the potential like more
environmental disasters like the one last year in which North
Carolinians saw their rivers polluted with the carcasses of
thousands of drowned hogs. But it also brings a risk of political
disaster, as South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges found out last year
when he ordered the coast evacuated for a disaster which didn't
materialize. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   TRANSEXUAL-MINISTER _ The Rev. Erin Swenson's heart thumped

Church in Atlanta stared at her in disbelief. Swenson, an ordained
minister and father of two daughters, had just walked to the front
of the church in a green dress, heels and an eggshell-white blouse.
She was going to speak publicly for the first time about a
49-year-old secret that had driven her to thoughts of suicide.
Swenson told the hushed crowd that she was a woman born in a man's
body. Now that she had taken steps to correct that, she made an
unprecedented request before the assembly of Presbyterian church
leaders: Allow her to retain her ordination as a minister. Five
years later, Swenson is stepping back in the spotlight. She _ along
with , her ex-wife, daughter and father _ is are finally talking
about the extraordinary journey _ as a family and as individuals _
they have taken together since that autumn morning. (Blake, Atlanta

   COVER _ The idea seems obvious, so why didn't anyone think of it

so why shouldn't our Palm Pilot covers and planners express who we

now makes her home in Los Angeles, theorized that women would be
anxious to replace ``black and boring'' accessory covers with those
more funky and fashionable. She figured right. Today Sunshine Knox
(her business card simply reads ``Sunshine'') is the president and
designer of Sunny Kate, a 1-year-old company that's already sold
thousands of items and is quickly becoming known for its upscale
accessories for women. (Dayton Daily News) WITH PHOTOS

   ADAMS-YOSEMITE _ Yosemite National Park draws a whopping 3.6
million visitors a year _ making it one of the busiest sites in the
park system _ and many credit Ansel Adams' majestic black-and-white
photographs for its popularity. ``Every year I have to have an
Ansel Adams calendar of the park,'' said the Rev. David Johnson, a
Welches, Ore., minister. ``Now I want to see the vantage points
firsthand.'' The park plays to the fascination visitors have with
Adams by offering camera walks filled with basic instruction and
nifty details on where some of his classic images were executed. We
took the walk but also hiked independently, trying to view this
magnificent land in a way similar to the great photographer.

top of the Americana charts. He kicks off his national tour in

bookstores all over metro Atlanta Saturday when the kids finally

inconsequential as mortals are in the magical world where Potter
the pubescent warlock exists. As beleagured store employees finally
ripped open the cartons containing precious copies of ``Harry
Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' youngsters for whom Dumbledore and
Snape are rapidly becoming their generation's version of Paul and
Ringo plotted to get in there early and stay up late reading. Eight

   LOST-FANS _ Major League Baseball takes center stage here
Tuesday with the annual All-Star game with all the glitz and
glamour you might expect. But all that can't hide the fact that the
sport is loing a generation of young fans, who have been pushed
away from the sport by high prices, late night starts and the greed
of the owners. The owners seem oblivious to the fact that the kids
who aren't watching now probably won't be watching 20 years from
now. (Schlabach, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   ALLSTAR _ An essay. At a time when many say major league
baseball is dying because of the length of games, players switching
teams and leagues, night World Series games that eliminate the need
for radios in classrooms in October _ we explain why the All-Star
Game is prosaic, cerebral, attractive. Why it is still as American
as Chevrolet and apple pie and why on All-Star night, it all comes
together. Why it's still America's pastime. Why it was started in
1933, why it survived WWII, and why it's the best All-Star game of
all the pro sports. (Stinson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 50-60''

   LINCOLN-HOUSE _ President Clinton will announce plans for
restoring Abraham Lincoln's summer retreat home, three miles from
the Capitol. The14-room Gothic-Revival cottage is where Lincoln
drafted the Emancipation Proclamation. David Long, history

   BLACKS-UTEXAS _ Free airfare and a good time apparently worked

of an outreach effort this spring that brought accepted students to

next spring. (Jayson, Austin American-Statesman). 15-18.

   LATIN-FORUM _ ATLANTA _ Expectations were high in parts of
Georgia's Latino community six months ago. Four people appointed by
Gov. Roy Barnes were recommending changes to state laws and
policies to help Georgia's growing Latino population. They held a
press conference to give their report to the governor, but his
staff said Barnes was too busy to attend. His absence frustrated
some Latinos. Now some Latinos are more frustrated because not much
has become of recommendations made by the Latino Forum that Barnes
appointed. It's a different story in North Carolina, another state
with a fast-growing Hispanic population where thousands of Latinos
work in construction, poultry, agriculture and hotels and
restaurants as they do in Georgia. Latino leaders in North Carolina
meet regularly with high-ranking state official and the governor.
In fact the Office of Hispanic/Latino Affairs, is part of the
governor's office. (Bixler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

&HT;     JUSTICE: SALE OF SAN FRANCISCO DAILY ENDED ANTITRUST PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Justice Department, which has approved the
Hearst Corp.'s purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle, told a
federal judge Friday that it closed an investigation of the sale
after Hearst struck a deal to sell its flagship San Francisco
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   In a carefully worded letter to U.S. District Judge Vaughn
Walker, the department said its decision not to challenge Hearst's
$660 million purchase of the Chronicle was contingent on the
privately-held company's agreement to sell the Examiner to a ExIn
LLC, a company headed by Ted Fang, publisher of the San Francisco
Independent. Fang is to pay $100 for the newspaper and get a
subsidy of up to $66 million from Hearst over three years.
</P>
<P>
   But the department said it never had to reach a conclusion on
Walker's question: whether the Chronicle sale would have violated
federal antitrust laws if Hearst had not also agreed to sell the
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department did not approve the sale of the Chronicle to
Hearst, but rather made a decision not to proceed with further
investigation or a challenge in court, in light of the sale of the
Examiner to ExIn,'' wrote Mark J. Botti, the lawyer in charge of
the investigation for the department's Antitrust Division.
</P>
<P>
   Walker had been awaiting the department's reply before ruling on
an antitrust lawsuit by Clint Reilly, an unsuccessful bidder for
the Examiner. Reilly contends the deal with Fang is a sham,
designed to prop up the Examiner for a few years and then leave
Hearst with a local monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Shulman, a lawyer for Reilly, said he was unimpressed by
the department's latest filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not coming out of their bunker,'' he said. ``He (the
judge) should feel free to decide the thing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Corp. spokesman Paul Luthringer said: ``We believe this
supports the position that Hearst has been taking all along, as
well as the position that we have taken in court throughout this
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst attorney Gerald A. Connell could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department approved the sale on March 30, saying its
concerns about competition were satisfied by the prospect of the
Examiner's continued publication by Fang.
</P>
<P>
   Walker blocked the sale with a restraining order a few hours
later. Since the trial of Reilly's lawsuit ended May 31, the judge
has been pressing Justice for its opinion on whether Hearst's
purchase of the Chronicle, by itself, would have violated antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has not said why he wants the information, but during the
trial he indicated he was troubled about the Fang transaction,
asking lawyers for Hearst why they agreed to subsidize a competitor
and whether they were merely trying to mollify federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter June 29, Botti told Walker the Justice Department
was initially concerned about a monopoly and doubted Hearst's
claims that the Examiner was a failing newspaper that could not be
sold above liquidation value. But once the Fang deal was announced
in mid-March, the department shifted its focus, considered both
transactions together and decided that competition would not be
damaged, the government lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Unsatisfied, Walker issued a new order the next day, asking
whether the department's approval was contingent on the Fang sale,
or whether the Chronicle purchase would otherwise have violated
antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's letter, Botti said the department's decision not to
challenge the sale was contingent on the Fang transaction _ but he
stopped short of saying what the department would have done if the
transaction had not taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department's decision to close the investigation was based
only on the determination that the sale of the Chronicle to Hearst,
in light of the sale of the Examiner to ExIn, did not result in a
substantial lessening of competition,'' Botti said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle and Examiner have operated under a joint operating
agreement since 1965, combining business operations and splitting
profits while maintaining separate editorial staffs. The agreement
was to run through 2005 but would be terminated by the sale.

HOW JOKES THAT OFFEND TEACH PROPRIETY ITS PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sigmund Freud, like Groucho, loved a good cigar. But he never
met the Marx Brothers, which is just as well, because they might
have treated him the way they did the poor producer Irving
Thalberg, camping out in his office stark naked and roasting
potatoes in his fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   Freud did have some good ideas about jokes, though, and it might
even be that Groucho's German Jewish grandfather, an itinerant
entertainer, provided one of Freud's ancestors some amusement. For
in Freud's brilliantly unfunny book ``Jokes and Their Relation to
the Unconscious,'' he keeps coming back to a popular genre of
Jewish jokes about the ``shadchen,'' the matchmaker, a folk figure
who will assure a suitor of anything to arrange a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   In one joke, a suitor protests: ``I don't care for the
mother-in-law. She's disagreeable and stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're not marrying the mother-in-law,'' the shadchen
replies. ``What you want is her daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but she's not young any longer and she's not exactly a
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So? If she's neither young nor beautiful, she'll be even more
faithful to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She also doesn't have much money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's talking about money? Are you marrying money? It's a wife
you want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But she's got a hunchback!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do you want? She can't have a single fault?''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this joke would not have made the final cut in the
Marx Brothers' movies scripted by S.J. Perelman or George S.
Kaufman. But the genre was brought to mind anyway by two recent
books: ``Monkey Business: The Lives and Legends of the Marx
Brothers,'' by Simon Louvish, and Stefan Kanfer's new biography,
``Groucho: The Life and Times of Julius Henry Marx.'' For Groucho
has a touch of the shadchen in him.
</P>
<P>
   Like Groucho, the shadchen is an operator, twisting logic to his
own ends. Everyone knows he is not to be trusted, but it doesn't
matter. He strips away the pretense behind social graces, revealing
the ugly scaffolding, the same way the brothers do when they rip
the set apart in ``A Night at the Opera.'' Everything is wrecked,
but a match is made and the show goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Groucho at work:
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, I love you,'' he passionately declares to Margaret
Dumont's pompous character in ``Cocoanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'd love me if I were poor,'' she sagely
replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might,'' he answers, ``but I'd keep my mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Groucho lecherously pursues money, status, power; he knows it,
we know it. He mocks it, we mock it. Like the shadchen, he first
seems to be making a simple match, linking a desire with its
satisfaction. But then the trickery comes through. The match itself
turns out to be a farce; so does the desire. ``Madam,'' he declares
on another occasion, ``before I get through with you, you will have
a clear case for divorce. And so will my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Freud suggests that while it might seem as if the shameless
matchmaker is the butt of the shadchen joke, actually the
respectable suitor is. The suitor crassly seeks perfection. The
shadchen knows better. Perfection is not to be had.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a social function to his conniving: The suitor must
be reconciled to the merely human. So when the matchmaker is forced
to acknowledge all the distasteful bride's scars and flaws, that
only strengthens his case. She can't have a single fault?
</P>
<P>
   This was, in Freud's view, one of the functions of jokes
themselves. They trick propriety to accept impropriety, slipping
the unacceptable through the censors. The joke is itself a
matchmaker; and the butt of the joke is the censorious suitor's
demands for absolute perfection. You want beauty, riches, status?
Ha! This is the way things are. And listen, I'm not so great
either.
</P>
<P>
   So Groucho is a crouching joke with a mustache, and like the
shadchen (who never seems to be married), he can see what's going
on because he is an outsider. He is Rufus T. Firefly, brought in as
president of Freedonia by the bejeweled Mrs. Teasdale. He is
Captain Spaulding, the African explorer/schnorrer who lands in the
middle of Mrs. Rittenhouse's Long Island mansion. He is, in other
words, a lot like the Marx Brothers and the other aspiring children
of ethnic immigrants, who came, saw, mocked and conquered.
</P>
<P>
   This may have been what vaudeville was all about: The alien is
ridiculed, but so is the society carrying out the ridicule. Race
and ethnicity may have been the biggest jokes on the vaudeville
circuit. Groucho, in his youth, once played in a theater with the
Wangdoodle Four, a group of black men dressed as Chinese. Groucho's
Jewish uncle, Al Shean, presented himself as an Irishman in the duo
Gallagher and Shean.
</P>
<P>
   And the brothers created their personas out of immigrant
cliches. In ``Animal Crackers'' the brothers' foil is a Czech fish
peddler, Abe Kabbible, who tries to pass for a sophisticated
connoisseur. ``How did you get to be Roscoe W. Chandler?'' Chico
challenges him. ``Say,'' he shoots back, ``how did you get to be an
Italian?''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Abe Kabbible (who was modeled on the arriviste
financier Otto Kahn), the Marx Brothers did not disguise their
closeness to immigrant culture; they exaggerated it.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian, a mute and a wisecracking Jew are set loose in high
society and work havoc. Their success is a distinctively American
joke. For as it turns out, Mrs. Rittenhouse and her clan are no
match; and figures like Roscoe W. Chandler can claim no
superiority.
</P>
<P>
   The Marx Brothers begin as aliens, but they are eventually at
society's center, helping to redefine America with a popular
culture shaped by ethnicity, race and immigration. Seventy years
later, despite mothers-in-law and the shadchens' scheming, the
match has held up remarkably well.

BRING ON THE VILLAINS

<P>
   I saw ``Shaft'' last weekend _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the movie, mind you, which is only slightly above
average, but for two of the performances in it.
</P>
<P>
   Movie villains are such a devalued commodity these days that
when a film contains two great ones, I can't get to it fast enough.
And ``Shaft'' sports a display of duelling bad guys so
extravagantly enjoyable that the film doesn't just deserve to be
seen, it demands it.
</P>
<P>
   They are Walter Wade Jr. (a suavely handsome Christian Bale,
last seen as the title character in ``American Psycho''), a
millionaire yuppie racist who perpetrates the vicious hate crime
that begins the film; and Peoples Hernandez, a flamboyant Dominican
drug dealer played by Jeffrey Wright (star of the 1996 portrait of
a doomed painter, ``Basquiat'').
</P>
<P>
   Their collaboration is the kind of forced contrivance that only
makes sense in a movie while you are watching it. Wade and
Hernandez _ two monsters from different worlds _ meet in jail.
Their unholy alliance isn't specifically designed to confront
detective John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson), but that's what happens.
</P>
<P>
   Until the movie bogs down in its second hour with a numbing
collision of subplots, the narrative balance is almost sublime:
Wade and Hernandez alternate one-upping each other, and taking on
Shaft.
</P>
<P>
   This type of sleekly contemporary villain, full of psychological
quirks that beg inquiry, isn't new. He first surfaced in two
bristling Robert Mitchum performances _ the maniacal backwoods
preacher, Harry Powell, in ``Night of the Hunter'' (1954), and the
vengeful ex-con, Max Cady, in ``Cape Fear'' (1962). The mark of a
good actor is the ability to play a memorable villain. But for
Mitchum, the mark of a great actor is the ability to do it twice,
and a different way each time.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-hero trend of the '60s and '70s, epitomized by the
films of Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson, blunted the persona of
the villain, who had to be a drooling caricature to seem worse than
the tarnished protagonist. Believably scary bad guys were hard to
find.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, there were exceptions. The best of them was arguably
Bruce Dern's character, ``Long Hair,'' in the 1972 John Wayne
feature, ``The Cowboys.'' Dern, an Actors Studio graduate who
reluctantly specialized in loathesome villains for a time in the
first half of his long career, got to do the unthinkable in ``The
Cowboys'': He murdered Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview some years later, Dern said there is more to
playing a wholly contemptible villain than merely acting sinister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to playing a psychotic villain,'' Dern said, ``is
that: One the guy doesn't know he's crazy, which they don't; and,
two you have to give the character a little style, a little flair,
so that the audience despises the guy so much that they begin to
enjoy that sensation ... and want him around for the rest of the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Dern expressed some of that sentiment to Wayne, as the screen
legend gently chided him during the filming of the controversial
death scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne said, `Boy, when you kill me, the audience is going to
hate you,''' Dern recalled. ``And I told him, `In Orange County,
maybe, but in Berkeley, they're going to stand up and cheer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Taking on John Wayne, a larger-than-life Hollywood icon, is one
thing. Even if you kill him, you don't really win. But the villains
of today must contend with the subtler _ but ultimately just as
palpable _ pressures inherent in doing battle with the millennium's
male superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, if you're a strong, commanding presence, the hunks
of today don't want you as a villain. Ever since Alan Rickman's
breakthrough performance as a wily terrorist in ``Die Hard'' (1988)
_ a modern matrix of evil; only in it for the money _ today's
pretty-boy leading men have been wary of character actors who might
steal the picture away from them.
</P>
<P>
   Think I'm exaggerating? Then name the actor who plays the
villain in ``Mission: Impossible 2.'' (It's Dougray Scott.) You
think Tom Cruise, who co-produced the movie, wants a fight for
dominance with another Alan Rickman? That's what makes the
double-barreled villainy of ``Shaft'' so refreshing. Jackson is too
powerful an actor to be upstaged by anyone, and he knows it; he
lets Bale and Wright play out the full dimensions of their
characters, unencumbered, and the film is enriched by it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's true that actors as brilliant as Bale and Wright
deserve to be in a better movie than ``Shaft.'' But in a summer
popcorn season, a period not known for creative surprises, this one
is something to savor.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Boom times are the worst thing to have ever hit New
York's Chinatown. Twenty-five years ago, New York needed Chinatown.
The city was on the brink of bankruptcy, and many neighborhoods
were declining. Chinatown was a rare area of growing prosperity in
the tight times, emerging from an area occupying few city blocks to
transform a dilapidated Lower East Side into a thriving community.
</P>
<P>
   And now that things are good, New York doesn't seem to care
about its old friend. As it turns its attention to Silicon Alley
entrepreneurs and Wall Street barons. Meanwhile, Chinatown has
stagnated in the past several years _ hurt by rising rents,
aggressive enforcement of old city laws and a digital divide.
</P>
<P>
   Chinatown's economy, now as in the past, depends largely on a
core of small businesses in mature and declining industries:
small-scale manufacturing, much of it in the garment industry;
restaurants that specialize in Chinese cuisine; retail and
wholesale trade; tourism and gift shops. We in Chinatown need the
city's help in both preserving our traditional businesses and and
generating more modern ones.
</P>
<P>
   The garment industry, which once employed 30,000 people in
Chinatown, has been hardest hit. Foreign competition, low-cost
production overseas and occasional charges of sweatshop operations
have driven manufacturers away from Chinatown: its garment
factories have decreased from 500 to less than 300. This decline
has had a multiplier effect as lost income in the community has
sent sales plunging in other businesses. Now, as garment factories
struggle to pay $10 to $12 a square foot for loft space in
Chinatown, dot-com companies, which are edging in from the outside,
would gladly pay double or triple that. Some provision should be
made to keep at least some buildings operating with affordable
rents.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer has appointed a task force of prominent
business leaders, known as the Group of 35, to find more commercial
space in the city for growing companies. Perhaps a representative
of small business or manufacturing industry should be appointed to
this task force, too, to reflect more diverse business needs.
</P>
<P>
   Lower Manhattan's residential boom has also hurt Chinatown. In
the 1980s and 1990s, the upscale development that started in SoHo
began to to hem Chinatown in, causing economic and cultural
clashes. The sidewalk fish and vegetable stalls that most New
Yorkers once saw as quaint are viewed by some of our new neighbors
as dirty and smelly inconveniences. The wholesale trades of poultry
and groceries, with their early morning deliveries and congestion
on the sidewalks, are seen as a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals have been made to the local community boards to restrict
certain business operations; the Police Department and Department
of Consumer Affairs have dusted off all the rule books, ticketing
sidewalk vendors for all types of violations that had not been
enforced in decades and, in some cases, are still not enforced
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the city unearthed a quarter-century-old Little
Italy special zoning district, limiting types of businesses and
setting requirements for stores, and attempted to force merchants
to comply with its rules and regulations _ in an area where
properties have been more than 90 percent Chinese-owned and
Chinese-occupied for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Chinatown's own entrepreneurs must recognize the need
to modernize. Within New York's Asian-American community, a yawning
digital divide has appeared. National studies show that
Asian-Americans as a group have the highest computer ownership and
Internet connection rates for any ethnic group in the United
States, but a recent survey by the Asian American Business
Development Center found a different picture in Chinatown. Although
85 percent of the small businesses that responded use computers,
most of those are outdated and cannot be connected to the Internet.
Most Chinatown entrepreneurs don't yet fully appreciate the need to
develop educational and economic resources to turn around the
declining businesses.
</P>
<P>
   What's most important for the preservation of Chinatown,
however, is a recognition by the city itself that this neighborhood
is an endangered asset. The City Planning Commission should study
how best to preserve Chinatown, whose special character has always
been a point of municipal pride. Our city's leaders should
recognize, too, that by helping to sustain New York in difficult
years, Chinatown helped lay the foundation for today's boom.

NEW CHIEF OF SULLIVAN &AMP; CROMWELL IS MAN OF ECLECTIC INTERESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 9.)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bridge games. Elvis Presley. Iranian hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the topics on the mind of H. Rodgin Cohen, a
leading banking lawyer who on July 1 became chairman of Sullivan &AMP;
Cromwell, the New York law firm. For more than 30 years, Cohen, 56,
has been a sought-after counselor to chief executives of the
industry's largest institutions, including the Bank of New York,
First Union and Societe Generale, advising on 10 of the 15 largest
bank mergers in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his reputation as an expert in banking arcana (he
once wrote an article titled ``Interstate Banking: Myth and
Reality''), he is a man of eclectic personal tastes. How many other
lawyers can boast of spending weeknights as a high school student
at the home of his chemistry teacher perfecting his bridge game?
And few, to be sure, can rattle off the answer to almost any
question about 1950s rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   Such interests give him an added dimension. But it is his skill
as an attentive counselor who not only understands the law, but
also how it is best applied in both business and politics, that
holds sway with clients.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the 1993 acquisition of Dreyfus Corp., a mutual fund
company, by Mellon Financial Corp. Martin G. McGuinn, chief
executive of Mellon, said executives were worried that regulators
would not allow the bank to buy a fund company.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen came up with a structural solution that allowed the deal
to be reviewed by the Comptroller of the Currency, instead of the
Federal Reserve Board, which was expected to be less flexible,
McGuinn said. It was approved.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Terracciano, who retired as president of First Union in
1997 and spent more than three decades at banks like Chase
Manhattan and Mellon, described Cohen this way: ``I used to call
him my legal St. Christopher medal,'' referring to the patron saint
of travelers. Cohen is best in a crisis, able to synthesize
information quickly and come up with a reasoned response,
Terracciano said.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he said, he reached Cohen in a Manhattan cab by cell phone
and asked a complex question. By the time Cohen reached his
destination, he had consulted with an associate and then given
Terracciano the answer.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1980, Cohen handled one of his most complex matters as
part of a team representing several banks in the exchange of
billions of dollars' worth of frozen Iranian assets for American
hostages held in Iran. The lawyers met in midtown Manhattan for
weeks to overcome the practical and legal obstacles of such an
exchange. ``It made you feel like you had a purpose in life,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Sullivan's new chairman, he faces a new set of
challenges. He must stem the flow of young lawyers seduced by
dot-com riches. Cohen has weekly lunches with small groups of
associates. The firm has also hired a consultant who interviews law
school students about why they are, or why they are not, interested
in joining the firm. ``You don't panic over someone going out to
make $10 million by age 30,'' he said. ``You can't compete with
that. What you are trying to deal with is people on the margin.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, which has 525 lawyers, is also responding to the
trends of globalization and technology. Like many other New
York-centered law firms, it is opening a Silicon Valley branch. The
firm has also recently expanded its offices in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With clients like Disney, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft, Sullivan
&AMP; Cromwell remains one of the most profitable firms in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has spent nearly his whole career at Sullivan. He was born
in Charleston, W.Va., in 1944, the elder of two brothers and the
son of a pharmacist who owned a small chain of drugstores. He did
not stay long. His parents sent him to Deerfield Academy in
Massachusetts for preparatory school, which is where he learned to
play bridge. In the early 1960s, he headed to Harvard University,
where he studied history and, in 1968, graduated from the law
school.
</P>
<P>
   He had not planned on becoming a lawyer, he said, but law school
was to continue his liberal arts education. In fact, he had
considered becoming a disc jockey or a veterinarian, but neither
career seemed promising. He once flirted with the idea of writing,
pitching a story idea to an editor friend at The New Yorker in the
early 1970s. Her response was polite but blunt, he said: ``Stick to
law.''
</P>
<P>
   That he did. He worked two years as an Army staff lawyer at Fort
Monmouth, N.J., trying to disqualify military contractors that
failed to deliver on orders. Then, in 1970, he joined Sullivan &AMP;
Cromwell.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked to join the firm's banking practice, which then
lacked glamour. Cohen changed all that. He has long represented the
New York Clearing House Association of major New York banks, making
him a weekly visitor to legislators and regulators in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he has been a top adviser in the industry's
consolidation wave, including the mergers of Chemical and Chase
Manhattan, Wells Fargo and Norwest, and First Union and Corestates.
Cohen's prowess is not unrivaled. He is often across the table from
Edward Herlihy of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz, who is also a
well-regarded banking lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen still expects to spend most of his time with his clients,
devoting about 25 percent of his long day to managing the firm.
That leaves him only limited time with his family. He has been
married since 1969. His wife, Barbara, is a former newspaper
reporter. They have a teen-age daughter and a young son.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen joked that his constituents closest to home were often the
hardest to please. Neither of his children, he said, really
understood all the fuss over 1950s music. ``They don't think it's
that sophisticated,'' he said. Folk singers get a lot more air time
in his house these days, except when the kids are gone. ``Then I
get on the treadmill and turn up the jukebox,'' he said.

CLICK, CLICK AND YOU GET THE KEYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHELINE MAYNARD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ The woman in the green Plymouth minivan
honked repeatedly and gestured. Immobilized in rush hour at the
clogged spot where three suburban Detroit freeways converge, I knew
I had not cut her off, nor had our bumpers kissed. Puzzled, I
rolled down my window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that Vapor?'' she asked excitedly, pointing to my shiny
blue Volkswagen, just three days old. I nodded. She responded with
a thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of a dozen such encounters in the month since I
took delivery of my New Beetle, one of 4,000 special editions
available only through VW's Web site. During May and June, VW
offered 2,000 Beetles in Vapor, a pale blue meant to evoke the
original baby-blue Beetle, and 2,000 in Reflex Yellow, a color akin
to that of New York taxis. They were the first new colors since the
Beetle went on sale in the summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In buying my Bug, I joined a growing number of consumers who are
making car deals online, in whole or in part. CNW Marketing
Research, a market-research firm in Bandon, Ore., estimates that
nearly 10 percent of new car buyers within the last year _ some 1.6
million people _ ordered or paid for vehicles over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Rhyder McClure, a computer consultant in New York
City, who recently bought an ML430 sport utility through the
Mercedes-Benz Web site (www.mbusa.com). He likes the convenience of
shopping on the Web, and often orders groceries, gifts and clothing
online. ``Since the day I could buy things on the Internet, I
have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McClure accomplished all but the final step on line. Placing a
deposit on his $45,000 vehicle required a visit to Mercedes-Benz of
Manhattan on West 41st Street, where, in five minutes, a salesman
completed the necessary electronic forms.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, I did not visit a dealership until I went in to
claim my keys. My purchase followed a confluence of events. First,
my next-door neighbors, Trish and Eric Promersberger, asked if I
would consider selling my 1994 Honda Accord.
</P>
<P>
   Almost simultaneously, my young nephews weighed in. Benjamin
Maynard, 8, has been a fan of the New Beetle since it first came
out, giving me gifts of Beetle-shaped cookies and a poster. This
spring, his 4-year-old brother, Parker, asked, ``Auntie Micki, when
will you have your Beetle car again?'' He was referring to test
cars I had driven.
</P>
<P>
   But the deciding factor was a VW press release promoting the
company's online sales. VW thought the program would be successful
because 60 percent of Beetle owners are frequent computer users,
said Elisabeth Vanzura, marketing director for VW of America. ``We
intend to be a leader in this area,'' Vanzura said.
</P>
<P>
   The potential ease appealed to me, and I did not feel a need to
visit a showroom because I was familiar with the car. Logging onto
VW's Web site (www.vw.com) on May 4, the first day the cars were
available, I selected Vapor Blue, picked the engine, chose leather
seats and a trim package that included a sunroof.
</P>
<P>
   My first choice _ with the latest engine, a turbocharged
1.8-liter 4-cylinder _ was not available. So instead, I selected a
car with a 2-liter conventional gas engine and completed the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   My order was immediately sent to Howard Cooper Volkswagen here.
The entire process took 17 minutes. I immediately received an
e-mail message that said: ``Congratulations. You are well on your
way to owning a Limited Edition New Beetle.'' The note told me I
now had my own home page on www.myvw.com, complete with an e-mail
account that would allow me to discuss terms with my dealer. It
promised I would hear from someone within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours later, Cooper Volkswagen's Internet sales manager,
David McCoy, rang my cellular phone. He was ready to take a deposit
of $500 and offered to let me use a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   But I decided that I really wanted the turbo. McCoy said he
could not guarantee he could get me that car because only VW, not
dealers, controlled the inventory. But later that afternoon, he
fired off an e-mail telling me that a Vapor Blue 1.8T had been
found and would be shipped to Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks of e-mail exchanges followed. I did not meet McCoy or
set foot in the dealership until May 22, when I went to pick up my
car. But through our electronic communications, I knew the car's
identification number; the seaport (Wilmington, Del.) where it had
arrived from VW's factory in Puebla, Mexico; the date it was due in
Ann Arbor; the price ($21,900 before taxes and other fees); and
various financing options.
</P>
<P>
   Because my car was a limited-edition model, there was no
negotiating. I paid the list price, in cash received from the
Promersbergers for my old car along with proceeds from a badly
performing mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   While McClure said he also could have paid cash, he decided to
finance his purchase, and sought alternatives via the Internet. He
spent four minutes completing a form at www.lendingtree.com, which
matches lenders with buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, he had four responses. ``I had never heard of these
people, and they had never heard of me,'' he said. ``But within two
hours, they were willing to loan me $35,000.'' He dismissed two
loan offers, at interest rates of 9.25 and 8 percent, as too high.
Two other banks offered loans at 7.25 and 7.7 percent. The bank
with the higher rate agreed to match the lower one. Within a few
days, he received a check, made out to him and the Mercedes
dealership, which he took to the showroom to redeem and pick up his
vehicle. McClure also shopped on the Internet for insurance.
</P>
<P>
   McClure dealt with the same salesman throughout his transaction.
At Howard Cooper, I was handed off by McCoy, the Internet
specialist, to a salesman, Ed Goldman. Completing the deal took
about two hours. In that time, Goldman verified my insurance,
accepted my personal check, explained the warranty and the owner's
manual in detail, and then gave me a tutorial on the Beetle's
features.
</P>
<P>
   My car was literally under wraps in a garage behind the
showroom, hidden away so that window shoppers wouldn't get the
impression that they could buy a similar car from inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The special handling did not end there. Members of the sales
staff, as well as the general manager, came out to look at the
Vapor Blue car and to congratulate me. I felt vaguely like a bride
when, in a final touch, Goldman handed me a bouquet of daisies, cut
to fit the dashboard bud vase, which is tinted the same color as
the car.
</P>
<P>
   The Vapor Blue Beetles were virtually sold out by June, but
sales of the Reflex Yellow models lagged; some of these have been
sent to dealers. Tony Fouladpour, VW's press relations manager,
said yellow cars tend to appeal to people with outgoing
personalities, perhaps at odds with those who spend hours surfing
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Volkswagen will use the Web again to sell special
models, Fouladpour replied, ``Absolutely.'' A future customer could
be McClure. ``I'm going to do it forever this way,'' he said. &QL;

JACK STEIN, 81; MAKEUP ARTIST TO THE STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Stein, a makeup man who made the stars shine and presidents
presentable for the TV cameras, died Thursday at MetroWest Medical
Center in Framingham, Mass. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Stein also helped the plain look pretty. As he wrote in his
``Let's Make-Up'' column in the Jewish Advocate for 15 years,
``There is no such thing as an unattractive woman, just women who
don't know how to fix themselves up.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born Jacob Stein in Boston. As a young boy he acted in
the Yiddish Theater, but soon decided acting wasn't for him. He
said he changed his career plans when he discovered he was better
at applying makeup than delivering lines.
</P>
<P>
   The young Jacob started by mixed makeup in the bathtub in his
parent's home. By 1945, he had established the Jack Stein Makeup
Center, which still operates on Congress Street in Boston. He sold
makeup under his own label.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Stein's theatrical clients included Barbra Streisand,
Lucille Ball, and Tony Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   When TV became important to the political process, he began
doing makeup for political figures, presidents Eisenhower, Truman
and Kennedy among them.
</P>
<P>
   In a story published in the Globe on Nov. 4, 1966, he discussed
his political clients. John F. Kennedy, he said, ``fidgeted and
couldn't wait to get out of the chair.'' Harry S Truman told him in
salty language what he could do with his makeup. Eisenhower was
among the most patient and polite of all his clients, and British
statesman Anthony Eden once mused, ``I wonder what Winston
(Churchill) would have to say about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Stein volunteered his time to assist disfigured patients at
the Burns Institute of Boston's Shriners Hospital for Children, and
other hospitals. For 25 years, he taught at Emerson College, which
awarded him an honorary degree.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Sophie (Shapiro); two daughters, Judy Klamka
of Purdys, N.Y., a daughter, Sharon Weinberger of South Deerfield,
Mass.; two sisters, Sarah Budd of Lawrence, Mass. and Frances Marks
of Easton, Mass.; five grandchildren and a great-grandson.

&HT;     MEXICAN MARVELS: NEW PRESIDENT, CHANCE FOR SMOOTH TRANSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, July 9)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DUDLEY ALTHAUS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Whether giddy, ambivalent or broken-hearted, many
Mexicans have spent the past week getting their minds around the
idea that their country has finally joined the ranks of the world's
modern democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential election of Vicente Fox of the center-right
National Action Party ended more than seven decades of rule by a
political machine that many charged was venal, violent and
inefficient. Fox's inauguration on Dec. 1 will mark the first time
in generations that power has passed peacefully between political
rivals here.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, also the de facto leader of the
outgoing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has promised to
work with Fox for a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps very few, and I include myself, imagined a scenario of
this kind,'' Fox told foreign correspondents during a lengthy press
conference last week. ``Of course I knock on wood that it continues
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Mexicans, Fox marveled at the passing of the PRI's
71-year rule to a democracy full of citizen participation ``with
stability, speed and tranquility.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Fox must govern a deeply fragmented and impoverished
nation of 100 million people beset with high unemployment,
organized crime and political bossism.
</P>
<P>
   His challenge, analysts say, will be to produce significant, yet
controlled change. And there likely will be a lot of wood knocking
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for democratic government to show results
fast,'' said Edward Gibson, a political scientist at Northwestern
University who has specialized in the democratic transitions in
South America. ``They are under pressure to solve the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But in giving the PRI the boot, voters also denied Fox the blank
check held by every past Mexican president. Undermining Fox's
euphoric victory is the knowledge that more ballots were cast
against than for him.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's National Action Party will hold the largest block in both
chambers of Congress. But it won't have a majority in either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has a golden opportunity to put in good government,''
Gibson said. ``But the ball is in the hands of the opposition,
because the president is really going to have to be looking for
coalitions.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of any consensus-building will depend on the faction
that eventually wins power in the internal feuding that erupted in
the PRI following Sunday's election, analysts said. Success will
also may depend on whether Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leader of
Mexico's fractious left, can hold himself and his followers to
their vow of not cooperating with a Fox administration.
</P>
<P>
   Friction also persists between Fox and some leaders of the
National Action Party, which is widely known here by its Spanish
acronym, PAN.
</P>
<P>
   Fox comes from a party wing, sometimes called the Barbarians of
the North, whose more confrontational politics often rankled the
PAN's leaders who favored backroom agreements over street
agitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are constant tensions,'' said Fox adviser Carlos Arce.
``The PAN is a party forged in the opposition to be opposition. Now
it's going to have to transform itself to be a governing party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain uncertainty in all of this,'' Arce said.
``Democracy is complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox, his advisers and some analysts say that cutting deals
is what both the president-elect and his National Action Party do
best.
</P>
<P>
   Arce, an outgoing National Action congressman and a longtime Fox
ally from his home state of Guanajuato, said the president-elect is
``a man who understands politics as two people sitting at a table
talking and reaching agreement. This Fox at the table is the Fox
who is going to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Coca-Cola now,'' said political scientist Federico
Estevez, referring to Fox's stint as that company's senior
executive in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to cut a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's takes the long view. He's very steady,'' Estevez
continued. ``He's got all the qualities he needs to see him through
the hard times. And hard times are coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Since winning on Sunday, Fox has been meeting with Mexican and
foreign reporters to get out his message that he means to have a
plural government made up of men and women of various political
stripes. While saying he hopes to spread the benefits of Mexico's
free-market economic policies, Fox considers that a long-term goal.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Fox told foreign reporters last week, his
administration will focus on the corruption and illicit
back-scratching that defines Mexican public life.
</P>
<P>
   He proposes to reorganize federal law enforcement, which has
been badly corroded by billions of dollars in bribes by
international narcotics smugglers. And he has called for a new
agency in the Congress to keep tabs on Executive Branch financial
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes down the road will depend upon the success of the
anti-corruption effort, Arce said. The trick, he said, will be to
prevent a PAN government from becoming as corrupt as those in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibilities of corruption are enormous,'' Arce, 45,
said. ``The same corruption that the PRI was exposed to, within a
few years could permeate the PAN.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the PAN manages above all to attack the corruption within
its ranks, we can have two or three governments that are good for
Mexico. If not, there will be a change.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has lagged far behind the rest of Latin America in
working out a formula for peacefully alternating power. And the
experience with democratic government throughout the region has
been decidedly mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Multiparty systems have sunk deep roots in such former military
dictatorships as Argentina, Chile and Brazil, but profound
disappointment with the politicians' inability to address the needs
of most citizens have given rise to strongman-rule in Peru and
Venezuela and brought political chaos to Colombia and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime activists worry that Mexicans, after so many
decades of having most of their political decisions made for them,
will want Fox to simply ape the PRI's authoritian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now as we bury the symbolic father that marked our lives for a
century, let's not commit the error of substituting him with
another one,'' Segio Aguayo, a long-time democracy advocate who
lost a run for Congress on a left-of-center ticket, wrote in the
daily Reforma last week.
</P>
<P>
   But others say Fox's victory shows that Mexican society has
matured enough to make democratic decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an new consciousness among people of the power they
have,'' said sociologist Maria del Carmen Diaz, an outgoing federal
congresswoman from Fox's party. ``It's beyond parties.````There was
a rupture, and what was broken, was the fear and the
subordination,'' she said. ``Hope lies in two pillars: One is the
Fox government. But the other is the knowledge that if it doesn't
work, they can remove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that the power is within us.''

&HT;     ZEDILLO EARNS TEPID PRAISE FOR MEXICO'S POLITICAL SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, July 9)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DUDLEY ALTHAUS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Amid the turmoil of his long-ruling party's loss
of national power in the July 2 election, President Ernesto Zedillo
has won wide praise for bringing peaceful democratic transition to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Zedillo oversaw the electoral reforms that leveled
the playing field between his ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the PRI, and the political opposition. And those changes led
to the opposition parties winning control of the lower house of
Congress in 1997 and the presidency last week.
</P>
<P>
   But many democracy advocates and political opponents in Mexico
give Zedillo only a grudging nod for his role in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did what he had to do,'' said Sergio Aguayo, a founder of
the Civic Alliance, an elections watchdog group established in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox's election as president marked a milestone on the
country's long and frequently violent path to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The elections culminated decades of political pressure and
agitation in which the PRI's power was whittled away by both
conservative and leftist opponents. Although still strong in many
rural areas and especially in Mexico's impoverished south, by last
week the PRI was a silhouette of its former self.
</P>
<P>
   For many politically active Mexicans, the democratic
transformation began 32 years ago, when army troops slaughtered
hundreds of student in a downtown Mexico City plaza who were
protesting against the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Through the mid-1980s, the National Action Party and several
other opposition factions won a number of city halls along the U.S.
border and across northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI held on to many cities, and the state government of
Chihuahua through only election fraud, critics say. National Action
activists responded to each fraud with sit-ins, hunger strikes and
other public demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, a coalition of disgruntled left-leaning defectors from
the PRI and members of tiny socialist parties under Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas harnessed a groundswell of popular anger and nearly won
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   After vote-counting computers at the PRI-controlled Interior
Ministry inexplicably broke down on election night, the ruling
party's Carlos Salinas de Gortari was declared the winner. Since
then, Cardenas' supporters say that nearly 650 of their number have
been killed in political disputes with the PRI and the government.
</P>
<P>
   To help win legitimacy and forge an alliance that would allow
him to govern, Salinas recognized a National Action victory for the
statehouse in Baja California in 1989 and later in other states. In
return, National Action frequently voted in favor of Salinas'
economic proposals in the Congress, infuriating Cardenas'
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Then Maya Indian peasants led by leftist intellectuals launched
a bloody uprising in southernmost Chiapas state on New Year's 1994,
the day the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and the
United States went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion was quickly contained militarily. But it unleashed
political chaos followed by assassinations, first of the PRI's
presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, and five months later
of its second-ranking official. Many Mexicans believe both men were
victims of a power struggle within the PRI itself.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who had replaced Colosio as the PRI's candidate, won
his presidency in a largely fraud-free vote. But the economy, which
had been propped up by PRI policy-makers to help get him elected,
finally collapsed in late December 1994, setting off the worst of
Mexico's many economic crises under the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Politically weakened and occupied with the economy, Zedillo
yielded to opposition pressure, recognizing more election wins in
state governments across Mexico. At the same time, he distanced
himself from the PRI while maneuvering to maintain control of it,
replacing the party's presidents seven time during his term of
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took any pretext possible to avoid doing dirty business
with the PRI,'' said political analyst Frederico Estevez, who
briefly served on Zedillo's team of advisers.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday's elections, more than half of Mexicans were already
governed by the political opposition on the state and local levels.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Zedillo scrapped a PRI tradition in which a sitting
president hand-picked the country's next president. In its place,
Zedillo allowed a primary in which his candidate handily won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the slightest doubt that the intention was to
sabotage the PRI so that it would lose,'' Cesar Agusto Santiago, a
former PRI congressman and deputy interior minister, said in a
nationally broadcast radio interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo amazed Mexicans last Sunday night just hours after the
polls closed by declaring Fox the next president with only a
fraction of the votes counted and before the PRI candidate had
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the old-line members of the PRI bitterly
accused the president of selling out the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there was a problem, was in the leadership, not the
base,'' Santiago said in the radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI was able to defeat the PRI.''

DRAWING ON YOUNG RESOURCES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use after July 10, 2000 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below)

<P>
   &QL; 
Lining the walls of the Every Picture Tells a Story gallery for the
next month are drawings that could as easily be attached to a
refrigerator door or tacked to a proud parent's office cubicle.
They bear the distinct mark of a child's imagination and
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Except the subjects are hardly childlike.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see an abundance of sun, rainbows or houses _ images
that typically dominate art by children. Occasionally, the faces
will be smiling. More often, not. A clay modeled hand is covered
with pins. In a crayon and charcoal drawing, the haunted-eyed face
of a single flower grows out of a pile of rocks. In another crayon
drawing, a stick figure adult rescues a child following the bombing
of the federal building in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   The artists' names aren't revealed. We only learn their age,
gender and the element of their lives that makes their stories more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The young artists featured in ``Childhood Revealed: Art
Expressing Pain, Discovery and Hope,'' suffer from learning
disabilities, attention deficit disorder, anxiety, depression and
schizophrenia. Some have been victims of divorce; others have
suffered physical and sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   And, just like children who have never experienced trauma or
mental illness, these painters and sculptors _ ages 4 to 18 _ have
found a way to express themselves through art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that children's artwork is beautiful,'' says
Dr. Harold Koplewicz, director of the New York University Child
Study Center. ``You can be psychiatrically ill and still be a
child. That's what this is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will be at the Los Angeles gallery through July
30 before continuing a national tour through the end of 2001.
Proceeds from the exhibition and from an accompanying coffee table
book _ co-edited by Koplewicz and Dr. Robin Goodman _ will benefit
research at the Child Study Center.
</P>
<P>
   During its stay, the art _ which includes water color drawings,
collages and sculpture _ will educate, and, Koplewicz hopes,
enlighten those who see it. The images may disturb people as well,
but as Child Study Center officials note, there's nothing pretty
about mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million children and teens in the United States
suffer from mental health problems such as depression, eating
disorders, learning disabilities and anxiety, but only a fraction
have been diagnosed and receive treatment. Exhibitions like
``Childhood Revealed'' help give these children and their
afflictions some much-needed recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with an issue that we don't think gets talked
about enough, and dealing with some brutal subjects,'' says Brein
Lopez, Every Picture's curator. ``There's a tendency for adults to
just sort of stay away from emotional issues, but I think it's very
important that we allow ourselves to see that kids do deal with
these types of emotions on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the usual fare for Every Picture Tells a Story, which
typically displays art from children's books. But gallery officials
had recently been studying the works and career of Friedl
Dicker-Brandeis, a woman who pioneered art therapy techniques
during the Holocaust, and the subject of a future exhibition. They
concluded that the ``Childhood Revealed'' exhibition was a perfect
fit after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``With art being banned from schools over the last 12 years,
we're losing our ability to experience art on a daily basis,'' said
Lopez. ``When art is used as a way for kids to relate to their
surroundings and emotions, it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 700 pieces of artwork _ all submitted anonymously by
the children's teachers, counselors and therapists _ were entered
for consideration in the exhibition. A jury of teachers, artists
and educators, including New Yorker art critic Paul Goldberger _
made the final selection for ``Childhood Revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   But as revealing as the artwork may seem, Koplewicz cautions
exhibition visitors to refrain from becoming amateur clinicians
after looking at the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The works themselves are not diagnostic. It would be
inappropriate and unsafe to interpret what they mean.'' says
Koplewicz. ``A child who doesn't have the same disorder can do the
same work. Some of them are just beautiful pieces of art.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, however, the artists themselves provide a window
of interpretation via an extended caption. Under his acrylic and
watercolor titled ``Breaking Through,'' a 15-year-old boy with
bipolar disorder writes: ``In this painting I am portraying myself
on the dark side and other people on the light side. There is a
chain in the middle because I used to put up an emotional wall and
did not let others help me. I used drugs for help instead. Well,
now the chain is broken and I let others help. I am not alone
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Since opening at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York
last November, ``Childhood Revealed'' has spawned several tie-in
events. Local medical facilities have sponsored forums on mental
health and, in certain cases, have brought in celebrities who
suffered from various forms of illness or physical disabilities as
children. Katie Couric wrote the forward to the book, which also
includes a paragraph from Ted Kennedy Jr. A few of the artists have
even broken their anonymity, appearing at functions to talk about
their works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to educate America about these disorders, and
hopefully we can leave something behind,'' says Koplewicz. ``It's
not that the New York University Child Study Center is coming to
California. The idea is that these kids are everywhere.'' &QL;

<P>
   HUNT (Phoenix) - The controversy started, best anyone can tell,
May 27, 1999, when several Hopis arrived in the offices of Wupatki
National Monument outside Flagstaff. The members of a clan from
Third Mesa were on a simple errand. For religious purposes -
approved by government permit, no less - could they take a golden
eaglet from their ancestral grounds on the monument? Yes, it would
be killed and its feathers used as part of a ceremony. The request
was denied, and what started out as a simple errand has now become
the hinge upon which a national policy turns. The Hopis want a
golden eaglet. The National Park Service wants to obey the law and
its own rules. And a contentious issue with wide-ranging precedents
is about to split open. By JUDD SLIVKA. Story will move in the
``A'' category.
</P>
<P>
   BORDERAIR (Undated) - The U.S. Border Patrol is borrowing
airplanes from across the country to fly extra missions of mercy
along Arizona's remote frontier as the death toll rises among
illegal border crossers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tucson sector, which includes most of Arizona's border with
Mexico, has been this year's hotspot in the nation for immigrants
in distress, the Border Patrol said. The numbers tell the story:
844 people rescued and 52 dead since October.
</P>
<P>
   The sector's rescues accounted for roughly 60 percent of all
immigrant rescues along the nation's southwest border. The number
of deaths is already nearly twice that of last year's. By PAT
FLANNERY. Story will move in the ``A'' category.

Lived in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort
by a team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of
ordinary people and some of the troubling issues that Americans
continue to face. The following story will move in the `a' category
for release on Sunday. Earlier articles are available to be resent

   RACE-COPS-DRUGS (New York) _ On Friday, Feb. 25, at 5 p.m.,
there wasn't a single narcotics officer on the streets of Harlem.
Everyone was being held inside on standby in case of a race riot.
The Amadou Diallo verdict was about to come down. The whites _
officers like Sgt. Maria Brogli and Detectives Lee Macklowe and
John Montes _ hoped the four Diallo officers would be found not
guilty. The blacks _ detectives like Johnny Gonzalez and the
undercovers Derrick and Rob _ felt they should be found guilty on
at least some counts. Feelings ran deep. No case in recent years
has hit the police closer to home. By Michael Winerip.

Gregory's sanctuary for the leaders of the Irish literary revival;

was the World Financial Center's Winter Garden on July 4th weekend.
This sort of thing takes place here all the time; the midpoints of

WINE-PROMOTING TV ADS GET AXED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM HAMMETT   
 WineToday.com   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After test-marketing an ad campaign with a catch-phrase of
``Wine. What are you saving it for?'' the Wine Market Council is
opting to put its efforts into the Internet, in-store merchandising
and public relations, rather than into more costly television and
radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is the right message but the medium was the wrong
medium,'' said Wine Market Council president John Gillespie,
explaining why the broadcast campaign was tested only in Albany,
N.Y., and Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was an attempt to enhance the image of wine as baby
boomers, the industry's core consumers, age and the next generation
leans more toward beer and martinis.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the wine industry were disappointed at the decision not
to run broadcast ads. ``It's a shame that it was ruled out,'' said
Martin Johnson, vice president of marketing and advertising for
Robert Mondavi Winery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when Gallo, Taylor Wines and Paul Masson started
advertising in the 1980s, wine consumption rose to its highest
level,'' Johnson said. ``And when those ads stopped we started to
see consumption drop.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted, however, that few premium wineries could afford
television.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was designed to change marginal wine drinkers'
perception that wine is suitable only for special events, and to
get those consumers to consider it an accompaniment to meals.
</P>
<P>
   Bozell Worldwide, the agency that came up with the milk mustache
and the ``Pork, the Other White Meat'' campaigns, developed the
television, billboard and radio commercials for the wine industry.
The campaign showcased special days, like National Hog Day, that
consumers could celebrate by serving wine with a meal.
</P>
<P>
   The test ads ran for three months at a cost of $1.3 million, and
were funded by wine producers, importers, grape growers and
industry organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all knew it was going to be a challenge to get the
industry to fund a national campaign to the tune that would be
required to make this work,'' said Sutter Home's director of public
relations, Stan Hock. ``Many larger wineries who can afford to put
money into it are more likely going to put that money into their
own ad campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutter Home has used broadcast advertising since the early
1990s. The Napa Valley winery spent $5 million to $7 million last
year creating and airing television ads during the Christmas
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is to sponsor Public Broadcasting programs.
Kendall-Jackson, and the Jackson family's Artisans &AMP; Estates wines,
sponsor programs like Jacques Pepin's ``Cooking with Claudine'' and
``Cooking with Jacques and Julia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part philanthropic,'' said John Maxwell, Kendall-Jackson
brand manager. ``But we score with consumers and with the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   While K-J already has spent $1.5 million sponsoring such
programming, there are other costs like the underwriting of dinners
in major markets for 100 or so viewers, with Pepin and Julia Child
as guests of honor. These events raise money for public
broadcasting, and the costs generally are defrayed by sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with most marketing concepts, it isn't the direct cost that
gets you, it's the support you must give to the project to make it
work, which generally costs far more than the advertising
investment,'' said K-J's director of public relations, Jim Caudill.
</P>
<P>
   Some winery officials said the industry has to go beyond
consumer and wine trade publications to reach infrequent drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the industry tends to preach to the choir too much
rather than go for a broader audience to pick up new customers,''
said Johnson of Mondavi.

IRELAND, ONCE A HOMELAND OF EMIGRES, IS MAGNET FOR NEW IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRR, Ireland _ It is hard to find anyone in this busy little
town with a specific complaint about the 70-odd strangers who
abruptly arrived last fall from places like Chechnya and Nigeria.
But that does not mean the town wants them here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're ignorant, but the only colored person you'd ever
see before was someone back from England,'' said a 45-year-old
carpenter who refused to give his name, saying that the issue was
too fraught and that Birr, with only 4,000 or so people, was too
small.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we're biased,'' he said, trying to explain why
he had not spoken to any of the newcomers, who are living here at
government expense while their applications for political asylum
are being considered. ``It's just that we don't know what to make
of these black people. We don't understand them. We're, maybe,
afraid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, Ireland's membership in the European Union
has helped fuel an economic boom, transforming an isolated,
desperately poor economy into the proud success that calls itself
the Celtic Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom has brought another European dividend: waves of
unwanted newcomers, most of them seeking refuge from politically
unstable, war-ravaged areas of Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And now Ireland, with its history of sending its citizens abroad
in search of better lives, has become something it never would have
imagined: a magnet for the dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the real world catching up to us,'' said Piaris Mac
Einri, director of the Irish Center for Migration Studies at
University College, Cork. ``It's not just about refugees. It's
about Ireland no longer being a small, white place of emigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   By now the Irish are all too familiar with the prejudice and
hardships their countrymen suffered over the centuries as they
searched for work abroad. It is hard-wired into their sense of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That is why people like Ned Lawton become so angry when they
hear the common complaint, voiced in Birr and elsewhere, that the
refugees are here simply to take advantage of Ireland's newfound
wealth, not to flee persecution at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s when you saw a headline about illegal immigrants,
you'd assume the article was talking about Irish immigrants in New
York,'' said Lawton, a spokesman for the Irish Refugee Council.
``This is all a bit rich, coming from us, particularly now that we
have a booming economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe is awash in refugees these days, but Ireland, more than
its Continental cousins, has been forced by the rush of events to
make up its asylum policy as it goes along.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 only 39 people applied for asylum in Ireland. In 1999
there were 7,724. Now 1,000 are applying every month, a number that
sounds inconsequential until you consider Ireland's relatively tiny
size, less than half the size of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   With only 3.6 million residents, the country drew more asylum
seekers as a percentage of its population last year than any other
European country except Austria and Belgium. Most of the new
arrivals have gravitated to an already overwhelmed Dublin, forcing
the government to scramble for places to put them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A proposal to build floating detention centers, or ``flotels,''
foundered when port after port up and down the coast found new
objections to raise. The current plan is to build some 4,000
housing units where the refugees can live for the 18 months or so
it generally takes to process their applications.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerians, Congolese, Romanians, Chechens and Poles living
in the Maltings guesthouse at one end of Birr are beneficiaries, if
that is the right word, of the government's current emergency
program of dispersing the asylum-seekers around the country, even
in rural areas ill equipped to handle them and even less prepared
to welcome them.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem, for the refugees and the residents, is
the government's decision to forbid asylum seekers to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're having a situation where people are being dispersed,
but social services are not dispersed with them,'' Mac Einri said.
``Local government is in a poor state, and we're not really giving
it any extra money.''
</P>
<P>
   In Birr the program has stirred up a stew of feelings, many of
them negative, about where the country is going.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say they cannot square the fact that the asylum
seekers are living rent-free, with their meals taken care of and 15
pounds ($18) a week in spending money besides, with the knowledge
that there are still Irish people living on the streets of Dublin.

</P>
<P>
   ``They keep to themselves,'' admitted a 23-year-old man, walking
past the Maltings on his way home from work. ``But most people
aren't happy with them. They're living the life of luxury.'' He
spoke on condition that his name and occupation not be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, who is in his 50s and runs a tractor-trailer
business, stood next to a small construction site and said he
thought Ireland was taking on more than it could handle. Birr, too.
</P>
<P>
   People tend to know each other here. Smack in the middle of
Ireland, the town has several bustling streets of small stores and
pubs and makes its living from a handful of factories around its
edges and from the tourists who drive through, looking for Birr
Castle.
</P>
<P>
   Before the newcomers came, the man said, he had rarely _ if ever
_ seen more than one dark-skinned person at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned against them completely when I saw them begging in
restaurants,'' he said. He did not know whom he had seen. ``Either
Romanians or Nigerians,'' he said. ``We don't know the difference.
They're all the same. They're all black, and we've never been used
to colored people here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the cultural divide are people like Dorcas
Balogun, 25. For Balogun, a Muslim who fled Nigeria with her
husband when both of his parents were killed by Christians who then
came looking for them, her exile to Birr has meant long days of
idleness, with too much time to fret about the future.
</P>
<P>
   While she waits for her application to be processed _ and only a
tiny percentage of the Nigerians who applied for asylum in Ireland
last year had their applications accepted _ she has had scarcely a
conversation, let alone a shared meal, with an actual Irish person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly I just sit around the house all day,'' she said, the
house being the two-bedroom apartment she and her husband share
with another Nigerian couple. Sometimes they take the long, slow
bus ride into Dublin, but they do not feel comfortable walking
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too bad,'' her husband, Adele, said. ``But sometimes,
when you go out to take some air, they look at you and say: `Black
people _ what are you doing in Ireland? Go back to your country.'''
</P>

   Some townspeople have reached out. Maeve Garry, who runs the
Maltings with her husband, has made several trips to Dublin to buy
African food. The Rev. Tony Cahir, the priest at St. Brendan's, the
Roman Catholic church in Birr, organized a minivan trip to a
neighboring town and also distributed used radios and tape
recorders donated by his parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   And when he sees the refugees walking past his house on their
way to the tiny local library, where they tend to gather, he goes
out of his way to greet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was somebody passing by, I'd introduce them and say,
`This is Jimmy from Nigeria,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cahir said the community had reacted as well as could be
expected. ``Honestly, I'd say that the attitude has been a positive
one,'' he said.

   ``There has been wonderment, questioning, people asking who
these people are, what is going to happen. But then people realized
that they were here waiting for a decision from the government, and
they saw that there's been absolutely no trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But his optimism does not erase the anger simmering beneath the
surface around the country, particularly in the places ordered to
accept people they do not want. So far, more than 1,000 refugees
are living in small communities outside Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Kildare, the outraged Chamber of Commerce has
sued to block the arrival of 400 refugees, pointing out that the
town has already taken in 300 from Kosovo. And in tiny Clogheen, in
County Tipperary, an empty hostel that was being refurbished to
house 40 asylum seekers was set on fire, apparently in protest at
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked to consult a lot more, but you have to
understand our predicament,'' said Alan Mulligan, a spokesman for
the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, explaining the
government's policy of dispersing the refugees. ``The vast majority
_ 90 percent _ were staying in Dublin, and we just didn't have the
accommodation for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a country that was so homogeneous until the mid-1990s
that the Rough Guide travel book described its residents as having
a ``uniquely naive brand of racism,'' is trying as best as it can
to figure out what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government accepts its obligation to asylum seekers under
international law,'' Mulligan said. ``Racism will not be tolerated.
But no government can go into any village and force people to like
each other.''

RUNNING THE TEACHERS UNION IS A BALANCING ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Resplendent in her brand-new heathery indigo
pantsuit, adrenaline still pumping from her keynote address an hour
before, Sandra Feldman, the president of the American Federation of
Teachers, strode through the gleaming convention center, surrounded
by her members, her teachers, her people. They stopped her for
snapshots. They called out congratulations. They waved, and she
smiled that outsized Sandy Feldman smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken a poll, and we all agree,'' Nat LaCour, the
federation's No. 2, whispered as he walked up. ``Blond is
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yup, Sandy Feldman has dyed her hair blond. Brash, blunt,
Brooklyn-Jewish Sandy Feldman, whose saucy voice and
straightforward manner _ perhaps whose very soul _ practically ooze
brunette, has gone blond.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to downplay it, brushing off questions about her salon
by suggesting that a male leader would never be asked such things.
She called it ``highlights,'' though the entire top layer of her
shoulder-length bob has been colored. Then later, loosening up a
little, she admitted that when she first saw her lightened locks in
the mirror she almost redyed them brown.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Feldman is right, and it is a superficial _ even sexist _
detail hardly worth mentioning. Or maybe making such a bold change
two weeks before your organization's biennial convention _ your big
chance to bond with your members and shine in the media spotlight
for days _ maybe that suggests a comfort and confidence level that
means something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought I'd try it,'' she said over a hotel breakfast
of poached eggs, wholewheat toast and coffee with ``as much
caffeine as you have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was summertime. It was a lark. I might not keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been over three years since the legendary Al Shanker died
and Feldman, his protege, replaced him at the federation's helm.
The smaller but scrappier of the two national teachers unions, the
American Federation of Teachers has swelled by more than 100,000 to
top 1 million members under Feldman's leadership over the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   And there has rarely been a moment when education, particularly
the question of teacher quality, has been higher on the national
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman, 60, is seizing the opportunity to talk about increasing
her members' salaries and professionalizing their jobs, but also
about educating the poorest and hardest to teach of America's
children. If there is one thing that differentiates her from the
hard-driving Shanker, it is the obviousness of her passionate
commitment to the children, which erupts through the smile
stretched across her face as she escorts a nervous kindergartner
across a stage on July 4 for a musical performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a moment when the kids who have really been left out
can really get help,'' she said. ``I want to fix those schools. I
know those schools are not what they should be. If we don't
prevail, I'm afraid they're going to be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is who I am,'' she added. ``I'm a poor kid from Coney
Island. I couldn't have had a life of any success if I didn't have
education.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Familiar to those who have been watching since Feldman became
president of New York's United Federation of Teachers in 1986, her
story is an education fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a milkman and a sickly woman who sometimes
worked in a bakery, Feldman grew up in a dirty tenement and then a
public housing project. Her second-grade teacher at P.S. 188 gave
her books like ``A Child's Garden of Verses,'' which she devoured,
often while at home in bed with asthma.
</P>
<P>
   She won a creative writing award at James Madison High School,
studied English at Brooklyn College and, while pursuing a master's
degree in literature, taught first- and fourth-grade at P.S. 34 in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   When Feldman tried to join the union at her school, there wasn't
one. So she built it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Married after her first year of college and divorced 17 years
later, Feldman never had children of her own but has spent her life
surrounded by them, doting on her nieces and nephews and visiting
schools three times a week during the three decades she worked for
the United Federation of Teachers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now married to Arthur Barnes, a New York businessman, she exults
in his 6-year-old grandson, who has just finished first grade at a
Brooklyn public school.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman lives primarily in New York, commuting to her union's
headquarters in Washington. When not traveling to assist local
leaders with negotiations _ or connect with teachers unions in Hong
Kong or Chile or South Africa _ she and Barnes, 70, go salsa
dancing and frequent jazz clubs.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the union local in New York, Feldman emptied
schools of time-clocks, successfully sued the district over
decrepit conditions, and helped pick chancellors _ even mayors.
Since becoming national president, she has called for shutting down
failing schools, establishing tough tests for entry into the
teaching profession and, this week, creating an optional
transitional year for high school students who lack basic skills.
</P>
<P>
   Though it makes some in the rank and file bristle, Feldman
supports the wave of new standardized tests that have come along
with higher academic expectations over the last decade, and is open
to suggestions about compensating teachers in part based on
performance.
</P>
<P>
   It is a funny balance, running a trade union of college-educated
professionals; the enemy, she said, is the growing cohort of
entrepreneurs eyeing the $3 billion educational industrial complex,
and the Republican politicians who want to give parents vouchers of
public money for private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get power and dismantle the public schools _ or, over
a period of time, decide that we won't educate all our kids _ then
we will be a different country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me. I've got this in my gut,'' she added. ``Look at
me. If that school wasn't there, I wouldn't be here.''

for Sunday, July 9, will move Saturday.

   Planned for the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-WORLD-POWER-REVIEW (Washington) _ The
U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian summit meeting raises anew the overarching
questions dogging President Clinton, his aspiring successors and
Congress. Toward what ends should America harness the astounding
economic, military, political and cultural power it has accrued in
recent years? Is it enough to act as the world's peacemaker? Why is
the country having so much trouble establishing its international
priorities? By David Sanger. (Moving in `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   PRESCRIPTION-DRUGS-REVIEW (Washington) _ In this election
season, helping the elderly pay for their pills is a political
no-brainer: Everybody's for it. The fight is over how to do it.
Republicans want private insurers to run any prescription drug
benefits plan. Democrats want the government in control. But that
classic liberal-conservative clash masks the real issue: how much
drugs will cost, and who will set their prices. By Sheryl Gay
Stolberg. (Moving in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL-SPECIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Like dolphins, chimpanzees and
other gregarious creatures, humans are a ``highly social species.''
Dining al fresco on crowded sidewalks with cell phones grafted to
our ears. You scratch my back, I'll de-flea yours. Synchronized
swimming, anyone? Biologists say the complexities of social life
are what gave rise to big brains and intelligence in the first
place. Highly social species are, as a rule, the smartest and most
sophisticated. But why is there nothing stupider, nothing more
primitive and dangerous, than a crowd of people? If human sociality
has its roots in its primate past, it's worth asking whether the
menacing side of a human crowd likewise resembles group behavior
among nonhuman species. By Natalie Angier.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-SUPERSTITIONS-REVIEW (New York) _ The ``Macbeth'' curse,
in which productions of that play have been harried by misfortune,
is not the only hanging over the black-magic-laden world of the
theater, a profession where open incantations of blood lust
(``Break a leg!'') are routine. The list of taboos is lengthy:
never whistle in the dressing room, never open an umbrella onstage,
never play an electrical fuse. A brief rundown of some current and
ancient omens plaguing the stage. By James McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   SWEATSHOPS-REVIEW (undated) _ Many consumers are displaying
noblesse oblige toward the millions of foreign workers who make the
goods that flood American stores. For years, anti-sweatshop
protests accomplished next to nothing. But as the anti-sweatshop
movement continues to grow _ and grow louder _ manufacturers have
recently taken steps that just might improve working conditions
around the world. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-HYPE-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's movie hype season. Since
1975, when ``Jaws'' devoured the box office and showed the film
industry new ways to get kids to see films over and over again
during the summer, hype has become its own industry. Colossal
promotional campaigns that studios create to sell their films
include the repetitive cover stories in glossy magazines, newspaper
and TV coverage and blanket advertising. Studios usually spend one
and a half times the production budget of a movie on publicity. By
Elvis Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   BOYSCOUT-MANUAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The recent Supreme Court
decision that allowed the Boy Scouts to expel a gay member dealt in
part with the moral values of Scouting. The first Boy Scout manual,
published in 1910 by Scouting founder Ernest Thompson Seton, says
nothing about homosexuality, but much to say about primal urges and
manly passions. Some passages are excerpted.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ The victory of
opposition presidential candidate Vicente Fox has raised hopes
among poor Mexicans, who are indicating that they will no longer
hand over their votes and expect little in return. What they most
expect from Fox are programs and reforms that will help Mexico's
new democracy expand beyond elections. But what some do not quite
realize is that the new president's powers have also been radically
altered _ and in some ways weakened _ by some of the same currents
that carried him to victory: he is not part of the one-party
apparatus that monopolized power but so often failed its people. By
Ginger Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   BOSNIA-ATROCITIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Thousands of carefully
numbered, white plastic bags stacked on wooden shelves fill two
tunnels behind a morgue in central Bosnia. In warm weather, the
stench is overwhelming. The bags contain the remains of 2,000
bodies collected over the last five years from mass graves and
hillsides around Srebrenica. The limbo in which the bodies still
wait for final burial stands as a symbol of the uncertain fate of
Bosnia itself _ and much else in the Balkans. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   BEIRUT-RETURN-REVIEW (Beirut, Lebanon) _ A journalist describes
his impressions of today's Beirut and the Beirut he left in 1985.
Chaos and violence have been replaced by tranquility and order. By
John Kifner.

   LEDE STORY:
</P>
<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Just 11,000 jobs were created in June,
much fewer than expected and the smallest increase in four years,
in the latest sign that the U.S. economy is slowing. The nonfarm
payrolls number, however, reflected a loss of 195,000 government
jobs as Census workers completed their work. That offset a gain of
206,000 jobs in private business. Still, the unemployment rate
slipped to 4 percent from 4.1 percent, matching expectations and
bring the rate closer to April's 30-year low of 3.9 percent. And
private business is now averaging growth of 177,000 jobs a month so
far this year, a slowdown from last year's pace of 220,000 jobs. By
Louis Uchitelle.

   MAIN DISPLAY:

<P>
   DULUTH-SISTERCITY (Duluth, Minn.) _ On the street here these
days you hear French, Swedish, Russian, Japanese and at least half
a dozen other foreign tongues. It's not tourists who give the city
this cosmopolitan air, but business executives. Not too bad for a
city that 80 years ago, under the alias Zenith, was branded as
hopelessly small-minded and provincial by Sinclair Lewis in his
novel ``Babbitt.'' Duluth is still no New York or Los Angeles, of
course. Or even a place like Rochester, home of the Mayo Clinic.
But it has focused more on the wider world not just because of its
shipping trade through the Great Lakes but also because of its
sister-city program _ the nonprofit city-to-city network inspired
by President Dwight Eisenhower's suggestion in 1956 that citizen
diplomacy might lessen the chance of future world conflict. By
William H. Honan.

   CHINA-SOFTWARE (Shanghai, China) _ Janet Reno isn't the only one
worried about Bill Gates' software monopoly. China's leaders are,
too. They are concerned that the country is growing overly
dependent on the Windows operating system, which controls computers
running everything from China's banks to President Jiang Zemin's
e-mail box. But the Chinese government, itself a master at
monopoly, is taking its case against Microsoft not to the courtroom
but to the marketplace, albeit with a bit of administrative fiat.
It is backing the Linux operating system, created by a Finnish
university student in 1991 and distributed free to anyone who wants
it. By Craig S. Smith.

</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If your investing style could be a geometric figure, what kind
would it be?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a polyhedron, like the pyramid with the shining upper
chamber that serves as the logotype for Fidelity Investments? Or
the concentric triangles that symbolize Alliance Capital
Management? Or maybe the stylistic circle that represents the
Invesco funds?
</P>
<P>
   If you are like me, all these fund family crests leave you cold.
Granted, illustrating something so fuzzy as an investment
philosophy is no easy feat but can't we do any better than a bunch
of polygons, sailing vessels and oak trees?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder studies show that the most memorable icon of the
mutual fund industry is the lion that belongs to the Dreyfus Corp.,
a unit of Mellon Financial. As Merrill Lynch has proved, when it
comes to building a strong public image, you can't beat a
magnificent hairy beast. Investors are likely to keep identifying
Dreyfus with its mascot long after they have forgotten the $2.95
million the company recently agreed to pay to settle accusations
that it failed to adequately disclose the risks of its Aggressive
Growth fund and that the fund's early performance was inflated by
one its former managers, Michael L. Schonberg. (Neither Dreyfus nor
Schonberg admitted wrongdoing.)
</P>
<P>
   It comes as no surprise that people have trouble remembering
that Fidelity's logo resembles the pyramid on the back of a dollar
bill _ without that eerie eye _ or that the Franklin fund family
logo, a portrait of Benjamin Franklin, looks as if it might come
from the front of an old $100 note. If you are going to use cash to
represent the promise to shareholders, why not go with a big pile,
maybe in a wheelbarrow? But on second thought, that image might be
mistaken for the managers carting off commissions of 5 percent plus
assorted annual fees.
</P>
<P>
   And, please, no more boats. What is it with money men and all
things nautical? You can't walk through the headquarters of a major
financial institution in the Northeast without feeling as if you
have stumbled into the offices of the Dutch East India Co. of the
17th century. The walls are lined with paintings and sketches of
schooners and ketches. I've noticed that the money managers have
learned to keep the pictures of their own yachts out of sight of
the paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   The State Street and Pioneer fund families, which share the home
port of Boston, each use a variation on a sailing ship as a logo.
The Vanguard Group has taken the seafaring theme to such an extreme
that you might never guess that the company is based as far inland
as Valley Forge, Pa. The index-fund giant is so hooked on sailing
that one ad in a glossy magazine reads, ``While many fund companies
are learning the ropes of indexing, consider who built the
rigging.'' (Rigging is a word you probably will not see in a
Dreyfus ad anytime soon.)
</P>
<P>
   The new symbol for the Scudder funds is distinctive: a racing
shell with four rowers pulling their oars in unison. It conveys
sleekness, fitness and teamwork and certainly resonates better with
baby boomers than Scudder's previous icon _ an old, bearded sea
captain, bedecked in foul-weather gear. He always gave me a sudden
craving for frozen fish sticks.
</P>
<P>
   The old salt sailed off into the sunset last year after Scudder
merged with the Kemper fund family, yet Kemper has kept its more
mysterious symbol, a sheaf of wheat. You can't get much more
old-economy than a farming metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   A bull may be a perfect symbol for a Wall Street firm, but none
of Merrill's competitors has tried to rustle it lately. For the
most part their mascots are avuncular bankers promising to earn
your trust. But some of Merrill's rivals, who of course manage
their own funds, have landed some memorable slogans, like ``We make
money the old-fashioned way, we earn it'' and ``We measure success
one investor at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest analog from a fund company comes from Massachusetts
Financial Services, which flatly declares: ``We invented the mutual
fund.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to distinguish among Fidelity's ``Invest
responsibly'' theme, the Aim fund family's ``Invest with
discipline'' and T. Rowe Price's ``Invest with confidence.'' But
they are durable. Is there any slogan that says ``out of step with
the times'' more clearly than Kemper's ``long-term investing in a
short-term world''?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the mythology thing. Janus, the Denver company that
has become synonymous with making concentrated bets on fast-growing
technology companies, has clearly studied Nike's playbook, not
Vanguard's. The evidence: Nike was named for a Greek goddess, Janus
for a Roman god. Nike's rallying cry was ``Just do it''; Janus says
``Get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Janus' logo is one of the more recognizable in the industry.
There may already be thousands of investors who know that two-faced
god symbolizes doorways and beginnings, but there probably are more
who think he was the god of beating the market. Of course, more
than a few old-school investors would argue that Bacchus would be a
more appropriate icon for a company that so thoroughly reveled at
the technology-stock feast of the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Dreyfus and Merrill, surprisingly few fund companies
have turned to the tried-and-true use of animals as symbols. One is
T. Rowe Price, whose mascot is a ram that represents
surefootedness.
</P>
<P>
   But another is a newcomer, and its choice of a logo may be
spot-on. Thomas Marsico already was something of a maverick before
he bolted from Janus' stable of managers a few years ago to start
his own firm focused on investing in fast-growing companies. The
symbol he chose looks a lot like a wild horse; that is appropriate,
because his funds have taken shareholders on a exhilarating ride.
The flagship Marsico Focus fund returned more than 50 percent in
1998 and again in 1999, though it was down about 9 percent this
year through June 30.
</P>
<P>
   For established fund firms that want to project a more sober
image, inventive marketing has proved a major challenge. Consider
what Fidelity, arguably the most successful fund company since
somebody came up with the idea of putting stocks in baskets, has
done to promote itself in recent years. To hammer home its ``Invest
responsibly'' mantra, it hired Don Rickles and Lily Tomlin, two
people who made their fortunes by sticking their tongues out at
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The truth for the people who run Fidelity is that they have the
single most valuable promotional resource in the industry on the
board of directors. His name is Peter Lynch and, although he has
not managed a Fidelity fund in many years, he is generally accepted
as one of the greatest living investors.
</P>
<P>
   At 56, he will probably be around for a long time, but Fidelity
executives should be planning how they will continue using Lynch's
Midas-like reputation after he is gone. They might consider
replacing the current logo, which conjures up images of some sort
of cult or a secret society, with a sketch of Lynch's brain and a
simple, direct slogan, like ``We didn't invent the mutual fund but
we have dibs on Peter Lynch's gene pool.''

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Just 11,000 jobs were created in June,
much fewer than expected and the smallest increase in four years,
in the latest sign that the U.S. economy is slowing. The nonfarm
payrolls number, however, reflected a loss of 195,000 government
jobs as Census workers completed their work. That offset a gain of
206,000 jobs in private business. Still, the unemployment rate
slipped to 4 percent from 4.1 percent, matching expectations and
bring the rate closer to April's 30-year low of 3.9 percent. And
private business is now averaging growth of 177,000 jobs a month so
far this year, a slowdown from last year's pace of 220,000 jobs. By

   DULUTH-SISTERCITY (Duluth, Minn.) _ On the street here these
days you hear French, Swedish, Russian, Japanese and at least half
a dozen other foreign tongues. It's not tourists who give the city
this cosmopolitan air, but business executives. Not too bad for a
city that 80 years ago, under the alias Zenith, was branded as
hopelessly small-minded and provincial by Sinclair Lewis in his
novel ``Babbitt.'' Duluth is still no New York or Los Angeles, of
course. Or even a place like Rochester, home of the Mayo Clinic.
But it has focused more on the wider world not just because of its
shipping trade through the Great Lakes but also because of its
sister-city program _ the nonprofit city-to-city network inspired

diplomacy might lessen the chance of future world conflict. By

FRANCE'S AGNOLUTTO WINS TOUR DE FRANCE 7TH STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMOGES, France _ Erik Zabel knew that what he wanted for his
30th birthday on Friday was not another necktie or a good book, but
exactly what he received for his 25th birthday: A victory in the
Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the stage into Limoges looked promising for the star
German sprinter for the Telekom team. But Zabel had wanted the same
present last year, and the year before too, and came away
disappointed. Although his wife and son may have given him the
power drill of his dreams, nothing lights up a birthday party like
a victory in a Tour stage.
</P>
<P>
   Wait until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Zabel never had a chance for victory Friday because Christophe
Agnolutto, a Frenchman with the AG2R team, went on a 128-kilometer
(80-mile) solo breakaway during this seventh of 21 daily stages,
built a lead that neared 8 minutes and held on to win by 1 minute
11 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph was the first for a Frenchman in the Tour in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Agnolutto, a winner of the Tour of Switzerland in 1997, has done
nothing particularly successful since and ranked 82nd, more than 11
minutes behind the leader, when the 205.5-kilometer (128 miles)
rolling ride began Friday morning in Tours. He won on a nasty day _
sun, rain, rain, sun, cool breezes throughout _ in a time of 5
hours 11 minutes 41 seconds, a speed of 39 kilometers an hour (24
mph).
</P>
<P>
   Because the victor was so submerged in the overall standings,
there was no change at the top. Alberto Elli, an Italian with
Telekom, continued at age 36 to be one of the oldest men ever to
wear the leader's yellow jersey of the Tour, an annual event that
began in 1903 and has been interrupted only by both world wars.
</P>
<P>
   Second was Fabrice Gougot, a Frenchman with Credit Agricole, who
bolted away from the 172-man trailing pack in the final kilometer
in an attempt to reduce his 12-second deficit, but he failed as the
sprinters surged past him.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Marcel Wust, a German with Festina, was second
across the line behind Agnolutto, with Zabel third. Rats, another
birthday ruined.
</P>
<P>
   In the first seven days of this 87th Tour, Zabel has come so
close to ridding himself of what has nearly become an obsession for
victory. On Sunday, he was ideally placed in the last 100 meters
leading into Loudun _ at the front of a mass charge to the line.
The same was true Monday, into Nantes. And the same Wednesday, into
Vitre.
</P>
<P>
   With age, though, Zabel's hallmark is endurance, not the sudden
acceleration that often decides a tight sprint. He finished third,
third and second in those previous sprints _ close but, as he says,
close isn't enough. What he wants is for everybody else to be close
to victory, his victory.
</P>
<P>
   It has been three Tours de France since Zabel crossed a finish
line first. From 1995, when he made his debut in the race, through
1997, he won seven stages. Since then there have been many
second-place finishes, the worst place of all for most racers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident, I feel good,'' Zabel said before the start of
this Tour. ``Yes,'' he said, ``I've won a lot of races this year.''
Including the esteemed Milan-San Remo classic in March, he has 15
victories already, five more than he had in all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   With the triumph in Italy, his third in that race, and a fourth
place in the Tour of Flanders, followed by a third place in
Paris-Roubaix and a victory in the Amstel Gold Race, Zabel leads
the standings in the World Cup of one-day classics. He ranks second
among the world's 800 professional riders. In a recent poll by the
German newspaper Sport Bild, he was a runaway (82 percent) choice
as the country's favorite rider.
</P>
<P>
   Zabel has everything, in short, except what he wants most. After
Stuart O'Grady, an Australian with Credit Agricole, crashed
Thursday and had to leave the race with a broken collarbone, Zabel
remains a leader in the hot battle for the Tour's green points
jersey. The German has won it for a record four consecutive years,
but he does not regard it as highly as a single stage victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't write Zabel off,'' another fine sprinter, Tom Steels,
told the Belgian press Thursday. ``He's not winning, but you notice
that he's among the top finishers every day. One day it will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Steels, himself, has won two sprint finishes this week.

STUDENTS LEARN DIFFICULTY OF TRADE NEGOTIATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ In a world where globalization is often portrayed as a
malevolent force, a career as a trade negotiator might not sound
appealing. But Oystein Borsum disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   Borsum, 24, came from his home country, Norway, to make Egypt's
case in a student debate over whether the World Trade Organization
should be linking trade sanctions to standards that prohibit child
labor.
</P>
<P>
   He had done his research, visiting the Egyptian Embassy in Oslo,
Norway, and finding information on the Internet, and he produced a
paper that outlined the Egyptian view that punishing violators with
trade sanctions would harm its emerging economy.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of negotiations in which students representing other
countries including the United States argued opposing views, ``we
were practically unable to agree on anything,'' Borsum said. ``When
we tried to get from the problem to the solution in the WTO
framework, we agreed to disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the real world, the adult advisers sighed.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 students from two dozen countries _ like others who
obstructed last fall's World Trade Organization talks in Seattle _
ran into the same kinds of problems when they tried to find answers
to half a dozen of the most sensitive trade issues, including child
labor.
</P>
<P>
   The students, sequestered in a conference room in the WTO's
stately building with spectacular views of Lake Geneva,
concentrated on long and tough negotiations, oblivious to the
perfect sunny weather outside.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias Fauser, 26, of Germany, who argued the U.S. viewpoint,
said he felt isolated. ``It is pretty hard to represent the United
States, because all the developing countries oppose linking labor
standards to trade, and see this effort as a protectionist measure
by Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate took on an emotional quality when India, represented
by Djana Gnjic of Yugoslavia, accused him of trying to impose
American culture and values on other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a solution that will make a poor country even
poorer,'' Gnjic, 23, said. ``Children can't always go to school,
because their families can't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said later that she felt somewhat beaten up. ``All the
countries had a tough attitude, and no one wanted to let his ideas
go,'' Gnjic said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with the arguments on a child-labor link really heated,
the 12 students taking part decided to place a moratorium on even
discussing the matter for seven years. Some delegates had wanted a
20-year blackout, but eventually compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The group, mostly business and economics students, did not sport
the trappings of political radicals. Having come for the second
Model WTO 2000 _ an idea that the trade organization hopes to
export to universities worldwide _ they wore jackets, ties and
other businesslike attire. This ``contributed to the atmosphere and
made negotiations more realistic,'' said Mathieu Regnier of Canada,
a Geneva business student.
</P>
<P>
   Selected through competition, and subsidized by foundations, the
group gathered in late May for four days of acting as trade
negotiators to get the feeling of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Professing support for the concept of free trade, they were a
far cry from the students who staged a sit-in here last November,
chaining themselves to the WTO's main stairway, strewing confetti
and paint, and chanting: ``The WTO kills people. Death to the
WTO.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mock negotiators were able to spend some time with the WTO's
director-general, Mike Moore, who told them they were lucky that
they did not have to ``go home and sell'' their trade proposals to
their parliaments.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the program, Friedericke Hesse of Germany said she
had ``dropped my nationalistic glasses,'' adding, ``You see that
other parts of the world have completely different points of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliakfei Razanay of Belarus agreed. ``It's impossible to
understand the complexity of the trade negotiations without
participating in them,'' he said.

COLOMBIAN AREA RESISTS PLAN TO MAKE IT A `ZONE OF ENCOUNTER' 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   YONDO, Colombia _ For years, the people of this thriving little
oil town on the bank of the Magdalena River complained that the
authorities back in Bogota never paid them any attention. But now
that they and their neighbors have suddenly become pivotal to a
government plan to open peace talks with the second-largest
guerrilla group here, they want only to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   When President Andres Pastrana announced the plan in April, it
seemed a simple matter. To lure the Marxist rebels of the Army of
National Liberation, or ELN, into negotiations, Yondo and two other
municipalities north of here were to be turned into a ``zone of
encounter'' under guerrilla control, with all army and police units
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a shortage of armed groups roaming this
area. So the government apparently thought that an end of
hostilities would be welcome. Left-wing guerrillas, right-wing
paramilitaries and the military have all sought to control this
resource rich and strategic region, the Middle Magdalena. And all
have left casualties in their wakes.
</P>
<P>
   What the authorities in Bogota did not expect, though, was the
popular resistance that has emerged. Soon after the announcement,
thousands of protesters blocked the Pan American Highway, cutting
off most commerce between central and northern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they really want to talk peace, all they need to negotiate
is a table and chairs,'' said Leonel Uribe Hernandez, a municipal
official here and a leader of the protest movement. ``They don't
need all this territory. If the ELN leaders are worried about their
safety, let them talk overseas, in Venezuela or Spain or Germany.
But we don't want to be a part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   After several weeks, Pastrana relented and agreed to a
``dialogue'' with residents. As part of a recent accord, the
government has agreed to delay formally establishing the zone until
``popular consultations'' have been undertaken, a phrase that the
government seems to interpret as town meetings and workshops, but
that residents take to mean a plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a democracy, so let the people vote on this, and let
their will be respected,'' Councilman Nixon Arrieta said. ``If they
say yes, then fine. But I don't think that is likely to happen,
because we have nothing to gain from this and everything to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The territory that the government has agreed to hand over is
roughly the size of Delaware, or barely one-tenth the size of a
separate demilitarized zone granted to the largest guerrilla group,
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. But the
strategic importance of this area is much greater because it sits
astride the country's main waterway and is within striking distance
of a railway line and the Pan American Highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the president was thinking,'' a teacher here
said. ``The ELN has a long history of blowing up oil pipelines,
power stations and transmission lines. And he wants to put them
right across the river from the biggest oil refinery in the
country,'' which processes the bulk of Colombia's gasoline and is
in Barrancabermeja.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like the more isolated and sparsely populated FARC zone to the
south, which is larger than Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode
Island combined, this is cattle country and abounds in fertile
pastures. But cows and water buffaloes have to graze alongside oil
wells that produce millions of dollars a year in royalties, and,
residents said, have long been coveted by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, the mountains of the Serrania de San Lucas have
large deposits of gold, emeralds, nickel and mercury. The gold
mines have been shut for years because of the violence but could
easily reopen after the fighting stops and soon thereafter begin
filling the coffers of the ELN, which has met with military
reverses in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest and fastest-growing source of wealth in the area,
however, is the cultivation of coca. The ELN controlled drug
trafficking here until 18 months ago, when it was violently
supplanted by paramilitaries of the United Peasant Self-Defense
force. And the ELN would clearly like to regain the dominance and
the revenues that it once enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is anything but a fight over ideology,'' said Mayor
Danuil Mecera of San Pablo, a town an hour's boat ride north of
here that is in the ELN zone. ``This is a struggle for economic
control and power, pure and simple, between two illegal armed
groups that only want to strengthen their position at the expense
of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   As government negotiations with protesters drag on, disgruntled
ELN forces are staying out of the towns and holing up in their
mountain stronghold north of here. In a recent television
interview, the senior commander, Nicolas Rodriguez Bautista,
acknowledged that ``there is much fear'' of a peace zone but
attributed that to ``the pressure of paramilitary groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents and local officials say their real concern is that
violence may increase after the zone has been set up, because the
accord between the government and the rebels excludes paramilitary
forces. With the army and the police withdrawn, the critics said,
residents would be even more likely to be caught in cross-fire
between the rebels and adamant paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
   ``This territory is ours,'' said the local paramilitary leader,
who is known as Comandante Julian. The fundamental problem, he
added, is that ``there are three states here, that of the
guerrillas, the real one of the government and that of the
self-defense forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he added, ``We will respect what the population
decides, and if they accept a zone, we will withdraw our troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to win over the residents, the national government
arranged for local officials to visit the FARC zone and talk with
their counterparts and other residents there. But that effort
backfired when the officials returned home with tales of extortion
of businesses, summary executions, forced recruitment of teen-agers
and other guerrilla abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can see for ourselves what happened down there, and we've
been contacted by people down there who tell us that we should
fight by all means to prevent what happened to them from happening
to us,'' a pharmacist in San Pablo said. ``The FARC zone has become
an independent country, and we don't want that happening here.''

 &HT;    Sacagawea ad campaign is a day late, dollar short
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I've got a problem with that TV commercial for
the new golden-dollar coin: Sacagawea gets shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is all about George Washington. Not Sacagawea. We get to
see a hip George dancing in a nightclub, diving under water, buying
coffee and dropping a coin at a tollbooth. Another version of the
TV ad shows George as president of his book club, teaching aerobics
and floating in space as an astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me, but whose life is it, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Sacagawea, the Shoshone Indian teen-ager who helped Lewis and
Clark on their 3,000-mile expedition through the Northwest, is the
person on the new golden dollar. Not George.
</P>
<P>
   George is old news. George is a piece of green paper.
</P>
<P>
   Sacagawea is new. Sacagawea is golden.
</P>
<P>
   Who gives a coin flip about George when it comes to the new
dollar?
</P>
<P>
   The only time you'll see Sacagawea in any of the $40 million
worth of advertising by the United States Mint is a split-second
image of the golden dollar. Her name is never even mentioned. If
you blink, I guarantee you'll miss the face of Sacagawea that was
designed by renowned sculptor Glenna Goodacre, who also sculpted
the Vietnam Women's Memorial in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe newspapers wouldn't have to print stories about the big
debate on how to pronounce or spell Sacagawea if the government had
bothered to make her the star of ads about her new coin.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to figure out why the U.S. Mint put Sacagawea's face
on the coin but George's face on the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't that make about as much sense as Chrysler trying to sell
its new PT Cruiser by running ads showing the LeBaron?
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose George Washington for a couple of reasons,'' said
Philip Diehl, who headed the U.S. Mint and oversaw the
golden-dollar campaign until he left in March. ``He is the father
of our country, and so he speaks with authority. An endorsement
from George Washington means a lot. It's like a celebrity
endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   The government thinks Sacagawea's story is too complex and
intriguing to promote in a fleeting commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too rich. You can't tell it in a sound bite,'' Diehl
said. ``Because Glenna Goodacre created such a beautiful coin, the
coin itself evokes the story.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the government thinks we need permission from our country's
daddy before we can understand fully that it's OK to use the new
dollar coin?
</P>
<P>
   George Washington was an accomplished man. We all know that. But
Sacagawea was no ordinary woman.
</P>
<P>
   Sacagawea was chosen for the new golden coin because of her
courage, strength and quiet integrity on the 1804-1806 trek of
Lewis and Clark and their Corps of Discovery from the Great Plains
to the Pacific Ocean and back. Serving as an interpreter and guide,
she became an invaluable member of the expedition. When the boats
overturned, only Sacagawea took the initiative to plunge in and
save travel journals and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   She was only 15 when she made the journey with her husband,
trader Toussaint Charbonneau, and she gave birth to a son before
the expedition. The baby, Jean Baptiste, is pictured on the new
coin with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Clark paid Sacagawea's husband for his help during the
expedition. But Sacagawea got nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Some American Indians think Sacagawea is left empty-handed all
over again by the George commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of disgusting, because even on the
expedition, she wasn't really recognized,'' said Zelda Tillman,
director of the Shoshone Cultural Center in Fort Washakie, Wyo.
``It's like a woman is never recognized for what's she done, like
she's not worthy.''
</P>
<P>
   My two cents' worth? The government blew its golden opportunity
to educate and inspire Americans with the story of Sacagawea.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Mint's argument to use George instead is nothing but
spin that leaves the new coin twirling in a vacuum of knowledge.
Tails, we win. Heads, we lose.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Diana Ross and ``the former ladies of the
Supremes'' revived the Supremes' hits on Thursday night at Madison
Square Garden, it was a tribute to three musicians who weren't
onstage: Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Edward Holland Jr.
</P>
<P>
   They were the ones behind the Supremes' string of indelible hits
from 1963 to 1967. The H-D-H team wrote and produced lovelorn pop
songs with a gospel kick: ``Where Did Our Love Go,'' ``I Hear a
Symphony,'' ``Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart,'' ``My World Is
Empty Without You,'' ``Come See About Me.'' Under their direction,
Ross pined repeatedly for a distant lover, confessing to lonely,
sleepless nights that would turn to joy if he'd only come back. For
many baby boomers, her girlish, melting croon became the voice of
young love.
</P>
<P>
   The set included the major H-D-H songs and a few lesser-known
ones, like the Supremes' first hit, ``When the Lovelight Starts
Shining Through His Eyes,'' from 1963. The concert's staging made
mild efforts to rekindle thoughts of the 1960s by showing
photographs from civil rights marches during ``Reflections'' and
hinting that ``Back in My Arms Again'' could refer to soldiers
returning from Vietnam. But in an audience that had baby-boomer
couples alongside diva devotees and an occasional drag queen, the
overwhelming nostalgia was not sociopolitical but musical.
</P>
<P>
   To hear the old songs again, the sold-out audience forgave Ross
for touring with two latter-day Supremes, Lynda Laurence and
Scherrie Payne, who joined the group after Ross started her solo
career in 1970, instead of the surviving 1960s Supremes, Mary
Wilson and Cindy Birdsong.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the newer Supremes had a solo spot, with Payne showing
off a multi-octave range in ``Stoned Love.'' But it was Ross' show,
of course. While the women had matching outfits _ sequined and
feathered dresses, along with some ill-advised form-fitting suits _
the two 1970s Supremes generally kept a respectful distance from
Ross, smiling as if their jobs depended on it and curling their
arms in more or less synchronized versions of the Supremes' old
choreography. When the three women stood together for ``Stop! in
the Name of Love,'' there were some near collisions.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than recreate the lean rhythm-and-blues arrangements of
the great 1960s Motown studio bands, the concert deployed a large
orchestra with strings, horns and backup singers, as well as 10
dancers doing a Gap ad version of 1960s go-go routines. In another
modern touch, a teleprompter above the sound booth displayed the
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   But the audience wasn't worried about anachronisms, or about the
shrill edge that came and went in Ross' voice. The people in the
floor seats were on their feet, dancing and singing along,
throughout the nearly two-hour set. They cheered each memorable
H-D-H hook: the jabbing guitar that opens ``You Keep Me Hangin'
On,'' the ``oohs'' that lead into ``Baby Love.'' During ``You Can't
Hurry Love,'' Ross walked down into the audience, accepting hugs
and kisses from fans and giving them her microphone to sing a few
lines; it was like Oprah Winfrey working a karaoke bar.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' fans would have been disappointed if she hadn't included
some of her post-Supremes hits, and she advanced as far as the
disco era to sing ``Ain't No Mountain High Enough,'' ``I'm Coming
Out'' and ``Upside Down,'' as well as Gloria Gaynor's diva staple,
``I Will Survive.'' She also summoned Luther Vandross up from the
audience to sing with her in ``The Best Years of My Life.'' He
didn't know the song, but by echoing Ross with rich, curvaceous
phrases, he brought down the house.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the bustle of the production, there were flashes of the
vulnerability that made the Supremes speak so intimately to
millions of listeners. It appeared in ``Love Child,'' as Ross
blurted, ``Take a look at me!'' and in a tender, slowed-down solo
version of ``Reach Out I'll Be There.'' Most of the time, the
neo-Supremes glittered and belted, and the songs did the rest.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHEN THE GIANTS AND SUPERBAS PLAYED TWO 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Teddy Roosevelt was in Syracuse, N.Y., that Labor Day
for the opening of the New York State Fair when a man was arrested
there for allegedly threatening to shoot the president. Foreign
diplomats were predicting that war in the Balkans was inevitable.
And at a baseball game in Brooklyn between the Superbas, as the
team was known then, and John McGraw's New York Giants, the
multitudes were howling.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point,'' according to the next day's New York Times,
``a riot seemed imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Superbas' Sammy Strang trying to steal second in the
fifth inning, Jimmy Sheckard, who led the National League that year
with nine homers and 67 stolen bases, suddenly raised his bat,
apparently with mischief in mind. When catcher Frank Bowerman's
throw glanced off the bat and rolled near first base, Strang kept
running and scored as the Giants' infielders stood around, assuming
that the only umpire would nullify the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurst, however, gave the tally to Brooklyn and disallowed the
claim of interference,'' The Times reported, referring to the
umpire. ``McGraw and Bowerman, with four or five more of the New
York players, protested while the partisans in the stands kept up
an ear-splitting noise, some applauding and others protesting the
umpire's fiat. Bowerman was ejected.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the way it was nearly a century ago, on Sept. 7, 1903,
in New York's primeval preview of Saturday's Yankees-Mets
doubleheader in Queens and the Bronx _ the Giants' 6-4 triumph in
the morning at Washington Park's wooden grandstand in Brooklyn, the
Superbas' 3-0 victory that afternoon at the rickety Polo Grounds at
Eighth Avenue and West 155th Street in upper Manhattan, under what
is still known as Coogan's Bluff.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody called it a subway series; the city's subway wouldn't
open until late the next year. But the city had elevated trains and
trolleys. Maybe that's how the teams traveled from one ballpark to
the other.
</P>
<P>
   The primary personalties in the interborough rivalry were
McGraw, the Giants' pugnacious manager, and Charles Ebbets, the
Superbas' owner remembered for proclaiming, ``Baseball is in its
infancy.'' So was the feud that endured until the Dodgers and
Giants departed for Los Angeles and San Francisco after the 1957
season.
</P>
<P>
   In that 1903 season New York also had its first American League
team, the Highlanders, the ancestors of the Yankees, who split a
morning-afternoon Labor Day doubleheader with the Boston Pilgrims
(now the Red Sox) at Hilltop Park in Washington Heights. In the
afternoon game, the Highlanders defeated the great Cy Young, 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   But the lead sports headline the next day in The Times (which
sold for 1 cent), the Herald and the Evening Post went to the
winner of the Twin City Handicap at the Sheepshead Bay racetrack.
McChesney, described as ``the great horse of the West,'' equaled
the track record for a mile and a quarter before 50,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The reported total attendance for the four baseball games was
44,000, including 23,000 at the Polo Grounds where Henry Schmidt,
the Superbas' 30-year-old rookie righthander, outdueled Joe ``Iron
Man'' McGinnity, who that August had justified his nickname by
pitching (and winning) both games of three doubleheaders.
</P>
<P>
   McGinnity went on to a 31-20 record, pitching 434 innings with
44 complete games. His teammate, Christy Mathewson, was 30-13 with
267 strikeouts. Together, the future Hall of Famers appeared in 100
games. The Giants finished second, six and a half games behind the
Pittsburgh Pirates, whose Honus Wagner batted .355.
</P>
<P>
   For the Superbas, who finished fifth, Schmidt had a 21-13 record
in his only major-league season. Early the next year he sent the
club a telegram: ``I do not like living in the East and will not
report.'' He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbets, who built the ballpark named for him that opened in
1913, had been a ticket seller, clerk and briefly the manager
before he bought the Dodgers (Brooklynites were known as trolley
dodgers) for $30,000 in 1898. He installed it in Washington Park on
Third Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues, where a playground
is now.
</P>
<P>
   When Ebbets hired Ned Hanlon as manager, the team was briefly
called the Superbas, after a popular vaudeville act, Hanlon's
Superbas.
</P>
<P>
   The Highlanders, who played at Broadway and West 165th St.,
where the New York Presbyterian Medical Center is now, finished
fourth in 1903, but their crusty manager, Clark Griffith, later the
longtime owner of the Washington Senators, challenged the Giants to
a postseason city series. The established Giants ignored the
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cheap advertising stunt,'' snapped John T. Brush, the
Giants' haughty owner. ``Who is Griffith? I never heard of him.
There is only one club in New York and that is the Giants.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody on the Yankees, not even George Steinbrenner, would dare
say that there is only one club in New York now. And nobody on the
Mets would dare say it. But they all would love to.

COMMENTARY: CREDIT COMES AT A PRICE: THE CRITICISM IS FREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is a tale of three central banks. All face
tough choices about whether to raise interest rates, and the
strategies they pursue over the remainder of this year could have a
big effect on the global economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   _After pushing its benchmark lending rate down to just a notch
above zero in an effort to resuscitate the Japanese economy, the
Bank of Japan is hinting that it will soon tighten monetary policy,
even though many analysts think that deflation is still a greater
risk than inflation, and that the financial system needs more money
and credit, not less.
</P>
<P>
   _With an economic upswing under way across Europe, the European
Central Bank is likely to continue raising rates this year. But the
11 nations sharing a common monetary policy are running at
different economic speeds and are not, at the moment, good
candidates for a one-size-fits-all interest rate prescription.
</P>
<P>
   _In the United States, six interest rate increases over the last
year are beginning to have their intended effect, as illustrated by
Friday's report from the Labor Department showing a slowdown in the
rate of job creation. But there is considerable uncertainty and
debate within the Federal Reserve about how much more tightening,
if any, will be necessary to squelch inflation pressures without
putting the long expansion at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three major central banks, the Bank of Japan faces the
most dire situation and the most second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Masaru Hayami, the central bank's governor, has signaled that he
would like to bring to an end what he considers an emergency period
of exceptionally low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Hayami's rationale seems to be twofold: that higher rates would
force Japanese industry to stop relying on cheap money for survival
and get on with the painful business of restructuring itself, and
that moving rates up now, when the economy is showing tentative
signs of life, would give the Bank of Japan the ability to cut them
again if the economy goes back into a swoon.
</P>
<P>
   But his approach is viewed skeptically even in his own
government's finance ministry. And many economists say Japan's
problems are not linked so much to interest rates _ the cost of
money _ but rather to a lack of available money and credit at any
price.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency
Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y., bank credit in
Japan contracted 4.7 percent in the 12 months ended in May,
reflecting the dead weight of bad loans held by lenders and the
continued decline in the value of assets that borrowers can use as
collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than raising rates, he and other critics say, the Bank of
Japan would do better to grease the wheels of the financial system,
perhaps by buying bad loans from banks, to spur new lending and get
the economy humming again.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the head of the new central bank, Wim Duisenberg, is
facing the first big test of his institution's ability to weather
the economic and political strains inherent in establishing a
transnational institution to perform a function that has always
been closely linked to national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   In one group of European countries, including Ireland, Spain and
Finland, inflation is creeping up, putting pressure on the central
bank to raise rates. But in another group, including Germany and
France, the economic and political heavyweights at the European
Union's core, inflation is low and unemployment remains stubbornly
high, a combination that argues for stable or even lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This development raises the prospect that, over the next year,
monetary policy will be trapped between the tightening needs of
overheating countries and resistance to higher real rates from
low-inflation ones,'' economists at Salomon Smith Barney said in a
recent report.
</P>
<P>
   The question in the United States is whether the slowdown in
growth is enough to keep inflation under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fed's meeting in May, staff economists presented a
forecast showing that growth would slow this year to around 3.5
percent, from a 5.5 percent rate in the first quarter. But the same
forecast projected that core price inflation _ which excludes
volatile food and energy prices _ would ``rise noticeably'' this
year.
</P>
<P>
   So both inflation hawks and doves at the Fed have plenty of
ammunition as they debate whether to raise rates again. It may be
some consolation to Alan Greenspan as he tries to sort it all out
that his fellow central bankers around the world are not having it
any easier.

MEXICO HAS VOTED. ITS ECONOMY HASN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a political party that has been in control for many decades
is beaten at the polls, it's a good sign that voters are clamoring
for sweeping change _ and an indication of how much things already
have changed.
</P>
<P>
   That is the case in Mexico, where last week Vicente Fox Quesada
became president-elect, ending 71 years of rule by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. Though Mexico
is in far better shape than it was a decade ago, let alone two
decades ago, it is still a developing country.
</P>
<P>
   Investors charged in after the vote, pushing the Bolsa index up
more than 6 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski, president of the Latin America Enterprise
fund, a Miami-based private equity fund with about $450 million
under management, took time last week to talk about the effect of
the election on Mexico's market outlook. Following are excerpts
from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Isn't the economy that Fox will inherit from the outgoing
president, Ernesto Zedillo, in pretty good shape?
</P>
<P>
   A. Zedillo is leaving him in a good position in terms of foreign
trade. Exports are running between $160 billion and $170 billion
annually, due mostly to increased trade due to the North American
Free Trade Agreement and not to the recent rise in oil prices. As
recently as 1995, following the peso crisis, Mexican exports were
about $80 billion a year. External debt has evaporated as a
macroeconomic issue; it is about $160 billion today, roughly what
it was in 1995. And the budget deficit is totally under control.
However, unemployment is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the new president likely to take steps to push down the
unemployment rate?
</P>
<P>
   A. Due to a lack of flexibility in the budget, he doesn't have
much room to maneuver. After paying for a number of fixed costs,
like debt service and education expenditures, only 7 percent to 10
percent of the budget is left over for discretionary spending.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sorts of problems does Fox want, or need, to tackle?
</P>
<P>
   A. So far he has talked about focusing on corruption and on
drugs, which are important. He faces big problems in dealing with
safety issues, especially in Mexico City. And the banking system is
still decimated. In Mexico, credit is scarce for midsize companies
and not there at all for little companies. He also faces challenges
from the unions, which are controlled by the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the prospects for privatization?
</P>
<P>
   A. The biggest opportunity is in privatizing the electric
utility industry, which is a $70 billion to $80 billion business,
half in power generation and half in distribution. The major
impediment to change there is the union. It is totally opposed to
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Because of his years at Coca-Cola and his positive attitude
about foreign investment, doesn't Fox run the risk of criticism
from Mexican nationalists?
</P>
<P>
   A. What Fox has to do, and what he talked about in his campaign,
is show he has a high priority for social welfare programs. That
means better schools, security for people, rural investment and
roads. If he does that, the private investment from the United
States and elsewhere will be more digestible to the people. There
has to be a social dimension to his program. But he won't have the
money to pay for it unless he privatizes the electric utility
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your fund invests in privately held companies. How is the
money divided?
</P>
<P>
   A. About 10 percent is in manufacturing; between 40 percent and
50 percent is in various types of services, from funeral homes to
telephones; and the balance is in an assortment of things, from
financial companies to Internet companies. Roughly 25 percent of
the money in the fund is invested in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Individual investors who have bet on Mexico and Latin America
have not been well rewarded for some time. Is there reason to
expect higher returns?
</P>
<P>
   A. Currently, valuations in Latin America are reasonably low
relative to prospective earnings growth, and that applies with some
force in Mexico. With its finances in pretty good shape, if Mexico
grows 5.5 percent in 2000, its market should do pretty well over
the balance of the year. For example, Cemex and Telefonos de Mexico
will respond to faster growth in Mexico.

BOSNIA GOVERNMENT ANGRY AT U.S. REPORT ON CRIME AND CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ The Bosnian government bridled
Friday at a report to the U.S. Congress that said crime and
corruption were blocking the success of the Dayton peace accord.
Bosnian officials insisted that the government itself was pursuing
investigations of local government corruption and tackling
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to President Alija Izetbegovic did not deny that
corruption exists among the three ethnic entities in Bosnia, but
defended government efforts to crack down on it. ``Things are being
done _ dozens, even hundreds of cases are being investigated,''
said Mirza Hajric, the adviser. ``The president has made lots of
statements on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, released by the General Accounting Office in
Washington on Friday, blamed the local authorities in Bosnia for
failing to eliminate corruption and build a state of law in the
four years since the war ended. The Dayton peace agreement, which
the GAO report said was being undercut, was signed in December 1995
by Croatia, Yugoslavia and Bosnia's three major ethnic groups as a
framework for rebuilding a self-sustaining multiethnic Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress,
suggested that the Clinton administration should consider
suspending its aid until the Bosnian authorities show that they are
committed to fighting the abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But Hajric responded that the Bosnian government had worked to
cooperate with the international bodies and peacekeepers in the
country. ``You would not find one element that we are not
cooperating on, but we are only halfway through a five- year
transition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, and some of the international officials
working here, stressed that anti-corruption programs depend on
fundamental reforms to the judicial system and law enforcement
bodies. They pointed out that such changes take time and effort,
and need at least several years to take full effect.
</P>
<P>
   They said that while Bosnia had been impoverished by war, it had
also missed out on years of economic and judicial reforms. The
country suffers all the postwar problems of smuggling and organized
crime, as well as the more usual difficulties of a transitional
economy, like failed banks, tax evasion and privatization of state
companies. They said those economic challenges were compounded
tenfold by the deep ethnic divisions that have perpetuated three
separate ethnic entities in one country and have also allowed crime
to thrive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bosnia's presidency rotates among its three main ethnic groups _
Muslim, Croat and Serb. Two members of the presidency are elected
from the Muslim-Croat Federation and one from Republika Srpska, but
the entities still run almost entirely separate states, including
separate law enforcement bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Office of the High Representative here, the
highest civilian authority in Bosnia, pointed to some successes, or
at least small signs of progress. They particularly noted the
creation of a countrywide customs service that is now working, and
the financial police and prosecutors who are growing steadily more
bold and are starting to work with their counterparts in other
ethnic entities.
</P>
<P>
   They said customs revenues were finally up because officials
were closing loopholes that allowed goods to travel into Bosnia
through one entity with few checks as to its final destination.
Stolen cars, illegal cigarettes and other goods have been arriving
in Bosnia for years with the central government unable to collect
excise duties.
</P>
<P>
   The high representative, Wolfgang Petritsch, stressed that
efforts to combat corruption would work only when there is a
political breakthrough. ``I am convinced it will continue,'' he
said of corruption, ``as long as there are no central state
institutions or the rule of law and while we have not fully broken
the vested interests of the nationalist parties.''

ENCHANTING BUT DARKER HARRY POTTER BOOK 4 IS WORTHY OF HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKEN DENN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three-word answer for Harry Potter fans everywhere:
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's good.
</P>
<P>
   How good?
</P>
<P>
   In the generally accepted Potterific Scale of 1 to 10 _ in which
Book 1 in the wildly popular series rates an 11, Book 2 slips to a
10, and Book 3 surges to a 12 _ the madly anticipated fourth book
settles in around an 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' released to the public
at midnight Friday, is darker than the first three books detailing
the young orphan's magical adventures _ think of the sort of mood
shift that came between J.R.R. Tolkien's ``Hobbit'' and
``Fellowship of the Ring.'' Also, for the first time a Harry book
ends on a somber note.
</P>
<P>
   Book 4 doesn't have the emotional resonance of the best parts of
Book 3, focusing more on adventures than introspection. But it does
provide a satisfying depth for several characters in author J.K.
Rowling's carefully imagined world, including new insights into
Professor Severus Snape, Hagrid the groundskeeper and even the evil
Lord You-Know-Who.
</P>
<P>
   And the book keeps up the awesome inventiveness, deadpan humor
and gripping pace of previous installments, despite a 732-page
count that gives ``Goblet of Fire'' the heft of a decent
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   (Warning, Warning, Warning: Potter fans may want to stop reading
here, unless they want to know details in the plot the book's
publisher has guarded as zealously as an Azbakan prisoner.)
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly, Rowling tinkers some with the series formula. For
instance, she starts with a chapter featuring the evil Lord
Voldemort rather than hero Harry, and dominates Harry's year at the
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with a ``Triwizard
Tournament'' of challenges rather than the magical game Quidditch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's tradition to spare.
</P>
<P>
   The Sorting Hat is back, with a newly written song to boot.
(``It's got to be a pretty boring life, hasn't it, being a hat?''
comments Harry's friend Ron Weasley. ``I suppose it spends all year
making up the next one.'')
</P>
<P>
   Wronged outcast Sirius Black, eating rats for sustenance, keeps
a godfatherly eye on Harry's welfare. Quidditch is still Harry's
favorite game, with the book's first chunk dedicated to the
Quidditch World Cup (Ireland vs. Bulgaria), with a dark faction of
fans rioting in a scary rally against Muggles (non-magical people).
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Rowling flawlessly knits her plotlines together, with
seemingly casual early details taking on meaningful force by the
end. (Ever wonder why Hogwarts student Neville Longbottom lives
with his grandmother? It turns out to matter.)
</P>
<P>
   And as usual, Rowling slips in sly jokes that keep adults
entertained too (``Moi?'' says a hefty woman accused of giantess
blood. ``I 'ave big bones!'')
</P>
<P>
   The book focuses less on the funny-to-fascinating details of
life at a magical boarding school, with more attention on the
coming showdown _ it's a seven-book series _ between the good
wizards on Harry's side and the Death Eater followers of evil.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most-hyped aspects of the book pre-publication _ that
Harry and his friends would discover the opposite sex _ is fun but
not earthshaking. The romances, such as they are, are old-fashioned
for the real 14-year-old set, with on-target agonies about whom to
invite to the Yule Ball and a light-handed lecture against favoring
beauty over brains.
</P>
<P>
   The book doesn't hit every note perfectly, though.
</P>
<P>
   The previous timeless atmosphere is jarred a bit with mentions
of Playstations and Aqualungs.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a subplot with the characters called house elves _
whose dialect will grit the teeth of anyone who hated Jar Jar Binks
of ``Star Wars'' notoriety _ creating a parallel between the elves'
lives and slavery, which hovers uncomfortably between seriousness
and humor.
</P>
<P>
   The book's scarier sections are certain to re-ignite a debate
over whether younger children should read the book, technically
aimed at ages 9 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   A beloved character faces brief torture; another character (as
Rowling forewarned) is killed; there's one scene with a chopped-off
hand and another with magical curses that could easily raise the
hackles of protective parents. (``Abracadabra!,'' for instance,
will never have the same ring, now that Rowling has co-opted it as
the fatal ``Avada Kedavra'' spell.)
</P>
<P>
   But the book is unquestionably aimed at children, regardless of
its older fans, and adults often forget the horrors in older
children's classics that go over young readers' heads. It seems a
shame to deny the book's intended audience the creative world of
``Goblet of Fire'' simply because of its honesty in including doses
of both good and evil to illustrate the battle between the two.

<P>
   Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived
in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a
team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of ordinary
people and some of the troubling issues that Americans continue to
face. These stories, two or three each week, will be approximately
6,000-7,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are
organized into chapters, papers with severe space restraints may
choose to spread a single article over several days.
</P>
<P>
   This story, for papers on Sunday, July 9, will be filed on
tonight, in full and abridged versions:

   RACE-COPS-DRUGS (New York) _ On Friday, Feb. 25, at 5 p.m.,
there wasn't a single narcotics officer on the streets of Harlem.
Everyone was being held inside on standby in case of a race riot.
The Amadou Diallo verdict was about to come down. The whites _
officers like Sgt. Maria Brogli and Detectives Lee Macklowe and
John Montes _ hoped the four Diallo officers would be found not
guilty. The blacks _ detectives like Johnny Gonzalez and the
undercovers Derrick and Rob _ felt they should be found guilty on
at least some counts. Feelings ran deep. No case in recent years
has hit the police closer to home. The case _ the 1998 killing of a
black man by four panicky white policemen _ touched every narcotics
officer _ black and white _ to the core. By Michael Winerip.

   RACE-HIP-HOP (Undated) _ Billy Wimsatt, 27, was born as rap
music was being invented by blacks and Latinos in the South Bronx.
What began as party music became their cry of ghetto pain and their
great hope for a way out. And as hip-hop blossomed into the center
of youth culture, Wimsatt and lots of other white kids found in it
a way to flee their own orderly world by discovering a sexier, more
provocative one. He regarded hip-hop as a bold modern hope to ease
some of the abrasiveness between the races. Elliott Wilson, a young
black man, had never met Wimsatt, but their lives had traced

example, and shortly after the series ended, it introduced a lineup

it. They included a black woman and a white woman as well as
Chancellor, who is black, and Dyer, who is white. The paper, it
seemed, had become a proud model of racial enlightenment. Which

AGAINST PURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July   9, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a bold claim, but for my money is the single most
interesting journalist of all the 700-plus highly-talented
reporters on the Wall Street Journal is G. Pascal Zachary.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a few supporting facts. He is the author of
``Showstopper,'' about innovation at Microsoft Corp. (Dave Cutler,
the former Digital Equipment programmer who is the book's
protagonist, last week was named one of Microsoft's first
Distinguished Engineers, akin to an IBM Fellow) and ``Endless
Frontier,'' a biography of Vannevar Bush, the architect of
America's science policy in World War II and after. He is a
contributing editor to the political fortnightly In These Times. He
writes a column for Technology Review as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief exhibit is Zachary's new book on diversity. ``The
Global Me: New Cosmopolitans and the Competitive Edge,'' is a
stunning example of inventive reporting. My hunch is that it will
achieve in the Early Twos what George Gilder's ``Wealth and
Poverty'' did for the 1980s -- confidently and clearly set out the
dominant theme of the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Zachary often sounds like Gilder _ in the new book at
least (in the paper his stories are nearly as sober as the rest.)
Gilder's specialty is the tension between entreprenurs and everyone
else. Zachary zeroes in on the more intimate battlefield between
children and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversity defines the health and wealth of nations in a new
century,'' he writes. ``Mighty is the mongrel. The mixing of races,
ethnic groups and nationalities-- at home and abroad -- is at a
record level. The hybrid is hip. . .. Mixing is the new norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no passing fashion but a deep change. Say goodbye to
the pure, the straight, the smooth. Forget the original, the
primordial, the one. They are old news, humpty dumpties, shattered
when the walls fell down. No one can put them together again. The
apostles of purity are doomed. Resistence is futile.''
</P>
<P>
   In between the exuberent prose-poetry at the beginning and the
end of the book is a wealth of shrewd reporting about how, in an
increasingly fluid world, people make decisions to affiliate or
not. Zachary visits Ireland, studies Germany, tours the Balkans,
journeys to Mongolia, surveys Japan and drops in on Zurich to show
the increasing power of border-crossers in the global economy.
Virtually no corner of the world remains uncrissed or crossed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact there are few more intimate choices than the decision
which side of the inevitable hyphen of ethnicity on which to live
one's life. Even more private and inexplicable is the subsequent
decision of whom to marry _ inside or out of the relevant tribe?
The effects of these choices go cascading down the generations
through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Until I read ``The Global Me,'' however, it never occurred to me
that that the sum total of all such decisions might have
significant economic implications.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary makes a compelling case that that hybridization is a key
to growth. He draws on the authority of the great historian William
McNeill, who has argued that contact with strangers has always been
the chief engine of historical change. Some extra little bit of
energy accompanies commingling, collision, intermarriage. He quotes
the writer Salman Rushdie to the effect that ``melange, hotchpotch,
a bit of this and a bit of that is how newness enters the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Who is the Global Me? It is Zachary, of course, and every other
half-breed proud to call him or herself mongrel or a mutt. Born in
Brooklyn in TK to a Jewish mother of Polish-Russian ancestry an a
south Italian Catholic father, Zachary studied philosophy at the
State University of New York in Albany, founded a journal, moved to
California to write for the Berkeley Barb, worked his way up a
chain of business publications, married an Irish farm girl and
moved to London.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I asked him about his experiences. ``My years in
California convinced me that radical mixing of peoples works and
raises the bar (creatively) for everyone,'' he replied. ``While the
US as a whole experiences immigration, California experiences it in
a different way, in part because many of the US born natives aren't
native to California. Perhaps we were all newcomers to the state...
</P>
<P>
   ``Even today, when the rest of the US has become a lot more like
California, I still feel the East Coast remains more locked in the
older-style ethnic consciousness, where people feel the fierce need
to defend their group, indeed even to freeze its boundaries. In
California identity is more fluid, and the elements of social
vitality are too.''
</P>
<P>
   Openess to immigration gives the United States its key
advantage, Zachary concludes. Germany is his chief example of ``the
monoculture in retreat.'' No wonder, then, the economy of
California's economy is bigger than that of Germany _ and still
growing by leaps and bounds.

SPORTS RAGE: THE NEW FACE OF VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERICA THESING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First there was road rage. Then came air rage. Now, it seems,
the country is experiencing an outbreak of youth sports rage,
sports officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's fatal beating in Massachusetts of a father after he
apparently argued with another father during a pick-up ice hockey
game is the latest and most serious example of violence stemming
from youth sports, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But across the country there have been a slew of incidents that
sports officials say point to a worrisome trend.
</P>
<P>
   In Amherst, Mass., police arrested two soccer parents for
disorderly conduct and simple assault after the two fought at a
Memorial Day under-12 boys tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In Greensboro, N.C. last year, a mother was charged with assault
after attacking a soccer referee.
</P>
<P>
   And in Maryland last year a father knocked down and kicked a
baseball coach when his son was not chosen for the all-star team.
It could not be determined if charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Youth sports officials nationwide say incidents of parental rage
have become so prevalent that Barry Mano, president of the National
Association of Sports Officials, said his group has begun offerring
``assault insurance'' to its 19,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The program provides members who claim they've been assaulted
while officiating games legal advice and offers to pay a portion of
the cost of any medical treatment resulting from attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten so many reports of assualts, we thought that was
an important ingredient,'' said Mano. ``It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the growing number of parents becoming unruly at
their children's sporting events, some youth leagues are mandating
good sportsmanship seminars for parents.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Jupiter-Tequesta Athletic Assocation in
Florida to adopt such a requirment garnered national attention
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   And in Michigan, a September seminar focusing on good
sportsmanship and aimed at parents, athletic directors and coaches
involved in high school sports sold out after drawing 2,000
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Avitt, national program director for the nonprofit
Parents Alliance for Youth Sports, said her group developed a good
sportsmanship program after being inundated with phone calls from
parents, coaches, and officials concerned about parent behavior at
sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Too many angry adults setting poor examples for children, she
said are ``totally destroying the concept of what youth sports is
supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The PAYS program, Avitt said, has been adopted by several youth
leagues in communities across the country. She said, the program
has been used by the Billerica (Mass.) Recreation Department and
has involved about 100 parents.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the program is a code of ethics parents are
asked to sign reminding them that sports are for children, not
adults and that the well-being of children is more important than
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Through videos, workbooks and handouts, the program also
encourages youth league parents to create a safe, positive, and fun
environment for children, Avitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Some communities have taken other initiatives to try to keep
parents' enthusiasm from escalating into rowdy behavior. Two months
ago, the Cambridge, Mass. youth soccer league asked parents and
other spectators not to cheer or yell instructions during several
matches between female teams.
</P>
<P>
   The fact youth sport leagues need to sponsor good sportsmanship
programs and take other anti-violence measures is a sad commentary
on the state of sports in America, said Michael S. Josephson,
founder and president of the Josephson Institute of Ethics.
</P>
<P>
   The California-based organization offers seminars and training
for coaches, athletes and parents that stress ethical sports
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that sports is becoming more and more an arena where
people are allowing unrestrained anger and passion to play out,''
Josephson said. ``We don't know how to control violence. We are
more and more moving from sport to spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he added, if some parents can't control their
behavior then youth league officials will have be under enve more
pressure to combat the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to, as a society, make a real judgment as to how
much of this violence we're going to allow to stay in sports,''
Josephson said. ``If we continue to allow sports to demonstrate the
worst in human nature and we do not demand and require the referees
and officials to control the game, it will get wilder and wilder.''
</P>
<P>
   And the death in Massachusetts may serve as a clarion call among
everyone involved in youth leagues of what can happen when parents
lose sight of the purpose of youth sports, Josephson noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a window to the problem,'' Josephson said. ``We
have to take sport back or it won't be a safe place for any of us
to be or to send our kids.''

 &HT;    ``We came here to win''
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Venus Williams hasn't been shopping in
London yet or sat in the stands watching tennis or even been out to
dinner in the village just up the hill from the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
   She and sister Serena have spent a few Wimbledons playing some
tennis and exploring one of the greatest cities in the world. But
those years, they came with Mom. This year, they begged their
father to come.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams agreed, but only on the condition he get
something in return for overcoming his fear of flying and boarding
an airplane in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted free time spent on tennis, not clothes. He wanted
meals eaten quietly at their rented home a few blocks from the
courts. He wanted shopping minimized. Venus hasn't even had the
cash to buy a newspaper, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to win,'' Richard Williams said. ``We didn't come this
far to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why he brought two players. One went down in the
semifinals, of course, when fifth seed Venus defeated eighth seed
Serena 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) in the semifinals Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But now Venus can make history.
</P>
<P>
   If she wins her first Grand Slam title at the most prestigious
and most traditional tournament in the world, she will become just
the second black woman to win Wimbledon since the championships
began in 1884.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow American Althea Gibson won in 1957 and 1958, but just one
other black woman has even reached the final since. Martina
Navratilova beat Zina Garrison in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so few black people to win Wimbledon or even
just play outstanding tennis,'' Venus said. ``Hopefully there will
be more. Naturally, we're going to do our best to change that. We
already have.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams couldn't agree more. He signed more autographs
and posed for more pictures with fans Friday afternoon at the All
England Club after his daughters defeated Anna Kournikova and
Natasha Zvereva 6-3, 7-6 (z-z) to reach their first Wimbledon
doubles final.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he talked with reporters but wouldn't discuss his
feelings ``if'' Venus makes history by defeating second seed
Lindsay Davenport or ``if'' she and Serena defeat Julie
Halard-Decugis and Ai Sugiyama for the doubles title, also making
history as the first all-black team to win Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the problems I've seen a long time ago when
people my color talk about ``if'' this happens,'' Richard Williams
said. ``We're here to make things happen. We're here to set any
kind of history for anyone that wants to see history. Althea Gibson
won the singles here and we're here to follow in the footsteps that
she laid.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not (saying) if Venus wins, if this happens,'' he
said. ``It's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Serena tries to put aside her bad feelings at her own
loss to cheer for her sister.
</P>
<P>
   She insists that won't be difficult. The sisters watched a movie
together Thursday night and didn't even talk tennis, they said.
Serena did plan, however, to give Venus some confidential advice
about Davenport and a few words about handling a final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just (tell her) not to get too much caught up in the moment
of, `I'm in the final of Wimbledon,' '' Serena said. ``Just got to
relax, go out there and perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams also reports that the hard work is over. He
expects to return to the friends box today after avoiding his
daughters' head-to-head matchup. That would have been too painful
to watch, he said, but he promises today will be joyful for
Compton, Palm Beach Gardens and for Williams fans everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our party,'' he said. ``We came here to win, and we
didn't invite no one to come play at this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport might disagree. She was the one who knew for almost
365 days that, as the defending champion, she would play her
first-round match this year at 2 p.m. Tuesday, June 27, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Californian has won all three previous Grand
Slam finals she's reached and has won nine of her 12 meetings with
Venus. But they've split the past four matches, with Davenport
winning most recently in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times I found the key was find a way to get her serve
back deep so she doesn't have put-away shots,'' said Davenport,
whose ranking will not budge from No.2 win or lose. ``You've got to
not let her step inside the baseline and hit because she hits so
hard that on grass they might be hard to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus has played in just one Grand Slam final, the 1997 U.S.
Open, which she lost to Martina Hingis. It was her first U.S. Open
but she made a splashy run in New York with her beaded hair and
long limbs flying.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing will be the same as that day, Venus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my third Grand Slam. I wasn't even full time on the
tour,'' she said, smiling at the memory. ``I didn't understand any
strategy, as far as you're down break point, maybe you should get
your first serve in. Things like that never came to my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few thought it would take the young player with the huge
serve and powerful groundstrokes nearly three years to return to a
Grand Slam final. But she needed to learn strategy, refine her
strokes, harness her power and, most importantly, correct her
often-streaky mental game.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's reading the ball very well and she's hitting and moving,
which is a big difference,'' said E.T. Dumas, a coach who has
worked with the sisters off and on for 10 years. ``Instead of
hitting and seeing what she's doing and then reacting, she's
hitting and moving right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams believes Venus is overdue for her Grand Slam
title, and he seemed eager Friday for the trophy to be firmly in
the Williamses' grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for a certainty when Venus learns how easy it is to
win a Grand Slam when she walks on that court, she'll be winning
just like that on and on for a while,'' he said. ``(But) I won't
say she's going to win all of them that Serena's in.''

 &HT;    Rafter's upset of Agassi proves he's back in the game
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Even if he doesn't win on Sunday, the agony
is over for Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't sure the uncertainty, pain and disappointment created
by tearing the right rotator cuff in his serving shoulder last year
would ever end. He didn't know if his aggressive serve-and-volley
game would ever return and even if it did, he had no idea if it
would be successful.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, all those concerns and questions melted away for the
27-year-old Australian. It happened with a convincing upset of
second seed Andre Agassi in the semifinals of Wimbledon. It was an
intriguing match that Rafter won 7-5, 4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 in 3
hours, 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road back,'' Rafter said. ``That's the most
satisfying part about it. Now I'm back in the final. It has been
probably a big shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, who served 18 aces and won 35 points with volleys, will
play top seed Pete Sampras in Sunday's final. Sampras needed a
trainer once during his match against Vladimir Voltchkov but didn't
appeared slowed by the left shin injury he's had since the second
round, winning 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit unexpected for me, a little bit probably for
everyone else in the locker room, as well,'' Rafter said. ``I've
showed no real signs of coming back very well after the shoulder
surgery. It's very satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the 1997 and 1998 U.S. Open champion lost in
straight sets to Agassi in the Wimbledon semifinals. Rafter came
off the court angry with himself, although this year he recalled it
as a satisfying loss.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months later, the twinges started in his shoulder.
By the U.S. Open, the pain forced him to retire from his
first-round match against Cedric Pioline. On Oct. 24, he had
arthroscopic surgery to repair the rotator cuff and he missed the
rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the tour in February in Delray Beach but played
sparingly and not very well in the months following. Doctors told
him ``there are only so many serves left in your arm.'' They
instructed him to decide whether to use them in practice or in
matches. That information weighed on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't finished and decided to practice his serve until
he was happy with it, disregarding doctors' advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't last that long, it doesn't last very long,'' he
told himself. ``That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he won a small tournament last week in the Netherlands.
And he won a round at Wimbledon and his hopes the shoulder would
really be ready this fortnight seemed to be coming true.
</P>
<P>
   He played stunning tennis against Agassi, taking advantage of
Agassi's eight ill-timed double faults and a few careless shots.
After the two exchanged the first four sets, the fifth seemed like
a fresh slate for Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   But Rafter served to start the set, as he did all five, and
Agassi felt like he was in a hole from the beginning. Down 2-3, he
double faulted to fall behind 30-40. Rafter hit an overhead that
Agassi reached but put into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter got the service break and didn't lose another point on
his serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like at the biggest moments of each set, he
continued to execute and I fell off a little bit,'' Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't appreciate the exciting match for its level of
tennis and drama, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no objectivity on that right now,'' he said. ``As far
as I'm concerned, the match sucked.''
</P>
<P>
   Voltchov, the 22-year-old qualifier from Belarus, also lost but
had an entirely different perspective. It was his first match on
Centre Court, first against Sampras and it carried a badly needed
$193,000 paycheck, even though he lost.
</P>
<P>
   He also didn't play badly. He kept the world's best grass court
player on serve for the first set, losing only after a
heartbreaking error at 4-5 in the tiebreaker. Voltchkov hit two
perfect backhands to get the easy volley from Sampras but hit it
into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot about it,'' he said. ``I guess these things are
decided somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he moves on to Davis Cup in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good run for me here,'' he said. ``I'm actually
pretty satisfied with the way the match went today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter also was satisfied. He hopes never to lose the feeling
that his post-injury tennis is ``a bonus thing,'' but he wants to
remain competitive. He knows it's all up to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're out there struggling, you've got to do it
yourself,'' he said. ``No one can tell you. No one can tell me. I'm
too bloody stubborn.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ When Banco Santander Central Hispano (BSCH) forked over
US$529 million in cash for online financial services site
Patagon.com in March, it became clear that banks serious about
competing in Latin America would back up their virtual plans with
real dollars. The reason is simple: Online banking saves money.
Lots of money.
 &HT;    ``We save 90 percent on every transaction done on the
Internet,'' says Eugenio Zubiria, head of the Internet division for
Mexico's Banamex. ``It costs us $1 for every transaction done at a
branch and 10 cents for every transaction online.''
 &HT;    With such tremendous savings as an incentive, banks in Latin
America are scrambling frantically to get clients online at the
same time they broaden their roster of digital offerings. In the
race for customers, Brazil's Bradesco set an industry standard when
it became the first to offer free Internet access to its customers.
Competitor Unibanco quickly followed suit. Now, both Brazilian
financial houses boast websites that are dynamic, fun and
interesting _ in short, very un-banklike.
 &HT;    Banamex offers the latest sports scores on its site while
Colombia's Conavi promotes its ``Club Abejita Conavi'' or ``Little
Conavi Bee Club'' for kids between 6 and 12. The children have to
memorize a pin number to obtain sticker books featuring the
much-loved Conavi bee. Mexico's Bancomer offers everything from the
latest winning lottery numbers to breaking headlines from the
nation's major newspapers.
 &HT;    Tucked into the gimmicks are banking's backbone operations _
loans, bill paying, investments, credit card applications, account
updates and changes of address. Except now they're unfolding
online. As the calendar flipped to 2000, banks began to roar into
cyberspace. The clumsy and sometimes comical mating of the stodgy
Old Economy bastions and the hot and sexy Internet scene has raised
the mercury in the financial thermometer.
 &HT;    ``Things are really overheated right now,'' says Patagon CEO
Wenceslao Casares. ``There is so much hype when, in reality, if you
turned the Internet off for a week in Latin America it wouldn't
hurt anyone.''
 &HT;    Fueling the fury is a quest to be No. 1. For Spanish financial
houses, that means being top dog in the region. Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) got out of the gate early, allying with
Telefonica de Espana in a multibillion dollar digital deal. The
arrangement between Spain's two largest companies, in terms of
market capitalization, included giving domineering Telefonica CEO
Juan Villalonga a seat on BBVA's board of directors. Since the
deal, BBVA has been less than enthusiastic about conceding control
to Villalonga, who recently lost two top executives at Telefonica's
Terra Networks over a lack of freedom.
 &HT;    Provided control issues are ironed out, the Spanish alliance
will unveil a global digital bank with no branches. The new bank,
Unofirst, will merge England's First-e and Spain's Uno-e to create
a financial megabank in Asia, Europe, Latin America and the United
States, with an initial public offering on the horizon.
 &HT;    BSCH jumped into the fray with the surprise purchase of
Patagon.com _ its weapon to create online banking facilities in
Spain and Latin America. BBVA countered by buying a 30 percent
stake, along with operating control, of Grupo Financiero Bancomer
for $1.75 billion to form Mexico's largest bank. A week later, the
company announced it would dole out $25 million in 2000 on Internet
projects designed to reel in 500,000 customers.
 &HT;    Once BBVA and BSCH finish duking it out, they'll have to take on
the local favorites in Latin America. And the local banks are
getting ready.
 &HT;    Mexico's Banamex is bulking up against foreign invaders by
installing personal computers and hiring branch personnel who'll
teach the ins and outs of online transactions to anyone who walks
through the door.
 &HT;    ``Our goal is to maintain our leadership on the Internet,'' says
Zubiria at Banamex, which teamed with California-based Commerce One
to launch an e-commerce operation and business procurement site.
The site will focus first on Mexico, where it claims to have a
relationship with 75 percent of domestic businesses, before
branching into the rest of Latin America.
 &HT;    But there are still challenges, including an attachment to
bureaucracy and red tape. ``People here always want receipts for
everything and you don't always get that online,'' Zubiria
explains. He also says the bank is lobbying the Mexican Congress to
facilitate online transactions.
 &HT;    The story is quite different in Brazil, where the banking system
has been ready for the online switch for some time.
 &HT;    ``Brazil has one of the most sophisticated banking systems in
the world today,'' says Alkimar Moura, a professor of banking and
finance at Getulio Vargas School of Business in Sao Paulo. During
the hyperinflation of the 1980s and 1990s, the banks learned to
operate swiftly, he says. ``Time was money and the longer you
waited, the more you would lose.''
 &HT;    Brazilians now expect high-speed transactions and check clearing
with as little red tape as possible. Moura says the biggest problem
is that only a small percentage of the population can afford
computers. But Brazil's largest private bank, Bradesco, hopes to
change that.
 &HT;    The bank has been an Internet pioneer in Brazil and within its
own company, including cutting deals with computer manufacturers to
supply its employees with computers. At last count, it had
purchased 8,000 computers in a two-month stretch.
 &HT;    Bradesco the first bank in the country (and only the third in
the world) to offer online banking in May of 1996. In 2000, it
registered another ``first'' when it offered free Internet access
to its 8.7 million customers.
 &HT;    Today, the bank boasts more than 1 million online users and 5
million transactions per month. The 66 cents saved on each
transaction adds up to nearly $40 million a year.
 &HT;    Rivals Itau and Unibanco are still playing catch-up. Unibanco
most recently replaced E-commerce Director Carlos Cesar with the
new director, Geraldo Travagli, before announcing a $28 million
Internet expansion. Itau on the other hand has a reputation for
superb management but critics say it lacks a clear Internet plan.
 &HT;    Candido Leonelli, Bradesco's director of special products, says
Brazilians have long used banks to pay bills. ``We had to invest
years ago in automating the process to cut costs.'' He sees the
Internet as the perfect extension of the process.
 &HT;    He also touts Bradesco's digital creativity. For example, the
bank is installing personal computers in its branches so customers
can shop online. ``We have 2,300 branches and 3.7 million people
passing through every day. Why not turn the branches into stores?''
he asks. ``Our branch people are our disciples spreading the
Internet.''
 &HT;    At the same time it courts customers, Bradesco is embracing
e-commerce ventures and business-to-business procurement activities
through its sister site www.scopus.com.br.
 &HT;    The bank also plans on installing e-kiosks _ stands of
free-standing personal computers _ in airports, hotels and malls.
And the Bradesco tentacles don't stop with computers. The bank has
picked up almost a fifth of the voting shares of pay TV company
Globo Cabo, which is expanding broadband access in Brazil.
 &HT;    ``We want the banking to be more interactive, with videos and
images,'' says Leonelli, adding that the new technologies will
merge online banking with cellular phones and WebTV.
 &HT;    Still, maintaining balance between bricks and clicks may be the
key to succeeding in most of Latin America.
 &HT;    Angeli del Toro, director of online banking for Colombia's
Conavi, says many customers are still spurning Internet banking.
Despite a multimillion dollar campaign that included free classes
on how to use the Internet, the appearance of public Internet
kiosks and web cafes, some customers refuse to go digital.
 &HT;    ``Many of our clients like the personal contact they get at the
branch and we respect that,'' says Del Toro.
 &HT;    She predicts that the challenge of getting people online in
Latin America will be similar to the push that got people using
automatic teller machines (ATMs). ``It took a while at first
because people were scared and did not trust the technology,'' she
says. ``Today, (ATMs) are used very commonly.''

NEVADA'S TROUBLED PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN MAY HOLD LESSONS FOR
CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARSON CITY, Nev. _ Nevada has adopted a prescription drug
program for the elderly very similar to one approved last month by
the U.S. House of Representatives, but it is off to a rocky start.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies have spurned Nevada's invitation to provide
coverage. The risks and the costs are too high, they say, and the
subsidies offered by the state are too low.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada's experience offers ominous lessons for Congress,
especially Republicans, who want to subsidize insurance companies
to entice them into providing drug benefits to elderly and disabled
people on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   States often portray themselves as the laboratories of democracy
where good ideas originate and are tested, and Nevada's governor,
Kenny Guinn, a Republican, was far ahead of Washington in trying to
address the needs of the elderly in buying prescription drugs.
Guinn signed the legislation creating the program on June 9, 1999,
three weeks before President Clinton unveiled his proposal to add
drug benefits to Medicare. But Nevada officials say Guinn's ideas
may need more work in the laboratory before they can be put into
effect nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada was prepared to use 15 percent of the $1.2 billion it
expected to receive over the next 25 years from the settlement of
its lawsuit against tobacco companies _ $4.6 million this year, $37
million over six years _ to subsidize drug benefits for elderly
people with incomes of less than $21,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the state invited hundreds of insurance companies to
bid for its business, providing drug coverage for 10,000 to 14,000
people age 62 or older. Only one company responded, but it was
ineligible because it was not licensed to sell insurance in Nevada.
The state revised its invitation and reissued it on June 29, with
an Aug. 29 deadline for submission of proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara E. Buckley, a state assemblywoman who is co-chairwoman
of a task force monitoring use of the money, said: ``I have my
doubts that an insurance company will be able to offer meaningful
drug benefits under this program. If an insurance company does bid
on it but the benefits are paltry, senior citizens will be up in
arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force has refused to authorize the release of any money
until it sees details of a drug program, like the eligibility
criteria, premiums, deductibles, co-payments and benefit limits.
Most of those details will be decided by the successful bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Fend, a retired Navy captain who serves on the task force,
said he was surprised at the insurance industry's failure to
respond to the state's initial invitation. Asked why insurers did
not show more interest, he said: ``Probably because they don't
think they can make any money. If they thought they could make a
reasonable amount of money, they would probably buy into the
program and bid on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada program, created by the state Legislature last year
at the governor's request, is similar to the Republican plan
approved in the House on June 28 by a vote of 217-214, largely
along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Shelley Berkley, a Democratic congresswoman from Las Vegas,
said she did not understand why Congress would try to copy a
troubled state program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in the world, when it is not yet functioning'' for
thousands of low-income seniors in Nevada, ``would we try to
replicate it for the millions of seniors who are desperately in
need of affordable prescription medications?'' Berkley asked.
</P>
<P>
   Guinn said he remained ``fully committed'' to carrying out the
program, known as Senior Rx. He complained that Berkley had made
``a bitter partisan attack on a program which will benefit
thousands of Nevada's low-income senior citizens, both Republican
and Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the Nevada program, state officials say, premiums should
be in the range of $45 to $60 a month. The state would pay up to
$40 of that amount, based on the patient's income; the patient
would pay the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Health Insurance Association of America has
repeatedly told Congress that its members are not interested in
selling ``drug only'' insurance to the elderly. House Republicans
have insisted that if Congress provides the money, insurers or
other companies will step forward to offer coverage. Nevada's
experience raises questions about that argument.
</P>
<P>
   The state offered millions of dollars in subsidies, but insurers
were skittish. ``They didn't understand what we were looking for,''
said Scott Scherer, chief of staff to Guinn. ``They were confused
by the first request for proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Nevada's experience tends to confirm a point
made repeatedly by Republicans in Congress: private insurers need
freedom to design drug benefits as they think best, or they will
not participate in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Denice L. Miller, senior policy adviser to Guinn, summarized the
lesson this way: ``Let the insurers be creative. Let them be
flexible. Let seniors have some choices.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Medicare generally does not cover prescription drugs for people
outside a hospital. Democrats in Congress want to offer the same
drug benefits, with the same premiums, to all Medicare recipients.
Republicans reject that approach. Under the House-passed bill,
premiums, benefits and co-payments could vary from one private drug
plan to another, so long as the overall value was equivalent to
that of a standard policy defined by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Several states have programs to help older people obtain
prescription medicines. In most cases, the state itself is the
insurer, reviewing claims, paying pharmacies and deciding which
drugs a patient may receive. Nevada, rather than paying for drugs
outright, is the first state to develop a program that uses
subsidies to help people buy private drug insurance of the type
envisioned by many Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, as in Washington, insurers worry that the only people
who buy drug coverage will be those who really need it. State Sen.
Raymond D. Rawson, a Republican, said insurance companies were
``very worried'' about this phenomenon, known as adverse selection.
</P>
<P>
   Marie H. Soldo, executive vice president of Sierra Health
Services of Las Vegas, the largest managed care company in the
state, said: ``Insurers are unwilling to bear the entire financial
risk of drug coverage. The rapidly rising cost of pharmacy benefits
does not allow that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The only company that responded to the state's first
solicitation was Mature Rx Plus of Nevada. It was set up this year
by FFI Health Services, a privately held company based in
Macedonia, Ohio. James J. Mindala, chief executive of FFI, said the
company was seeking a Nevada license and still hoped to participate
in the program here. FFI was acquired this week by Advance Paradigm
of Irving, Texas, a provider of health-benefit management services.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada program had broad bipartisan support when it was
created under a bill passed unanimously by both houses of the state
Legislature in May 1999. But since then, prescription drugs have
become a major issue at the national level defining philosophical
differences between the parties, and specifically between the
Republican and Democratic candidates for Nevada's open seat in the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Democratic candidate for the Senate, Ed Bernstein,
has made prescription drugs the central issue of his campaign
against John Ensign, the Republican, who served in the House from
1995 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein flew to Tijuana, Mexico, last month with a group of
eight Nevadans to call attention to the lower prices charged for
prescription drugs south of the border. Back in Reno, he dumped
$100,000 in cash on the ground in front of a drug company
distribution center; it was, he said, a symbol of the campaign
contributions Ensign has taken from drug manufacturers. In
addition, Bernstein has toured the state in a recreational vehicle,
the ``Rx RV,'' talking about the need to make medicines more
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ensign says the Nevada program should be given
time to work.
</P>
<P>
   The insurers' role in the Nevada program is similar to that
envisioned in the House Republican bill. Insurers would ``provide
prescription drug and pharmaceutical services'' to the elderly
here, market the approved insurance policies and set up a network
of drugstores to fill prescriptions. The insurers are also expected
to offer mail-order pharmacy services and could establish a list of
preferred drug products, known as a formulary.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada officials, like federal officials, hope to use their
purchasing power to obtain discounts on drugs. Insurers could set
monthly or annual limits on benefits, but subscribers could still
buy drugs at a discount after they reached the limit on drugs
covered by their insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   The population of Nevada has been growing faster than that of
any other state. The number of Nevadans age 65 and older has
increased more than 60 percent since 1990.

FIGHT AFTER YOUTH HOCKEY EVENT LEADS TO FATHER'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT AND IEVA AUGSTUMS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   READING, Mass. _ A father of four who was beaten unconscious
Wednesday by another father at an ice rink here was pronounced dead
Friday, turning a merely ugly event into perhaps the most grisly
incident to date in a nationwide wave of parental violence at youth
sports events.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas F. Junta, 42, of Reading, so far faces misdemeanor
assault charges, but Middlesex County District Attorney Martha
Coakley said in a news conference that the case is being considered
a ``possible homicide'' pending an autopsy this morning.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier interview, Reading Police Chief Edward Marchand
said Junta attacked the victim, Michael Costin, 40, of Lynnfield,
after an informal youth hockey skate-around at the Burbank Ice
Arena, during which the men traded insults and argued about the
childrens' rowdy behavior.
</P>
<P>
   While those who knew him described Costin as easy-going and
affable, police records obtained Friday show he had been sent to
prison several times in the 1980s and 1990s for a host of crimes,
including assaulting police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley was reluctant to say who may have instigated the fatal
fight.
</P>
<P>
   According to Marchand, verbal sparring between Junta, who was in
the stands, and Costin, who was on the ice monitoring the
youngsters, resulted in a brief, off-ice shoving match after the
practice. But after a rink employee ordered Junta to leave the
building, the 6-foot-2, 275-pound Junta alledegly returned and
knocked Costin to the ground, Marchand said.
</P>
<P>
   As Costin, described as 5-feet-11 and 170 pounds, lay there,
Junta allegedly sank his knee into the fallen father's chest, and
began ``whacking'' Costin in the face and beating his head into the
floor, Marchand said.
</P>
<P>
   Junta ``was doing a job on him, whacking him... and slapping his
head on the floor,'' Marchand said, adding that 14 to 20 children
were at the practice, but it was unclear how many witnessed the
altercation. When police officers arrived at the rink, Costin was
unconscious and had no pulse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the Lahey Medical Clinic pronounced Costin brain dead
early Thursday, keeping him on a ventilator until Friday. Costin's
father, Augustine M. Costin, said that when relatives went to see
their injured kin, he was ``unrecognizable.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials and residents in Reading, a community of 23,000, many
devoted to youth hockey _ were stunned by Costin's death, saying
they never imagined parental zeal could ever go so far.
</P>
<P>
   The Burbank Ice Arena, they said, often serves as a frigid town
common. High school hockey games fill the 1,000-seat rink to
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big hockey town, but sometimes in Reading, we don't
think we are part of the world,'' said Town Manager Peter I.
Hechenbleikner. ``We are.''
</P>
<P>
   Hechenbleikner and town Health Services Administrator Jane M.
Fiore will host a meeting Saturday at which clergy, police, and
mental health workers will offer counseling to anyone shaken by the
violent episode.
</P>
<P>
   In Lynnfield, neighbors of Costin, a single father, said they
were appalled that a man they described as shy, gentle, religious,
and utterly devoted to his children could die such a violent death.
</P>
<P>
   Jack McDonald, whose children often spent time with Costin, his
three sons and one daughter, said Costin was the most unlikely
candidate he could imagine to engage in a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a great dad and a real gentleman,'' McDonald said.
``To have this happen to him is unbeleievable to everyone who knows
him. You get an image of parents who are real rah-rah about their
kids' activities, but he's a guy you'd never hear a peep out of. I
used to marvel at his parental diligence.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Costin was a dedicated parent who regularly ferried his
children to Sunday Mass at Our Lady of the Assumption Roman
Catholic Church, he was also a man with a dark, even violent side,
records show.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state's Criminal Offender Registry, Costin was
sent to prison seven times between 1983 and 1995, spending anywhere
from 30 days to 15 months behind bars at a time. His crimes, the
Registry states, ranged from assaulting police officers to drunken
driving to breaking-and-entering with a loaded, unlicensed firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Junta _ who has no criminal record, according to the Registry _
was also described by those who know him as a parent with fierce
devotion to his children and their budding sports careers. Junta's
16-year-old daughter is a key player on the Reading High School
Rockets, the school's girls hockey team, which was formed last
year, thanks in large part to the hard work of Junta's wife,
Michelle.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Still, spokesman for the National Association of Sports
Officials, a Wisconsin organization that represents 19,000 umpires
and referees, said his organization receives at least two reports a
week of physical assaults on referees and umpires by parents. The
problem, he said, was virtually non-existent 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Wolff, a New York sports psychologist and author of
``Coaching Kids For Dummies,'' said parents have grown increasingly
involved and occasionally violent at children's sports events, but
despite that, he said he was unaware of any incident that had ended
in death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who have been seriously injured,
absolutely,'' Wolff said. ``Over the years, people have fired
shots, brandished knives, brandished guns, thrown punches, but I
don't ever recall any fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the sad part is,'' he continued, ``it's not surprising. It
has become a national epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts have floated several theories to explain the increased
violence, rage, and aggression parents have become to exhibit at
their children's games.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the problem is just another form of road rage, or the
newer ``air rage'' that flight attendants and pilots protested on
Thursday across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of this ahs to do with college sports
scholarships,'' Still said. ``Everyone is pushing for their kid to
be a star athlete so they can get their kid a free ride to school.
A referee's call that hurts their kid is actually worth money to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still also sees increased time-constraints on working parents as
a potential cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents don't have time to go out in the yard and practice
with their kids anymore, so the games are the only involvement they
have,'' Still, who was confronted by an angry father at a high
school baseball game in Racine, Wisc., earlier this week, said.
``Winning becomes everything at that point. That's all they have
left.''

FOES OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION FILE PETITION IN ARIZONA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opponents of bilingual education in Arizona have filed 165,000
signatures with the secretary of state's office, about 64,000 more
than needed to get their measure on the November ballot to kill
bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's ``English for the Children'' campaign is modeled after
a nearly identical measure passed by California voters in 1998, and
funded by the same Silicon Valley entrepreneur and occasional
political candidate, Ron Unz. However, exit polling showed that
California Hispanics voted against the measure nearly 2-1, and
political analysts predict similar opposition from Arizona
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona secretary of state's office is expected to determine
whether the signatures and petitions meet the requirements for the
ballot within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Unz said he hopes that having the bilingual question on the
November ballot will force the presidential candidates to treat it
as a national issue, even though neither major candidate supports
the abolition of bilingual education. GOP hopeful George W. Bush
attracts more Hispanic support than most Republican candidates, but
a poll released recently by Hispanic Trends Inc. shows presumptive
Democratic nominee Al Gore with a lead of 22 percent among Hispanic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic population is still only 5 percent of the U.S.
electorate, but those voters are heavily concentrated, and their
numbers are growing in California, Texas, New York and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in those states provide just over half the electoral
votes needed to claim the White House, prompting presidential
contenders to focus more on issues of importance to Hispanic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Hispanic leaders are divided over the question. The
committees managing the ballot drive and opposing it are both
headed by Hispanics. Arizona State University pollster Bruce
Merrill said preliminary polling about 18 months ago on the
abolition of bilingual education showed voters of nonspecified
ethnicity were evenly split on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Merrill predicts the measure is well-positioned for approval
by Arizona's traditional voting majority of conservative, white
Republicans, even if it draws a larger than average turnout among
the state's Hispanic voters. They comprise about 20 percent of the
Arizona electorate, yet typically turn out only about 6 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Like California, the Arizona initiative calls for replacing
bilingual education _ the system in which students not fluent in
English are taught in both English and their native tongue _ with a
year of English-immersion classes. And as in California, opponents
claim the English-immersion movement is racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superficially, the initiative sounds like an innocent attempt
to improve education in the state of Arizona,'' said Leonard
Basurto, director of bilingual education programs for the Tucson
Unified School District. ``In fact, it's a mean-spirited new
attempt to impose an English-only law on the state of Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Unz wrote a guest column in the National Review last month,
noting that the bilingual debate of the past 30 years usually
boiled down to empty rhetoric, ``with the loudest voices on one
side often representing none-too-subtle xenophobia and nativism and
those on the other side preaching ethnic separatism and
Anglophobia.'' But he frequently reminds critics who charge
English-immersion supporters with racist motives that the
Proposition 227 campaign in California started with an activist nun
and a group of dissatisfied Hispanic parents.
</P>
<P>
   Political debate is still raging in California over measuring
the success or failure of Proposition 227, in part because school
districts have interpreted the law variously. And since California
has only recently begun requiring public schools to administer
Stanford 9 standardized tests to all their students, critics also
argue that there is no accurate baseline for measuring improvement.
</P>
<P>
   California educators have made many improvements to public
education in the past decade that are just now beginning to show
results, Basurto argues. Students enrolled in English-immersion
classes may be showing improvements, he said, but so are all
California students.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of test scores in California by the San Jose Mercury
News, a year and a half after Proposition 227 passed, showed
schools that switched to English-only instruction had somewhat
bigger gains than schools that used waivers to keep bilingual
education.
</P>
<P>
   But the achievement gap tended to narrow among students in
higher grades, and neither group _ bilingual or English-immersion
students _ fared well when compared against all students.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say bilingual education programs typically keep students
in specialized classrooms for years, frequently graduating students
from high school who are still not capable of communicating well in
English. They further argue that federal financial incentives paid
to school districts with bilingual programs serve to perpetuate a
program that holds non-English-speaking children back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bilingual educators do not claim to make kids 100 percent
English proficient over any (specific) period of time,'' Basurto
said. ``It varies from student to student. We're saying to
reclassify a student as English proficient, we want to make sure
they can read the English language at grade level.''

 &HT;    Ohio residents remember Kenny Irwin
 &HT;    By Dave Lance
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Kenny Irwin's death happened miles away at New
Hampshire International Speedway on Friday, but its impact was felt
in Ohio, where Irwin had touched many lives.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton native and racing legend Mack McClellan met Irwin in 1991
and immediately liked what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   Polite. A bit shy. A race driver with a golden future. Those
were McClellan's first impressions. His second and more lasting
impression developed a year later when McClellan was hospitalized
in Indianapolis, broken up from a sprint-car race wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came and visited me in the hospital the whole time I was
there,'' McClellan said. ``He was a really nice person. We were
friends more than anything else. He was a little on the bashful
side, but he was very aggressive on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan remembered Irwin on Friday in wake of his tragic death
after crashing during practice before qualifying for Sunday's race
for a NASCAR Winston Cup race the New England 300. Irwin, 30, of
Indianapolis, was killed just yards from where another stock-car
racer, 19-year-old Adam Petty, crashed and died two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, the 1998 Winston Cup rookie of the year, was entering
Turn 3 when his stock car crashed into the wall and flipped upside
down. He was taken to Concord Hospital, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third auto-racing related death in two months.
Besides Irwin and Petty, Scott Baker of Holland, Mich., was killed
during an ARCA race June 23 in Toledo. Sam Schmidt was paralyzed in
January after crashing his open-wheel race car during testing at
Walt Disney World Speedway in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin's death also will be deeply felt by Johnny Vance, owner of
Aristocrat Products in Dayton. Irwin drove for Vance's sprint-car
team in the early 1990s and the two forged a father-son
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Vance was too upset to comment when reached by phone Friday, but
in April he talked about how proud he was of Irwin. He didn't need
to say a word. His mementos and photos of Irwin behind his desk
spoke volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Irwin had moved on to NASCAR racing, he always kept
in touch with Vance, always sought his advice. And whenever he
could, he spent the night at Vance's house.
</P>
<P>
   He visited in April to see a Reds game with Vance's son and to
help around Vance's garage.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was always at home at Aristocrat, tinkering with one of
Vance's sprint cars. In April, he was doing just that but stopped
working on the car for a few moments to talk about his relationship
with Vance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Johnny are good friends,'' Irwin said. ``It's a little
of that (father-son). I talk to him about stuff I talk to my dad
about. But we're friends, too. We go on vacations together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to him about what's going on in my life. I confide in
him a lot. He's helped me more than anybody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Vance, McClellan offered Irwin advice, but his always
centered on racing. Irwin already knew several tricks of the trade.
McClellan was so impressed with Irwin's racing skills, he groomed
him as a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he'd be a star and he proved that,'' McClellan said.
``This is so unbelievable. Kenny was just a great young man. He was
quite a bit younger than me. He was more like a younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I taught him some different things, different aspects on how
to drive a car. He was certainly talented. I can't image this.''

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ Cuando Banco Santander Central Hispano (BSCH) inyecto en
marzo US$529 millones al website financiero Patagon.com se hizo
evidente que los bancos decididos a competir en America Latina
respaldarian sus planes virtuales con dolares.
 &HT;    La razon es simple: la banca en linea ahorra dinero. Mucho
dinero.
 &HT;    ``Ahorramos el 90 por ciento en cada transaccion en la
Internet,'' dice Eugenio Zubiria, director de la division de
Internet de Banamex, de Mexico. ``Nos cuesta US$1 la transaccion en
una sucursal y 10 centavos la transaccion en linea.''
 &HT;    Con ese incentivo, los bancos en America Latina se apresuran a
poner a sus clientes en linea al tiempo que amplian su oferta
digital. En la carrera por captar consumidores, Bradesco, de
Brasil, fijo una norma al convertirse en el primer banco en ofrecer
acceso gratis de Internet a sus clientes. El rival Unibanco siguio
su ejemplo y ahora ambos tienen websites dinamicos e interesantes,
muy distintos a los bancos no virtuales.
 &HT;    Banamex ofrece los ultimos resultados deportivos en su website,
mientras Conavi, de Colombia, promueve su ``Club Abejita Conavi''
para los ninos de 6 a 12 anos. Los chicos tienen que memorizar un
numero de identificacion personal para conseguir libros de
pegatinas con la famosa abeja de Conavi. Bancomer, de Mexico,
ofrece desde el ultimo sorteo de la loteria hasta los titulares de
los principales periodicos de la nacion. En medio de estos
atractivos publicitarios estan las operaciones medulares de los
bancos: prestamos, pago de facturas, inversiones, solicitud de
tarjetas de credito, actualizacion de cuentas, cambio de direccion.
 &HT;    Al comenzar el 2000 la banca se precipito hacia el espacio
cibernetico. La union torpe y a veces comica de los pesados
bastiones de la vieja economia y de la escena ardiente y sensual de
la Internet ha elevado el termometro financiero.
 &HT;    ``Las cosas se han recalentado mucho,'' dice Wenceslao Casares,
presidente ejecutivo de Patagon. ``Hay mucho alboroto pero, en
realidad, si uno desconecta la Internet por una semana en America
Latina no afectaria a nadie.''
 &HT;    Todos quieren ser el numero uno, pero para los bancos espanoles,
eso significa ser el principal en toda la region. Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) fue de los primeros en ponerse en marcha
al aliarse con Telefonica de Espana. El acuerdo entre las dos
mayores companias de Espana en terminos de capitalizacion de
mercado contemplo darle al presidente ejecutivo de Telefonica, Juan
Villalonga, un puesto en la junta de directores de BBVA. Desde el
convenio, BBVA no se ha sentido muy entusiasmado con el control de
Villalonga, quien recientemente perdio a dos altos ejecutivos de
Terra Networks, de Telefonica, por falta de libertad.
 &HT;    Suponiendo que se resuelvan los problemas de control, la alianza
espanola lanzara un banco digital internacional sin sucursales. El
nuevo banco, Unofirst, sera una fusion de First-e, de Inglaterra, y
Uno-e, de Espana, para crear un megabanco financiero en Asia,
Europa, America Latina y Estados Unidos, con una salida a bolsa en
el horizonte.
 &HT;    BSCH entro en la palestra con la sorpresiva compra de
Patagon.com, su arma para crear instalaciones bancarias en linea en
Espana y America Latina. BBVA respondio comprando una participacion
del 30 por ciento y el control operativo de Grupo Financiero
Bancomer por US$1.750 millones para formar el mayor banco de
Mexico. Una semana despues, la compania anuncio que destinaria
US$25 millones en el 2000 a proyectos de Internet para captar
500.000 clientes.
 &HT;    Cuando BBVA y BSCH concluyan su contienda tendran que batirse
con los favoritos locales de America Latina. Y los bancos
latinoamericanos se aprestan para la batalla.
 &HT;    Banamex se prepara contra los invasores extranjeros instalando
PC y contratando personal para las sucursales que ensenaran las
interioridades de las transacciones en linea a los clientes.
 &HT;    ``Nuestra meta es mantener nuestro liderazgo en la Internet,''
dice Zubiria, de Banamex, que se asocio con Commerce One, de
California, para lanzar una operacion de comercio electronico y un
website de compras para negocios. El website se concentrara primero
en Mexico, donde afirma que tiene relaciones con el 75 por ciento
de los negocios nacionales, antes de extenderse al resto de America
Latina.
 &HT;    Pero quedan desafios, como el apego a los habitos burocraticos.
``La gente siempre quiere recibos, y en linea no siempre se dan,''
explica Zubiria. Agrega que el banco cabildea en el Congreso
mexicano para facilitar las transacciones en linea.
 &HT;    Las cosas son bien distintas en Brasil, donde el sistema
bancario esta listo para el salto a la Internet desde hace tiempo.
``Brasil tiene uno de los sistemas bancarios mas sofisticados del
mundo,'' dice Alkimar Moura, profesor de Banca y Finanzas de la
Escuela de Comercio Getulio Vargas en Sao Paulo. Durante la
hiperinflacion de los anos 80 y 90, los bancos aprendieron a operar
con rapidez, afirma. ``El tiempo era oro y mientras mas uno
esperaba, mas perdia.''
 &HT;    Los brasilenos estan acostumbrados a las transacciones de alta
velocidad y liquidacion de cheques con el menor papeleo posible.
Moura dice que el mayor problema es que muy pocos pueden comprar
computadoras. Pero el mayor banco privado del pais, Bradesco,
espera cambiar esa situacion. El banco ha sido un pionero de la
Internet en Brasil y dentro de la propia entidad. Ha firmado
acuerdos con fabricantes para dar PC a sus empleados. En dos meses
compro 8.000 computadoras.
 &HT;    Bradesco se convirtio en el primer banco del pais (y el tercero
del mundo) en ofrecer banca en linea en mayo de 1996. En el 2000,
dio otro paso sin precedentes al ofrecer acceso gratis a la
Internet a sus 8,7 millones de clientes.
 &HT;    Hoy el banco tiene mas de un millon de usuarios en linea y
realiza 5 millones de transacciones al mes. Los 66 centavos que
ahorra en cada transaccion suman casi US$40 millones al ano.
 &HT;    Los rivales Itau y Unibanco aun estan a la zaga. Unibanco
recientemente sustituyo al director de comercio electronico Carlos
Cesar y puso en su lugar a Geraldo Travagli antes de anunciar una
expansion de US$28 millones en la Internet. Itau tiene fama de
contar con una administracion superior pero los criticos dicen que
carece de un plan de Internet.
 &HT;    Candido Leonelli, director de productos especiales de Bradesco,
dice que los brasilenos usan los bancos desde hace tiempo para
pagar sus cuentas, y agrega: ``Tuvimos que invertir hace anos en
automatizar el proceso para reducir costos.'' Leonelli ve la
Internet como la extension perfecta del proceso.
 &HT;    Tambien destaca la creatividad digital de Bradesco. Por ejemplo,
el banco esta instalando PC en sus sucursales para que los clientes
puedan comprar en linea. ``Tenemos 2.300 sucursales y 3,7 millones
de personas las visitan todos los dias. Por que no convertimos las
sucursales en tiendas?'' se pregunta. ``Los empleados de nuestras
sucursales son los evangelistas de la Internet.''
 &HT;    A la vez que corteja a los clientes, Bradesco crea empresas de
comercio electronico y actividades de compras interempresariales a
traves de su website www.scopus.com.br.
 &HT;    El banco tambien planea instalar puestos equipados con PC en
aeropuertos, hoteles y centros comerciales. El banco ha adquirido
casi la quinta parte de las acciones con derecho a voto de la
empresa de TV Globo Cabo, que amplia el acceso de banda ancha en
Brasil.
 &HT;    ``Queremos que la banca sea mas interactiva, con videos e
imagenes,'' dice Leonelli. Agrega que las nuevas tecnologias
fusionaran la banca en linea con los telefonos celulares y la
WebTV.
 &HT;    Pero mantener un equilibrio entre la empresa real y la virtual
puede ser la clave del exito en la mayor parte de America Latina.
Angeli del Toro, directora de banca en linea de Conavi, dice que
muchos clientes todavia desdenan la banca en la Internet. A pesar
de una campana multimillonaria con clases gratis sobre el uso de la
Internet, la aparicion de quioscos publicos y cibercafes, muchos
clientes se niegan a entrar en el mundo digital.
 &HT;    ``A muchos clientes nuestros les gusta el contacto personal de
las sucursales y respetamos ese gusto,'' dice Del Toro. Pronostica
que el desafio de poner a los latinoamericanos en linea sera
similar a la tarea de lograr que el publico usara los cajeros
automaticos. ``Tomo tiempo porque la gente no confiaba en la
tecnologia,'' comenta. ``Hoy los cajeros automaticos son muy
populares.''

MIGRANTS' DROWNINGS CAUSE TENSION ALONG THE RIO GRANDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MATAMOROS, Mexico _ For one brief moment last month, Walter
Maria Sandoval and Jose Antonio Ramirez made it across the Rio
Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Both had traveled hundreds of miles to get there. Sandoval had
come from the arid lands of central Michoacan state. Ramirez
journeyed from a small town in the southern coastal state of
Veracruz.
</P>
<P>
   But their victory would be fleeting, and fatal. Shortly after
reaching the tall grass on the Texas side of the river, both men
started paddling back to Mexico, fleeing the watchful US Border
Patrol agents who would have detained them and sent them back.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man made it. Caught in an unexpected undertow, Sandoval
and Ramirez drowned while officers on both riverbanks watched. The
agonizing scene was recorded by a television crew and shown hours
later on a Mexican nightly newscast.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were not the only migrants to die trying to cross
the border. Theirs was not even the most recent case.
</P>
<P>
   But the televised drownings have heightened tensions here over
the growing number of migrants who die while attempting
ever-riskier crossings into the United States by land and water. US
figures show that already this year there have been 238
crossing-related deaths, compared to 161 all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you hear now is stories about immigrants drowning in the
river or dying in the desert,'' said Candido Molina, a 23-year-old
father of three who sat one morning last week on the Matamoros side
pondering whether he should swim across the Rio Grande to
neighboring Brownsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for ms in both the US and Mexico attribute the higher
number of deaths to changes in US border enforcement tactics that
have sealed many of the well-known crossing points and forced
desperate migrants to cross over snowy mountains, across sun-baked
deserts, and through swirling rivers.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Sandoval and Ramirez deaths, US Immigration
and Naturalization officials announced new training programs in
live-saving techniques for Border Patrol officers along the Rio
Grande.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protecting our borders includes an obligation to protect
lives,'' INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said in announcing the
program in Washington two weeks ago. She added that despite having
rescued more than 2,000 migrants in the two years since the tougher
enforcement measures were put into place, ``we will redouble our
security efforts, because one death is too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox Quesada, who won Sunday in
a historic vote that unseated the ruling party after 71 years in
power, has criticized the intensive US enforcement along the
border. He said he favors a policy of more ``open flow'' of
immigrants between the US and Mexico to cut down on violence
against them.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than just a matter of Mother Nature or Washington
policies, activists say. Drug traffickers, illegal smugglers, and
even American ranchers have contributed to an increasing level of
violence against the migrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object of these policies is to move the migrants to more
dangerous places,'' said Arturio Solis, president of the Center for
Border Studies and Human Rights, a nonprofit research and advocacy
group based in Reynosa. ``But it has also put them more vulnerable
to violence by people who either abandon them, no longer need them,
or want them off their property.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the US estimate of 238 deaths, which is considered
conservative because it only counts migrants who die in the act of
reaching US soil, Solis said more than 300 have died this year
trying to cross _ 75 of them along the southern tip of the Rio
Grande.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, in its largest catch ever in this region, Mexican
immigration officials in Matamoros found 309 Central American
migrants hiding in four tractor trailer trucks. Although all were
alive _ unlike the 58 Chinese migrants whose corpses were
discovered two weeks ago in Britain _ several were suffering from
dehydration and infections of untreated injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the concern about violence against migrants has focused
on an area of southern Arizona, where despite the threats of
poisonous snakes, treacherous desert terrain, and 100-degree
temperatures, illegal crossings have risen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona border, which is less populated than in California
or Texas and has fewer agents on patrol, recorded more than 470,000
detentions in fiscal year 1999, making it the busiest point for
illegal crossings along the 2,000-mile border.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the stream of migrants trampling through private
property on their cross-border dash, a small group of Arizona
ranchers has taken to rounding them up at gunpoint and holding them
until authorities arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have publicly denounced such activity as
``migrant hunting'' and complained formally to Washington. Over the
last several weeks, Mexico has also reassigned dozens of federal
police as agents of the new Mexican Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with patrol cars and uniforms, the officers will be
responsible for searching for and detaining smugglers, criminals
who assault migrants, and non-Mexican citizens trying to cross
illegally into the US. Critics, like Solis, say the organization is
a poor imitation of its US counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   The officers will work closely with Grupo Beta, a Mexican
migrant assistance group made up of police from local, state, and
federal agencies whose job is to warn migrants of the dangers of
crossing. By law, however, it cannot detain them.
</P>
<P>
   The Matamoros sector of Grupo Beta came under intense criticism
when it emerged that the two agents who tried to rescue Sandoval
and Ramirez didn't know how to swim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work so hard to help migrants with food, medicine or even
rides home if they decide not to cross,'' said Maria de la Paz
Reyes, the sector director, during her daily 30-mile sweep along
the dusty banks of the Rio Grande in her four-wheel drive. ``Every
death is a setback for us. But we try to warn people: Be careful.
That river is a traitor for a lot of people.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Friday, Feb. 25, at 5 p.m., there wasn't a single
narcotics officer on the streets of Harlem. Everyone was being held
inside on standby in case of a race riot. The Amadou Diallo verdict
was about to come down.
</P>
<P>
   On East 107th Street, at the police headquarters for Harlem
narcotics, cops gathered around several televisions to watch the
verdict, a couple of hundred plainclothes officers in two big
rooms, maybe a third of them black and Hispanic. They appeared from
interviews to be split racially, much as people had been by the
O.J. Simpson case.
</P>
<P>
   The whites _ officers like Sgt. Maria Brogli and Detectives Lee
Macklowe and John Montes _ hoped the four Diallo officers would be
found not guilty. The blacks _ detectives like Johnny Gonzalez and
the undercovers Derrick and Rob _ felt they should be found guilty
on at least some counts. ``Forty-one shots,'' said Derrick.
``That's excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Feelings ran deep. No case in recent years has hit the police
closer to home. As Brogli said, ``There but for the grace of God .
. .'' Every officer with any sense, white or black, fears
mistakenly shooting an unarmed man like Amadou Diallo. Talk about
jamming up a career.
</P>
<P>
   All eight members of Brogli's narcotics team have stories about
almost squeezing the trigger. In Gonzalez's case, he remembers
running after a drug dealer, on 143rd Street, and as he got close,
the man dropped to the ground and with his back to Gonzalez,
reached into his waistband. . In a split second, the detective had
to decide: shoot, or jump him and risk being shot. He risked it.
This time, the dealer was reaching in to dump his drugs before
being arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost shot an unarmed man in the back,'' said Gonzalez.
``It would've been the end of my career. I would have been like the
Diallo cops.''
</P>
<P>
   But dark-skinned plainclothes officers have a second, more
chilling fear: that someday, a white officer will accidentally
shoot them. And that, they said, made them view the Diallo case
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, before going undercover, Derrick recalls
being in street clothes, on his way to work at the 63rd Precinct in
Brooklyn, when he saw an elderly woman being robbed by two
teen-agers. He managed to get the woman into his car, subdue the
attackers and persuade a passer-by to call 911 _ an effort that
would win him a hero's medal. But as he waited for backup, he was
scared. Most officers at the 63rd were away at a funeral that day.
He feared that the officers who came would not know him, and that
he would be in danger _ a black man in street clothes with a gun.
Seeing a patrol car approach, he waved his police ID over his head
and kept screaming: ``I'm a cop! I'm a cop!''
</P>
<P>
   Race colors everything for Harlem narcotics detectives. It lies
just beneath the surface in an argument over tactics between a
white sergeant and a black undercover detective. Race is out there
in the neighborhood where Brogli's team pits African-American
informers against Dominican drug dealers. Race is in the police
radio descriptions (``suspect is a dark-skinned Dominican, mid-20s
...''), and race amplifies the anger on the street when the police
drive up and arrest yet another dark-skinned man.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest police race case in New York City in years, Diallo _
the 1998 killing of a black man by four panicky white policemen _
touched every Harlem narcotics officer in the room that day to the
core. And yet Brogli's team had never discussed it. Cops do not
discuss race. It's too risky. They need to get along.
</P>
<P>
   As the Diallo verdict was read charge by charge that rainy
February evening and it became evident that the four officers would
be cleared on every count, Brogli was so delighted she felt almost
as if she had been personally exonerated, and Derrick was so bitter
he could not stop pacing. But despite the enormous emotion of the
moment, there was barely a sound in the room.
</P>
<P>
   WORKING A BROWN NEIGHBORHOOD
</P>
<P>
   When Brogli sees a dozen brown-skinned Dominican men standing on
the corner of 141st Street and Broadway in Harlem, immediately she
thinks, ``Drug dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most are involved in drugs, probably,'' says Brogli, 38.
``That's the best assumption I can make.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though she is a 5-foot-tall woman dressed in everyday
clothes and driving an ordinary van, the moment they see her, they
give the warning whistle that means ``cops on the block, 5-0,
policia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``La Terrible,'' they whisper as she approaches. ``La Bruja''
(``the Witch'').
</P>
<P>
   The very visible, white Brogli could not do her work without her
undercover detectives, whose dark skin renders them invisible on
these streets.
</P>
<P>
   For five years Detective Johnny Gonzalez, himself
Dominican-American, was an undercover for Brogli, posing as a drug
user, a brown man disappearing into a brown neighborhood. He'd buy
the drugs, leave the scene, radio in a description of the dealer,
and then Brogli and her team of mainly white investigators would
speed their vans up the street and grab that one man from the dozen
on the corner.
</P>
<P>
   So deft is the whole thing when done properly that dealers don't
have a clue as to which person they sold to was the undercover cop.
Often they don't figure it out until months later, when they go to
trial and the undercover is there on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   Smart cops like Brogli and Gonzalez know how to use race wisely,
how to turn race to their advantage to enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, Gonzalez _ nicknamed Johnny G. _ returned over
and over to the same five blocks, 140th to 145th Streets, sometimes
making $5 ``nick'' buys, sometimes buying thousands of dollars in
cocaine, and never was he found out. Among Harlem drug cops he is a
legend, an easygoing, jokey, charming, streetwise man who,
occasionally, when things went wrong, got in fistfights with
dealers but took pride in never having used his gun.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers loved Johnny G. They invited him into their apartments,
they kidded with him, their mothers fed him, their girlfriends
flirted with him and, most important, they trusted him, enough to
sell him their drugs _ more than 500 buys, hundreds of arrests,
hundreds of guilty pleas and convictions.
</P>
<P>
   RACIAL PROFILING
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is Dominican, but when he sees those young Dominican
men on that corner, he has the same reaction as Brogli: ``90
percent are working in drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he insists, he does not stoop to racial profiling. He
would not go cold into a corner full of black and brown men and try
to make a buy, he says, unless his investigators had gathered
evidence that a specific dealer was operating there. They should be
able to tell him whether the dealer is selling in grams or ounces,
crack, coke or heroin, whether it is powdery or shiny ``fish
scale,'' whether the brand name is New World Order or Bazooka, so
he knows what to ask for.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Gonzalez draws the line between good police work
and racial profiling. ``It's insulting to walk up to a guy just
because he's black or Dominican standing on a corner and say,
`Who's working?''' That is the distinction he makes between using
race fairly and misusing race.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At times, he says, white sergeants have told him, ``Go over to
that group of Domos and see who's working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say no to a direct order,'' Gonzalez said. ``You
just go up, walk past and tell the sergeant nothing's going on.'' A
dozen black and Hispanic undercovers working with him in Harlem
said in interviews that they had defied a sergeant's orders in the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   Dark-skinned undercovers are touchy about racial profiling
because most, including Gonzalez, say that when they have been off
duty, in their neighborhoods or out driving, they have been the
targets of white officers.
</P>
<P>
   One undercover, Tyrone, says that while driving home from the
job in Harlem to Brooklyn he gets stopped an average of one night a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Among black and Hispanic undercovers, Brogli is a favorite, the
rare white sergeant with a reputation for listening to undercovers
and speaking up for them. . Working with Brogli for seven years _
first as an undercover and for the last two years as an
investigator _ Gonzalez says has learned there are harder things
than being a black policeman. ``Females on the job have it worse,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks it is what makes Brogli a fairer boss than most
whites; a female officer knows what it's like being in the
minority.
</P>
<P>
   A TRAINED EYE SEES BLUE
</P>
<P>
   Maria Brogli is no bleeding heart. She is an aggressive
Italian-American cop who has tackled men resisting arrest and
slammed others against walls, who has been kicked and punched, had
her nose broken and a flowerpot dropped on her head, and still got
the collar. She thinks race is overblown as a police problem, but
will not watch ``The Sopranos,'' the television series on the
Mafia, because she feels it is biased against Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Going up cold to blacks on a corner doesn't bother her because
it's racial profiling. It bothers her because it's lazy and risky.
</P>
<P>
   And she cannot abide laziness. In recent years, her team has
ranked first or second, among the 45 units working northern
Manhattan, for felony arrests, search warrants, drugs confiscated.
While most sergeants are satisfied doing buy and busts, twice she
has undertaken complex yearlong investigations that involved
extensive wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about dealing with race on the job, Brogli says, ``I
don't see black and white, I see blue.''
</P>
<P>
   A RACIAL CHAMELEON
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Johnny Gonzalez was raised to be an undercover. He
grew up in a working-class Dominican family in Brownsville, a tough
African-American section of Brooklyn where he would see Mike Tyson
and Riddick Bowe on the streets. He attended PS 41, a black school,
then went to IS 302, a Puerto Rican school, where his Spanish
helped. ``If you met me when I was in elementary school, you'd
assume I was black,'' he says. ``But with Puerto Rican kids I
became Puerto Rican.''
</P>
<P>
   When he began dating Sonia, a Puerto Rican woman who is now his
wife, her dad was nice until he realized this new boyfriend was
Dominican. ``Dad would not answer the door,'' Sonia said. ``My
father used to say, `He's a Dominican man, they don't know how to
treat Spanish women right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sonia, who is also a cop, says her co-workers assume that Johnny
is black. Sometimes even she teases him, ``Johnny, what are you
anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   He applied in 1987, but failed the department's psychological
test. At the time the test was being challenged in court as biased
against minorities; under an appeals procedure, he was allowed to
see a nondepartmental psychologist, and was approved after a
two-year delay.
</P>
<P>
   The first whites he and his wife knew well were cops. A few
years ago, he moved to Long Island for the schools; it took the
family time to adjust. ``There was a blond boy Jimmy across the
street,'' Gonzalez recalled. ``When my son Mark saw him, he said,
`Dad, what's wrong with him? He doesn't have any color.'''
</P>
<P>
   MORE RISKS, MORE OF THE TIME
</P>
<P>
   When Brogli needed a new undercover, she was handed photos of
two black officers she had never met and picked one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the NBA draft,'' said Rob, a black undercover, who
has been traded among narcotics teams a few times. ``They say,
`Grab him, he's a big black body.''' There is a logic to it _ the
poorest neighborhoods tend to be black or Hispanic and often have
the biggest street narcotics problems. A minority is less
conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   But it means that from Day 1, when a team is assembled, race
enters the room. Narcotics headquarters looks as racially divided
as a school cafeteria. The undercovers sit together. In their free
time they play backgammon. They tend to be younger and city-bred;
many own motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs they do are different, and that sets them apart, too.
Most police work can be dangerous, but day in and day out,
undercovers take more risks. Gonzalez has been locked in a dealer's
apartment with a gun to his head; his jaw has been broken; he has
been accused of being a cop several times by dealers and has had to
lie his way out of booby-trapped apartments. Often, he has worked
without a gun.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, to protect their identities, undercovers are
excused from the daily duties that make police work miserable. They
do not have to transport sick, angry or foul-smelling prisoners
(``stinkies'') to jail; execute search warrants; or do crowd
control at events like the Diallo protests. They are not allowed to
have their full names or photographs used in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   While other cops do grunt jobs, undercovers play backgammon.
Resentment builds. Race isn't mentioned, but it's there. Returning
from executing a tedious search warrant, Macklowe, a white Jewish
detective, noticed an undercover's car parked in the lot. ``How do
these kids afford BMWs?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez would not let the comment pass. ``They live at home,''
he said. ``They're not carrying a big mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a constant gripe among undercovers that they get pushed
for more buys by white bosses seeking more overtime to pay off
their heavily mortgaged houses in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups of officers do not always communicate well.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, this is how it's going to work,'' said Sgt. Joe Simonetti
one day last summer, outlining a series of buy and busts. He told
Nelson, who had been working as an undercover less than a year, to
make two buys: a $10 crack buy and a $300 cocaine buy. Several
veteran undercovers winced. To do a $10 buy, you dress down, like a
crackhead; for the other buy, you need to look groomed, moneyed.
You can't be both at once.
</P>
<P>
   When Simonetti had finished giving orders, several from Brogli's
team working backup, including Gonzalez, put on bulletproof vests,
then piled into the elevator to head out. Just before the door
closed, Nelson rushed up. Gonzalez could see fear in the young
undercover's eyes. ``He wants me to do both,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's crazy,'' said Gonzalez. ``It's your call. You have to
know what's safe and watch out for yourself.'' As the elevator door
shut, Nelson knew what to do.

$1.1 MILLION ALLOCATED TO RENOVATE LINCOLN COTTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER WALSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The rundown summer cottage where President Lincoln
wrote a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation was declared a
national monument Friday by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Anderson Cottage, relatively unknown and tucked away in
the northwest corner of the city, Clinton made use of the
Antiquities Act to designate the 158-year-old landmark the
President Lincoln and Soldiers' Home National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year more than a million people visited Ford's Theater
alone, but barely 100 made it here to Anderson Cottage, where
Lincoln lived and worked,'' said Clinton. ``In some ways, this
cottage behind me is the most important, as well as the least
known, Lincoln site in the entire United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said $1.1 million has been raised for the renovations,
including a $750,000 matching funds grant from Save America's
Treasures, a public-private partnership between the White House
Millennium Council and the National Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cottage in its way is just as precious as a giant
sequoia, as irreplaceable as the ruins of cultures long past, and
it is our profound obligation to preserve and protect it for future
generations,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes less than two weeks after the National
Trust for Historic Preservation put the cottage at the top of this
year's list of historical sites in danger of demolition or
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Moe, president of the National Trust, said, ``At a time
when understanding of American history is at an abysmal level, we
need sites like this more than ever to convey an appreciation of
how we got to be the nation we are.''
</P>
<P>
   As Civil War battles loomed, the hilltop cottage essentially
served as Lincoln's Camp David, where he would retreat from the
heat of the city and the stress of day-to-day operations. The
cottage, built in 1842, was located on the grounds of what was
known then as the Soldiers' Home, the first home for disabled
veterans of the US Army.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-room Gothic revival cottage, where Lincoln spent about a
quarter of his presidency, is in desperate need of renovation with
water damage, rotting wooden window frames, and aging electrical
and plumbing systems. Restoration is expected to start next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to preserving Lincoln's retreat, Clinton announced
another $15 million in grants from Save America's Treasures for
preserving 47 historic sites and collections nationwide, including
the USS Missouri, where the Japanese formally surrendered to end
World War II, and Babe Ruth's scrapbooks at the National Baseball
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts sites to receive grants include the Orchard House,
the family home of author Louisa May Alcott in Concord; the
Colonial Theater in Pittsfield; and the American Antiquarian
Society Library in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   Refurnishing the 14-room cottage may be difficult since Lincoln
would move the family's belongings to the summer home in May and
take them back to the White House in November, said Nick Minecci,
spokesman for the cottage and an amateur historian who has done
extensive research on Lincoln's stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Office furniture and equipment for the public affairs department
of the soldiers' home now occupy many of the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first president to visit the site since
President Chester A. Arthur more than 100 years ago. Presidents
Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B.
Hayes also used the cottage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tour Friday was reminiscent of the summer days between
1862 and 1864 when Lincoln roamed the grounds just three miles away
from the White House. Clinton walked the same staircase that
Lincoln would take to retreat to the corner bedroom where he
drafted the famous proclamation that ended slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can still feel that spirit strongly in the room in this
cottage where he worked,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also stood in the cool shade under the copper
beech tree where Lincoln would spend time playing with his son,
reading, or writing correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it is three centuries old, it is our last living link
to Abraham Lincoln,'' Clinton said of the tree.

   SAME SHOW, Nth PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   Narcotics enforcement is a frustrating cat-and-mouse game
between officers and dealers who, after years of crackdowns, are
savvy about dividing and concealing each step of the operation.
Rarely do the police get the drugs, the money and the dealer
together. Repeatedly Brogli's team arrests dealers and, the next
day, standing in that very spot, there is someone else _ or even
the same person.
</P>
<P>
   On these streets, dark-skinned man are often stopped,
questioned, then let go. On May 4, Simonetti's team searched 601 W.
141st St., Apartment 41. As several officers entered the apartment,
others detained 15 men standing on the nearby corner of 141st and
Broadway. Inside the apartment, the cops reported a rare trifecta:
they seized 1.5 kilos of cocaine and about $3,000, and arrested an
18-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   Outside on the street, the police lined up the detained men
against a wall to see if any had keys to Apartment 41. Sometimes
this works; a few weeks before, on the same block, they caught two
dealers this way. This time no one had a matching key. One man had
a small amount of coke and was arrested; a second had $2,000 in
cash and a Kenwood two-way radio. There was another Kenwood inside
the apartment, but the frequency didn't match. He and the other 14
were let go after half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   As the police searched the men, a mainly Dominican crowd
gathered, joking with the cops. Pointing at the men on the corner,
a young woman called out, ``Why are you bothering them? They're
just working,'' and the crowd and cops shared a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But public reaction makes sometimes narcotics officers feel
bitter, as if it were the 1920s and they were reliving Prohibition.
``Everyone sees this is a joke,'' said Jason, an undercover. ``They
know we ain't putting no dent in drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. James Byrne, who oversees Brogli's team, says the only
answer is legalizing drugs. ``In my humble opinion, we're doing
nothing up here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD
</P>
<P>
   It's supposedly common knowledge: black New Yorkers distrust the
police. But on the streets where Brogli works, the police's biggest
supporters are African-American. In the last 15 years, this
neighborhood may have changed from primarily African-American to
Dominican, but the citizens council that meets monthly at the local
precinct, the 30th, dominated by African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   At council meetings it is mainly black residents who attend to
ask for  &UR; more &LR;  police enforcement,  &UR; more &LR;  drug arrests, who want
 &UR; more &LR;  people jailed for loitering and trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   Detective John Montes, a Hispanic cop who walked a beat for two
years before joining Brogli's team, says his best informers here
were black. On these streets, the African-Americans are frequently
the older, better-established families, who moved here in the
1950s. Many are middle-class government workers, small-business
owners and professionals, and often they are resentful that Spanish
is now the primary language spoken in the Broadway shops; that
able-bodied Dominican men line the sidewalks all hours of the day;
and that the police consider the neighborhood drug trade,
controlled by Dominicans, the worst in the city.
</P>
<P>
   At a 30th Precinct meeting, an African-American homeowner asked
that the police do loitering sweeps, calling in the National Guard
if necessary. The woman, a single professional with a master's
degree, complained in an interview about the Dominicans: ``They
hang out on the corners _ they have so many children. When I go
into one of their stores, I try to line up to buy something the
American way, but it's all chaos, the Dominican customers all
milling, they don't know how to go in order.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dozen interviews in their homes, African-Americans
complained about Dominicans ruining the neighborhood, sounding very
much like the Jews and Italians who once dominated this area and
began leaving 40 years ago, complaining about the blacks moving in.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at headquarters has a racial or ethnic identity and
gets needled about it. But the one slur rarely spoken is
``nigger.'' In a year's time, a reporter did not hear it. Whether
that was because, as Brogli says, this generation has been
conditioned against it, or because, as Derrick, a black undercover,
says, racial animosity still runs too deep to joke about the word,
it seemed off limits.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in these streets where most people arrested
for drugs are Dominican, it's open season on ``Domos.'' Many are
from poor, rural parts of their Caribbean island, where
record-keeping isn't precise, and officers making arrests jokingly
wonder if the Domo will know his birth date.
</P>
<P>
   OUT WITH PREJUDICE
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when Gonzalez was on uniformed housing patrol in Red
Hook, Brooklyn, white officers couldn't tell what he was by looking
at him and were guarded until reading his name tag. ``Then they'd
say, `Oh, you're Gonzalez _ these blacks, aren't they like animals
with all their kids?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm in a Dominican neighborhood,'' he said. ``I'll hear
some sergeant, not knowing I'm around, talking about Domos this,
Domos that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a white cop ask me, `How many in your family are drug
dealers?''' said Gonzalez, who doesn't drink alcohol. ``I told him,
in my family, nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   If the police can be too quick to label, Gonzalez says, they are
only reflecting society.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm afternoon, dressed as usual in plain clothes, he met
downtown with a prosecutor about a case, then stopped in a deli
near Chinatown for an iced tea. One sip and he nearly spit it out.
He knew immediately it was the extra-sweet tea that heroin addicts
on methadone often crave. ``Sorry,'' said the Asian woman behind
the counter, exchanging the drink. ``This is junkie iced tea.''
</P>
<P>
   An honest mistake? Or had she assumed he was a junkie from a
nearby methadone clinic because he is brown-skinned?
</P>
<P>
   You could go crazy trying to get to the bottom of every slight,
says Gonzalez, and he doesn't bother. He is an upbeat family man.
His view of the narcotics officers he deals with each day:
``There's not that much prejudice in the room.''

 &HT;    Latinos cooling toward governor, want results
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Expectations were high in parts of the Latino
community six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Four people appointed by Gov. Roy Barnes were recommending
changes to state laws and policies to help Georgia's growing Latino
population. They held a news conference to give their report to the
governor, but his staff said Barnes was too busy to attend.
</P>
<P>
   His absence frustrated some Latinos. Now some Hispanics are more
frustrated because not much has become of recommendations made by
the Latino Forum that Barnes appointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very disappointed. They are saying `Like always,
they tell us something but nothing is done,' '' said Teodoro Maus,
the Mexican consul general for Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   It's a different story in North Carolina, another state with a
fast-growing Hispanic population where thousands of Latinos work in
construction, poultry, agriculture and hotels and restaurants as
they do in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of Georgia's Hispanic population range from 220,000 to
480,000. The U.S. Census Bureau says the state's Hispanic
population increased 102 percent from 1990-98. North Carolina's
Hispanic population went up 110 percent in that time.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hunt of North Carolina, a conservative Democrat like
Barnes, was instrumental in 1998 in creating a state office for
Latino issues and an advisory council of 15 Hispanic community
leaders and 10 top state officials, such as the commissioner of the
division of motor vehicles and the superintendent of public
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   The community leaders and state officials meet every two months
and meet with the governor once a year, said H. Nolo Martinez,
director of the Office of Hispanic/Latino Affairs, part of the
governor's office. He said council meetings have provided ``an
amazing opportunity for us to do things quickly.'' Martinez's
office has arranged Spanish classes for about a dozen members of
the governor's staff and helped set up a bilingual hotline during
Hurricane Floyd last year. It also lobbied successfully to persuade
legislators to change a law requiring people to show a Social
Security number to get married.
</P>
<P>
   Also, meetings with Latino leaders and state officials before
Hunt created the council prompted North Carolina to let illegal
immigrants get driver's licenses, something Georgia's Latino Forum
has suggested here. Applicants for a Georgia license have had to
show proof of U.S. citizenship or legal residency since 1994, but
Latino advocates say licensing illegal immigrants would teach them
the rules of the road and let them buy auto insurance. Opponents
say illegal immigrants could use a license to access other
services.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes does not support giving driver's licenses to illegal
immigrants, said Howard Mead, a spokesman. ``If someone is in the
United States illegally, they should not be able to get a driver's
license,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver's license issue _ and an arrangement like the one in
North Carolina _ is what Winston Garcia had in mind last month when
his Spanish-language newspaper, Nuestro Semanario (Our Weekly), ran
an editorial saying, ``the time has come for Gov. Barnes to
implement the proposals'' of the Latino Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia remembers the day the forum delivered its report. During
the news conference on the steps of the state Capitol, he asked
members of the forum what would happen if they deliver the report
and nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer was `That's a good question,' '' Garcia said.
``Perhaps it was a good question, but I'm still waiting for the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Latino Forum and a spokeswoman for the governor
say changes are on the way. Among them: Barnes plans to create a
permanent council to advise him on Hispanic issues _ something the
forum recommended.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly a priority for him,'' said Joseyln Butler,
spokeswoman for Barnes. ``It is one of a number of important issues
to which he is now able to turn his attention.'' She said he hasn't
decided whether to push for it as a state office or an advisory
council.
</P>
<P>
   At least 21 states and Washington D.C. have created offices or
councils dedicated to Hispanic issues. In six of the states,
according to the census, Hispanics make up a lower percentage of
the state population than in Georgia _ Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota,
North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Latino leaders plan to meet with state
legislators this fall, said Sam Zamarripa, a businessman who was on
the Latino Forum and is chairman of metro Atlanta's Latin American
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to find legislators willing to introduce bills to
make some of the forum's proposals a reality. ``I think that we
will have a legislative group organized this year,'' he said. ``Am
I hopeful? You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Maus has met with the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney
general and other top officials since the forum's report, but said
he is frustrated that nothing concrete has happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking to people, they're all very sensitive,
they're all very concerned,'' he said, but ``you go away, and
basically nothing happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Genie Pascual, chairwoman of the Latino Forum, said timing was
one reason the Legislature did not debate the forum's proposals.
The forum presented its report well into the legislative session.
The governor and legislators were consumed with Barnes' massive
education reform bill and other measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very hopeful that something will come out of it,'' she
said. ``Nothing happens very quickly in the government realm.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Friday, Feb. 25, at 5 p.m., there wasn't a single
narcotics officer on the streets of Harlem. Everyone was being held
inside on standby in case of a race riot. The Amadou Diallo verdict
was about to come down.
</P>
<P>
   On East 107th Street, at the police headquarters for Harlem
narcotics, cops gathered around several televisions to watch the
verdict, a couple of hundred plainclothes officers in two big
rooms, maybe a third of them black and Hispanic. They appeared from
interviews to be split racially, much as people had been by the
O.J. Simpson case. The whites _ officers like Sgt. Maria Brogli and
Detectives Lee Macklowe and John Montes _ hoped the four Diallo
officers would be found not guilty. The blacks _ detectives like
Johnny Gonzalez and the undercovers Derrick and Rob _ felt they
should be found guilty on at least some counts. ``Forty-one
shots,'' said Derrick. ``That's excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Feelings ran deep. No case in recent years has hit the police
closer to home. As Brogli said, ``There but for the grace of God .
. .'' Every officer with any sense, white or black, fears
mistakenly shooting an unarmed man like Amadou Diallo. Talk about
jamming up a career.
</P>
<P>
   All eight members of Brogli's narcotics team have stories about
almost squeezing the trigger. In Gonzalez's case, he remembers
running after a drug dealer, Earl Thomas, on 143rd Street, and as
he got close, the man dropped to the ground and with his back to
Gonzalez, reached into his waistband. ``MAN WITH A GUN!'' is what
flashed through Gonzalez's mind. In a split second, the detective
had to decide: shoot, or jump him and risk being shot. He risked
it. This time, Thomas was reaching in to dump his drugs before
being arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost shot an unarmed man in the back,'' said Gonzalez.
``It would've been the end of my career. I would have been like the
Diallo cops.''
</P>
<P>
   But dark-skinned plainclothes officers have a second, more
chilling fear: that someday, a white officer will accidentally
shoot them. And that, they said, made them view the Diallo case
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, before going undercover, Derrick recalls
being in street clothes, on his way to work at the 63rd Precinct in
Brooklyn, when he saw an elderly woman being robbed by two
teen-agers. He managed to get the woman into his car, subdue the
attackers (though he had no handcuffs) and persuade a passer-by to
call 911 _ an effort that would win him a hero's medal. But as he
waited for backup, he was scared. Most officers at the 63rd were
away at a funeral that day. He feared that the officers who showed
up would not know him, and that he would be in danger _ a black man
in street clothes with a gun. Seeing a patrol car approach, he
waved his police ID over his head and kept screaming: ``I'm a cop!
I'm a cop!''
</P>
<P>
   Race colors everything for Harlem narcotics detectives. It lies
just beneath the surface in an argument over tactics between a
white sergeant and a black undercover detective. Race is out there
in the neighborhood where Brogli's team pits African-American
informers against Dominican drug dealers. Race is in the police
radio descriptions (``suspect is a dark-skinned Dominican, mid-20s
... ''), and race amplifies the anger on the street when the police
drive up and arrest yet another dark-skinned man.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest police race case in New York City in years, Diallo _
the 1998 killing of a black man by four panicky white policemen _
touched every Harlem narcotics officer in the room that day to the
core. And yet Brogli's team had never discussed it. Cops do not
discuss race. It's too risky. They need to get along.
</P>
<P>
   As the Diallo verdict was read charge by charge that rainy
February evening and it became evident that the four officers would
be cleared on every count, Brogli was so delighted she felt almost
as if she had been personally exonerated, and Derrick was so bitter
he could not stop pacing. But despite the enormous emotion of the
moment, there was barely a sound in the room.
</P>
<P>
   WORKING A BROWN NEIGHBORHOOD
</P>
<P>
   When Brogli sees a dozen brown-skinned Dominican men standing on
the corner of 141st Street and Broadway in Harlem, immediately she
thinks, ``Drug dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most are involved in drugs, probably,'' she says. ``That's the
best assumption I can make.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though she is a 5-foot-tall woman dressed in everyday
clothes and driving an ordinary van, the moment they see her, they
give the warning whistle that means ``cops on the block, 5-0,
policia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``La Terrible,'' they whisper as she approaches. ``La Bruja''
(``the Witch'').
</P>
<P>
   The very visible, white Brogli could not do her work without her
undercover detectives, whose dark skin renders them invisible on
these streets.
</P>
<P>
   For five years Detective Johnny Gonzalez, himself
Dominican-American, was an undercover for Brogli, posing as a drug
user, a brown man disappearing into a brown neighborhood. He'd buy
the drugs, leave the scene, radio in a description of the dealer,
and then Brogli and her team of mainly white investigators would
speed their vans up the street and grab that one man from the dozen
on the corner.
</P>
<P>
   So deft is the whole thing when done properly that dealers don't
have a clue as to which person they sold to was the undercover cop.
Often they don't figure it out until months later, when they go to
trial and the undercover is there on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I ask what you're taking me in for?'' a surprised Victor
Figueroa said when arrested during a buy-and-bust one evening in
May as he stood at 141st Street and Hamilton Place with $2,650 in
his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Brogli always has the same answer: ``You really don't know what
you did? You'll find out.''

GENERAL ACCUSED IN HIGH-RANKING HARASSMENT CASE RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case that spotlighted sexual harassment at the
highest ranks of the US military, a highly regarded general has
submitted his resignation after being accused of making improper
sexual advances on the Army's first three-star female general, the
Army announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Major General Larry G. Smith, who had been in line to become the
Army's deputy inspector general _ a role in which he would oversee
sexual harassment cases _ was given a written reprimand for conduct
unbecoming of an officer and for sexually harassing an officer. His
retirement is effective Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's inspector general said in a report released Friday
that Smith ``improperly displayed disrespect toward a commissioned
officer . . . by holding her and kissing her against her will.''
For the first time, the Army acknowledged publicly that it had
substantiated the claim made by Lieutenant General Claudia J.
Kennedy against Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The case, initiated after the Army announced Smith's appointment
last year and Kennedy informally expressed her reservations about
the promotion, followed a long line of sex scandals that made it
abundantly clear that sexual harassment was widespread in the armed
services.
</P>
<P>
   But punishment in past cases _ with one notable exception _ had
been criticized by women's rights groups as cursory or
non-existent. They included the groping of women at the Navy's 1991
Tailhook convention and charges that Army drill sergeants assaulted
female recruits at a training base in Aberdeen, Md., in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Major General David R. E. Hale retired after being the
target of a complaint by the wife of colonel who worked for him.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, in his first public comment on the matter, Friday denied
any wrongdoing. In a statement, he said, ``However, for the good of
my family and the Army, we have elected to put it behind us and
move on with our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also made her first public comment on the case, saying
she was ``satisfied with the Army's action. . . .As far as I'm
concerned, this matter is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army's treatment of Kennedy's accusation was being closely
watched by many of the 1.4 million people in the military _ men and
women alike. For many women, it showed that even those with high
rank are vulnerable to sexual advances. Kennedy, who retired from
her position last month after exactly 31 years of service, held a
higher rank than Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the system worked,'' said a female senior
officer in the Navy, who asked not to be identified. ``He was about
to be in charge of a sexual harassment panel and she was literally
dragged through the mud. But she did it because he was being put in
a position on an issue that she knew he did not have a moral
framework to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Navy officer said, ``I don't see it as an extra layer
of protection. This will be forever judged on a case-by-case basis.
There are still men getting away with it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Brigadier General Wilma L. Vaught, president
of the Women in Military Service Memorial Foundation, welcomed the
Army's report and predicted that ramifications of the case will be
felt throughout the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's becoming increasingly clear that sexual
misconduct is unacceptable,'' she said. ``It's unacceptable to both
men and women, and that those who err from the proper standards may
well be finding themselves facing investigation and potential
disciplinary action, as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army inspector general, Lieutenant General Michael W.
Ackerman, wrote in his report that Smith and Kennedy were in
``total disagreement'' about what happened in her office on that
day in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's version: He hugged Kennedy and possibly gave her a
``cheek kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's: Smith grabbed her, held her against her will, and
kissed her.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, Smith did not shy from defending
himself, providing a list of 52 character witnesses to testify on
his behalf. Ackerman's office interviewed seven of them.
</P>
<P>
   While Ackerman found that Smith was a ``highly respected officer
and gentleman with an unblemished career,'' he sided with Kennedy,
citing her credibility. The report noted that she had no motive for
making a false accusation.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, General John Keane, the vice chief of staff, gave
Smith an ``administrative memorandum of reprimand.'' He saw no
basis for a criminal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Flanders, who researched the role of women in the military
during the Gulf War, said the Kennedy-Smith case comes against a
backdrop of increasing pressure from Christian fundamentalist
groups and other socially conservative groups to limit women's role
in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the military to confirm what Kennedy is saying does fuel
the argument that . . . it's better to not have women in the
military at all, that they are all a big distraction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But women comprise 15 percent of the Army's 479,000 people, and
Flanders strongly doubted that the conservatives' push would yield
any step backward for the advancement of women in the military. ``I
think every time they do this type of investigation, it's a great
step forward for women in the military, and the women's movement as
a whole,'' she said.

 NEW YORK: find out.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smart cops like Brogli and Gonzalez know how to use race wisely,
how to turn race to their advantage to enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, Gonzalez _ nicknamed Johnny G. _ returned over
and over to the same five blocks, 140th to 145th Streets, sometimes
making $5 ``nick'' buys, sometimes buying thousands of dollars in
cocaine, and never was he found out. Among Harlem drug cops he is a
legend, an easygoing, jokey, charming, streetwise man who,
occasionally, when things went wrong, got in fistfights with
dealers but took pride in never having used his gun. Dealers loved
Johnny G. They invited him into their apartments, they kidded with
him, their mothers fed him, their girlfriends flirted with him and,
most important, they trusted him, enough to sell him their drugs _
more than 500 buys, hundreds of arrests, hundreds of guilty pleas
and convictions.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, Johnny G. used whatever he could to get an edge.
Usually he pretended to be African-American, acting as if he knew
only English. Then the Spanish-speaking dealers would talk openly
in front of him, sometimes spilling their secrets. But other times
he bought from Dominican dealers who hated blacks, who would make
blacks wait for their drugs, who would tell their steerers in
Spanish, ``Have all the monkeys stand over there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'd be Dominican,'' said Gonzalez. ``To get done
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   He was so smooth at switching it on and off, from Dominican to
African-American, from cop to cokehead, that at times his wife,
Sonia, would catch him slipping into a street character as he
played with their two little sons and would gently remind him,
``Johnny, you're home now, you're not working.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PERILS OF GOING IN COLD
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez may be Dominican, but when he sees those young
Dominican men on that corner, he has the same reaction as Brogli:
``90 percent are working in drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he insists, he does not stoop to racial profiling. He
would not go cold into a corner full of black and brown men and try
to make a buy, he says, unless his investigators had gathered
evidence that a specific dealer was operating there. They should be
able to tell him whether the dealer is selling in grams or ounces,
crack, coke or heroin, whether it is shiny ``fish scale'' or more
powdery, whether the brand name is New World Order or Bazooka, so
he knows what to ask for.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Gonzalez draws the line between good police work
and racial profiling. ``It's insulting to walk up to a guy just
because he's black or Dominican standing on a corner and say,
`Who's working?''' That is the distinction he makes between using
race fairly and misusing race.
</P>
<P>
   At times, he says, white sergeants have told him, ``Go over to
that group of Domos and see who's working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say no to a direct order,'' Gonzalez said. ``You
just go up, walk past and tell the sergeant nothing's going on.'' A
dozen black and Hispanic undercovers working with him in Harlem
said in interviews that they had defied a sergeant's orders in the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   Among these undercovers, Brogli is a favorite, the rare white
sergeant with a reputation for listening to undercovers and
speaking up for them. ``Maria has a mouth on her,'' says Rob, one
of her undercovers. On May 9, as the team put together a list of
buy-and-bust locations, a white investigator, Lee Macklowe, said he
had a tip that cocaine was being sold from a street-level window on
140th near Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just bang on the window,'' he said. But Brogli was upset. She
made him call his informer. ``Find out if they're selling nicks,
grams, dimes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the undercover making that buy, Nelson, quietly thanked
her. ``Way to go, Sarge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Going in cold increases the risk. Some narcotics officers,
including Brogli, suspect that is what may have gone wrong earlier
this year when Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed black man, was shot to
death during a buy-and-bust operation by an undercover detective
near Times Square. It may have been a case, they say, of a
narcotics team working late, one body short of the nightly quota of
five arrests, approaching a group of black men cold and having it
blow up in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Dark-skinned undercovers are touchy about racial profiling
because most, including Gonzalez, say that when they have been off
duty, in their neighborhoods or out driving, they have been the
targets of white officers.
</P>
<P>
   One undercover, Tyrone, says that while driving home from the
job in Harlem to Brooklyn he gets stopped an average of one night a
week. Two of Brogli's black undercovers, Derrick and Rob, describe
standing out front at Rob's home in Brooklyn after work, having a
beer, and being approached by a man who asked, ``Who's working?''
</P>
<P>
   Derrick and Rob didn't bother explaining to that plainclothes
cop that they, too, were cops. They just shook their heads and
waited until he left. ``You know it's because we're black,''
Derrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You develop thick skin,'' Gonzalez said. Besides, working with
Brogli for seven years _ first as an undercover and for the last
two years as an investigator _ he has learned there are harder
things than being a black policeman. ``Females on the job have it
worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks it is what makes Brogli a fairer boss than most
whites; a female officer knows what it's like being in the
minority.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he has been worried that she may be leaving narcotics
and he may be assigned a new sergeant. And in an office where the
top boss, the captain, changes every few months, where conditions
are so cheesy that officers have to bring in their own toilet paper
and lock it in their desks, your sergeant is often your only
protection.

 &HT;    Home Depot's Olympian employees take off running
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For years, Olympic contenders have been among the
folks at Home Depot pointing out which aisle holds the fertilizer
spikes or the roofing pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But those employees soon won't be at work, and the home supply
retailer will explain why in a TV commercial airing nationally on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot said the 30-second spot will feature eight of its
employee-athletes saying goodbye to their co-workers as they head
off to the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   And while the scenes _ filmed in May at a Home Depot store in
New York _ are staged, the theme is not, said Dick Hammill, Home
Depot senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going on in some way, shape or form all over the
country,'' said Hammill, as athletes leave Home Depot stores for
training or qualifying trials. ``We've got 20 athletes today who
have already made their teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot has been an Olympic sponsor since 1992, along with
other locally-based sponsors Coca-Cola and United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot has hired U.S. Olympic hopefuls since 1994 to provide
athletes with jobs and flexible schedules to allow for training and
competition. The company has employee-athletes working in similar
programs in Canada, Puerto Rico and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot currently employs 116 athletes who are training for
the Sydney Games or the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah,
more than any other U.S. company, Hammill said.
</P>
<P>
   That will be the subject of another television spot after the
current one ends in September, with the beginning of the Sydney
Games, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got other big plans for that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 200 athletes who have worked for Home Depot, 51
have qualified for Olympic national teams, 31 have won Olympic
medals and 16 have won gold medals, said Hammill.
</P>
<P>
   One of those athletes is 36-year-old Butch Reynolds, who still
gets a paycheck from Home Depot, even though he took leave from his
sales associate job in Home Depot's Lilburn store about four months
ago to train full-time for the 400-meter sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you ask for anything better than that?'' asked
Reynolds, who won gold and silver medals in the 1988 Olympics. He
heads to Sacramento on Monday for the U.S. trials in preparation
for his fourth Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tip my hat to the leadership at Home Depot,'' said Reynolds,
who is not featured in the commercial. ``They are the true and real
leadership of the Olympic movement.''

 NEW YORK: only protection.  
<TEXT>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A TRAINED EYE SEES BLUE
</P>
<P>
   Maria Brogli is no bleeding heart. She is an aggressive
Italian-American cop who has tackled men resisting arrest and
slammed others against walls, who has been kicked and punched, had
her nose broken and a flowerpot dropped on her head, and still got
the collar. She thinks race is overblown as a police problem, but
will not watch ``The Sopranos,'' the television series on the
Mafia, because she feels it is biased against Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Going up cold to blacks on a corner doesn't bother her because
it's racial profiling. It bothers her because it's lazy and risky.
</P>
<P>
   And she cannot abide laziness. In recent years, her team has
ranked first or second, among the 45 units working northern
Manhattan, for felony arrests, search warrants, drugs confiscated.
While most sergeants are satisfied doing buy and busts, twice she
has undertaken complex yearlong investigations that involved
extensive wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about dealing with race on the job, she says, ``I
don't see black and white, I see blue.'' But she is not blind about
blue. In the mid-1990s, during a scandal at the 30th Precinct, two
informers fed her tips on corrupt officers. She drove the informers
to the internal affairs office in Harlem, contributing to the
convictions of Officers George Nova and Alphonso Compres.
</P>
<P>
   She is a short, stocky, unglamorous 38-year-old woman who has
attained respect in a department dominated by white men. Her
lieutenant, James Byrne, likes to smoke a cigar in the van and
offer comments on young female passers-by. (``Wouldn't you like to
spoil that one?'' is a favorite.)
</P>
<P>
   She never expected to be a cop. After attending racially mixed
Bronx public schools and scoring 1400 on her SATs, she was pre-med
at New York University. But her father, a commercial photographer,
suffered a stroke, and she needed a job to support the family. She
applied in 1983. A requirement then was clearing a 5-foot wall _ no
easy task for a woman who  &UR; claims &LR;  to be 5 feet tall. She
practiced, she prayed to St. Anthony, but on the first of two tries
she failed. ``There was a tall black instructor,'' she recalled.
``He says: `What's the matter, munchkin? You can get over the wall.
When you're running, don't look at the wall, look beyond the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a pretty fair metaphor for her rise in the department.
As a rookie, she was repeatedly given the complaint room,
traditional duty for women, typing forms. Whenever possible, she
traded for patrol, working her way onto the streets. In 1990, after
passing the sergeant's test, she was sent to the 28th Precinct in
Harlem, hard duty for any white, let alone the first female
supervisor assigned there. As is the rule on the force, a separate
supervisor's locker room was provided, by moving a wall of lockers
to partition off a corner of the women's room for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear them laughing on the other side of the lockers
and you're alone,'' she recalls. She learned to bang her locker
when she entered, so cops on the other side knew she was no snoop.
</P>
<P>
   In narcotics she gets impressive numbers, in part because no one
puts in longer hours. A single woman living with her widowed
mother, she often stays past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   But her success also comes from pushing hard on the street. It
is because of officers like Brogli that men in this neighborhood
learn always to carry identification. Though there is no law saying
they must, they know if they don't, and are stopped, they can be
hauled into the precinct for a few hours, their names run through
the computer for outstanding warrants.
</P>
<P>
   On May 9, her team did a buy and bust at 141st Street and
Amsterdam Avenue, arresting Pedro Pereira and confiscating $1,374.
Standing on the same corner was Juan Payano, 30. He didn't have
drugs or much money. Nor did he have identification; he said he
couldn't remember his address.
</P>
<P>
   ``He don't know where he lives?'' Brogli asked. ``He's got no
ID?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's only been here 15 days and he's legal,'' said her
senior detective, Felix Berrios, interpreting the Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he know he can be arrested for no ID?'' said Brogli, who
kept him standing there about 10 minutes. ``Ask him if he wants to
go to jail.'' He didn't. ``Ask him where he lives again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Riverside between 136 and 137.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he going to learn the building number now?'' Brogli asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Later the sergeant said: ``I wanted to see if he changed his
story and got nervous and blurted anything out. I think he's lying
through his teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   A RACIAL CHAMELEON
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Johnny Gonzalez was raised to be an undercover. He
grew up in a working-class Dominican family (his dad was a welder,
his mother a beautician), in Brownsville, a tough African-American
section of Brooklyn where he would see Mike Tyson and Riddick Bowe
on the streets. He attended PS 41, a black school, then went to IS
302, a Puerto Rican school, where his Spanish helped. ``If you met
me when I was in elementary school, you'd assume I was black,'' he
says. ``But with Puerto Rican kids I became Puerto Rican.''
</P>
<P>
   When he began dating Sonia, who is Puerto Rican, her dad was
nice until he realized this new boyfriend was Dominican. ``Dad
would not answer the door,'' Sonia said. ``My father used to say,
`He's a Dominican man, they don't know how to treat Spanish women
right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sonia, who is also a cop, says her co-workers assume that Johnny
is black. Sometimes even she teases him, ``Johnny, what are you
anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   He applied in 1987, but failed the department's psychological
test. At the time the test was being challenged in court as biased
against minorities; under an appeals procedure, he was allowed to
see a nondepartmental psychologist, and was approved after a
two-year delay.
</P>
<P>
   The first whites he and his wife knew well were cops. A few
years ago, he moved to Long Island for the schools; it took the
family time to adjust. ``There was a blond boy Jimmy across the
street,'' Gonzalez recalled. ``When my son Mark saw him, he said,
`Dad, what's wrong with him? He doesn't have any color.'''

   MORE RISKS, MORE OF THE TIME
</P>
<P>
   When Brogli needed a new undercover, she was handed photos of
two black officers she had never met and picked one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the NBA draft,'' said Rob, a black undercover, who
has been traded among narcotics teams a few times. ``They say,
`Grab him, he's a big black body.''' There is a logic to it _ the
poorest neighborhoods tend to be black or Hispanic and often have
the biggest street narcotics problems. A minority is less
conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   But it means that from Day 1, when a team is assembled, race
enters the room. Narcotics headquarters looks as racially divided
as a school cafeteria. The undercovers sit together. In their free
time they play backgammon. They tend to be younger and city-bred;
many own motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs they do are different, and that sets them apart, too.
Most police work can be dangerous, but day in and day out,
undercovers take more risks. Gonzalez has been locked in a dealer's
apartment with a gun to his head; his jaw has been broken; he has
been accused of being a cop several times by dealers and has had to
lie his way out of booby-trapped apartments. Often, he has worked
without a gun.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, to protect their identities, undercovers are
excused from the daily duties that make police work miserable. They
do not have to transport sick, angry or foul-smelling prisoners
(``stinkies'') to jail; execute search warrants; or do crowd
control at events like the Diallo protests. They are not allowed to
have their full names or photographs used in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   While other cops do grunt jobs, undercovers play backgammon.
Resentment builds. Race isn't mentioned, but it's there. Returning
from executing a tedious search warrant, Macklowe noticed an
undercover's car parked in the lot. ``How do these kids afford
BMWs?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez would not let the comment pass. ``They live at home,''
he said. ``They're not carrying a big mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is a constant gripe among undercovers that they get
pushed for more buys by white bosses seeking more overtime to pay
off their heavily mortgaged houses out by Exit 68 on the Long
Island Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups of officers do not always communicate well.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, this is how it's going to work,'' said Sgt. Joe Simonetti
one day last summer, outlining a series of buy and busts. He told
Nelson, who had been working as an undercover less than a year, to
make two buys: a $10 crack buy and a $300 cocaine buy. Several
veteran undercovers winced. To do a $10 buy, you dress down, like a
crackhead; for the other buy, you need to look groomed, moneyed.
You can't be both at once.
</P>
<P>
   When Simonetti had finished giving orders, several from Brogli's
team working backup, including Gonzalez, put on bulletproof vests,
then piled into the elevator to head out. Just before the door
closed, Nelson rushed up. Gonzalez could see fear in the young
undercover's eyes. ``He wants me to do both,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's crazy,'' said Gonzalez. ``It's your call. You have to
know what's safe and watch out for yourself.'' As the elevator door
shut, Nelson knew what to do.
</P>
<P>
   SAME SHOW, Nth PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   Narcotics enforcement is a frustrating cat-and-mouse game
between officers and dealers who, after years of crackdowns, are
savvy about dividing and concealing each step of the operation.
Rarely do the police get the drugs, the money and the dealer
together. Repeatedly Brogli's team arrests dealers and, the next
day, standing in that very spot, there is someone else _ or even
the same person.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 12, they executed a search warrant at the basement
apartments at 605 W. 141st St., where some tenants are so poor they
live in luggage storage bins. In the room of Ramon Ortiz, the
superintendent, Detective Rob Arbuiso found drug paraphernalia,
including a scale; 100 plastic sandwich bags commonly used to
package cocaine; and $132,750 in cash. The money was confiscated as
drug profits. Ortiz was notified that he could reclaim it if he
proved he had earned it legitimately; he never has. But they found
no drugs, and Ortiz was quickly back on the street.
</P>
<P>
   His misdemeanor charge on paraphernalia possession is still
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, they searched in the same building, hitting
Apartment 21, which was leased to an elderly woman who had recently
had a liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to knock instead of banging down the door,''
Simonetti said. ``We don't want to give her a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, near a painting of the Virgin Mary, were two bedrooms
that she sublet, both equipped with locks. In one room was a
sleeping Dominican, who was forced into the hall in his underwear,
cuffed and questioned. He told Gonzalez he had no idea who lived in
the other bedroom, had never seen anyone going or coming. In that
second bedroom officers found a plastic bag containing about
$60,000 worth of cocaine. The old woman with the new liver said she
had never seen anyone go in or out of that room and that neither
she nor the man in his underpants had a key for it.
</P>
<P>
   As Byrne mulled over whom to arrest, a man rushed up the stairs.
He said that his name was Alberto Rivera Jr., and that he was the
old woman's son.
</P>
<P>
   At first he said he lived there; when he heard why the police
were there, he said he didn't. Gonzalez asked if Rivera had an ID,
and before he knew it, Rivera was reaching into his pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't do that until I tell . . . '' began Detective Gonzalez,
but it was too late. Rivera was pointing a dark brown  &UR; wallet &LR;  at
the detective, who started, then relaxed. ``Don't be making any
fast moves like that,'' the officer sighed.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the lieutenant compromised. He said he doubted that
charges against the old woman would stick and didn't want her
dropping dead in the prisoner van; he was suspicious of the son but
had nothing. So he decided on the man in underpants. ``We don't
want to be embarrassed going into the neighborhood and coming out
with no one,'' the lieutenant said. ``This sends a message.'' They
would take him to the precinct, check for outstanding warrants, and
then, if he was clean, let him go. All of which they did.
</P>
<P>
   To cops, who often feel they're in a losing battle against the
dealers, it's a way to apply some leverage, maybe persuade someone
to inform; in the neighborhoods, it smacks of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   On these streets, dark-skinned man are often stopped,
questioned, then let go. On May 4, Simonetti's team searched 601 W.
141st St., Apartment 41. As several officers entered the apartment,
others detained 15 men standing on the nearby corner of 141st and
Broadway. Inside the apartment, the cops reported a rare trifecta:
they seized 1.5 kilos of cocaine and about $3,000, and arrested
18-year-old Jorge Rodriguez (who has since fled and is being sought
on a bench warrant).

 &HT;    EarthLink jumps ship from Pricewaterhouse to Ernst &AMP; Young
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ EarthLink Inc., the second-largest Internet service
provider in the country, dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers as its
independent accountant June 29, according to a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company hired Ernst &AMP; Young as its new
accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   According to the filing, EarthLink's audit committee and board
of directors recommended the dismissal of Pricewaterhouse. No
reason was given for the change.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Pricewaterhouse audited its financial reports
for fiscal years 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In the filing, EarthLink said there were no disagreements with
Pricewaterhouse on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the SEC filed in an exhibit, Pricewaterhouse
agreed with those statements made by EarthLink.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the change in accounting firms was related to the
merger of EarthLink Networks and MindSpring Enterprises, which took
place in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old MindSpring used Arthur Andersen and the old EarthLink
used PWC,'' said EarthLink President Michael McQuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we decided to do a review from scratch and the winner was
Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chief financial officer, Lee Adrean, had a relationship
with them in the past and he felt comfortable using them so that's
who we went with,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Outside on the street, the police lined up the detained men
against a wall to see if any had keys to Apartment 41. Sometimes
this works; a few weeks before, on the same block, they caught two
dealers this way. This time no one had a matching key. One man had
a small amount of coke and was arrested; a second had $2,000 in
cash and a Kenwood two-way radio. There was another Kenwood inside
the apartment, but the frequency didn't match. He and the other 14
were let go after half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   As the police searched the men, a mainly Dominican crowd
gathered, joking with the cops. Pointing at the men on the corner,
a young woman called out, ``Why are you bothering them? They're
just working,'' and the crowd and cops shared a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But just as often, the crowd turns nasty. Last August, Flor Blum
was arrested for buying $35 of crack. When she realized she would
be handcuffed and put in the prisoner van, she began screaming. In
the back of the van, she hurled herself against the walls, slamming
her body against Gonzalez, and his partner, Detective Scott
Signorelli. ``Please let me go, let me get out of here!'' she
screamed. ``I'm phobic!''
</P>
<P>
   They tried to calm her, but she kept screaming. ``I need water!
I have AIDS, sir! I swear, I don't want to do this! It's only a job
to you. What do you care?'' She began hacking up phlegm, spitting
all over the back of the van. Gonzalez could not tell: Was she
high? Having an anxiety attack? Faking it? Might she go into
cardiac arrest? That could end a cop's career fast. They stopped
and bought her a bottle of Poland Spring water, but she continued
to scream and thrash so much, the van rocked. ``My T-cells are
going down! Please let me go, sir!'' When they parked on 135th
Street to try and calm her, a crowd gathered outside the rocking
van. ``What are they doing?'' a woman asked. ``Are they beating
her?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beating her?'' yelled a second woman.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there was a bang on top of the van; someone had hurled
an egg off a roof at the police. Gonzalez drove off. Blum screamed
the whole way to the precinct. Later she apologized, saying, ``I
just get phobic.'' She was given a desk appearance ticket and took
a taxi home. Ultimately charges were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   All of this make narcotics officers feel bitter, as if it were
the 1920s and they were reliving Prohibition. ``Everyone sees this
is a joke,'' said Jason, an undercover. ``They know we ain't
putting no dent in drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne, who oversees Brogli's team, says the only answer is
legalizing drugs. ``In my humble opinion, we're doing nothing up
here,'' he said after another long day of buy and busts.
</P>
<P>
   THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD
</P>
<P>
   It's supposedly common knowledge: black New Yorkers distrust the
police. But on the streets where Brogli works, the police's biggest
supporters are African-American. In the last 15 years, this
neighborhood may have changed from primarily African-American to
Dominican, but the citizens council that meets monthly at the local
precinct, the 30th, is headed by an African-American, Hazel
O'Reilly, and dominated by African-Americans. At council meetings
it is mainly black residents who attend to ask for  &UR; more &LR;  police
enforcement,  &UR; more &LR;  drug arrests, who want  &UR; more &LR;  people jailed for
loitering and trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   Detective John Montes, a Hispanic cop who walked a beat for two
years before joining Brogli's team, says his best informers here
were black. On these streets, the African-Americans are frequently
the older, better-established families, who moved here in the
1950s. Many are middle-class government workers, small-business
owners and professionals, and often they are resentful that Spanish
is now the primary language spoken in the Broadway shops; that
able-bodied Dominican men line the sidewalks all hours of the day;
and that the police consider the neighborhood drug trade,
controlled by Dominicans, the worst in the city.
</P>
<P>
   At a 30th Precinct meeting, an African-American homeowner asked
that the police do loitering sweeps, calling in the National Guard
if necessary. The woman, a single professional with a master's
degree, complained in an interview about the Dominicans: ``They
hang out on the corners _ they have so many children. When I go
into one of their stores, I try to line up to buy something the
American way, but it's all chaos, the Dominican customers all
milling, they don't know how to go in order.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dozen interviews in their homes, African-Americans
complained about Dominicans ruining the neighborhood, sounding very
much like the Jews and Italians who once dominated this area and
began leaving 40 years ago, complaining about the blacks moving in.
</P>
<P>
   Citing fear of retribution from dealers, all but one refused to
be cited by name. The one who allowed her last name to be used,
Mrs. Roper, ran a beauty shop but moved ``when the neighborhood
started going down because of the Dominicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a nice building, until we got a Dominican
superintendent and every time an apartment came available, he'd put
in some of them, and each one looked like a drug dealer,'' said
Roper, a great-grandmother and a member of the scholarship
committee at her Baptist church. ``They'd play their music so loud,
and this one time, a Dominican boy ran into our place and stole the
money for the electric and a gold chain. I tell you the Dominicans
destroy everything.''
</P>
<P>
   DOMINICANS TAKE THE RAP
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at headquarters has a racial or ethnic identity and
gets needled about it. Lee Macklowe, a Jew, is introduced to a
Jewish reporter as ``a fellow member of the tribe.'' When Simonetti
treats his team to bagels, he lifts up a dark brown one and yells
to Detective Luis Nieves-Diaz, a black-skinned Puerto Rican: ``The
pumpernickel's for you, Lou! Heh-heh!''
</P>
<P>
   The one slur rarely spoken is ``nigger.'' In a year's time, a
reporter did not hear it. Whether that was because, as Brogli says,
this generation has been conditioned against it, or because, as
Derrick, a black undercover, says, racial animosity still runs too
deep to joke about the word, it seemed off limits.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in these streets where most people arrested
for drugs are Dominican, it's open season on ``Domos.'' Many are
from poor, rural parts of their Caribbean island, where
record-keeping isn't precise, and officers making arrests jokingly
wonder if the Domo will know his birth date.

<P>
   Sgt. Neil Nappi, who is white, was trying to help Brogli's team
persuade an arrested Dominican to give up information about a drug
ring. In the midst of questioning him, Nappi started talking about
Dominican women. ``They're beautiful, but big trouble,'' he said to
another officer. ``You don't want to knock 'em up. There's a couple
of little redheaded Dominican kids running around, belong to guys
at the 30th. Cops get their checks garnished, it breaks up
marriages _ they're dangerous.'' As the cop spoke the Dominican man
stared at the floor; he provided no useful information that day.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times when the stereotype is true _ that the
able-bodied dark-skinned man standing on the corner day after day
is up to something _ and playing all the obvious hunches may pay
off for the police.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sept. 10, Brogli's team bought drugs on 141st Street. Soon
the van pulled up, and while Hector Espinal stood among a group of
Dominican men, Detectives Gonzalez and Montes quietly arrested and
cuffed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why'm I getting locked up?'' he asked. A woman with a baby
said, ``He's just standing here.'' In Espinal's pocket was a
Progressive Labor Party flier, headlined ``Racist Cops Kill Workers
in Cold Blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the 30th, doing the paperwork, two detectives could not
agree whether Espinal's eyes were hazel or brown. ``Hector, look at
me,'' said Brogli, getting so close you could barely squeeze a dime
between them. ``Light brown,'' she said, and while she had his
attention, she mentioned that he might be able to knock some prison
time off by cooperating. She did not tell him that based on an
investigation, they believed he belonged to a ring run by a dealer
with the street name DB.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a drug dealer,'' Espinal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go upstairs and talk,'' Detective Berrios said.
</P>
<P>
   They took him to a windowless interrogation room, where he sat
at a table, one hand cuffed to the wall, and sipped a Poland Spring
they had bought him. ``I go up on that block, but I mind my
business,'' Espinal said. ``I'm not out there with anybody else.
All I do is hang out there and smoke weed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling you, you sold drugs,'' Brogli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hector, I'm going to treat you like a man, not a boy,'' Montes
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't work for anybody,'' Espinal repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-shot offer,'' Brogli said. ``Talk now or the offer's
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about sales,'' Espinal said. ``I'm just trying to
get it in my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have kids?'' Berrios asked. Espinal said he wasn't
married.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Berrios said. ``but you got a kid, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday he turned 1,'' Espinal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think about the kid now,'' Berrios said, adding that
Espinal could face 15 years. ``You won't see him until he turns 17
possibly, and by that time he could have him another daddy.'' They
all stared while Espinal swigged Poland Spring. ``What are you
thinking about?'' Brogli asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You doubt if we are telling you the truth,'' Berrios said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't work with nobody,'' Espinal repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have exactly one minute,'' Brogli said.
</P>
<P>
   Espinal mumbled something. The cinder-block room went dead as a
tomb. Next time he said it loud and clear: He got his stuff from
``some cat named DB.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you get it from DB.,'' Montes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``DB's that chubby kid,'' Espinal said. ``I'm not big like you
think. I just got a lot of years in the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   They said they knew he had to be a seller, an able-bodied man,
with no steady job, hanging on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't got a lot of expenses,'' Espinal said. ``I stay with
my mother, plus I had a legal job _ back in '96.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you only make a couple of bucks,'' Brogli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to feed my child and my mother and my girlfriend and
me,'' Espinal said. ``Not to bring no guns, or no kilos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How you get in contact with him?'' Montes asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the block,'' Espinal said. ``DB used to live with his
girlfriend, but don't anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To feed you, your mother, your baby and your girl, he's got to
be around a lot,'' Montes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even his ex don't know where DB lives,'' Espinal said.
</P>
<P>
   Montes asked if DB lived with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't be talking to that crackhead bitch,'' said Espinal
(who has since been indicted on drug-selling charges and is facing
trial).
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING OUT FOR EACH OTHER
</P>
<P>
   Members of a police team spend enormous amounts of time
together. They discuss all forms of personal minutiae, including
their dental work, their sleeping problems, whether they're having
regular bowel movements and which relatives they're not getting
along with.
</P>
<P>
   They do not discuss race. They did not discuss Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   And yet when the verdict came down, it was clear, from separate
interviews, that each group knew how the other felt. Neither could
afford to offend the other; light and dark, they needed each other
to get home safely at day's end.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the eerie silence after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the racial divides in that room, at some point, most had
helped out when others were jammed up. When Pete, one of the few
white undercovers, was new, he had a terrible time making buys. His
first month he did only two, well short of the five quota. Gonzalez
took him aside and gave him tips about blending in, like finding a
group of druggies to stand in line with and taking care to hand
over the money in the same wrist motion as the guy before you. But
more than that, he leveled with Pete. He told him that as a white,
he wouldn't be able to act like a brown Spanish guy. It helped Pete
create his own character. Pete changed, from jivey white dude to
homeless crackhead. His record is now 13 buys in a month.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Gonzalez, a gifted street cop, is weak on
writing skills and awful about finishing his paperwork. At one
point Byrne threatened to dock him a few days, for work that was
months overdue, and told Brogli to stay out of it. (``I want to put
the fear of God in him,'' the lieutenant said.) Even so, the
sergeant called Gonzalez at home late at night and gave him tips on
writing the forms in his own words.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years between the night Amadou Diallo was killed and
the day the verdict was announced, Brogli spent perhaps 5,000 hours
working with Derrick and Gonzalez. They may never have discussed
the case, but she knew their hearts. ``Derrick's thinking it could
have been him standing in that doorway,'' Brogli said after the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the very words Derrick used when asked later. ``It
could have been us,'' he said. ``It could've been an undercover.''

 NEW YORK: an undercover.''

</P>
<P>
   UP THE LADDER
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, the new civil service list for lieutenants
came out. Brogli has friends all over the department, and one who
got an early peek called her at home: ``Is this  &UR; Lieutenant &LR; 
Brogli?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma!'' she called out. ``I made the list!''
</P>
<P>
   The police bureaucracy moves in inscrutable ways, and it could
be months before the promotion takes effect and she is transferred.
Fearing her departure, Gonzalez has been looking around. He is not
a good test taker, did poorly on the sergeant's exam. Like a lot of
blacks and Hispanics, he took the undercover job because it put him
on a fast track for a detective's shield and a higher pay scale. It
is a common avenue for minorities who either aren't good test
takers or don't want the responsibility of being a sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   But at 35, after doing five years as an undercover and two years
as an investigator, he says he feels too old to return to life, and
now the options were less glamorous. Ideally he would like to stay
with Brogli until she changes jobs, and he said to her, ``Maria, if
you just tell me to stay, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what she wanted, too. She's crazy about Johnny G., even
if his paperwork is a nightmare. But she knew he had a couple of
offers pending and it would be unfair to ask. ``The door that opens
now may not be open later,'' she said, and they laughed because she
sounded like one of those fortune cookies that come with the
Chinese takeout they order on the overnight tour.
</P>
<P>
   OUT WITH PREJUDICE
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when Gonzalez was on uniformed housing patrol in Red
Hook, Brooklyn, white officers couldn't tell what he was by looking
at him and were guarded until reading his name tag. ``Then they'd
say, `Oh, you're Gonzalez _ these blacks, aren't they like animals
with all their kids?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm in a Dominican neighborhood,'' he said. ``I'll hear
some sergeant, not knowing I'm around, talking about Domos this,
Domos that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a white cop ask me, `How many in your family are drug
dealers?''' said Gonzalez, who doesn't drink alcohol. ``I told him,
in my family, nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   If the police can be too quick to label, Gonzalez says, they are
only reflecting society.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm afternoon, dressed as usual in plain clothes, he met
downtown with a prosecutor about a case, then stopped in a deli
near Chinatown for an iced tea. One sip and he nearly spit it out.
He knew immediately it was the extra-sweet tea that heroin addicts
on methadone often crave. ``Sorry,'' said the Asian woman behind
the counter, exchanging the drink. ``This is junkie iced tea.'' An
honest mistake? Or had she assumed he was a junkie from a nearby
methadone clinic because he is brown-skinned?
</P>
<P>
   You could go crazy trying to get to the bottom of every slight,
says Gonzalez, and he doesn't bother. He is an upbeat family man.
His view of the narcotics officers he deals with each day:
``There's not that much prejudice in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   A POOR HOMELAND
</P>
<P>
   Making assumptions about Dominicans and drugs is not wholly an
act of racism. Federal officials consider the Dominican Republic a
major drug depot. In part that is because it is halfway between
Colombia, where the cocaine is grown, and the United States, where
it is snorted. And unlike Haiti on the other side of the island,
the Dominican Republic shares a language with Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But the most common reason that Dominicans join the drug trade,
Gonzalez says, is that most are very, very poor. He visits the
island a few times a year to see his mother, who has retired there,
and tells this story:
</P>
<P>
   He is driving on the island with his 2-year-old son Mark when
the car breaks down. There is a shack nearby, and he walks to it
carrying Mark. Inside there is a single light bulb dangling from a
cord. He asks the the woman living there to use a phone. She takes
down the number, and before he knows it he sees a boy running
through the fields; the woman has sent her son to the nearest
phone, a few miles away. Then she disappears out back and kills a
chicken. She pulls plantains from a tree and makes the New York
City detective and his boy a meal. A lost afternoon turns festive.
Finally a mechanic arrives with the detective's mother, but when
they try to give the woman money, she will not take it. She says it
would be an insult.
</P>
<P>
   Now every time he visits the island, he stops by her shack to
drop off some small gift, like clothes his children have outgrown,
and is greeted like a rich man.
</P>
<P>
   ``You drive around the D.R.,'' he said, ``and in the middle of
rows of shacks, you see one big house, a big car, a satellite dish,
and you know it's drug money. These Dominican kids see it, too, and
they have no other way and they take a chance. Most are not bad
people. They come up humble, country people. It's a choice of
living in a shack or getting something better for their families.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gonzalez sees the brown men lined up on 140th Street, he
thinks drug dealers, he says. But he also thinks of the bare light
bulb and the boy running miles through the fields to the nearest
phone.

A BINGE ON MUSIC AT STATE U. 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By MATT RICHTEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ College students who share their music files
on the Internet have been accused of stealing copyrighted works, or
at least of exhibiting questionable morality. Ask the students in a
liberal college town like this one and they will beg to differ. The
dark truth, they say, is that they've been driven to Napster or
Scour Exchange by a global conspiracy arrayed against them.
</P>
<P>
   By the tens of thousands, they have joined services like these,
through which they can get new music free, rather than having to go
to the record store _ which would entail the nasty hurdle of having
to pay money. But the real reason they're sharing files, they say,
is that they've been forced to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for someone to blame, blame the
universities,'' said Amna Suharwardy, 19, who attended summer
classes at the University of California at Berkeley. Her point is
that the universities give students high-speed Internet connections
that make it so easy to download free music that they'd be
inexcusably dense not to take the bait.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to the conspiracy than just the enablers in
the administration building. The students say the record industry
itself is driving them to subversion.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan Goyne, 24, a new graduate of the University of
California at Santa Cruz, said he had seen through the industry's
clever little ruse: greedy record companies have been trying to
make money. He has taken to Napster to fight back. ``Music should
be made for the sake of music _ it should be free,'' said Goyne,
24, who specifically wants to liberate the music of Willie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   He's not an extremist, mind you. For him, the principle of
people sharing stuff has limits. ``No, you can't have my shoes,''
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Napster users generally agree with him on the limits thing, but
the difference with music is that it's, well, music, and charging
money for Metallica's ``Kill 'Em All'' is like depriving them of a
basic human need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on _ $15? Some people can't afford a CD,'' said Mario
Garcia, a Berkeley junior who uses Napster to download tracks of
Metallica and Rage Against the Machine. He would be willing to pay
for the music if he had a job, but that would turn the priorities
of a modern society on their head. ``What do they want more _ for
me to have a job and money, or stay in school?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could borrow my toaster, but only if you return
it,'' he added, walking away briskly, careful not to turn his back.
</P>
<P>
   On Telegraph Avenue, John Vance, a Napster user, runs the ``1st
Amendment Center'' _ several portable shelves from which he sells
bumper stickers like ``Robin Hood Was Right'' and ``I Do Whatever
My Rice Krispies Tell Me to Do.'' Vance, 57, said it was
unfortunate that Napster users had been entrapped into downloading
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, as long as technology is provided by The Corp. _ you know
what I'm saying, The Corp.! _ people are going to use it,'' he
said. ``It's like putting $100 on the sidewalk _ people are going
to take it. They can make a criminal of anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   His Rice Krispies told him to sell the bumper stickers for $2
each. He said he hoped The Corp. never comes up with a way to share
bumper stickers on the Web. ``I'd have to do something else,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a college student, but he's in tune with their
thinking, and what they are thinking is: Please, people, see the
straits we're in. Record companies charge too much, The Corp. makes
the tools and universities complete the unholy axis, forcing
bandwidth on the poor souls that society deems must get a degree.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Goyne, the recent graduate, the whole conversation
has gotten him thinking. If college students and other poor folks
don't pay for records, he observed, then the record industry could
start to fail, which could lead to layoffs of ordinary workers,
like record store clerks and people who work in factories that make
compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   And upon reflection, maybe he does think musicians should be
able to make a profit. He just thinks that the profit should be
limited, and that musicians should perform for the love of their
craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I am against it. I don't know,'' he said of the Napster
service. ``I hadn't really thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you still can't have my shoes,'' he said. ``Don't even
bring that up again.''

   MOORESTOWN, N.J. _ The locals call it ``the cruiser in the
cornfield.'' The USS Rancocas rises eerily from a meadow just north
of Exit 4 of the New Jersey Turnpike near here, 50 miles from the
Atlantic coast. What looks like the top half of a Navy vessel is
actually a lab where the Lockheed Martin Corp. tests its ability to
knit together naval communications gear, sensors, radar, and
controls used to fire weapons.
</P>
<P>
   With its berth on land, the Rancocas is an apt symbol for what
has become the most important and promising part of a company that
has run aground. Its 1999 net profits of $382 million on sales of
$25.5 billion were down from $1 billion, on $26.3 billion in sales,
the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., has long been known as
a maker of military wares like fighters, missiles and rockets. But
as its market has shrunk, this military contractor, the world's
largest, has quietly transformed itself. Today, its biggest
business is selling sophisticated electronic gear and integrating
the most advanced equipment from different suppliers, whether for
military or peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The company still never tires of portraying its most photogenic
products in high-flying action. But ``it's tough to put me on a
calendar,'' jokes Robert Coutts, the executive vice president who
heads Lockheed Martin's systems integration unit.
</P>
<P>
   His operations, however, are having a profound impact on
Lockheed Martin's bottom line. Led by its work on Navy programs
like the Aegis ship-based weapons system, Coutts' businesses
accounted for 54 percent of Lockheed Martin's first-quarter
operating profits of $316 million this year, up from 37 percent for
all of 1997. Its backlog grew last year while the remainder of the
company's shrank. On June 28, his division won a $4 billion
contract for a battlefield missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Systems integration has become the core of this company,''
says Loren Thompson, a consultant and chief operating officer of
the Lexington Institute, a research group in Arlington, Va. ``It's
going to be the earnings powerhouse that drives the company's
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Lockheed Martin _ or other big military contractors _
has much choice. When the government blocked Lockheed Martin's
$11.6 billion acquisition of the Northrop Grumman Corp. in 1998,
industry heavyweights knew they could not continue to grow through
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Headlong plunges into the commercial world, once the great hope
for military contractors after the Cold War, could also be dead
ends. As Norman Augustine, a former Lockheed Martin chairman, once
wrote, ``The record of massive defense conversion is one
unblemished by success.''
</P>
<P>
   The military procurement budget as a whole offers meager growth
prospects. Electronics and integration, however, should become the
fastest-growing segment. While Boeing, Northrop Grumman and
Raytheon are also competing in electronics and systems integration,
Lockheed Martin's shift has been the most profound.
</P>
<P>
   There, the prominence of Coutts' operation is part accident,
part design. The profits of the company's aeronautics and space
lines have been taking big hits from satellite-launch failures and
production glitches, helping to drive down Lockheed Martin's stock
from a high in 1998 of nearly $60 to a low of just under $17
earlier this year, before rebounding somewhat recently. The steady,
5-percent-a-year growth of Coutts' business, which includes
everything from mail sorting to military systems, makes it loom
larger by default. Other company units ``have bigger win parties
and bigger funerals,'' Coutts said. ``We tend to be able to bring
more smoothness.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lockheed Martin is also banking on his unit, organized last
year, for future growth, as part of a plan devised when the company
bought the Loral Corp., a specialist in military electronics, for
$9.1 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts, 50, is an engineer who was an executive in the General
Electric aerospace division when it was acquired in 1993 by Martin
Marietta; Lockheed and Martin Marietta merged in 1995. Coutts
(whose name rhymes with ``boots'') rose to chief operating officer
of the electronics division in 1998 and executive vice president of
systems integration a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers who work for Coutts weave together components from
different suppliers, much as computer services companies do. But
they also calculate important tradeoffs, like whether it is cheaper
to make radar and missiles with greater range than to provide a
fighter plane with expensive stealth features. (The farther a plane
can fire, of course, the fewer of those features it needs.) The
work also requires extensive computer simulations that test weapons
without having to fire them.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating on systems integration represents a shrewd hedge.
If the Pentagon binges on new planes and boats, it will need the
electronic goods and services that the division offers. If the
military chooses instead to upgrade existing planes and ships, it
will still need that hardware and software. ``It's the company's
best business,'' said John Raitt, associate director of Harris
Associates, whose Oakmark fund holds a 2 percent stake in Lockheed
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   But Coutts' unit cannot guarantee strong enough performance
against tough competitors to revive the whole company. In 1998,
Boeing won a $1.6 billion contract to be lead integrator for the
Pentagon's national missile defense program. And last year, a team
led by Boeing won a multibillion-dollar satellite contract from the
National Reconnaissance Office, a big victory in a field that was
virtually a Lockheed Martin franchise for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a hugely competitive marketplace,'' Coutts noted.
``It still has more capacity than it has demand.'' Although his
unit's operating profits last year were 8.7 percent of sales, the
best within Lockheed Martin, Coutts predicted that his margin would
decline slightly this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Lockheed Martin might be undermining his
operations with its plan to sell off key assets like Sanders
Electronics, the electronic-warfare specialist. But the company
must cut its $12 billion debt load and answer complaints from
rivals and the Pentagon that, in assembling weapons systems, it
favors its own components over those of its competitors _ an
accusation that the company denies.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Wall Street entirely pleased with the systems integration
division. Analysts are especially worried about its forays into
corporate assignments.
</P>
<P>
   While Coutts' operations have for years included air traffic
control systems and Postal Service work, it is now moving further
afield. Over the last several years, the company has won $240
million in contracts to provide information services for General
Motors. Lockheed Martin executives say the acquisition of a former
IBM unit in 1996 gives the company the ability to make corporate
contracts profitable. In fact, Lockheed Martin got into the GM
business because former IBM colleagues at both companies knew one
another.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, corporate contracts, with fixed prices and short
terms, are far different from military ones. ``It makes Wall Street
a little nervous,'' says Pierre Chao, an analyst at Credit Suisse
First Boston. ``Defense companies moving into the commercial world
have been a source of losses.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, investors can heave a sigh of relief that at
least this part of Lockheed Martin has not run aground _ except in
that New Jersey cornfield.

EMPLOYMENT FIGURES BODE WELL FOR STOCKS AND BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Both stocks and bonds rallied Friday after the June
employment report brought investors the good news of slower growth
and the hope that the Federal Reserve Board might now refrain from
another increase in interest rates next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index jumped over the 4,000 mark for the
first time since April and cut its loss for the year to a little
more than 1 percent. The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index popped
back into the plus column for the year, while the Dow Jones
industrial average narrowed its decline. In the bond market,
interest rates slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Both stocks and bonds are still locked in their recent trading
ranges, however, and are likely to remain there until it is clear
the Federal Reserve has finished raising its short-term
interest-rate target to slow the blistering pace of economic growth
and dampen inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   While private sector jobs continued to increase, the June data
showed that the pace of growth was slowing. At the same time,
income growth _ as measured by average hourly earnings _ remained
moderate. And the increase in aggregate hours worked slowed
somewhat, signaling that worker productivity was still strong.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to conclude that the pace of growth might be
decelerating enough to keep Federal Reserve policy-makers from
raising interest rates when they meet again on Aug. 22.
Inflationary pressures, as measured by wages and productivity, are
also not too threatening.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, economic growth is still robust enough to keep
the corporate earnings outlook positive. The reporting season for
second quarter earnings gets into full swing next week and
forecasters are still expecting a robust quarter, with growth of
about 19 percent over the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have become less certain that the Fed will tighten at
the August meeting, while that was the forecast after the June
meeting,'' said Joseph Liro, chief economist at Stone &AMP; McCarthy
Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was reflected in the small decline Friday in the
yield on federal funds futures for August, to 6.53 percent from
6.545 percent. The federal funds rate, which is the interest
charged on overnight loans between banks, is the Federal Reserve's
short-term interest-rate target. It is now at 6.5 percent after a
half-percentage-point increase in May. Policy-makers left the rate
unchanged in June but warned that it might be raised again if the
economy did not slow more.
</P>
<P>
   And, Liro added, investors can be ``confident that there will be
enough aggregate demand out there to keep the economy growing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index jumped 62.63 points, or 1.6 percent,
to 4,023.20 on Friday, while the S&AMP;P 500 climbed 22.23 points, or
1.5 percent, to 1,478.90. The Dow Jones industrial average rose
154.51 points, or 1.5 percent, to 10,635.98. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange was moderate, with 931.8 million shares changing
hands. The daily average for the year is 1.02 billion shares a day.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's rally turned the week into a nice positive. The Nasdaq
rose 1.4 percent for the week and the technology-heavy index is now
down just 1.1 percent for the year. But it is still 20.3 percent
below its 2000 high in March. The S&AMP;P was up 1.7 percent for the
week and is now up 0.7 percent for the year. But it is still 3.2
percent below its 2000 high in March.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished the week 1.8 percent higher. It is still the
worst performer of the three indexes, down 7.5 percent for the
year, and is 9.3 percent from its record high in January.
</P>
<P>
   Liro noted that while investors seem to worry about the impact
of the monthly jobs data on the stock market, the data has usually
been positive for the stock market on the day it is released. He
said that on 15 of the 18 Fridays on which the employment report
had been issued since January 1999, the S&AMP;P index had rallied. And
12 of those rallies saw the S&AMP;P rise 1 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for this positive response, he said.
One is that investors who are worried about the Fed raising
interest rates think positively if the economy is slowing slightly.
Continued growth is naturally positive. And often just getting the
news out of the way, even if it is negative, is a relief that can
make investors think positively.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were led higher Friday by Hewlett-Packard, Wal-Mart
Stores, Home Depot, IBM, Citigroup, Intel and Dell Computer. The
stocks that fell included Qualcomm, BroadVision, Yahoo, Pfizer,
Merck &AMP; Co., Alcoa and General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, prices were higher, as yields _ which move
in the opposite direction _ fell. The yield on the Treasury's
10-year note fell to 6.00 percent from 6.04 percent on Thursday,
while the price rose 8/32, to 103 19/32. The yield on the 10-year
note has been fighting to get back below 6 percent for the last
four weeks. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.87 percent from
5.90 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After one day of trading at 1 cent below $30 a barrel, the price
of crude oil rose Friday. Oil for August delivery on the New York
Mercantile Exchange rose 29 cents, or 1 percent, to $30.28.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear how much the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will actually increase its crude-oil
production. Saudi Arabia said Monday that it would raise its
production by 500,000 barrels a day _ less than 2 percent of OPEC
production _ if the price did not decline soon. But other OPEC
members are still discussing how much of an increase they will
accept.

DESPITE ECONOMIC GROWTH, SOUTHEAST ASIA'S STOCKS ARE SINKING

 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Southeast Asia's economies are growing again. Its
stock markets are getting smaller.
</P>
<P>
   If that contrast sounds odd, it is. Last December, economists
and analysts predicted that 2000 would be a boom year for Asian
stocks and currencies. They said foreign investors, enriched with
gains in high-technology stocks, would snap up Indonesian rupiah,
Thai baht and Philippine pesos to buy stocks and bet on the
region's continued recovery from the financial crisis that began in
mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   Those forecasts have gone astray. Foreign investors have sold
Southeast Asian stocks and currencies for much of the year, helping
make several of the region's markets among the worst performing in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and fund managers attribute the sell-off to a
perception that Southeast Asia, despite an economic rebound,
remains a dangerous place to invest because of political
instability, corruption and a lack of technological sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's looking at fundamentals these days,'' said Rebecca H.
Patterson, a currency strategist at J.P. Morgan in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much investment funds from the United States, Europe
and Japan have sold is difficult to determine. Securities exchanges
in some countries, notably Singapore, do not release figures on
foreign trading.
</P>
<P>
   Lipper Analytical Services in New York says that so for this
year at least $230 million had been pulled out of United States
funds that make investments in Asian markets other than Japan's.
But that figure would tend to understate the situation, because it
includes funds investing in popular markets like South Korea,
Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Figures from individual exchanges indicate where withdrawals and
investment losses are worst. The Philippine Stock Exchange reports
that foreigners have sold roughly $172 million more than they have
bought so far this year. In Thailand, foreigners have sold nearly
$700 million more in Thai stocks than they have bought. In
Indonesia, foreigners had a $20 million net withdrawal in the first
five months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the benchmark stock indexes in the region have dropped
25 percent or more, making the 7.5 percent year-to-date decline of
the Dow industrial average look modest. The exchange values of most
Southeast Asian currencies have also fallen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's benchmark stock index is down 25 percent. Combined
with a 31 percent currency-rate decline, Indonesian stocks have
lost nearly 56 percent of their value in dollar terms this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that this may balloon into another crisis,''
said Steven Lim, who manages $500 million in investments in
Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia for Daiwa International, the
Japanese investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lim cites the problems of an Indonesian fishing company, Daya
Guna Samudera, to indicate how the investment statistics apply in
real terms.
</P>
<P>
   Daya Guna has exclusive licenses to catch and export fish and
shrimp from Indonesia's teeming eastern seas. With its costs in
Indonesian rupiah and its revenue in dollars, investing in Daya
Guna seemed like an obvious opportunity last year.
</P>
<P>
   But in December, the company informed investors that its catch
had fallen 15 percent from the previous year. A third of its crew
members, it said, had deserted to escape Muslim-Christian clashes
in the eastern islands, leaving many new fishing vessels idle and
the company in difficulty with creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Seen more broadly, missing fishermen are the least of problems
Indonesia is having with foreign investors now.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, Muslim rebels in the west, secessionists in the
east and sectarian clashes on the islands in between have crippled
confidence. Skirmishing between President Abdurrahman Wahid, his
central bank chief and his cabinet have left the economy
rudderless.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat similar troubles are souring investor sentiment
elsewhere in the region. In the Philippines, insurgents in two
separate Muslim rebellions have brought bombings to the capital and
have kept 20 scuba divers hostage on a jungle island for nearly two
months _ situations that do little to entice foreign capital. Nor
has an insider-trading scandal involving a friend of President
Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Thailand is tamer. But a two-year court battle
between the founder of a local plastics maker and its bankers has
underlined the troubles still faced by Thai banks as they try to
recover the 40 percent of their loans that borrowers cannot or will
not repay. Banks make up roughly a quarter of the benchmark stock
index, leading Peggy Creveling, who heads Salomon Smith Barney's
research in Thailand, to ask, ``how can the market go up?''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian stocks, which had been rising this year in
anticipation of their inclusion again in global market indexes,
have lately succumbed to the exodus of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   And Singapore, famously stable and in the midst of an economic
liberalization campaign, is suffering the effects of living in a
tough neighborhood.
</P>

<P>
   ``I don't get it,'' said Chia Yeng Boo, 53, a Singaporean
investor, as he watched local stock prices dwindle on a television
screen. ``The economy keeps getting better, but the stocks keep
going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Local investors expecting a flood of foreign funds this year
helped fuel a powerful rally late in 1999, particularly in
electronics and telecommunications stocks. Their logic: when
Nasdaq's bulls came to bank on a Southeast Asian recovery, they
would look for anything remotely related to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But smaller markets in the region lacked sufficient Internet
appeal for foreign investors. There were just not enough high-end
exports, dot-com stock offerings or flashy Internet market
statistics, analysts say, to match markets in Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq rout in technology shares in April made things even
worse. Investors, rather than seizing an opportunity to jump into
fundamental economic stories like Southeast Asia's, simply lost
their appetite for any risk.

BORDER IMMIGRANT SMUGGLERS SHIFT INTO NEW GEAR

<P>
   HARLINGEN, Texas _ In the past, Border Patrol agents have
discovered undocumented immigrants in car trunks, engine
compartments, sealed freight cars and even stuffed into suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest smuggling ruse uncovered on the Fourth of July
outside Laredo, Texas, has topped them all for sheer brazenness.
</P>
<P>
   A man is accused of smuggling undocumented immigrants past a
Border Patrol checkpoint on Interstate 35 by dressing them up as
bicycle enthusiasts and having them pedal 10-speed cycles past
unsuspecting agents.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants were dressed to look like members of Laredo
cycling clubs, complete with colorful outfits and helmets. The club
often trains on the access road running past the secondary
checkpoint 14 miles north of the border town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unique and it took a little bit of planning and
forethought to come up with this,'' said Assistant Chief John
Smietana, who heads the Border Patrol anti-smuggling detail in
Laredo. ``Obviously, someone was watching our operations and saw
this road being used by bicyclists.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are not sure how the immigrants got past primary
checkpoints along the border. But once in Laredo, the immigrants
paid $1,500 for passage to San Antonio, agents believe.
</P>
<P>
   The subterfuge might have gone on for a year before it was
discovered. Smietana said agents' view of the access road is
obstructed when large trucks or buses are backed up at the
checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   After being tipped to the ploy, agents watched the checkpoint
particularly closely on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   They saw two cyclists speed past the checkpoint on the access
road. The agents watched as the cyclists met up with a man in a
pickup. The man loaded them and their bicycles and drove north on
I-35 until agents pulled him over.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Pedro Gonzalez-Davila, a 42-year-old Mexican citizen
who lives in San Antonio, was arrested and charged with aiding and
abetting illegal entry. Gonzalez-Davila &UR; ,  &LR; a legal resident, also
could face deportation as a result of the charges. His 1997 Ford
pickup has been seized, Smietana said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the information we gathered ... he's been doing this for
approximately a year,'' Smietana said. ``He'd do it two or three
times a week with two to three aliens at a time, so it would look
like the normal bicycling groups that are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1,500 that Gonzalez-Davila charged each client included the
use of a bicycle, an outfit and helmet, along with a ride to San
Antonio, Smietana said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez-Davila would drop his clients and bicycles off at a
Laredo truck stop south of the checkpoint and meet up with them
after they cruised past the Border Patrol, Smietana said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At $1,500 apiece, he was making some money at it,'' Smietana
said. ``We thought it was kind of a novel idea, and it just goes to
show the ingenuity of the alien smugglers who try and beat our
enforcement methods.''

$1.1 MILLION ALLOCATED TO RENOVATE LINCOLN COTTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER WALSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The rundown summer cottage where President Lincoln
wrote a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation was declared a
national monument Friday by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Anderson Cottage, relatively unknown and tucked away in
the northwest corner of the city, Clinton made use of the
Antiquities Act to designate the 158-year-old landmark the
President Lincoln and Soldiers' Home National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year more than a million people visited Ford's Theater
alone, but barely 100 made it here to Anderson Cottage, where
Lincoln lived and worked,'' said Clinton. ``In some ways, this
cottage behind me is the most important, as well as the least
known, Lincoln site in the entire United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said $1.1 million has been raised for the renovations,
including a $750,000 matching funds grant from Save America's
Treasures, a public-private partnership between the White House
Millennium Council and the National Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cottage in its way is just as precious as a giant
sequoia, as irreplaceable as the ruins of cultures long past, and
it is our profound obligation to preserve and protect it for future
generations,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes less than two weeks after the National
Trust for Historic Preservation put the cottage at the top of this
year's list of historical sites in danger of demolition or
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Moe, president of the National Trust, said, ``At a time
when understanding of American history is at an abysmal level, we
need sites like this more than ever to convey an appreciation of
how we got to be the nation we are.''
</P>
<P>
   As Civil War battles loomed, the hilltop cottage essentially
served as Lincoln's Camp David, where he would retreat from the
heat of the city and the stress of day-to-day operations. The
cottage, built in 1842, was located on the grounds of what was
known then as the Soldiers' Home, the first home for disabled
veterans of the US Army.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-room Gothic revival cottage, where Lincoln spent about a
quarter of his presidency, is in desperate need of renovation with
water damage, rotting wooden window frames, and aging electrical
and plumbing systems. Restoration is expected to start next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to preserving Lincoln's retreat, Clinton announced
another $15 million in grants from Save America's Treasures for
preserving 47 historic sites and collections nationwide, including
the USS Missouri, where the Japanese formally surrendered to end
World War II, and Babe Ruth's scrapbooks at the National Baseball
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts sites to receive grants include the Orchard House,
the family home of author Louisa May Alcott in Concord; the
Colonial Theater in Pittsfield; and the American Antiquarian
Society Library in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   Refurnishing the 14-room cottage may be difficult since Lincoln
would move the family's belongings to the summer home in May and
take them back to the White House in November, said Nick Minecci,
spokesman for the cottage and an amateur historian who has done
extensive research on Lincoln's stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Office furniture and equipment for the public affairs department
of the soldiers' home now occupy many of the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first president to visit the site since
President Chester A. Arthur more than 100 years ago. Presidents
Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B.
Hayes also used the cottage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tour Friday was reminiscent of the summer days between
1862 and 1864 when Lincoln roamed the grounds just three miles away
from the White House. Clinton walked the same staircase that
Lincoln would take to retreat to the corner bedroom where he
drafted the famous proclamation that ended slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can still feel that spirit strongly in the room in this
cottage where he worked,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also stood in the cool shade under the copper
beech tree where Lincoln would spend time playing with his son,
reading, or writing correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it is three centuries old, it is our last living link
to Abraham Lincoln,'' Clinton said of the tree.

RAFTER DEFEATS AGASSI IS STIRRING SEMIFINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ For months, Patrick Rafter rode out the
mood swings that turned his good-natured personality inside out.
The same Aussie who had always been ready with a good joke, a toast
and a smile _ the profile of the perfect best man at a wedding _
had his spirits rustled when forced to confront his tennis
mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Rafter underwent shoulder surgery, and the No. 1
ranking he worked so hard to obtain last July had evaporated. But
against a backdrop of rehab setbacks that left him pondering
retirement at times, the 27-year-old Rafter looked at peace Friday.
He realizes there are only so many serves left in his right rotator
cuff, but he did not seem the least bit concerned with the dynamics
of supply and demand on Center Court.
</P>
<P>
   To handcuff Andre Agassi's Houdini-like return game, Rafter
needed a big serve with the high kick of a Rockette. And he needed
as many as possible. As a gray afternoon extended into a crisp and
clear evening, as the first set of this hypnotic semifinal morphed
into the fifth, Rafter ignored the shrinking life span of his
serve. Unfurling his body freely, he pounded a high percentage of
first serves to undermine Agassi's strength on his way to a 7-5,
4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 victory that put him in position to play Pete
Sampras in Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a match that I couldn't have played any better under
the circumstances, on a big court against one of the best players
ever,'' Rafter said. ``I think it was probably very satisfying to
have actually done it on these grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   As a beaming Rafter lifted his arms in victory and spotted his
brothers sitting in the friends box, Steffi Graf was hustling out
of the stadium, not to return. Agassi's run was over, and the
American dream final had vanished. Only one half of it was alive
after the cash-poor qualifier, Vladimir Voltchkov, allowed one
pivotal shot to undo his upset chance against Sampras and lost, 7-6
(4), 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   With a huffing Sampras scrambling to chase down a deep, sliced
backhand, Voltchkov botched the easy backhand volley that would
have evened the first-set tiebreaker at 5-5. In disbelief,
Voltchkov dropped his racket and hung his head. The unknown
22-year-old from Belarus _ whose vagabond career took a brief
detour through Brooklyn seven years ago _ couldn't believe the
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hit a hundred out of a hundred of those in practice,''
said Voltchkov, who came to Wimbledon too cash-strapped to eat out
and left with $193,000 in prize money. ``You miss one here. I guess
it's the nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   Voltchkov never recovered. He went on to lose the tiebreaker and
never posed a threat to Sampras again. The only problem Sampras had
was with his sore lower left shin. At the end of the second set, he
asked a trainer for assistance. Scurrying around with only a slight
limp, he played on. After easing through the tournament without
having to face a seeded player, the top-seeded Sampras was in the
final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking at Sunday as pressure,'' said Sampras, 28, who
can break Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slams with a victory
against Rafter. ``I'm looking at it as an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Unchallenged through the tournament, Sampras will go up against
a player who has had his moments against Sampras in the past. They
have not always been pleasant encounters, either. As a part of an
odd tennis turf war when both were in their early days on the tour,
they exchanged a few heated words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get along fine,'' Sampras said. ``We'll just go out there
and do the best we can and then shake hands. But everything is
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Rafter wasn't focused on old grudges. He was fixated on
his recovery. Even as Agassi exited the grounds of the All England
Club, he seemed genuinely pleased for Rafter. One year ago, Rafter,
beginning to feel the first unsettling pains in his shoulder, was
crestfallen after his semifinal loss to Agassi at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat's gone through a tough stage here with his injury,''
Agassi said. ``He looks like he's found his game. I thought, in the
crucial times of the match, he was playing tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Every game seemed to present a critical point during a match
that unveiled a glorious contrast of styles. There was the
ponytailed Rafter, a serve-and-volley fiend with a touch as soft as
cashmere at the net, faced with a bald icon who uses his racket
like a laser from the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   For four sets, neither style had a clear edge over the other. To
threaten Rafter's serve in the seventh game of the first set, the
second-seeded Agassi pounced on a second serve and slapped it back
at the feet of the Aussie as he raced to the net. In the same game,
Rafter dared to reach back and go for a second-serve ace that split
the court in half.
</P>
<P>
   This was just part of a riveting back-and-forth. Agassi would
catch Rafter creeping into the net and airbrush a lob just over his
outstretched racket. Rafter would watch Agassi rip a service return
down the line, and then stab it like a swashbuckler for a
half-volley winner. The high level of play left the crowd in a
constant state of awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good enough if you lose,'' said Agassi, who converted
4 of 9 break points while Rafter succeeded on 5 of 12. ``I didn't
serve as well as I wanted to, made some careless errors. To his
credit, he played well at the right time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the end of a 3 hour 18 minute match, the hiccups in Agassi's
game caught up to him. In the sixth game of the fifth set, Agassi
went for too much on a second serve in an attempt to keep Rafter on
his heels. He double faulted. That mistake set up the 12th-seeded
Rafter with a break point. With Rafter at the net, Agassi sent a
forehand passing shot hurdling into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi couldn't break back. Rafter's first serve only got better
as the match progressed. In the first set, Rafter put 53 percent of
his first serves in. By the fifth, he was nailing 74 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As the match unfolded, it was obvious: Rafter's shoulder was
holding up just fine. Just after Rafter left the interview, he was
headed for his strength routines. Twice a day, he ties a rubber
band from a door knob to his racket and begins swinging away
against the resistance. So far, this dedication to rehabilitating
has extended his career. How long, no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just taking it week by week, just really grateful to be
out there,'' he said. ``I'm hoping I can get a few more serves out
than what everyone expects.''

 &HT;    University of Texas set about to increase minority law student
enrollmentBy Sharon Jayson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A free ride to Austin this spring for minority
students let the University of Texas School of Law lose some of its
disparaging baggage and boost its ranks for this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 1996 Hopwood court ruling that led to a dismantling
of affirmative action in Texas colleges, the number of African
American students who say they'll attend UT this fall is about
double the number enrolled last year. Though it's a small step up
from seven black students in 1999 _ and next year's group will
still be a small figure _ the double digits are welcome news to
admissions officials struggling to increase student diversity
without affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   This spring efforts to attract a more ethnically diverse
population spurred state Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, an alumni of
the law school, ask airlines to provide free roundtrip flights for
African Americans accepted for the fall to get a firsthand look at
UT. More than half of the 25 liked what they saw and signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican American enrollment is expected to increase only
slightly from last year's 32 students. Law school admissions
officials believe Ellis' effort made headway and they want to
expand the offerings to Mexican Americans this spring, said Shelli
Soto, assistant dean for admissions at UT Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a drastic improvement,'' Ellis said. ``It's
much more than a weekend in Austin. It's making the students feel
that people of color who have leadership positions in the state
want them here. My effort was a small piece in a much bigger puzzle
to figure out how to diminish the devastating effect of Hopwood.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those students, Chris Lopez of Houston, said he chose UT
over Georgetown University and the University of Pennsylvania after
his visit in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me confidence to know I wasn't alone,'' he said.
``They made you feel like you were welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, 26, said he had been nervous about coming to UT because
of the previous few years when the number of entering black
students at the law school were as few as four or five in a class
edging toward 500.
</P>
<P>
   The law school received almost 3,900 applications for the 475
spots for first-year students this fall. Of those, almost 1,000
were accepted. Students guarantee their place with a deposit,
though some change their mind over the summer. Soto said 50 to 100
students on the wait list will be admitted, but she won't know
exact numbers until classes begin. In 1999, when the entering class
comprised 483 students, there were only seven African Americans,
down one from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, another UT Law School graduate,
wants to help improve those numbers next fall. This month, he sent
letters to accepted Mexican American students encouraging them to
choose UT and to call him if they have questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has suffered under the ruling in Hopwood, but UT Law
School is making strides to maintain diversity in a race-neutral
system,'' Cuellar said in his letter. ``Texans have a wonderful
advantage in that they can receive a top caliber legal education at
a fraction of the cost charged by other top tier law schools. I
urge you to take advantage of the education that your family's tax
dollars have helped to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how the program could be expanded is still in question. In
fact, Ellis said his commitment from the airlines was only for the
trial run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the airlines don't do it, I'll be looking at a number
of other avenues to try to bring the students in,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuellar said he's optimistic their efforts will succeed in
increasing the numbers of future minority lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is if we can do it on an incremental basis _ in
the sense of getting more minority students _ that will be a
success,'' he said. ``It can be done.''

SWIMMERS TO BRAVE TIDES, SHARKS TO RAISE MONEY FOR POOLS

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At 7:45 a.m. July 23, a Boston real estate executive
intends to step off a Martha's Vineyard beach with a blind
Australian man at her side and begin swimming east toward a horizon
that offers nothing more than water and sky.
</P>
<P>
   Their destination will be Nantucket Island, 15 miles across a
maelstrom of tidal turbulance filled with toothy fish (the local
shark tournament ends the day before). The waters they will swim
through can be so confused that sometimes standing waves spit spray
30 feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   At approximately 3 p.m., the pair will step onto a beach in
Nantucket's Madaket Harbor. They will be the first swimmers to make
the crossing from Martha's Vineyard to Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if all goes according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I guess I would have to admit that a lot of things can go
wrong,'' said Debra Taylor, 36. Accompanying her will be James
Pittar, a resident of Sydney who has swum the English Channel, and
last year swam around Manhatten, she said.
</P>
<P>
   They're in it for the money _ not for themselves, but for a
$100,000 aquatic center proposed for Oak Bluffs. The center will
house the Vineyard's first public indoor swimming pools. They have
already lined up $20,000 from private donors, and are looking for
more sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The swim has not escaped the attention of Charlie Blair, the
harbormaster at Edgartown, a Vineyard port. He knows all 16 tide
rips that slice through the passage, and has lost count of the
number of mariners he has pulled out of trouble in the rips.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had this to say about Taylor:
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time she telephoned me, I thought she was joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second time she telephoned and told me about the
Australian, I thought she was crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now I'm beginning to think she might make it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is the founder and owner of Link, a company that
furnishes Boston realtors with housing market information. She is
slightly more than five solid feet tall, and Friday, dressed in a
business suit, she nursed a cup of coffee to describe the route she
took from an idea to a plan.
</P>
<P>
   It started back to the early 1990s when Taylor, a graduate of
Northeastern University, founded a small real estate business on
the Vineyard _ but was shocked to learn there was no place to swim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had grown up swimming (in Maryland). It's a way to zone out,
meditate, focus, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 she sold the business and moved back to Boston _ but not
before she met Annie Mechur, a Vineyard resident and distance
swimmer who has spearheaded an effort to build an aquatic center.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Taylor decided to join the effort in ernest, making
the first of what would be dozens of telephone calls to
harbormasters on both islands to learn about the local conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has twice swum from Boston Light to South Boston, a
distance of 10 miles.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, a stray email from Pittar landed in Taylor's
computer. Pittar had wanted to learn about a distance swim
elsewhere, but when he learned of Taylor's goal, he signed on. He
swims with the aid of two kayackers who blow whistles to guide him
_ one toot for a left course correction, two toots for a right
course correction. Pittar, who works for the Australian internal
revenue service, according to Taylor, will pay his own way to make
the swim, as will his kayackers.
</P>
<P>
   The intinerary _ much of it worked out by Blair in Edgartown _
will be as follows:
</P>
<P>
   The pair will leave Chappaquiddick Island about midway down the
beach at 7:45 a.m. They will catch the last of the ebb tide so that
swimming at 2 mph they reach the Muskeget Channel at about 9 a.m.
The channel is a trough where currents reach 5 mph at mid-tide. The
swimmers want to be there when the tide slacks.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the trip, the tides run north and south. But at
Muskeget Island, seven miles west of the swimmers' goal, the
currents flow east and west. Taylor figures she needs to reach
Muskeget by about noon to catch the westerly current toward
Muskeget Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where it gets really interesting. We miss Muskeget,
and we're going to have our hands full,'' she said. The pair would
find themselves caught in a powerful current pushing them north _
and away from their goal.
</P>
<P>
   The swimmers will be accompanied by a power boat and a pair of
kayackers each. In addition, a spotter airplane, provided by a
business associate of Taylor's, will give sponsors rides _ but also
look for schools of bluefish. The pilot will be in radio contact
with patrol craft that will either try to clear the path of the
fish or pull the swimmers from the water. In schools, hungry
bluefish behave like piranha, devouring just about anything in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the man o' war jelly fish, I think we'll just have to
put up with them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She will wear the most brightly colored bathing suit she owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure the sharks know I'm not a seal,'' she
said, ``and that they have never seen the likes of me.''
</P>
<P>
   This would appear to hold true for Vineyarders as well.

NEVADA'S TROUBLED PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN MAY HOLD LESSONS FOR
CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARSON CITY, Nev. _ Nevada has adopted a prescription drug
program for the elderly very similar to one approved last month by
the U.S. House of Representatives, but it is off to a rocky start.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies have spurned Nevada's invitation to provide
coverage. The risks and the costs are too high, they say, and the
subsidies offered by the state are too low.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada's experience offers ominous lessons for Congress,
especially Republicans, who want to subsidize insurance companies
to entice them into providing drug benefits to elderly and disabled
people on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   States often portray themselves as the laboratories of democracy
where good ideas originate and are tested, and Nevada's governor,
Kenny Guinn, a Republican, was far ahead of Washington in trying to
address the needs of the elderly in buying prescription drugs.
Guinn signed the legislation creating the program on June 9, 1999,
three weeks before President Clinton unveiled his proposal to add
drug benefits to Medicare. But Nevada officials say Guinn's ideas
may need more work in the laboratory before they can be put into
effect nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada was prepared to use 15 percent of the $1.2 billion it
expected to receive over the next 25 years from the settlement of
its lawsuit against tobacco companies _ $4.6 million this year, $37
million over six years _ to subsidize drug benefits for elderly
people with incomes of less than $21,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the state invited hundreds of insurance companies to
bid for its business, providing drug coverage for 10,000 to 14,000
people age 62 or older. Only one company responded, but it was
ineligible because it was not licensed to sell insurance in Nevada.
The state revised its invitation and reissued it on June 29, with
an Aug. 29 deadline for submission of proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara E. Buckley, a state assemblywoman who is co-chairwoman
of a task force monitoring use of the money, said: ``I have my
doubts that an insurance company will be able to offer meaningful
drug benefits under this program. If an insurance company does bid
on it but the benefits are paltry, senior citizens will be up in
arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force has refused to authorize the release of any money
until it sees details of a drug program, like the eligibility
criteria, premiums, deductibles, co-payments and benefit limits.
Most of those details will be decided by the successful bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Fend, a retired Navy captain who serves on the task force,
said he was surprised at the insurance industry's failure to
respond to the state's initial invitation. Asked why insurers did
not show more interest, he said: ``Probably because they don't
think they can make any money. If they thought they could make a
reasonable amount of money, they would probably buy into the
program and bid on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada program, created by the state Legislature last year
at the governor's request, is similar to the Republican plan
approved in the House on June 28 by a vote of 217-214, largely
along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Shelley Berkley, a Democratic congresswoman from Las Vegas,
said she did not understand why Congress would try to copy a
troubled state program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in the world, when it is not yet functioning'' for
thousands of low-income seniors in Nevada, ``would we try to
replicate it for the millions of seniors who are desperately in
need of affordable prescription medications?'' Berkley asked.
</P>
<P>
   Guinn said he remained ``fully committed'' to carrying out the
program, known as Senior Rx. He complained that Berkley had made
``a bitter partisan attack on a program which will benefit
thousands of Nevada's low-income senior citizens, both Republican
and Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the Nevada program, state officials say, premiums should
be in the range of $45 to $60 a month. The state would pay up to
$40 of that amount, based on the patient's income; the patient
would pay the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Health Insurance Association of America has
repeatedly told Congress that its members are not interested in
selling ``drug only'' insurance to the elderly. House Republicans
have insisted that if Congress provides the money, insurers or
other companies will step forward to offer coverage. Nevada's
experience raises questions about that argument.
</P>
<P>
   The state offered millions of dollars in subsidies, but insurers
were skittish. ``They didn't understand what we were looking for,''
said Scott Scherer, chief of staff to Guinn. ``They were confused
by the first request for proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Nevada's experience tends to confirm a point
made repeatedly by Republicans in Congress: private insurers need
freedom to design drug benefits as they think best, or they will
not participate in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Denice L. Miller, senior policy adviser to Guinn, summarized the
lesson this way: ``Let the insurers be creative. Let them be
flexible. Let seniors have some choices.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Medicare generally does not cover prescription drugs for people
outside a hospital. Democrats in Congress want to offer the same
drug benefits, with the same premiums, to all Medicare recipients.
Republicans reject that approach. Under the House-passed bill,
premiums, benefits and co-payments could vary from one private drug
plan to another, so long as the overall value was equivalent to
that of a standard policy defined by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Several states have programs to help older people obtain
prescription medicines. In most cases, the state itself is the
insurer, reviewing claims, paying pharmacies and deciding which
drugs a patient may receive. Nevada, rather than paying for drugs
outright, is the first state to develop a program that uses
subsidies to help people buy private drug insurance of the type
envisioned by many Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, as in Washington, insurers worry that the only people
who buy drug coverage will be those who really need it. State Sen.
Raymond D. Rawson, a Republican, said insurance companies were
``very worried'' about this phenomenon, known as adverse selection.
</P>
<P>
   Marie H. Soldo, executive vice president of Sierra Health
Services of Las Vegas, the largest managed care company in the
state, said: ``Insurers are unwilling to bear the entire financial
risk of drug coverage. The rapidly rising cost of pharmacy benefits
does not allow that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The only company that responded to the state's first
solicitation was Mature Rx Plus of Nevada. It was set up this year
by FFI Health Services, a privately held company based in
Macedonia, Ohio. James J. Mindala, chief executive of FFI, said the
company was seeking a Nevada license and still hoped to participate
in the program here. FFI was acquired this week by Advance Paradigm
of Irving, Texas, a provider of health-benefit management services.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada program had broad bipartisan support when it was
created under a bill passed unanimously by both houses of the state
Legislature in May 1999. But since then, prescription drugs have
become a major issue at the national level defining philosophical
differences between the parties, and specifically between the
Republican and Democratic candidates for Nevada's open seat in the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Democratic candidate for the Senate, Ed Bernstein,
has made prescription drugs the central issue of his campaign
against John Ensign, the Republican, who served in the House from
1995 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein flew to Tijuana, Mexico, last month with a group of
eight Nevadans to call attention to the lower prices charged for
prescription drugs south of the border. Back in Reno, he dumped
$100,000 in cash on the ground in front of a drug company
distribution center; it was, he said, a symbol of the campaign
contributions Ensign has taken from drug manufacturers. In
addition, Bernstein has toured the state in a recreational vehicle,
the ``Rx RV,'' talking about the need to make medicines more
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ensign says the Nevada program should be given
time to work.
</P>
<P>
   The insurers' role in the Nevada program is similar to that
envisioned in the House Republican bill. Insurers would ``provide
prescription drug and pharmaceutical services'' to the elderly
here, market the approved insurance policies and set up a network
of drugstores to fill prescriptions. The insurers are also expected
to offer mail-order pharmacy services and could establish a list of
preferred drug products, known as a formulary.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada officials, like federal officials, hope to use their
purchasing power to obtain discounts on drugs. Insurers could set
monthly or annual limits on benefits, but subscribers could still
buy drugs at a discount after they reached the limit on drugs
covered by their insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   The population of Nevada has been growing faster than that of
any other state. The number of Nevadans age 65 and older has
increased more than 60 percent since 1990.

GENERAL ACCUSED IN HIGH-RANKING HARASSMENT CASE RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case that spotlighted sexual harassment at the
highest ranks of the US military, a highly regarded general has
submitted his resignation after being accused of making improper
sexual advances on the Army's first three-star female general, the
Army announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Major General Larry G. Smith, who had been in line to become the
Army's deputy inspector general _ a role in which he would oversee
sexual harassment cases _ was given a written reprimand for conduct
unbecoming of an officer and for sexually harassing an officer. His
retirement is effective Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's inspector general said in a report released Friday
that Smith ``improperly displayed disrespect toward a commissioned
officer . . . by holding her and kissing her against her will.''
For the first time, the Army acknowledged publicly that it had
substantiated the claim made by Lieutenant General Claudia J.
Kennedy against Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The case, initiated after the Army announced Smith's appointment
last year and Kennedy informally expressed her reservations about
the promotion, followed a long line of sex scandals that made it
abundantly clear that sexual harassment was widespread in the armed
services.
</P>
<P>
   But punishment in past cases _ with one notable exception _ had
been criticized by women's rights groups as cursory or
non-existent. They included the groping of women at the Navy's 1991
Tailhook convention and charges that Army drill sergeants assaulted
female recruits at a training base in Aberdeen, Md., in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Major General David R. E. Hale retired after being the
target of a complaint by the wife of colonel who worked for him.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, in his first public comment on the matter, Friday denied
any wrongdoing. In a statement, he said, ``However, for the good of
my family and the Army, we have elected to put it behind us and
move on with our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also made her first public comment on the case, saying
she was ``satisfied with the Army's action. . . .As far as I'm
concerned, this matter is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army's treatment of Kennedy's accusation was being closely
watched by many of the 1.4 million people in the military _ men and
women alike. For many women, it showed that even those with high
rank are vulnerable to sexual advances. Kennedy, who retired from
her position last month after exactly 31 years of service, held a
higher rank than Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the system worked,'' said a female senior
officer in the Navy, who asked not to be identified. ``He was about
to be in charge of a sexual harassment panel and she was literally
dragged through the mud. But she did it because he was being put in
a position on an issue that she knew he did not have a moral
framework to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Navy officer said, ``I don't see it as an extra layer
of protection. This will be forever judged on a case-by-case basis.
There are still men getting away with it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Brigadier General Wilma L. Vaught, president
of the Women in Military Service Memorial Foundation, welcomed the
Army's report and predicted that ramifications of the case will be
felt throughout the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's becoming increasingly clear that sexual
misconduct is unacceptable,'' she said. ``It's unacceptable to both
men and women, and that those who err from the proper standards may
well be finding themselves facing investigation and potential
disciplinary action, as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army inspector general, Lieutenant General Michael W.
Ackerman, wrote in his report that Smith and Kennedy were in
``total disagreement'' about what happened in her office on that
day in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's version: He hugged Kennedy and possibly gave her a
``cheek kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's: Smith grabbed her, held her against her will, and
kissed her.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, Smith did not shy from defending
himself, providing a list of 52 character witnesses to testify on
his behalf. Ackerman's office interviewed seven of them.
</P>
<P>
   While Ackerman found that Smith was a ``highly respected officer
and gentleman with an unblemished career,'' he sided with Kennedy,
citing her credibility. The report noted that she had no motive for
making a false accusation.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, General John Keane, the vice chief of staff, gave
Smith an ``administrative memorandum of reprimand.'' He saw no
basis for a criminal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Flanders, who researched the role of women in the military
during the Gulf War, said the Kennedy-Smith case comes against a
backdrop of increasing pressure from Christian fundamentalist
groups and other socially conservative groups to limit women's role
in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the military to confirm what Kennedy is saying does fuel
the argument that . . . it's better to not have women in the
military at all, that they are all a big distraction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But women comprise 15 percent of the Army's 479,000 people, and
Flanders strongly doubted that the conservatives' push would yield
any step backward for the advancement of women in the military. ``I
think every time they do this type of investigation, it's a great
step forward for women in the military, and the women's movement as
a whole,'' she said.

DEMOCRATS RELEASE A CENTRIST PLATFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Democrats released a draft of their party
platform Friday that strongly articulates the centrist ``new
Democratic'' views of Vice President Al Gore, but also offers
concessions to liberals on several major issues, including trade,
the death penalty and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the 41-page document is an attempt to straddle the
same ideological divide that faces Gore in his quest for the
presidency. Even as he tries to reach out to moderate and
independent voters this fall, Gore will need to energize core
Democratic voters, who tend to be more liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On many major issues, the platform stakes out the centrist views
first championed by President Clinton in 1992. It calls for fiscal
discipline and paying off the national debt by 2012. It proposes
modest tax cuts. It advocates more accountability for schools and
teachers. It views global trade as crucial to economic prosperity.
It endorses tougher penalties, including the death penalty, for
violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But on many of those issues, the draft platform _ which will be
finalized at a meeting in Cleveland later this month _ also
includes provisions intended to mitigate the concerns of liberals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on trade, potentially the most divisive issue for
the party, the 2000 platform includes significantly stronger
language than the 1996 platform about protecting workers and the
environment against the potential downside of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore will insist on and use the authority to enforce worker
rights, human rights and environmental protections'' in trade
accords, the draft says. ``We should use trade to lift up standards
around the world, not drag down standards here at home.''
</P>
<P>
   In another tradeoff with labor, the document supports giving the
president broad powers to negotiate trade agreements _ a policy
known as ``fast track'' that is strongly opposed by unions. But it
also endorses legislation prohibiting the permanent replacement of
workers on strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an agreement to disagree,'' said Elaine Kamarck,
Gore's chief domestic policy adviser. ``There is plenty in here
that labor likes.''
</P>
<P>
   In another section, the platform asserts that increasing the
number of police officers and imposing tougher penalties, including
capital punishment, have helped reduce crime. But it will also
include language advocating that people facing the death sentence
have access to DNA testing and ``adequate'' legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The crime-fighting section includes another plank sought by
minority groups: the strong condemnation of racial profiling by
police officers. ``It views Americans as members of groups instead
of as individuals, and it is just plain shoddy policing,'' the
platform says.
</P>
<P>
   In a section with the centrist-sounding title ``Valuing our
families,'' the platform will say that the party ``supports the
full inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of a
nation.'' The provision is intended to suggest that the party
supports civil, though perhaps not religious, unions for gay
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Where the platform adopts Republican-sounding ideas, it usually
criticizes the Republican version of those ideas. On tax cuts, for
instance, the platform advocates reductions for ``working
parents.'' But it harshly attacks Gov. George W. Bush's proposed
across-the-board tax cut with populist language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would let the richest one percent of Americans afford a new
sports car and middle class Americans afford a warm soda,'' the
platform says.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The draft also echoes Gore's repeated attacks on Bush's proposal
to allow taxpayers to invest a portion of their Social Security
payroll taxes in the markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taken together, George W. Bush's $2 trillion tax cut, his
campaign-season spending proposals, his support for privatizing
Social Security add up to an assault on the surplus, causing
Americans to have to choose between drastic cuts in education and
health care or a return to the days of deficit spending,'' the
draft reads.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the platform highlights Gore's core campaign
proposals to preserve Social Security, expand health care, help
senior citizens to buy prescription drugs, overhaul the
campaign-finance system and strengthen gun regulations.
</P>
<P>
   And it devotes its largest section to outlining Gore's education
proposals, which include modernizing crumbling schools, requiring
teachers to pass periodic licensing tests and encouraging states to
take over failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, the platform praises the administration's
military interventions in Kosovo, Bosnia and Haiti. But it also
calls for a somewhat vaguely defined policy called ``forward
engagement'' that could defuse international problems before they
boil over into violence.
</P>
<P>
   In its language as well as its policies, the document echoes
Gore's stump speeches. It is divided into three major sections _
prosperity, progress and peace _ which were the themes of a recent
campaign swing by the vice president. It paraphrases the title of
Gore's book on the environment, saying, ``The Earth truly is in the
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   And it closes with a pet Gore slogan: ``Now, we say to America,
`You ain't seen nothing yet.'''

SLOWER US JOB GROWTH SPURS HOPES OF AN EASING ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Job growth across the nation was sluggish for the second
straight month in June, providing more evidence that the racing US
economy may be downshifting to a slower speed.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government reported Friday that business hiring
resumed last month at a modest clip, reversing a surprising decline
in May. But those gains in the private sector were offset by a
large drop in government payrolls as US Census takers, hired as
temporary workers, completed their assignments and were let go last
month. Total employment grew by just 11,000 last month.
</P>
<P>
   The June unemployment dipped by 0.1 percentage points, to 4
percent, a statistically meaningless change in a job market
stretched to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The government's monthly jobs report is the newest piece of data
to be scrutinized, like tea leaves, by economists seeking any clues
that the nation's nine-year expansion is experiencing a much-needed
cooling off that would also reduce inflationary pressures building
in the economy. The increase of 11,000 in total non-farm jobs
compared with a temporary, Census-inflated rise of 171,000 jobs in
May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is behaving very tamely,'' said Oscar Gonzalez,
economist for John Hancock Financial Services in Boston. Slower job
growth indicates the economy ``may be slowing down and coming into
the soft landing, which is in sharp contrast to what we were
thinking three months ago when there were worries we were on the
brink of overheating.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all economists find the signs of deceleration convincing,
pointing to continued strength in home sales and industrial
production. And if the economy is, indeed, slowing, some wonder
whether it is slowing enough to arrest inflation.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of strength in the June jobs report, for example, was the
rebound in business hiring. After private-sector payrolls had
shrunk 165,000 in May _ a revision from earliest estimates of a
116,000 reduction _ businesses expanded their payrolls in June by
206,000. Much of the hiring was in the services industry, ranging
from hotels and engineering to healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   Public-sector employment, mostly at the Census Bureau, declined
by 195,000 last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no evidence in the world the private sector is
actually shedding jobs,'' said William Dunkelberg, chief economist
for the National Federation of Independent Business, a Washington
trade group for small business. As for the overall slowdown, he
added, ``One of the interesting possibilities we have to face is
that slowing down could still be too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter job creation _ public and private _ was far below
the second quarter: Monthly average job growth, in April, May and
June, was 197,000, compared with 324,000 average growth for the
first three months of the year, according to Hancock's analysis of
US jobs data. Despite stronger business hiring in June, private
payrolls in the second quarter expanded at less than half the rate
during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The US unemployment has stopped declining, too. Since October,
the Labor Department said the jobless rate has stabilized at
between 3.9 percent and 4.1 percent at a time the economy's overall
growth, as measured by the gross national product, also moderated.
</P>
<P>
   If data in coming weeks also point to economic softening prior
to the Federal Reserve's next meeting, scheduled for August 22,
economists said the central bankers would be less likely to raise
interest rates for a seventh time. In their June meeting, Fed
members decided to wait for more economic data before doing so
again, deferring a rate hike; they left the federal funds rate
unchanged at 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the policy statement explaining its decision, the Fed said,
``Recent data suggests that the expansion of aggregate demand may
be moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the
economy's potential to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market was counting on that Friday. Each of the major
market indexes surged about 1.5 percent, buoyed by more moderate
job growth. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 154.51 points, to
10,635.98, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq index surged 62.63
points, to 4023.20. The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks also
rose, by 22.23 points to 1478.90.
</P>
<P>
   An end to the long-running bull market in stocks has also
somewhat undermined consumer confidence, albeit from record highs.
Friday there were indications a deflating stock market is hitting
Wall Street. Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., one of the nation's largest
retail securities firms, is considering cutting as many as 2,000
jobs from its brokerage unit _ about 5.4 percent of the unit's
total employment _ to lower costs, the Wall Street Journal
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is not so concerned about growth, per se, as it is that
growth would ignite inflation, spurred both by higher prices for
consumer goods and by rising wages.
</P>
<P>
   Overall prices, as measured by the consumer price index, are
accelerating though not at a pace that alarms economists. But oil
price hikes and rising wages continue to put upward pressure on the
CPI.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department estimated that wages rose 5 cents last
month, to $13.71 an hour; that is slightly above a 3 cent rise in
the previous month. And a predictor of future inflation, the
``future inflation gauge'' published by the Economic Cycle Research
Institute in New York, that is said to be closely watched by Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan edged up again in June after dipping in
May,
</P>
<P>
   Some of the employment gains made by the private sector in June
were attributed to summer's arrival, which brings vacations and
higher spending by Americans on leisure. Hotels and other
amusements saw faster-than-normal growth in jobs last month,
fueling growth in the services sector. The retail industry's
biggest gains were at eating establishments, which provided 35,000
of the 49,000 new jobs last month and bolstered an industry that
has suffered from a softening of consumer spending in recent month.
</P>
<P>
   The rush of graduating high school and college students into the
labor force also allowed some companies to hire for long-unfilled
positions, economists said. While data may show a cooler job
market, anecdotal evidence gathered by Jack Mohan, president in
Boston of Management Recruiters International, shows hiring, at
least in the New England region, is still frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses ``not only can't find people to fill the new jobs,''
Mohan said, ``they can't find people to replace the people who are
leaving. And people are leaving because there are better jobs
around.''

SUFFERERS OF RARE AFFLICTION FIND COMFORT AT CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEGAN SCOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rosaline Wu eats five bites of cantaloupe, and 18 hours
later she is violently ill. When she goes out to dinner, she may
treat herself to a slice of red pepper, while her family and
friends stuff themselves with pizza or hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   Wu is not bulimic or anorexic. She is not on a crash diet.
Instead, she suffers from a rare disease called intestinal
pseudo-obstruction, a painful condition that can have symptoms from
weight loss to cramps to constipation. Eating is so unpleasant for
Wu that she relies on a catheter in her neck for daily nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first find out you're going to be on this stuff, you
feel devastated and alone,'' said Wu, who had to quit her job as a
computer operator because of her illness.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday marks the end of an unusual three-day conference in
Boston for people such as Wu whose daily survival depends on
intravenous and tube-fed nutrition. More than 250 people gathered
from all over the United States with pouches, catheters and IVs in
tow for the aptly titled Conference for People Who Cannot (or do
not need to) Eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really helps to be connected to a lot of people,'' said
22-year-old Malisa Matheny of Doylestown, Pa., who started
suffering from nausea, pain, heartburn and vomiting eight years
ago. ``When you actually talk with somebody who has it, it's a
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, Matheny said she had never even heard of
pseudo-obstruction until she was diagnosed with it. Since then, she
has learned a lot through organizations such as conference
organizer, the Oley Foundation for Home Parenteral and Enteral
Nutrition, as well as the Association of Gastrointestinal Motility
Disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Wu said that connecting with the Oley Foundation ``brings life
back to you.'' Of the conference, she said, ``We all have a goal, a
joint reason why we're here: to learn more and feel better about
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo-obstruction afflicts roughly 11,000 Americans, making it
impossible for them to eat normally. Unlike actual intestinal
obstructions, which often can be removed, a pseudo-obstruction
prevents food from passing through even though there is no physical
barrier. Instead, abnormalities in nerves and muscles prevent the
digestive system from doing its job.
</P>
<P>
   The disorder strikes most frequently in children, about 200 of
whom are diagnosed with pseudo-obstruction each year. For many, the
``false'' blockage forces them to spend their lives receiving food
and nutrition through catheters or feeding tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, because the condition is so poorly understood, it
is often difficult for doctors to recognize and treat.
</P>
<P>
   Wu was diagnosed at birth with Hirschsprung's disease, an
illness akin to pseudo-obstruction in which the victim lacks the
nerve cells that enable the intestinal muscles to move stool
through the large intestine. But Wu knew she also had another
disease because her X-rays showed blockages in the large intestine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter what I ate or how much I ate, I would get
deathly sick,'' said the 52-year-old from Livonia, Mich. ``Nothing
was going through my system. It didn't matter if I had Jello or
water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ate, got sick, but never knew why,'' she said. ``All the air
and fluid would back all the way up to my heart. You really feel
horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Wu had a series of gastroenterology surgeries, doctors
found it difficult to diagnose her condition. In 1989, Wu read an
article in Family Circle magazine about a boy who had
pseudo-obstruction. For the first time, she found a name for her
disease. She took a test at the University of Michigan that showed
she had full-blown pseudo-obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pseudo-obstruction is very rare,'' said Andrea Anastas,
executive director of the American Pseudo Obstruction and
Hirschsprung's Disease Society. ``There are other gastrointestinal
disorders that mimic pseudo-obstruction. There are other tests
(doctors) are going to do before they jump to this conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bette Bond of Levittown, Pa., ate only from a feeding tube for
eight years because of constant gall bladder pain. She went through
$150,000 in three months for the nutrition costs and had to resort
to medical assistance. But the 30-year-old got back on her feet.
She now works full time as an occupational therapist, owns her home
and is engaged to be married.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see other people carrying pumps and being
connected,'' Bond said, referring to her fellow conventioneers.
``In normal, everyday life, you don't encounter a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much of American social life centered around food,
people with pseudo-obstructions find it difficult to always say no.
If Wu gets a craving for something, she enjoys it, but knows that
she's going to pay for it later. Bond said she finds her own
innovative way to socialize, such as carrying her own food to
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't . . never take another bite of food the rest of your
life,'' she said. ``You can't get away from eating. You can't stop
going out. You can't stop living because when you do you'll die.''

   Yosemite hikes a Rocky Mountain high
</P>
<P>
   By Susan Laccetti Meyers
</P>
<P>
   Yosemite National Park offers many scenic vistas, but hikers get
the best views when they experience its beauty up close.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service offers visitors a list of recommended
hikes on marked trails in both the valley and the high country. My
husband and I strung a couple of these hikes together to make
wonderful days in the park.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of recommended hikes of varied levels:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lower Yosemite Falls. This easy, 1/2-mile-round-trip hike
begins at the falls parking lot and goes to the base of the falls.
There is lots of spray in spring and early summer. And you can
often see rainbows in front of the falls on spring mornings. The
hike is a flat, 20-minute trip.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing our hike for 5 1/2 miles, we followed the trail past
the park stables, along the base of 7,000-foot-high Royal Arches
outcrop and past the historic Ahwahnee Hotel to Mirror Lake. This
fairly level trail had little elevation gain and often crossed tiny
bridges over waterfalls and streams.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bridalveil Fall. Another easy hike, although there is a slight
elevation gain. The trail from the parking lot to the base of the
falls is a 1/2-mile-round-trip walk. The spray is enormous in
spring and early summer. We left here soaking wet (including the
camera).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Panorama Trail. This hike can be done only after the snow
melts in early summer. The trail is 8 1/2 miles and is a one-way
descent from Glacier Point to the valley floor. The park service
labels this one of the most spectacular trails for its bird's-eye
view down into the valley. The trail passes Nevada Fall before
finishing its 3,200-foot descent. Allow six hours for this moderate
hike.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Vernal and Nevada falls. This moderate to strenuous hike can
be broken into two hikes. The hike to the Vernal Fall footbridge is
1.6 miles round trip and includes a 400-foot elevation gain. The
reward is an excellent view of the falls. To continue to the top of
the falls, you must hike one-half mile up more than 600 steps.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the top of Nevada Fall, continue past the top of
Vernal Fall an additional 2 miles along the Mist Trail, making it a
seven-mile-round-trip hike. This trail shaves very close to the
falls themselves. These hikes are often not open until summer
because of snow.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Half Dome. This hike on the famed granite outcrop is
recommended for skilledenuous, 17-mile-round-trip hike takes 10 to
12 hours and includes a 4,800-foot elevation gain. Cables are put
on the mountain to help with the climbing from mid-May until
mid-October. The park service warns not to attempt this climb if
there is any chance of rain, since most of the hike is on sheer
granite.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mariposa Grove. There are various trails throughout the grove,
but the most popular hike is to the Grizzly Giant sequoia tree
among the giant sequoias. This one-hour walk begins at the Mariposa
Grove parking lot. After reaching the 300-foot Grizzly Giant, you
can walk to Upper Grove, another three miles. We took an alternate
trail back through the north end of the grove to the parking lot,
and it was deserted and serene.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Upper Yosemite Falls. This strenuous hike takes six to eight
hours and begins at the Sunnyside Campground parking area. The
park's oldest trail, built in the mid-1870s, it leads to the top of
the world's fifth-largest waterfall. It looks easier than it is. At
7.2 miles round trip, plan on making a day of this hike.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tuolumne Meadows: Soda Springs. This is an easy,
1.5-mile-round-trip hike from the Lembert Dome parking lot on Tioga
Road. What makes this high-country hike through meadows unusual is
that carbonated water bubbles up through the ground at Soda
Springs. Unfortunately, it is believed to be contaminated, and the
park service recommends against drinking it.

 &HT;    A proposal to save the park from itself
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 9

<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone who visits Yosemite National Park loves its wide open
spaces, yet, ironically, room to roam can be precious in summer
because of all the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the seasonal tourist hordes, Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt recently unveiled a proposal for Yosemite that would
eliminate about 65 percent of parking spaces in Yosemite Valley and
reduce a lot of overnight accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   The park service plans to build satellite parking lots near the
valley's boundaries so visitors could take shuttle buses into the
valley. Officials also anticipate that the proposal would spur
hotel development just outside the 748,000-acre park.
</P>
<P>
   However, for the $343 million plan to be enacted, Congress would
have to fund it, something that may not be a priority with a new
president.
</P>
<P>
   During June, July and August, the park can average 21,000
visitors a day, compared with about 6,000 a day in spring or fall
and 3,400 a day in winter.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, the Yosemite Valley bottleneck can stretch up to
three miles. At the Wawona Road and El Portal Road entrance gates,
the wait to pay the $20 vehicle entrance fee can be 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, roads and bridges and structures have been
constructed, which, in some cases, have contributed to the sprawl
and crowding that visitors to Yosemite are trying to avoid,''
Babbitt said when he announced the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Under Babbitt's proposal, some roads and administrative
buildings in the valley would be torn out and lodging (excluding
campsites) sliced by 20 percent. This despite the fact that
overnight accommodations are at a premium, with rooms often booked
a year in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will not become official until public hearings are
finished this summer. After the hearings, the Interior Department
will review public concerns to consider any potential revisions.
The final plan should become policy in late December, when it is
expected to be signed by park service officials and the interior
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   This proposal has met resistance from some environmentalists _
who say it doesn't go far enough in eliminating cars and park
development _ and local business leaders, who fear it will scare
away tourists.

 &HT;    Ansel Adams' Yosemite
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 9.
 &HT;    By Susan Laccetti Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOSEMITE VALLEY, Calif. _ Photographer Ed McCormick stands on
Sentinel Bridge and points to an enormous granite outcrop known as
Half Dome, then to the fast-moving Merced River below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot downriver in the morning and upriver in the late
afternoon,'' McCormick advises 20 enthusiastic visitors, eager to
take pictures similar to the majestic landscapes of the late, great
photographer Ansel Adams. ``Watch for the light and emotional
impact the scene creates before you. That's what makes an image
successful. Light is everything, and photography is all about
reflective light. We are just capturing the reflective light off
the subject in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormick is carrying on the spirit of the legendary landscape
photographer by hosting a two-hour Ansel Adams camera walk in
748,000-acre Yosemite National Park. Adams, who died in 1984,
offered short photography lessons beginning in 1940 as a way for
aspiring photographers to experience this magnificient region of
the Sierra Nevadas through his lens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my destiny when I first experienced Yosemite,'' Adams
wrote in his autobiography. ``Yosemite Valley is a national
shrine.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams lived many years in Yosemite, then made it home away from
home after moving to Carmel, Calif., in 1961. His legacy is the
generations who have identified with his black-and-white images of
nature's grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Yosemite draws 3.6 million visitors a year _ making it one of
the busiest National Park Service sites _ and many credit Adams'
photos for the park's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This park has an international reputation because of Ansel
Adams' photography,'' said the Rev. David Johnson, a Welches, Ore.,
minister who was on the camera walk with his wife, Carol Jean.
``Every year I have to have an Ansel Adams calendar of the park.
Now I want to see the vantage points firsthand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ansel Adams camera walks are offered three days a week in
high season, and one of those days the instructor focuses on
black-and-white photography. The walks are free and sponsored by
the Ansel Adams Gallery, located next to the park visitors center.
The gallery also offers more in-depth, multiday photography
workshops, costing about $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to see the park from Adams' perspective is
independently hiking to many of the places he photographed:
Yosemite Falls, Half Dome, Mariposa Grove, Mirror Lake, Vernal
Fall, El Capitan, Bridalveil Fall, Tuolumne Meadows and Tenya Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Adams fell instantly in love with Yosemite in 1916 at age 14,
when his family visited from San Francisco. ``The splendor of
Yosemite burst upon us and it was glorious,'' he wrote of the
experience. ``Little clouds were gathering in the sky above the
granite cliffs, and the mists of Bridalveil Fall shimmered in the
sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The park's staggering beauty later inspired him to forgo a
career as a concert pianist _ for which he had studied _ and choose
photography instead. In 1928, Adams married Virginia Best in
Yosemite Valley at Best's Studios, her father's gallery, which
showed paintings by local landscape artists. The gallery would
later exhibit Adams' famous photos and today operates as the Ansel
Adams Gallery. My husband and I visited Yosemite in spring, and it
was easy to tap into the passion Adams had for the park. Spring is
when the snowmelt feeds the multitude of waterfalls to full force.
I had been here before in the fall, and no matter the season, the
park's beauty is so overwhelming that we felt like we were standing
in a painting. Many times, all we could say was, ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   The temptation to shoot photos of mule deer, wildflowers, the
Merced, giant sequoias, snowcapped peaks, granite cliffs, alpine
lakes and tranquil meadows made roll after roll of film disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cSentinel Bridge and Cook's Meadow. Adams' most famous
Yosemite photo, the 1960 shot of ``Moon at Half Dome,'' was taken
at Ahwahnee Meadow, near the stately Ahwahnee Hotel in the valley,
McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   Another prime place to take a picture of Yosemite Falls is from
the Yosemite Chapel. Shooting from behind the chapel, with the
highest waterfall in North America (2,425 feet) in the background,
was postcard-perfect.
</P>
<P>
   During our four-day visit, we hoped to see the much-raved-about
Tuolumne Meadows, a high-country zone of meadows, lakes and peaks
that is a three-day hike from Yosemite Valley (or a 90-minute
drive). The high country was a favorite of Adams, who was away on a
monthlonark boundaries either in Yosemite Valley, the south end of
the park or in the high-country lodgings (seasonal).
</P>
<P>
   Curry Village, open in the valley year-round, offers three types
of accommodations. Canvas tent cabins are $39.75 daily, regular
wood cabins without bath $57.25 and cabins with baths $74.75.
</P>
<P>
   The motel-like Yosemite Lodge, at the base of Yosemite Falls,
offers rooms for $99.75-$124.75 in peak season (April through
November) and $84.25-$101.50 in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The historic Ahwahnee Hotel has upscale hotel rooms ranging from
$279.50 to $821 nightly most of the year, $253.53-$745.51 in
December and January. A national historic landmark, the circa-1926
Ahwahnee offers all the amenities of a big-city hotel, including
the gourmet Ahwahnee Dining Room (dinner jacket required).
</P>
<P>
   The best place to stay in the south end of the park is the
Wawona Hotel, circa 1879, near the Mariposa Grove of giant
sequoias. Rooms run $94-$128.75 from April to October. During the
off-season, room rates begin at $84 nightly.
</P>
<P>
   In the high country in summer, accommodations may be available
at the Tuolumne Meadows Lodge and White Wolf Lodge. These
metal-framed canvas tent cabins, similar to ones in Curry Village,
have old-fashioned wood stoves and are open from mid-June until
early September. They run $48.50-$52.75.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations may be made up to one year and one day in advance
through Yosemite Concession Services Corp., 559-252-4848 or
YosemitePark

<P>
   CAMERA WALK INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   To sign up for an Ansel Adams camera walk, log on to
www.anseladams.com. They are offered different days during
different seasons but are always free. The multiday workshops,
known as the Ansel Adams Gallery Photography Workshops, usually
cost about $100 per day. One four-day workshop available later this
month, for example, will take participants through the Yosemite
high country and to Mono Lake, outside the park's eastern boundary.
</P>
<P>
   Information on those workshops, too, can be found at
www.anseladams.com or 1-800-568-7398.

<P>
   LIMOGES, France _ Five years ago, Lance Armstrong was an
entirely different cyclist, far removed from the overall athlete
and defending Tour de France champion that he is today.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite what he accomplished last year, it was here in
Southern France in 1995 that Armstrong created what he still to
this day considers his most cherished sporting memory.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong rode conservatively Friday afternoon and remained 12th
overall as he neared the Pyrenees Mountains. Five years ago this
month, he picked up a stage win in Limoges, the second of his
career, and the last time until Friday that the Tour made a stop in
this city known for its intricate porcelain.
</P>
<P>
   And he dedicated that stage win immediately to his fallen
teammate, Fabio Casartelli, who had died three days before. As
Armstrong crossed the finish line that afternoon, wearing the
colors of Team Motorola, tears were in his eyes as he pointed
toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   His thoughts were with Casartelli on Friday afternoon as he rode
in the middle of the peloton into Limoges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is a special place for me,'' Armstrong said
after completing stage seven. ``To this day, this is my greatest
memory in cycling because I didn't do it for myself, I did it for
Fabio.''
</P>
<P>
   Casartelli had been a popular teammate with Motorola and one of
the squad's biggest names. The gregarious Italian had won an
Olympic gold medal in 1992. He had a baby just beginning to walk
back home in Italy when he started the 1995 Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loved Fabio,'' said Bill Stapleton, Armstrong's
agent.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Tour had gotten through the majority of the
mountain stages in 1995, Spaniard Miguel Indurain was wearing
yellow and in control of the race. On the final mountain stage in
the Pyrenees, Casartelli was trying to get down the du
Portet-d'Aspet, when he crashed off the course. He hit his head and
died immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after Casartelli's death, Armstrong found himself
among a pack of eight breakaway riders who had left the peloton.
About 12 miles from the finish line, Armstrong broke free of the
group. He finished the final miles alone to claim the stage victory
on his way to completing his first-ever Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was such a hard-fought victory,'' recalled Chris
Carmichael, Armstrong's longtime coach. ``And I remembered how he
pointed toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on a team like this, you get really close to these
guys. You're with them 24 hours a day. Fabio's death really
affected Lance.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years removed from that stage victory, Armstrong is
defending his Tour title. On Friday, he was biding his time for the
Pyrenees, riding in the main group of riders who finished 1 minute,
11 seconds in back of Christophe Agnolutto.
</P>
<P>
   Like Armstrong did five years ago, Agnolutto claimed his stage
win by riding solo. Except the 31-year-old Frenchmen rode by
himself for much of the rainswept race, going alone for the final
79.67 miles and finishing in 5 hours, 11 minutes, 42 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Agnolutto started celebrating about 10 feet from the finish line
as he acknowledged the loud cheers from his fiercely proud
compatriots. Until Agnolutto, no French rider had claimed a stage
victory since Jacky Durand did so eight stages into the 1998 Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's race did little to change the overall standings.
Telekom's Alberto Elli still was wearing yellow, after going
through the seven stages in 24 hours, 11 minutes, 32 seconds.
Armstrong is 5:54 behind.

 &HT;    Strong economy is driving a cultural building boom
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 9.
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to our audio tour of new museums. (Please adjust your
headset volume to a comfortable level.)
</P>
<P>
   Beep.
</P>
<P>
   In the upper left-hand corner of our gallery _ that would be
Tennessee _ you can see two vastly different works. The white art
deco building being gutted and renovated is Nashville's former
downtown post office, built in 1934, the future home of the Frist
Center for the Visual Arts. What's unusual about the Frist is that
it's being built exclusively to host traveling mega-exhibits; it
won't collect art of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Beep.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Frist, note the burst of activity southwest of
downtown. That's the Cheekwood Museum of Art and Botanical Garden
on the 55 acres of the former Cheek family estate. That freshly cut
swath through the woods is its 1.2-mile sculpture trail. Note the
light flashing from the nearby stables; that's from the video
installations running in each of the remodeled stalls, reborn as
part of the contemporary art galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Beep.
</P>
<P>
   Please move to the center of the gallery and turn to your right.
Consider Savannah. See the sparks flying from the historic
district? Feel the tension in the sultry air? That's where
preservationists and arts leaders are dueling over the details of
the Telfair Museum of Art expansion, a contemporary design
struggling to gain a foothold amid the city's storied squares.
</P>
<P>
   Beep.
</P>
<P>
   Now walk across the lower half of the room, toward the Gulf of
Mexico. Recognize Tampa? You may not in a few years. Plans are
under way to reshape downtown with a cultural district anchored by
a new building for the Tampa Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Beep.
</P>
<P>
   That's the end of this abbreviated tour, but just the beginning
of the story.
</P>
<P>
   When the High Museum of Art in Atlanta completes plans for a
building expansion costing at least $60 million, it won't have the
only crane on the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 other cities in the Southeast are engineering new
art museums or expanding existing facilities in a major way. Just
about everywhere you look _ Biloxi, Miss.; Mobile; New Orleans;
Raleigh _ some city is looking to enhance its cultural calling card
with art repositories. Total cost of this building boom: an
estimated $325 million.
</P>
<P>
   Add the art museums being rolled out in Texas _ in Houston,
Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin, Corpus Christi _ and the South's
current projected expenditures for new building easily surpass half
a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is hardly a regional phenomenon. Riding the strong
economy, a museum boom has reverberated around the country
throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It includes history, science and children's museums, but art
museums ``lead the pack,'' says Jack Nokes, director of the Texas
Association of Museums in Austin. They draw the most visitors and
tend to have the richest patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Big museums opened in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the
1990s. Houston's Museum of Fine Arts expansion was unveiled this
year. New York's Museum of Modern Art is planning an expansion the
projected cost of which has reached a staggering $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the whole Zeitgeist of the country,'' says Diane
Lesko, director of the Telfair Museum of Art in Savannah. ``Museums
in the past 15 to 20 years have been trying to become nonexclusive,
to reach out to all aspects of the community, and it's working. The
lines between going to Disney World and going to the museum are
becoming more muddled.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit entrepreneurs
</P>
<P>
   Varied programming is one reason museums are reaching a wider
audience. They've courted families and casual visitors with
affordable, innovative shows that appeal to more mainstream taste.
Impressionism and big-name retrospectives _ Picasso, Matisse,
Norman Rockwell _ have been enormously successful for the High
Museum, where family membership for a year is still a modest $75;
that includes admission for two adults and children 17 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret why the Southeast has gotten caught up in museum
mania _ these facilities play an important role for cities building
their cultural-tourism clout. A recent Wall Street Journal story
noted that museums annually outdraw major-league baseball teams.
According to the National Endowment for the Arts, art museums
outdraw science museums and botanical gardens, respectively, by
almost a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art museums have become community gathering places and
destinations for visitors from out of the region,'' says Lawrence
Wheeler, director of the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh,
which is raising money for a new building projected to cost about
$60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Success at the turnstiles has prompted a space crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very clever programmers out there who know how
to get people excited,'' Wheeler says. ``As a result, most of these
(existing) museums have become too small.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stretched to the max,'' says Lani Czyzewski, spokeswoman
for the Tampa Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because there are no national data tracking museum
expansion, the busy rate of building activity in the Southeast
comes as a surprise to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unaware of most of it,'' says Michael Shapiro, director
of the High Museum of Art. ``But it's compelling testimony that the
arts are in the ascent in the Southeast. It only confirms
everything we're experiencing here in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Some call this proliferation of art museums part of the region's
cultural maturation. As Southern cities have landed various
professional sports franchises, they're seeking other ways to raise
their profiles and reach out to another kind of tourist.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's precisely the thinking here,'' says Emily Kass,
director of the Tampa Museum of Art. ``What's unique about this is
that it's not San Francisco and New York, it's Mobile and St. Pete
and Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   Museums have also worked hard to shed their elitist image and
become aggressive entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're working with other community entities _ schools,
service groups _ to broaden their base of support,'' says Esther
Hockett, executive director of the Southeastern Museums Conference
in Baton Rouge, La. ``It doesn't always turn into financial gain,
but it helps as an attitude thing. People say, `If the museum is
going to be there for us in more a broad-based way, then we need to
be there for the museum.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, improvement doesn't always mean getting into the
expensive field of art collection or throwing up a new building.
</P>
<P>
   In Nashville, surveys showed that people were tired of seeing
huge popular exhibits bypass the city and opt instead for, say,
Memphis. So the Frist Center will operate as an exhibition center
filled with rotating collections on loan from museums around the
world. It will also borrow from Nashville institutions and
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Another Tennessee facility, the Hunter Museum of American Art in
Chattanooga, designed an expansion, but decided against building it
when officials discovered there would be little left over for
operating costs. Instead, the museum spent $2 million on
renovations and funneled the remaining funds into its endowment _
which, says director Cleve Scarbrough, has reached $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many art institutions get so ambitious and so excited, they
end up sticking their necks out too far,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At Nashville's Cheekwood, one of the more popular features of a
recent expansion _ a sculpture trail with 16 pieces of art _ cost
less than $10,000. ``We got some chain saws and a chip machine and
put a trail in the woods,'' says museum director John Wetenhall.
``It's the biggest and best part of our expansion. We took
advantage of natural space that architects can't reproduce and
historical buildings that already existed.''
</P>
<P>
   History vs. expansion
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's nothing like the architectural splendor of a new
museum to stir enthusiasm and grab headlines. In Savannah, however,
a dispute between the forces of historic preservation and
contemporary art is at the heart of the most problematic among the
region's expansions.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, the Telfair Museum of Art has had
Boston-based architect Moshe Safdie redesigning his $16 million
expansion to meet the strict building requirements of that city's
historic district. The annex design calls for a glassy, modern
building to house contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point for the city's historic review board is a
bridge over York Lane, an alleyway that bisects the two lots on
which the expansion will be built. Such lanes are strenuously
protected in the design standards adopted for the historic
district, and the board has rejected Safdie's revisions. Another
vote is scheduled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' says Telfair director Lesko, ``is that some
people (on the review board) don't appreciate anything modern and
don't like this building or this architect.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the museum expansions slated for the Southeast vary
in size, shape and mission. Yet museum leaders invariably agree on
one point: The good times won't last forever, and when the economy
takes a downturn, you'd better have a substantial endowment stashed
away _ a savings account that's protected from roller-coaster
economics and political mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the Southeast's bricks-and-mortar boom is being
accompanied by campaigns to raise endowment funds to operate the
buildings. The Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Fla., is
raising $20 million for its expansion, but only $12 million is
slated for the new building; the rest is for endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Says Tampa's Kass: ``One of the scarier prospects is, what
happens when the building boom ends and we have all these great
museums? We have to make sure we can fulfill their promise.''

 &HT;    Americana pushes an edgier country mix
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 9
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nashville singer-songwriter Steve Earle's new album,
``Transcendental Blues,'' winds around the roots of nearly every
form of music that springs from the hearts and history of plain
people _ henpecking bluegrass, lonely Hank Williams country/blues,
Cajun fiddles, bouncy cantina accordion, working-class rock _ with
lyrics about being lonely, broke, tired, in love and even taking
that long, last walk down death row.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a country song, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not in today's Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   You're not going to hear much of anything new on mainstream
country radio that sounds remotely like the unpolished origins of
the genre, the sounds of the front porch, church choir, beer joint,
cotton fields or street corner. Not even hall-of-famers Johnny Cash
or Willie Nelson get much airplay. Too country.
</P>
<P>
   But over the commercial fence, out there in small music halls
and home recording studios, are a slew of younger purists who
travel the musical road laid by the Carters, Jimmie Rogers, Bill
Monroe, Bob Wills, Loretta Lynn and Willie Nelson. Acts such as
Earle, Texas troubadour Jimmie Dale Gilmore and soulful
singer-songwriter Shelby Lynne (who all appear in back-to-back
shows at Variety Playhouse this week), have always cared more about
how they sound than how they're selling.
</P>
<P>
   For years, this nonconformist attitude just about guaranteed you
would spend your career in noble pursuit of your muse while living
in mainstream obscurity and torn-sofa poverty. But today, Earle
sits on a deck overlooking his pool at his home outside Nashville,
basking in the glow of a No. 1 record, sales of 20,000 albums in
the first week of release, and more glowing reviews from major
publications that he can fit in a press kit.
</P>
<P>
   Earle and many other of the loose collection of artists who have
been labeled alternative country are gaining clout professionally
and personally as the music format known as Americana gains
momentum around the country, no doubt something of a backlash
against pop-oriented, mainstream country.
</P>
<P>
   ``My suspicion is we're on the verge of a new outlaw movement,''
says Jessie Scott, Americana editor of the music industry trade
publication, the Gavin Report. ``I think we potentially could
herald the next style of country.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least influence it heavily.
</P>
<P>
   What is Americana? It is perhaps best described as what it isn't
_ commercial or predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defining this music is something we have actively resisted
doing,'' explains Grant Alden, 41, co-editor of the alternative
country magazine No Depression. ``It is song- and lyric-driven
music that has some connection to this country's musical past. That
may be Hank Williams' past or a Duke Ellington past or a Woody
Guthrie past or a Robert Johnson past.''
</P>
<P>
   Although elusive, the common denominator for the genre is a long
taproot that reaches back to regional or country music. But the
roster of artists who now consider themselves Americana are wildly
diverse in style, from the Appalachian wails of Gillian Welch to
the honky tonk rockabilly of BR5-49 or the passionate,
country-tinged rock of Lucinda Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The three artists performing in Atlanta this week are
representative cornerstones of this burgeoning musical family.
</P>
<P>
   With his weathered face and thin, shoulder-length hair, Gilmore
looks more like a 19th-century daguerreotype than a star. With his
mystical lyrics and high-nasal tenor, he has more in common with
Mother Maybelle Carter than Tim McGraw. Lynne is this year's
Americana breakout star. After dabbling in mainstream country in
Nashville in the early 90s, she headed west and hooked up with
Sheryl Crow's former producer, Brian Bottrell. The result is the
critically acclaimed ``I Am Shelby Lynne,'' which springs from the
place where soul meets country. Tattooed Earle draws as much from
gritty, L.A. rock as country. His latest album mixes in some world
music touches _ accordion, harmonium_ but carries on the winning
formula that's made him a star of the format: This is his fourth
album to debut at No. 1 on the Americana charts.
</P>
<P>
   Though roots music has found a home on college and arts radio
stations since the Austin-based ``progressive'' country movement of
the '70s, it was formally dubbed ``Americana'' in the early '90s by
programmers who felt the pop-leanings of mainstream country were
leaving many artists without a forum. Radio stations exclusively
dedicated to the format began springing up around the country,
including WMLB/1170 AM in Cumming, which switched from current
country to Americana in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   For years, they remained a mostly under-the-radar collection of
static-riddled AM signals, or FM frequencies that weren't major
spots on the dial. And for the most part, like WMLB (which you
can't even pick up inside the Perimeter), they still are.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of stations dedicated to the Americana format in
the U.S. has grown from a handful to an estimated 150+. And they
are starting to coalesce as a force in the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Gavin began the country's first Americana music chart,
to officially track airplay of alternative country music. In five
years, it has grown into one of the publication's most sought-after
sources of information. (www.gavin.com)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In March, a group of musicians, producers and radio
programmers formed the Americana Music Association, dedicated to
promoting the format through radio airplay, publicity and
marketing. Their cheeky slogan (lifted from the Man in Black
himself, Johnny Cash): ``We Walk the Line.''
(www.americanamusic.org)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Americana artists have begun to sell records beyond their
small fan bases. In the past year, acts such as Earle, honky-tonk
torch singer Kelly Willis, Texas swing/boogie band Asleep at the
Wheel, and sweet-voiced bluegrass fiddler Alison Krauss scored gold
records based on Americana airplay.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Perhaps most significantly, Americana is turning out to be the
most popular radio format people turn to when it comes to Internet
listening. When the Arbitron Co. launched its first survey of
audiostream Web listening last October, three of the top radio
sites were Americana stations: KFAN-FM in Fredericksburg, Texas,
KPIG in Monterey, Calif. (www.kpig.com), and KHYI-FM in Plano,
Texas (www.khyi.com).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For the first time, corporate radio has expressed interest in
programming Americana. Atlanta-based Cumulus Communications is
experimenting with the 100,000-watt KBCY/99.5 FM in Abilene, Texas,
by yanking some of the newer Nashville music and replacing it with
tunes by Americana artists. And major labels in Nashville are
starting to sign a few of these acts: Hank Williams III on Curb
Records, Neal Cody on Mercury, Charlie Robison on Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Tony Brown, head of MCA Records, is one of the few
power brokers in Nashville who has shaped the careers of both
Americana artists and mainstream country acts. The one-time
keyboardist for Elvis Presley has not only produced George Strait,
Wynonna, Vince Gill, and Reba McEntire; he is known as a risk-taker
who also signed Kelly Willis, Marty Stuart, the Mavericks, Lynne
and Earle to a major label.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Brown produced Earle's debut MCA album, ``Guitar
Town,'' a poetic musical journey about crawling out of smalltown
Texas. Though it didn't spawn a hit nor make Earle a country star,
the very country record is widely considered a classic _ and early
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first came out, there wasn't such a thing as
Americana,'' Brown says of ``Guitar Town.'' ``It was honest, and
anytime you do an honest record it just makes more of an impact
than if it is trying to meet the supply and demand of radio.''
</P>
<P>
   He now thinks the album clearly foreshadowed the emergence of
the Americana format, ``which at first everybody felt was a passing
phase. But it's become a good term, and it doesn't seem to be going
away. You can see that the creative sector of the music industry
definitely wants it to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who's listening?
</P>
<P>
   The typical Americana fan more than likely grew up listening to
alternative country artists _ such as Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris,
Joe Ely, Kinky Friedman, John Prine, Commander Cody. Throw in a
little Grateful Dead (on the left) and Johnny Cash (on the right),
and you have the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Alden says he created No Drepression magazine for this group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of generations of people who discovered
through college radio that there was music outside the mainstream
that was interesting. They've gotten older, so punk and ska don't
interest them anymore. But they know there is something outside the
Backstreet Boys, and they are looking for something. They grew up
with an AM radio out in the garage or in dad's car that played
old-time country music, so it has a welcoming quality to it. As my
generation begins to settle a little bit, things that sound like
home aren't so bad. If it has an edge and sounds like home, it's
even better. That why Steve Earle and Jimmie Dale (Gilmore) are
attractive to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessie Scott, Nashville editor of the Americana charts for the
music industry trade publication, the Gavin Report (a smaller
version of Billboard) thinks Americana could be described as
``grunge country,'' since it tends to lean toward self-examination
and expressiveness rather than glamor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults who felt alienated by pop and rock in the early '90s
gave country its huge boost in popularity at that time, because
they were drawn to people like Mary Chapin Carpenter and Dwight
Yoakam,'' Scott says. ``Then country got seduced by MTV. They made
it younger, more like rock, more visually oriented as opposed to
aurally oriented. We saw belly buttons for the first time. And that
didn't speak to the original people who came over to country. And
some of them are finding Americana.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoughit's unlikely the Americana format will ever take away the
majority of mainstream country's audience, it may put the pressure
on Music Row to get back to basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are adults out there who want to hear music,'' says
Earle, who was recently on the cover of the Gavin Report under the
headline ``Americana Kingpin.'' ``But we've created a situation
where it genuinely isn't profitable to have artists who sell less
than 200,000...Record companies aren't just owned by corporations.
They are owned by the most powerful telecommunications companies in
the world. That makes labels kind of a slave to shareholders. So
you're not selling records, you're selling stock. And there ain't
nothin' more anti-art than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom-line broadcasting execs such John Dickey, vice president
of Atlanta-based broadcasting group Cumulus Communications,
question whether Americana will ever be more than an arty stepchild
in the dollars-and-cents world of radio and records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't qualify it as a full-force, homegrown, grassroots
cry for this type of music,'' he says. ``I haven't seen anything
quantitatively that all country programmers should be paying
attention to, or to indicate it's the next big thing in country
music...We own 55 country stations, and what we're seeing in all
the market research is a return to the gold stuff from the late
'80s and early '90s...Country's shares have receded by 20 percent
around the U.S. Stations can't play every me-too act Nashville
throws at them. Americana is hitting on a sensitive chord.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, mavericks of Americana such as Earle _ who are the
antithesis of the 8x10 glossy world of Music Row _ are definitely
feeling new appreciation for their art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm digustingly happy,'' Earle says, eyeing the first date
here in Atlanta of his upcoming tour. ``I'm selling more records
than I have in a long time. I've never been a priority at a record
label before. Nobody is mad at me, and I'm not mad at anybody. We
had to scramble to find $25,000 to make a video, but we did and now
it's going to VH1...I wake up in the morning and do something I
love to do for a living, and I'm grateful for that.''
</P>

8600 and Soundline number 427 for Steve Earle or 428 for Jimmie
Dale Tilmore and Shelby Lynne. Each call costs 50 cents.

 &HT;    `Harry' goes to Braille in record time
 &HT;    By Kirk Kicklighter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robyn Herrera'sson John, 7, loves Harry Potter books.
``He reads them every chance he gets,'' said Herrera, as she
browsed through children's titles at the National Federation of the
Blind convention at Atlanta's Marriott Marquis this week. ``He's
really pumped about the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest book, ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' was
released today, the same day Scholastic Press publishers
transmitted the book electronically to the National Braille Press
in Boston. John, who is blind, will have to wait a couple of weeks
to get his own edition of Harry Potter IV printed in Braille the
system of printing and writing for the blind using raised dots that
are felt with the fingersTen percent of books published in the
United States are printed in Braille, and most of those are delayed
a year or more before they are transferred from the written word.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a big difference that he'll be able to get the book
near the same time as his friends,'' said Herrera. ``He won't feel
left out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braille copies are thick; about seven notebook-size volumes
make up one book. ``But the kids don't mind it one bit ... they say
the bigger the better,'' said Diane Croft of National Braille
Press. ``Just like people with sight, blind children love to have
books they can hold and browse through.''
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 55,000 blind children younger than 18 in
the United States. About 10 percent of them can read Braille. That
number was closer to 50 percent before books on tape became
available. ``There's a handicap much worse than blindness _ it's
call illiteracy,'' said Croft.
</P>
<P>
   The NBP, which publishes a children's book each month and has
offered volumes since 1927, plans a first run of 500 for the new
Potter book. A typical run is 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll print more and more if we have to,'' said Croft.
``Adults want it, too. One woman told me her fingers were going
numb because she couldn't stop reading Harry Potter.''

 &HT;    Potter's popularity aside, epic prevails
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 9.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it weren't for Jerry Hall, it might very well have been the
``national humiliation'' that Anthony Holden feared.
</P>
<P>
   People at first wondered why Hall, the supermodel and ex-wife of
Mick Jagger, should be on the jury in the first place. And not only
Hall but also the actress Imogen Stubbs and the politician Ann
Widdecombe. Here you had one of the most prestigious literary
awards in Britain, the Whitbread Prize, and the jury was packed
with pop culture celebrities and a politician. No one needed to ask
if the sun had set for good on the British Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter's invisible cloak was suddenly quite visible and a
bit irritating.
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing to please the kiddies, but when Pottermania
nearly trumps a Nobel Prize-winning poet things are out of hand. By
a 5-4 vote, and only after much acrimony, in January the Whitbread
jury awarded the prize to Seamus Heaney for his new translation of
``Beowulf.'' Heaney must have been humbled even in a moment of
honor, his contemporary rendering of a 1,000-year-old epic
entangled in so unedifying a debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beowulf,'' said those wanting to award the prize to J.K.
Rowling's ``The Prisoner of Azkaban,'' was what it had always been
_ ``a boring book about dragons.'' They liked Rowling's dragons
better, to say nothing of the orphan Potter himself, riding his
broom and slashing his magic wand.
</P>
<P>
   No one wanted to begrudge the kids a good time, and _ brows are
mopped here _ at least they were reading. But a fable that's been
around a while was one thing and hokum about Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall dissociate myself from (the Whitbread) publicly,''
Holden, a biographer and a juror for the prize, harrumphed during
the deliberations. Joining him, Hall, Stubbs and Widdecombe lobbied
for literature over entertainment, and thus was the English
language spared unspeakable embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers know hard cases make bad law. A 5-4 decision by the U.S.
Supreme Court portends future litigation. But don't tell 3.8
million kids that the jury's still out on their hero. And don't
tell the marketers who've adopted Harry that orphans should be
cared for but not made pecuniary princes.
</P>
<P>
   It was inevitable. The marketing phenomenon would overwhelm the
story. Harry was born in children's imagination as a character,
fabulous in the fullest sense. He will die there as another
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable did not happen with C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of
Narnia books, still popular half a century after they were written.
But they are not only of a different time; they were also written
in a culture in which media and marketing had not yet become the
twin engines of commerce. True enough, the Potter books at first
sold by word-of-mouth, but the money men soon caught wind and saw
their real potential: Take a perfectly good-natured, often witty,
unfailingly perky tale, toss in vague allegories of Good and Evil
and get the train rolling. Harry's magic wand turns everything it
touches to green.
</P>
<P>
   Before Scholastic Press spilled the beans two weeks ago, the
title of Harry IV was a tightly held secret. But it hardly
mattered. ``They could call it `Harry Potter and the Brown Paper
Bag,' and it would still sell out,'' one publishing executive said.
</P>
<P>
   One can hardly blame Rowling, a single mother on public
assistance only a few years ago, for cashing in. You'd do it, and I
don't know that I'd be above it myself. ``She's not
anti-merchandising at all,'' says Daniel Romanelli of Warner Bros.,
which will market Harry toys by the truckload. ``She's very
pro-Harry Potter.'' The man is either disingenuous or naive.
</P>
<P>
   The more Harry Potter becomes a marketing phenomenon, the less
it matters whether the books are swell or just so-so. The less
reason there is to read the stories for what they are or to enjoy
Rowling's language for its charms. The latter are taken for
granted, and rather too readily. There are, truth be told, delights
on almost every page. But there are also passages like this, from
``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' the snowflake that
became a snowball that became an avalanche:
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that
recorded the house points the next day thought there'd been a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beowulf'' has its difficulties, but this is not especially
wonderful prose. Neither is it a single bad sentence unable to hide
itself; there are others. Kids, especially younger ones, haven't
learned what good prose is and adults have forgotten, if they ever
knew.
</P>
<P>
   The contretemps over the Whitbread Prize is more comedic than
instructive. I keep thinking instead of an 8-year-old girl from
Chattanooga named Gracie McGuire. She told me she liked the Harry
Potter books because she can ``really imagine in my head what all
the characters and places looked like.'' She could imagine them so
well, in fact, that she didn't even want anybody to make a movie of
Harry Potter. It could never be like the picture she already has.
The movie deal's already in the works, but no writer wishes for
much more than that.

 &HT;    Harvey's triumph of `incredible will'
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't let this unusual combo of music and comedy confuse you.
Power belter Eddie Levert and his capable O'Jays will stick to the
band's fat catalog of R&AMP;B hits while Steve Harvey, star of the
recent top-rated television show in black households (``The Steve
Harvey Show''), does the funny stuff, like this revealing round of
``20 Questions'':
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which word or phrase do you most overuse?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``You ain't gonna believe this but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What don't you say often enough?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wow. I don't compliment my wife (Mary) enough. You can never
do that too much.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your greatest regret?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not going into comedy sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What took you so long?
</P>
<P>
   A: I didn't know how to get into it. I sold life insurance,
worked for a carpet cleaning company, General Electric, sold Amway,
owned a rib joint ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what led to comedy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Um, as you can tell, my obvious inability to hold a job.
Basically, while I was doing all of those other things I was
writing jokes for another comedian, and someone said, since you're
writing them, why don't you do them yourself? And I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which historical figure do you most identify with?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a combination of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. I
try to do it peaceful but if you ain't gonna have it that way, then
I'll slap you (big laugh). Fine with me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your most treasured possession?
</P>
<P>
   A: My children (two boys and two girls).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Children aren't really possessions are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yes they are! (Another laugh) They're mine!
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which talent would you most like to have?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd love to be a basketball coach ... because I love
motivating young men.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you like most about yourself?
</P>
<P>
   A: My will. That's my strongest asset. I have an incredible
will. Tremendous drive. I will things into existence. I pray to God
about it, then put the hard work in behind the faith. That equals
success.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the trait you most deplore in others?
</P>
<P>
   A: Laziness. I hate that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?
</P>
<P>
   A: I work too much. (In addition to ``The Steve Harvey Show,''
he hosts ``Showtime at the Apollo'' and is considering a morning
radio announcer position, he says). I'm a workaholic.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which living person do you most admire?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm going to lose some fans off this one I know. The safe
answer is (famed O.J. Simpson attorney) Johnnie Cochran. My daring
answer, the real one, the one that people would misunderstand, is
Louis Farrakhan ... because of the Million Man March. No one could
else could have come up with the concept. No one else could have
gotten a million black people to do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the quality you most like in a woman?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wow, there are so many... I like a woman with spirit. Get up
and go. A woman that's a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the quality you most like in a man?
</P>
<P>
   A: Spirit. A man's spirit. His ability to get up when he falls
and stand when they push him down. When he has the spirt and
determination to be whatever he's going to be. That's how I pick my
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who's your favorite hero of movies?
</P>
<P>
   A: Whatever Denzel Washington is playing, because he's the man.
His roles are always positive and he's the finest actor I've ever
seen. And he doesn't get enough credit for his work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the last time you read a book and what was it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, I just finished one, and it was a good one, too,
``Monster (The Autobiography of an L.A. Gang Member,'' by Kody
Scott). Best book I've ever read outside of the Bible. It was just
real. It was telling things the way they are and that's how I like
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the best album of '99?
</P>
<P>
   A: Whitney Houston's (``My Love Is Your Love''). Banging!
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the best rumor about yourself that you've ever heard?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's funny. I haven't heard any good rumors because they're
usually negative. But I guess I haven't heard one because people
don't talk about me. People are scared of me. I'll confront you.
I'll call you. Get up in your face!
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you see when you look in the mirror?
</P>
<P>
   A: Um (long pause). I see two things: Pain, but then I see
strength to overcome pain.

 &HT;    Atlanta ordained minister reveals secret life to congregation
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 9.
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Erin Swenson's heart thumped wildly. She was so close
to panic that her fingertips tingled. The crowd inside Shallowford
Presbyterian Church in Atlanta stared at her in disbelief. Swenson,
an ordained minister and father of two daughters, had just walked
to the front of the church in a green dress, heels and an
eggshell-white blouse. She was going to speak publicly for the
first time about a 42-year-old secret that had driven her at times
to thoughts of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson told the hushed crowd that she was a woman born in a
man's body. Now that she had taken steps to correct that, she made
an unprecedented request before the assembly of Presbyterian church
leaders: Allow her to retain her ordination as a minister, even
though she had switched genders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that the changes in my life may seem to be
bewildering, or even outrageous,'' Swenson said in a calm, measured
voice. ``But they are not intended to be so.''
</P>
<P>
   Swenson made her request on Oct. 22, 1996. Some 1,000 delegates
from the Presbytery of Greater Atlanta had gathered for the group's
annual assembly, where Swenson's ordination was the chief topic of
debate. Some delegates questioned her motives. ``Didn't you think
about your family?'' ``Aren't you mocking God?'' ``Is it true that
you wore your wife's clothes?''
</P>
<P>
   As the questions droned on, Swenson closed her eyes to recite
her favorite prayer.
</P>
<P>
   When her turn came to speak, Swenson walked to the front of the
church and steadied herself by looking at a huge wooden cross that
loomed over the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Then she prayed again.
</P>
<P>
   God, help me keep my heart open to people.
</P>
<P>
   FINDING SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Erin _ formerly Eric _ Swenson is stepping
back in the spotlight. She and her ex-wife, one daughter and father
are finally talking about the extraordinary journey _ as a family
and as individuals _ they have taken together since that autumn
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Swenson has no official congregation, but she leads an
unofficial one _ a transgendered support group that meets in her
cozy Grant Park office. Since the Presbytery's vote in 1996, she
has become a leader in the transgendered community (transgendered
is the umbrella term for cross-dressers, transsexuals and those
born with ambiguous sexual characteristics).
</P>
<P>
   Part of Swenson's appeal comes from her soothing personal
presence. A marriage therapist by training, she has a gentle,
empathetic voice and a relentlessly jovial manner. With her
shoulder-length blond hair and 5-foot-9 frame, Swenson, 53, can
melt into a crowd as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Other transgendered people don't slip so easily into their new
gender. Some members of her support group _ balding 6-footers
sporting lipstick and linebacker shoulders _ seem trapped in gender
limbo. They don't look like a woman or a man.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson goes around the room to find out how everyone is doing.
Most of them share the same stories: losing their families and
careers and being taunted by strangers in public. The conversation
ranges from hormones to hairstyles.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson holds up a recent article about a Catholic priest who is
undergoing surgery to become a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel so lonely now,'' she tells the group, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   They don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm with ministers, I'm the transsexual,'' she explains.
``When I'm with transsexuals, I'm the minister.''
</P>
<P>
   The isolation started when Swenson was a child.
</P>
<P>
   One night, when he was 11, Eric had a startling dream. He saw
himself walking down an enchanted road. Each step around a bend
would gradually reveal a subtle transformation, from male to
female. Swenson emerged from the road permanently female.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the first transgendered experience that I
really had,'' Swenson says. ``The dream was so vivid that I began
to use it as fantasy. I would comfort myself with it at night.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the type of dream that young Eric thought he could
share in his ``sexually repressed'' household. Born in Buffalo,
N.Y., Eric had moved with his family to Atlanta when he was 10. His
father, Karl, was a branch office manager for a national
manufacturing firm. His mother, Ruth, who died of ovarian cancer in
1991, was a housewife. He has two younger sisters, Jana and Jill.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson's secret life began with that dream. That same year, he
crept into the powder room of his parents' home and used wadded-up
bathroom tissue to create breasts under his T-shirts. Other
cross-dressing experiences would follow, with Eric using his
mother's clothes. He would pledge never to do it again, but
eventually break his vow.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson's family had no clue. Eric was not effeminate. He was a
member of the high school wrestling team and excelled at such
traditionally male hobbies as electronics and carpentry. ``There
was absolutely nothing that led me to believe that there was a
gender problem,'' says dad Karl Swenson, 83. ``He did all the boy
things. He never showed any interest in dolls or males.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric prayed for deliverance, but none came. He joined the Mount
Vernon Presbyterian Church in Sandy Springs the same year he first
cross-dressed. He was elected to the Presbytery's Youth Council.
Church leaders groomed him for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   But the desire to be a woman did not evaporate. The boy looked
for salvation elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up believing that when I fell in love, I would be
cured,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   SHORT-LIVED `HEALING'
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Swenson met Sigrid Lyons at Camp Calvin, a Presbyterian
youth camp in Hampton. Both were youth counselors. Swenson was 20,
awkward and inexperienced around women. Still, he recalls being
``intensely, terribly'' attracted to Lyons, a slim, vibrant woman
with dark good looks.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, then 23, noticed Swenson as well. She thought he was
handsome, smart and great with kids. Six months later they got
married. Swenson's desire to cross-dress evaporated. ``She healed
me,'' Swenson says. ``She gave me my life back.''
</P>
<P>
   The healing lasted three months.
</P>
<P>
   While his wife was away one morning, Swenson put on her clothes.
Afterward, he curled up in a fetal position on his bed and cried.
``I was devastated,'' he remembers. ``I felt lost.''
</P>
<P>
   As Swenson's gender confusion intensified, he became
increasingly aloof from his wife. Their sex life disappeared.
Swenson threw himself into school to escape his inner turmoil.
After graduating from Georgia Tech with a degree in electrical
engineering, he earned two master's degrees from Columbia
Theological Seminary in Decatur and a doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   Then he immersed himself in church work. After he was ordained
in 1973, Swenson served as pastor at churches in Dalton and
Lithonia. He also became a chaplain at a psychiatric center, an
instructor at Emory University's Candler School of Theology and a
counselor at a mental retardation counseling center. In 1984, he
opened a marriage therapy practice.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson's reputation grew. He was a compassionate counselor and
a renaissance man _ an accomplished singer, small-plane pilot and
an electronics whiz.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he was miserable. He was still secretly dressing as a
woman with his wife's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war inside of one's self is incredible,'' Swenson says.
``It's like being at odds with your own molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Sigrid initially had no idea her husband was at war. She never
caught him cross-dressing; she never noticed her clothes amiss.
``There were glimmers, but they were things that I stuffed....,''
she says. ``This was back in the 1960s and 1970s. This was a
different world.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple's personal problems were superseded by another
concern. In 1976, their younger daughter, Lara, was born 10 weeks
premature. She had cerebral palsy, which would require constant
therapy and multiple operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family was so structured and couched in routines that
couldn't be broken,'' says Cerjan, the couple's elder daughter. ``I
think that's how we got by for some time. I had some friends who
didn't like to come to my house because ... it was so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Swenson began to hint at suicide to his wife. He drove aimlessly
around the city at night thinking about taking his life with a car
crash. His guilt over the divide between his public image and his
private life deepened. ``I was working in therapy with clients
about being self-actualized and authentic when I was the phoniest
person in the room,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, Swenson was desperate.
</P>
<P>
   MOMENT OF DECISION
</P>
<P>
   Years of counseling with five therapists had not helped Swenson.
He wouldn't even open up to his therapists. He had read volumes on
transsexualism and sex reassignment surgery, and thought that might
be his answer. Finally, a therapist recommended that Swenson
contact Margaret Lamacz, a psychiatrist in Baltimore who
specialized in counseling transgendered people.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson flew to Baltimore but wasn't forthcoming when he met
Lamacz. He told Lamacz that his struggles came from ``low
self-esteem.'' Lamacz told Swenson his problems were deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ```You know what you are,''' he recalls her telling him. ```You
don't need a diagnosis from me. You've known it for a long time.
You're just afraid that people aren't going to be able to accept
it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the words that I needed to hear,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson decided at that moment that he would undergo surgery to
become a transsexual. ``The flight back to Atlanta that evening was
magical,'' he says. ``I felt free.''
</P>
<P>
   Swenson's family felt otherwise when he finally told them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt sick,'' his wife says.
</P>
<P>
   His older daughter's reaction was delayed. She reflexively
hugged him when she heard the news. Then she walked to her car and
bawled. ``I was hurt for a few days, and then I was plain
furious,'' Cerjan says. ``I couldn't see how he would disrupt our
family this way. I thought he was being self-centered.''
</P>
<P>
   Swenson's father cried. His two sisters still have not
recovered. Both still will not talk publicly about Swenson.
</P>
<P>
   To win his family's support, Swenson took the same approach he
would later take with the church: He talked constantly to them.
</P>
<P>
   He told them he suffered from a medical condition known as
``gender identity disorder.'' He told them that his desire to be a
woman was not a choice. And he told them that he might take his
life if he were forced to keep living as a man. The process took
six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There didn't seem to be an alternative,'' his father recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson's family members accepted his rationale intellectually,
but each had to find their own way to accept it emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson's father thought about his father-in-law, a Klansman and
a homophobe. ``I felt subconsciously, if I was truly going to be
the opposite end of the spectrum of my father-in-law, I better
darned well start showing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sigrid thought about protecting the person she still loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If other people were going to accept her and be able to stay
with her, I had to be a major part of that,'' she says. ``If I had
just gone absolutely crazy and become adversarial, then people
would have to take sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, something unexpected took place within Swenson's
family. They discovered that they felt closer to Erin than Eric.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was always very distant, closed off,'' Cerjan says.
``Erin seems to be a very open person, easy to get close to. It's a
more honest relationship. She's able to be who she is with me. And
to me, you can't be close to somebody unless you're able to be
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin became her hero, Cerjan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's become a role model for me,'' she says. ``That was not
something that I had expected to happen. But she showed me that you
can really be yourself and do what makes you happy. And in doing
that, you can make yourself better for other people.''
</P>
<P>
   MOUNTING A CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, members of the church were a harder sell than
Swenson's family.
</P>
<P>
   Like many mainline denominations, the Presbyterian church is
embroiled in a running debate on homosexuality. When the 11-member
Committee on Ministry received Swenson's request in 1994 to approve
a name change, the panel was unanimously opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my stance, as the gay basher that I've been, that this
was not a proper thing,'' says Jim Siephert, a committee member.
``I thought it was messing with creation.''
</P>
<P>
   Swenson made her request for practical and spiritual reasons.
She wanted to retain her ordination because it was central to her
identity. But she also wanted to retain health insurance for her
daughter, Lara, something that would be jeopardized if she lost her
ordination.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson mounted a campaign to change the committee's stance. She
wrote letters to committee members. God, she insisted, calls a
person, not a gender. The committee remained unconvinced. So
Swenson personally lobbied them. She had lunch with them, met with
them in their offices and homes.
</P>
<P>
   They were impressed. After 18 months of letters and meetings
with Swenson, they agreed to support her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found Erin authentic, sincere, trying to see herself in the
will of God, not trying to create an issue,'' says David Fry, now
chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Members also began reading about gender identity disorder. They
concluded that Swenson's case was not a homosexual issue, but
rather a gender one.
</P>
<P>
   Even Siephert changed his mind. He became convinced that Swenson
had been carrying a ``crucible'' for years that she had no control
over. ``I finally put aside my preconceptions and prejudices and
looked at it from the standpoint of the person.''
</P>
<P>
   But would the Atlanta Presbytery follow the committee's
decision? The committee took 18 months to support Swenson. The
Presbytery had one morning to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from at least 1,100 metro churches packed into
Shallowford on the day of the vote. The debate took an hour. The
tone of the discussion varied from sympathy for Erin to
incredulity. The debate ended with Swenson's brief speech at the
front of the church.
</P>
<P>
   The vote stunned most people. The Presbytery of Greater Atlanta
voted 186-161 to retain Swenson's ordination. Swenson closed her
eyes in relief when the decision was announced. The decision made
Newsweek magazine. It was the first time a mainstream church had
upheld the ordination of a pastor who had become a transsexual.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Swenson was in the audience that day, sitting next to his
daughter. ``I was real proud of the way she handled herself on that
occasion,'' he says. ``She kept her cool and just did me proud. I
apologize to nobody for what she's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Erin Swenson is a member of the committee that
held her professional fate in its hands, and Siephert is one of her
closest allies. ``I don't shake hands with her, I hug her,'' he
says. ``I told her, `I hug broads.' I'm not ashamed to hug her or
to converse with her so that people know I'm not just a friend _
I'm affirming.''
</P>
<P>
   STARTING OVER
</P>
<P>
   Swenson's family has also found a way to affirm her, but it's
still a challenge. During the same year Swenson won the church
victory, Swenson and Sigrid divorced. Eric changed his name to
Erin. And Swenson finally had his surgery. His father helped pay
the $14,000 needed for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Swenson is starting over. Virtually all her former clients
have left her. She and Sigrid sold their home. Swenson lives in an
attic apartment near Grant Park that she rents for $325 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Sigrid and Swenson remain close. They call each other when the
other's car breaks down. Swenson does laundry at Sigrid's house.
Both continue to care for Lara. People often mistake them for a
lesbian couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a 30-year history together, most of which we were
married, raising two girls,'' Sigrid says. ``I accept her as a
woman, but I see her almost as nongender. She's just Erin. She's my
best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Swenson carries his own sorrow. Like Sigrid, he still
accidentally calls Erin ``he'' on occasion. ``He was my only son,''
he says of Eric, his voice dropping to a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Swenson's life remains busy. She works on a computer help
desk for an Atlanta company and counsels people at nights and on
the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   And she still misses Eric's wife. ``She is my mate for life,''
Swenson says. ``She may be married again. I'm sure I won't. But no
matter what happens, I am married to her forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Swenson doesn't miss Eric. In her tiny apartment there are
no traces of him. The place is full of books, discarded computer
parts and stuffed animals. Does she ever think of him? She pulls a
picture of a bearded Eric from a box nestled in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems like somebody who just doesn't come around anymore,''
she says, looking at the picture before gently placing it back in
the cardboard box. She closes it with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   God help me keep my heart open to people.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Swenson recited that prayer before counseling
marriage clients. It was her way of reminding herself to not judge
people who came to her for help.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Swenson is learning to extend that acceptance to herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of myself as a woman,'' she says. ``I don't
think of myself as a man. I say I'm a transsexual. But labels are
like stones in a stream. They're good to cross the stream, but if
you stay on them, you don't really go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the one label that I do like is, if someone asked me who
I really am, I would say, `I'm a child of God.'''

RICHARD PETTY, AT NHIS, OFFERS SOLACE TO IRWIN FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ On the day Richard Petty returned to New
Hampshire International Speedway for the first time since his
grandson, Adam, was killed, tragedy struck the NASCAR community
again.
</P>
<P>
   Petty spoke with reporters Friday morning about his grandson's
crash. At around noon, Kenny Irwin was killed in another Turn 3
crash _ yards away from where Adam was killed May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty issued a statement on behalf of the entire Petty
family through Petty Enterprises spokesman Chip Williams: ``The
Petty family would like to extend our deepest sympathies to the
Irwin family. Our thoughts and prayers are, and will continue to
be, with the Irwin family and the employees of Team SABCO (Irwin's
racing team) during this very difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty, in his 15 minutes with reporters in the morning, said he
and other family members continue to struggle with Adam's death. He
said they have tried to stay busy, so as not to dwell on it. He
said it often doesn't enter his mind unless someone brings it up.
</P>
<P>
   But Petty said coming to NHIS was part of the mourning process _
not only for him but for his son, Kyle, Adam's father.
</P>
<P>
   Petty said he arrived in Loudon Thursday at 6 p.m., but had not
surveyed the turn where his grandson died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of hard to make a decision to come at all. But the
Bahre family (owners of NHIS) has been so nice that I said, `Look,
I've got to face this one day anyway,' '' he said. ``So I talked to
Kyle and he said he just wasn't ready to come yet. So I said, `OK,
I'll go on and face everybody and face the circumstances, I guess.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `OK, I'm just going to go ahead, and then the
next time it will be a lot easier to do it.' Once I come then it
will be a lot easier for Kyle to come back the next time, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty said he could not blame the track _ or any other
racing-related circumstance _ as the cause of his grandson's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the Good Lord put his numbers in the book and it just
happened to come up,'' said Petty. ``It was unfortunate for the
racetrack or for us racing that it happened at the racetrack. We
can't blame racing. We can't blame the track. We can't blame the
circumstances. It was meant to be and it happened.''

NASA CONCERNED ABOUT RUSSIAN ROCKET MALFUNCTION 

</HEADLINE>
 STATION-HNS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA on Friday asked the Russians to thoroughly explain a recent
Proton rocket malfunction before they proceed with the launching of
the long-delayed crew module for the U.S.-led international space
station.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-foot-long Russian crew module is set to blast off from
Central Asia atop an identical Proton on Tuesday night. The
one-of-a-kind spacecraft is intended to furnish the slowly
developing orbital station with housing for its first resident crew
of astronauts and cosmonauts late this year.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration wants
assurances a previously undisclosed malfunction that accompanied
the launching of a Proton earlier this week will not jeopardize the
crew module mission, said space agency spokesman Dwayne Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was noted after an otherwise successful Proton
launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Wednesday, an
official with the rocket's manufacturer said early Friday. That
Proton placed a Russian military communications satellite into
orbit in spite of the difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's briefing was hosted by Russia's space agency to preview
the crew module flight, which has been delayed 27 months by
economic problems and a pair of 1999 Proton explosions.
</P>
<P>
   In response to NASA's request that accompanied the disclosure,
the Russians scheduled a briefing of the problem for U.S. station
managers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said previously scheduled launch preparations at
the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan will proceed as planned over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already investigated the case. We have a full
understanding of the problem, and it's a minor problem,'' said
Sergei Shayevich, the space station program manager for the
Khrunichev State Research &AMP; Production Center.
</P>
<P>
   NASA spokesman Ed Campion said a pressure loss occurred in a
propulsion system line as the Proton's second stage was completing
its burn.
</P>
<P>
   Shayevich said the problem was a first for the Proton, which has
been a Russian workhorse for more than 30 years, and that it was
not associated with upgrades made in the wake of the last year's
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators attributed Proton explosions last October and July
to poor workmanship of the turbo machinery in the rocket's second
and third stages. They determined that the lapses allowed
contaminants, including metal fragments and a piece of cloth, to
overheat the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   At NASA's urging, the Russians modified the propulsion systems
to include filters that would block future engine contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians and Americans also agreed to a pair of test flights
before the crew module is launched. A June 6 test was successful.
Until several Russian and American news reports disclosed problems
with Tuesday's test, the second was characterized as equally
successful.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the new station by a 16-nation partnership has
been stalled since the first components were joined in late 1998,
in large part by the tardiness of the crew module. Fifteen missions
with new components and supplies are planned in the next year alone
if the crew module mission is successful.
</P>
<P>
   The global partnership plans to use the station as a research
facility for physics, biology and medical experiments. It will also
serve as a high-altitude observatory for environmental studies and
a testing site for hardware needed for future human expeditions to
the moon and Mars.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the evening of Monday, May 1, and Michael Armstrong, the
chairman of AT&AMP;T, needed help.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled in a conference room at the company's headquarters in
Basking Ridge, N.J., with key members of his executive team,
Armstrong said he turned for advice to two Wall Street analysts,
later identified by people close to the meeting as Frank Governali
of Goldman, Sachs and Jack Grubman of Salomon Smith Barney.
Armstrong asked the two just how he should tell investors that some
of AT&AMP;T's core businesses had stumbled. At least as important,
Armstrong also wanted their assessment of how AT&AMP;T's shares, one of
the nation's most widely held stocks, would react to the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analysts came in and they said, `Well, look, what you have
to do is just put this on the table, tell it like you're going to
tell it,''' Armstrong recounted in an interview late last month. ``
`You're being forthright, you're talking about something in the
future.'''
</P>
<P>
   Governali and Grubman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their bottom line,'' Armstrong added, ``was, `You'll probably
take a four- to seven- point hit and then bounce back, for a three-
to five-point problem.' That's what their judgment was to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, AT&AMP;T dropped its bomb on the company's
investors. AT&AMP;T said its operations would grow more slowly and earn
less this year than the company had previously led the market to
expect. AT&AMP;T added that its core consumer long-distance unit would
shrink faster than expected. Worst of all, the company said that
its unit that sells communications services to business customers,
which had been one of its bastions of strength, would miss its
previous growth target because it had dropped the ball with some of
AT&AMP;T's biggest accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was swift and harsh. The company's shares, which
had closed that Monday at $49, skidded $7.0625, shaving more than
$25 billion from AT&AMP;T's market value. And the shares did not bounce
back. They continued to slide the next day. And the day after that.
And the day after that.
</P>
<P>
   The pain continues. AT&AMP;T's shares, which traded above $60 as
recently as late March, closed on Friday at $33.25.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just AT&AMP;T's shares that are feeling the burn. For
the first time since he took over as chairman in the fall of 1997,
Armstrong himself is on the defensive. His bet-the-company vision
to transform AT&AMP;T by delivering a package of interactive digital
television, high-speed cyberspace access and local telephone
service over cable television lines is still largely just that, a
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the core long-distance operations that he was
counting on to avoid trouble while the company focused on the cable
strategy have found it instead. Even AT&AMP;T's vaunted offering of a
new stock meant to track its fast-growing wireless operation has
been a disappointment. Mediocre would be a charitable description
of its performance, at least for investors who bought it at the
offering price of $29.50 a share. On Friday, the stock closed at
$25.4375.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bell local phone giants finally moving in force into
the $80 billion long-distance market, the outlook in AT&AMP;T's core
consumer business is not likely to improve anytime soon. With the
company's market value at about $125 billion _ versus, say, the $96
billion that AT&AMP;T spent to acquire the Tele-Communications Inc. and
MediaOne cable television operations over the last two years, a
recurring theme in financial circles this summer has been that the
company would be an attractive target for an unsolicited takeover
and breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong does not appear to be in any danger of losing his job.
Strategically, he appears to have done as fine a job as anyone
could have expected, given the unenviable hand he was dealt. To
survive, AT&AMP;T had to transform itself from a lumbering,
backward-looking long-distance behemoth into something new;
Armstrong's bold moves, especially in the cable arena, appear
poised to do that.
</P>
<P>
   But tactically, he has not yet proved that he can execute on the
broad range of small, unglamorous, nitty-gritty chores that are
required to turn his visionary strategy into a concrete success.
Time is running out, investors are losing patience, and AT&AMP;T is on
the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's a little irrational, but I think people are just
fed up,'' said one Wall Street analyst, on condition of anonymity.
``I know one fund manager who said: `Don't talk to me about this
stock; I'm dumping it. Call me in a year if things turn around.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a year, it should be fairly clear whether Armstrong will
deserve to be placed in the pantheon of great executives or instead
be remembered as the man who valiantly tried to turn AT&AMP;T from
decades of inertia and failed.
</P>
<P>
   It was fear of that inertia's power that made the May 2
disclosures so damaging. The actual numbers were far from
devastating _ a percentage-point change in outlook here, maybe two
points over there. But it has been so long since AT&AMP;T truly
impressed investors with its performance _ years, for sure _ that
the May warning raised fears that beneath Armstrong's beaming
visage at the helm, this was still the same old sclerotic AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   About Armstrong himself, the warning raised an even more pointed
concern: If he cannot mind the shop in AT&AMP;T's core businesses, how
can he be expected to succeed in the new ones?
</P>
<P>
   So how does Armstrong himself think he is doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we're making some really sound progress,'' he
said, with the unwavering, barrel-chested confidence that has
become his trademark. ``I think a lot of the progress is masked by
financials as a result of the declining voice business.''

SAFETY INNOVATIONS MAKE NASCAR FATALITIES A RARITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l, s and f coding; includes driver death text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another driver has been killed at New Hampshire International
Speedway, the second in less than two months to die in a wreck
during practice.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitable questions follow: Is it the track? Is it a safety
problem with the cars? Is it the speed?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: none of those. It is the sudden stops.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to a spectacular, but nonfatal, wreck last spring at
Daytona International Speedway in Florida. Ricky Rudd, in the Bud
Shootout, bounced off a couple of cars (a good thing), flipped his
Winston Cup car onto its roof (a good thing), and slid the length
of the straightaway (another good thing).
</P>
<P>
   Rudd walked away.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of wreck that gets the adrenaline pumping in the
grandstands. A wreck, in itself, is not a good thing, but Rudd was
relatively uninjured because his car was built to take all the
things Rudd's car did. Bouncing off other cars, flipping onto the
roof, and sliding on that roof dissipate the energy of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   As fans gather at NHIS in Loudon, N.H., Kenny Irwin and Adam
Petty are on the minds of all. Irwin died Friday when his car
slammed viciously into the wall at Turn 3 just yards from where
Petty was killed May 12.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to hold this thought, but fatalities are now rare
in NASCAR racing because of how the cars are built. Petty ran
straight into the wall at about 135 miles per hour. Accounts say
Irwin hit the wall hard and then flipped. He likely would have been
better off had he flipped and then slid into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in this type of crash, drivers and designers say, is
that although you can ``cage'' the driver's body _ strapping him
securely into a seat, surrounded by crumple zones _ you cannot
protect the neck and the brain in a sudden stop from high speed.
All else stops securely, but the head, heavy with helmet, keeps
moving, possibly resulting in a snapped neck or the brain smashing
against the skull.
</P>
<P>
   The car you drive on the highway is basically a stamped piece of
steel with soft crumple zones meant to withstand crashes that, by
NASCAR standards, are relatively slow-speed events. Winston Cup
cars crash at speeds of 130 miles per hour and far higher. The
challenge, then, in building a Winston Cup car is to balance
stiffness that will protect the driver with enough softness front
and rear to absorb the kinetic energy of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup cars are, in basic form, a body made of welded
pieces slipped onto a complex, tubular frame. The frame is made up
of four sections: front and rear clips (ends), center section, and
roll cage.
</P>
<P>
   John Valentine, chief engineer/racing, research and vehicle
technology for Ford Motor Co., described these sections. The most
important, he said, is the center section where the driver sits. It
combines the center section with the roll cage. The whole package,
Valentine said, ``is literally a cage.'' Steel tubing with wall
thickness of one-eighth of an inch protects the driver on the
sides, rear, front, and roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to maintain the structural integrity and keep the
occupant encased,'' Valentine said. In addition, he said, ``it
forms the backbone of the car. You don't want a racecar flexing in
the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinner, collapsible tubing .083-of-an-inch wall thickness is
used in the front and rear clips. Up front, the tubing crumples in
a crash, absorbing energy. In addition, the motor and transmission
are positioned so they will slide beneath the car, after the motor
mounts shear, rather than projecting into the driver's compartment.
In addition to the engine, the front clip also holds the
suspension. The suspension system is attached with restraining
straps so wheels and suspension parts don't go flying into the
stands, along the track, or back into the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Tubing of the same thickness is used in the rear clip as are
suspension straps. It, too, is designed to crumple in a crash, but
also holds the fuel cell, a fire-retardant fuel source far safer
than the gas tanks of old. There are check valves in the fuel lines
to shut off fuel if the engine is separated from the chassis.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR design, Valentine said, ``is all about energy
management.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the crashes that crowds like to see are often the
safest, he said. ``One where the car is sliding a great deal, the
tires are smoking, it's scraping off other cars, off the wall,
skidding into the grass. You're scraping off the energy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who spoke before Irwin's crash, said the worst
crashes ``are the ones where there's not a lot of energy
absorption.''
</P>
<P>
   Crashes like Petty's and Irwin's.
</P>
<P>
   But these types of crashes _ direct hits to an immovable surface
_ are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Safety evolves race by race, accident by accident. The airborne
crashes of the late 1980s have been mostly halted because of flaps
now installed at the rear of the roofline. They pop up when cars
get sideways or backward (and lose their aerodynamics) and keep
them from flying.
</P>
<P>
   Driver's seats have evolved, too, and today hug the driver tight
in an aluminum frame that is meant to hold up under huge crash
pressures while bending just enough to absorb energy.
</P>
<P>
   Nets on the window and behind the driver are ``basically to
contain the driver in the vehicle,'' said Valentine. They keep head
and arms inside and help prevent whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty, who lost his grandson, Adam, in May, said Friday,
``There ain't nothing the matter with the racetrack. These guys run
those things 200 miles per hour. It's circumstance with the way you
stop them so quick. The body just can't take it.''

 UNDATED: voice business.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What the financials may have masked is AT&AMP;T's belief that it
will be delivering local phone service over cable lines to at least
400,000 households by year-end. And even in states where the
company does not own cable systems, AT&AMP;T is making inroads in local
phone markets. In New York State, for instance, where Bell Atlantic
has made a strong move in the long-distance arena, AT&AMP;T has
counterattacked by signing up more than 475,000 local phone users.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to phone service, the other parts of AT&AMP;T's cable
service are also developing. While interactive television is not
yet a reality in the market, the company has about 300,000 cable
modem users and expects that figure to top 700,000 by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gives me confidence to respond to that question rather
than go look at the price of the stock and get depressed is that
the investments and the strategy are working,'' Armstrong said. ``I
see it, and the people who take the time to look at our company
know it. But the overhang of the decline in voice and, in a large
part, the consumer business is very depressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depressing to the value,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   What may also be depressing, or perhaps liberating, is the fact
that a big part of AT&AMP;T's troubles _ those in the $20 billion
consumer long-distance business _ are for most practical purposes
out of Armstrong's control.
</P>
<P>
   Since agreeing to break itself up under pressure from the
government in 1984, AT&AMP;T has seen its share of the long-distance
market shrink each year. But what has also begun to shrivel in
recent years is the overall revenue of AT&AMP;T's consumer
long-distance unit.
</P>
<P>
   After battling head-to-head with MCI (which has since been
acquired by WorldCom) and with Sprint for long-distance customers
during most of the 1990s, AT&AMP;T has largely given up that fight
under Armstrong. The incessant marketing in the last decade _ the
television commercials, the print advertising and, most important,
the free long-distance ``checks'' _ meant to persuade consumers to
switch long-distance carriers _ helped prop up revenue in the
long-distance unit, but at a cost to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Under Armstrong, AT&AMP;T has essentially put its consumer
long-distance unit on life support, allowing it to get smaller but
milking it for billions in cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, that is nothing but a concession to the
inevitable. Just about anyone with a few million dollars can start
a long-distance phone carrier by buying access to the big
companies' networks at wholesale and selling long-distance minutes
at a profit, as do small companies like Talk.com and Telecare. Many
of the upstarts initially zero in on AT&AMP;T. And it is only going to
get worse as, with the Federal Communications Commission's
blessing, the Bell companies move into long-distance. By the end of
this month, Bell Atlantic, which changed its name last week to
Verizon Communications, will have probably signed up one million
long-distance customers in New York State alone. July 10, SBC
Communications, which does business as Southwestern Bell, is set to
jump into the consumer long-distance business in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a systemic declining industry, long distance,'' Armstrong
said. ``That is irreversible. And not just for AT&AMP;T, but for the
long-distance industry.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason why AT&AMP;T recently tried to raise some of the
prices in its basic calling plan. But that effort met with an
outcry from some Washington regulators and consumer advocates, who
said that AT&AMP;T was reneging on a pledge to reduce those rates. The
criticism forced AT&AMP;T to revise its plan.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong often points out that if AT&AMP;T's consumer long-distance
business were set aside, the remainder of the company would have
shown a 12 percent growth rate in the first quarter of 2000. In the
Internet world, that would impress no one, but 12 percent growth
would be a home run for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, AT&AMP;T's consumer long-distance business has not been
set aside, at least not yet. But Armstrong's real problem resides
in the continued weakness in that unit, which makes it harder for
him to convince investors of his success in other areas. The
company must find gargantuan amounts of new business just to show
modest growth.
</P>
<P>
   In May, AT&AMP;T said it expected the consumer unit to decline by 6
to 8 percent this year, raising its earlier estimate of 3 to 5
percent. If that unit, which generated about $22 billion in revenue
last year, shrinks by 7 percent, that amounts to about $1.4 billion
in vanished sales. So AT&AMP;T needs to find that much new revenue this
year just to stay even.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T booked $62.4 billion in overall revenue last year, while
earning $3.4 billion. If the company wanted to achieve, say, 10
percent growth _ it is instead hoping for 7 to 8 percent _ the
company would have to find a whopping $7.8 billion in new revenue
(think Paine Webber) this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   If the consumer unit declined an additional 7 percent next year,
and the company again wanted to show 10 percent growth over all, it
would have to find an additional $8.3 billion in new revenue (think
Conseco) in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the decline of the consumer long-distance
business puts a lot of pressure on AT&AMP;T's other operations. And
that is one reason that AT&AMP;T is considering ways to quarantine the
consumer unit's financial results from those of the rest of the
company, perhaps by selling a new stock to track the consumer
operation. The idea seems to appeal to Armstrong, and it appears
that a decision on such a move could come within months, if not
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to tell everybody that a business has to reach
three conditions and then I would consider a segmentation of it,''
he said. ``Is it operationally prepared for public investment? Will
it create a currency that would serve a purpose? And will there be
some value creation as a result of doing it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's 115 years old, so I think it kind of qualifies that
it kind of operationally knows what it's doing,'' Armstrong said,
in answering the three questions. ``The creation of the currency is
more obscure, because it has declining revenue. On the other hand,
the currency would obviously have a value greater than it now has.
And then third, would it create shareholder value? In this case, it
would maybe permit that if there was some segmentation for the rest
of AT&AMP;T.

   ``So I would say that those three conditions would apply to the
consumer business and that's kind of where it is,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   As Armstrong says, the problems in his company's long-distance
unit are systemic and not likely to change. The missteps in AT&AMP;T's
unit that sells services to business customers, however, are purely
of the company's making.
</P>
<P>
   Put bluntly, the business-services unit tripped on its own
shoelaces. While AT&AMP;T was reorganizing the unit to transfer some
big corporate customers to the Concert international venture that
the company formed in 1998 with British Telecommunications, some of
those customers got lost in the shuffle. AT&AMP;T's sales force
appeared to get lazy in selling new data services to those
customers, opening the door for competitors like WorldCom and
Sprint. As a result, AT&AMP;T said growth in the business-services unit
would be about 8 percent this year, rather than the 9 to 11 percent
it had predicted earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the numbers did not scream failure. But again, they gave
some investors the impression of a ship adrift. And AT&AMP;T is not
going to be able to fix the problem right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the problem happened, I'm accountable, but I don't
operate quite at that level,'' Armstrong said. ``The relationships,
the administrative support, the skill coverage in those accounts
was not carefully managed and we lost the kind of proposing,
anticipating and customer-relationship role. And we've got to redo
that. And you don't do that in weeks or months. It's going to take
quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to view this sort of lapse. The first is that
it is in some way more comforting than the sort of overarching
issues afflicting AT&AMP;T's consumer business, because it can be
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The other is that it is in fact even more disquieting, because
there were no fundamental underlying reasons for the problem to
have ever emerged. Moreover, the problems in the business-services
operation were a direct result of the sort of organizational change
that is fundamental to Armstrong's overall plan.
</P>
<P>
   There is no more important quality for the chief executive of a
public company than credibility _ credibility that goals can and
will be achieved and credibility that the company will be
forthright in its dealings with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's credibility is intact. But the manner and timing of
the May 2 announcement left a bad taste for many investors and
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Just three business days before AT&AMP;T delivered its bad news, the
new stock meant to track the company's wireless business, whose
offering brought AT&AMP;T a $10.6 billion windfall, began trading.
</P>
<P>
   In the days and weeks leading up to the offering, AT&AMP;T
executives led by John D. Zeglis, AT&AMP;T's president, had
crisscrossed the country touting the new wireless shares to
investors. And in the course of those discussions, it does not
appear that Zeglis gave even a hint of the problems that AT&AMP;T was
about to announce, leading some investors to worry that perhaps
they had been manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people said: `Hey, I just met with Zeglis. What's that
about?''' said one communications analyst, on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Had AT&AMP;T delayed the announcement of the bad news to avoid
tainting the wireless offering, whose ticker symbol is AWE? What
would that say about AT&AMP;T's communications in the future?
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think it was relevant to the AWE offering,''
Armstrong said. ``What I was focused on was how can I maintain the
most credibility by giving shareholders the most lead time to the
bad news that I was coming with.''
</P>
<P>
   If he could do it again, would he handle the disclosure
differently?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, do I think that the perfect thing would have let a couple
weeks go in between the two? Sure, yeah, I'd wait. But I don't
think withholding information is a good idea. And that's what drove
me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the early 1980s, and IBM had recently introduced a new
device called the personal computer. Critics harped that only IBM's
arrogance would let it believe that people would pay to put a such
a powerful machine on their desks.
</P>
<P>
   It was the early 1990s, and Hughes Electronics had faded along
with the Cold War. Instead of retrenching, Hughes went against the
grain and invested in new civilian satellite systems.
</P>
<P>
   These are the stories Armstrong recounts as he tries to put this
difficult moment in perspective. After all, he oversaw IBM's PC
group in the early '80s, and he was running Hughes in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going through the toughest time, just like I did back in
'83 and '84 with the personal computer,'' he said. ``The same tough
time that we went through back in 1992 and '93 with the
commercialization-of-space strategy. This is more visible. I've
never enjoyed so many critics and authors and helpers from the
outside as to what I should have done and what I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not quite sound beleaguered. The strut, the confidence,
are still there. But the force of personality is not quite as
overwhelming as it was a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or not, AT&AMP;T will always labor under especially intense
scrutiny from investors. As AT&AMP;T has tried to remake itself, its
struggles have at times seemed the same as those of any other old,
powerful, slightly dotty organization pushing to become something
lean and new. But AT&AMP;T has muddled for so long now that only a big
surprise _ a big, good surprise _ will suffice to get investors
excited again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The street has gotten very emotional about this stock,'' said
Daniel P. Reingold, chief telecommunications analyst for Credit
Suisse First Boston. ``It seems that every fear in the world has
found its way into this stock and it has led to a very over-sold
condition. It's going to take good news on revenue or structural
shock treatment, like some spinoffs or additional tracking stocks,
to unlock the hidden value. But patient investors could be rewarded
very handsomely.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Armstrong probably would not describe himself as
patient, nor would investors be pleased if he did. But he does have
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been as tough a challenge as I bargained for,'' he
said. ``This is the toughest of times, when people view their
success in terms of the stock price. Transformation doesn't come
easy. It comes from hard work and ramping up new products and
services with new people and new technology, and we're doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind if people wonder if it can be done, this
transformation,'' he added. ``But I do mind if people wonder if it
can be done when it's being done. And it's being done here.''

LEBANESE TRIBUNAL HEARS CASES OF ACCUSED ISRAELI COLLABORATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ At the Military Tribunal, around the corner
from the grand statue of a helmeted and booted soldier clutching a
book and the scales of justice, is a series of bulletin boards with
a list of 2,135 names.
</P>
<P>
   These are the former members of Israel's proxy militia, the
South Lebanon Army, who turned themselves in to the Lebanese
government after the Israeli army abruptly pulled out of its
``security zone'' in southern Lebanon last month, or were caught by
Hezbollah guerillas, and are now accused of collaborating with the
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, the military court sits in
marathon session, a half dozen senior officers on the bench led by
Brig. Gen. Maher Safieddine, plowing through the cases against the
militiamen, issuing sentences overnight.
</P>
<P>
   So far the court has handed down 667 verdicts in 13 batches of
former militiamen, largely Christians from an area that is
predominantly Shiite Muslim. About 1 percent of the defendants are
acquitted, according to local news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the men coming to trial appear to be minor
players, rank-and-file soldiers who say they were conscripted or
joined because it was the only job available. By their accounts,
they mostly just moped about and never hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, the sentences run about a year or so
(although some are as short as eight weeks) and the militiamen are
told they cannot go back to their home villages for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Antoine Lahd, the commander of the South Lebanon Army,
escaped into Israel along with other senior officers. They are
expected to live abroad in comfortable exile.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few senior officers who was tried here, Maj. Emile
Nasr, who was in charge of operations in Jezzine, was sentenced to
13 jail terms of 10 years each on multiple charges of collaborating
with the enemy and disclosing army secrets.
</P>
<P>
   He shelled Sidon in 1997 in revenge for the death of his niece
and nephew in a roadside bombing, killing seven civilians and
wounding 42. After several attempts on his life, he reportedly cut
a deal with Hezbollah to supply information, then turned himself
over to the Lebanese army a month before the end of the occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Another ranking officer, Etienne Saqr, who is believed to be in
Israel, was given a 15-year sentence in absentia. Known as Abu Arz,
he was the head of a notorious far-right Christian militia, the
Guardians of the Cedars.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the trials seem perfunctory. Most, on a
recent day when the court was trying to get through 68 cases, were
adjourned because the defendants had no lawyer. The bar association
has sent batches of lawyers, in their black robes with white fur
tassels, as public defenders, but they are unfamiliar with the
cases and have to ask for time to read the records. For the most
part, they plead for mercy, saying times were hard under the
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   One defense lawyer, Fadi Kanaan, asked for mercy and a general
amnesty for all the defendants, saying: ``It was so dramatic for
the inhabitants of the south to live under occupation, isolated
from their country and government. They did not collaborate with
the enemy out of principle, but were forced to do so as a result of
the occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   One defendant was convicted of being a double agent who turned
his own sister over to the Israelis. Another, charged with giving
false information to army intelligence, said that he first had good
information, but that as he was pressured for more, he ran dry and
started making it up. One man said he had risen to the rank of
sergeant in charge of transporting fuel, but was discharged for
stealing gasoline from the stores.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for George Kawas, who was accused of being a longtime
militiaman, pleaded for mercy, saying, ``You know what poverty is
like, when money is put in somebody's face like a carrot.''
</P>
<P>
   The trials have not been without criticism. Amnesty
International has called them a ``parody of justice'' that ``can in
no way help national reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah officials have criticized the court as too lenient,
calling the trials ``ceremonial'' and the sentences ``scandalous.''
The leading newspaper, An Nahar, has reported incidents in which
villagers have beaten up returning former militiamen who received
what they saw as light sentences. U.N. officials said most of those
beaten up were Shiite Muslims who had worked with the mostly
Christian SLA.
</P>
<P>
   On the Christian side, Cardinal Nasrallah Pierre Sfeir, the
Maronite patriarch, said he was forming a committee ``to ensure
that the trials are fair and unbiased and that treatment of all
prisoners is respectful of human rights.''

COMMENTARY: DEAR RALPH: 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nader for president! You say you are serious this time, running
as the candidate of the Green Party, and you deride those who say
you should get out of Al Gore's way. Fair enough. Third parties are
an honorable, if frustrating, American tradition.
</P>
<P>
   What is puzzling to some of your old admirers is what you stand
for. You say the two major parties are practically Tweedledum and
Tweedledee _ there are ``few major differences'' between them.
Sure, they are both awash in campaign money that keeps them close
to business. But no major differences? Are you serious?
</P>
<P>
   Take one of your concerns, the environment. When Newt Gingrich &AMP;
Co. took control of the House, Republicans tried to gut the
country's environmental protection laws. They were stopped by
President Clinton's skillful use of the veto and veto threats. A
Republican from Texas, where environmental regulation is in the
hands of the polluters, is not likely to be that kind of president.
</P>
<P>
   Or take law. You and I first met in law school. You have used
the legal process well, and I believe you must still have a deep
concern for law and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective Republican candidate has spoken admiringly of
the judicial record of Justice Clarence Thomas. The Democrat would
almost certainly make appointments to the Supreme Court on the
model of President Clinton's moderate liberal choices, Justices
Ruth Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. No major difference?
</P>
<P>
   It is surprising that you pay little or no attention to one area
where there is in fact little difference between President Clinton
and the Republican Congress _ and the records of both are abysmal.
That is civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Federal habeas corpus, a fundamental safeguard of freedom, was
ravaged by legislation signed without objection by President
Clinton. The Republican Congress cut off funds for a handful of
resource centers that provided lawyers for prisoners on death row,
many of whom had been represented by incompetent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The Counter-Terrorism Act, drafted by the Clinton
administration, imported into our law the loathsome practice of
trials on secret evidence. The Immigration Act of 1996 compelled
the deportation of people who had committed trivial crimes years
before the act was passed.
</P>
<P>
   By attacking those affronts to due process and American decency,
a third-party candidate could have a real impact. He could shake
the major parties' indifference and touch the country's conscience.
Don't you care?
</P>
<P>
   What you mainly seem to care about these days is free trade. You
are against it _ or say you want it with so many ifs and buts that
it amounts to the same thing. You and your organization, Public
Citizen, led the way to the Seattle protests against the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   You talk about the importance of seeing that other countries
have laws like ours to protect fair labor standards, the consumer,
pure food and the environment. Those are fine ideals. But the
effect of insisting that other countries meet our standards before
we trade with them would be, as you must know, devastating.
</P>
<P>
   What South Africans need is jobs; about a third of them are
unemployed. The same is true in most of the developing world. Yes,
we should worry about underpaid child workers in Asia producing
goods for the American market. But efforts that focus attention on
such cruelties have been quite effective. To use, instead, the
blunderbuss of stopping or handicapping trade would make life
harsher for all.
</P>
<P>
   Free trade benefits Americans enormously, too. Your great early
achievement was to bring General Motors to heel. But what really
forced reform on GM, and gave us all better cars, was competition
from Japanese and other imports.
</P>
<P>
   Your protectionist stance has put you in bed with some of the
most reactionary forces in this country. You are a twin of Pat
Buchanan on the issue. The New Republic reported that Public
Citizen's Global Trade Watch got money from Roger Milliken, the
far-right South Carolina textile magnate who has bankrolled the
conservative cause from Barry Goldwater on.
</P>
<P>
   Protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the world's
poor even more miserable. It is a strange platform for the Ralph
Nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected.

EPISCOPALIANS NEAR ALLIANCE WITH BIGGEST LUTHERAN GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Episcopal Church and the nation's largest Lutheran
denomination moved closer Friday to creating a formal alliance in
which they would recognize each other's traditions and share
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelming approval of an accord known as ``Called to Common
Mission'' by the Episcopal House of Bishops at the church's annual
convention here left only a vote by the church's other chamber, the
House of Deputies, to enact the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The 800 deputies, who are lay people and clergy, were expected
to approve the accord in a vote scheduled to be held no later than
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the policy-making body of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America, the nation's largest Lutheran denomination with
5.2 million members, approved the accord last year.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of both churches said Friday that final passage would
reflect an historic accomplishment, ending 30 years of
conversations between the two churches, which have similar
theological positions and liturgies but significant differences
about the role and authority of bishops. In the Episcopal Church,
bishops are regarded as progeny of Christ's disciples and are
elected for life. Lutheran bishops serve six-year terms, largely as
administrators, before returning to their roles as pastors.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is one indicator that the ecumenical movement may
have regained momentum after several decades in which it was
declared all but dead. The Lutheran church voted in 1997 for full
communion with three churches in Protestantism's Reformed
tradition: the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the United Church of
Christ and the Reformed Church in America. Other longtime efforts
are underway to unite Christian churches, with supporters citing
the prayer of Jesus in the Gospel of John 17:11 that all his
followers ``may be one.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Concerning the alliance with the Episcopal Church, ``It has been
a long process, and I'm delighted,'' Lowell Almen, the secretary of
the Lutheran group and a guest at the Episcopal convention, said
after the 204 bishops voted, with only a dozen or so dissenting.
``God is doing a new thing in the life of the church. This
represents a moment in church history that is very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Epting, the Episcopal bishop of Iowa who played a major
role in writing the accord, called it ``an ecumenical
breakthrough'' that could help encourage similar agreements between
the church and other denominations. Already, he said, the Episcopal
church had begun conversations with the Moravian Church in America,
a Protestant denomination, and the Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   The vote by the deputies would align two churches that represent
nearly 8 million congregants and would end several years of bumpy
negotiations in efforts to bring the two denominations closer.
After an initial proposal was written by members of both churches
in 1990, it came up for its first votes of approval in 1997. The
Episcopal Church passed it overwhelmingly, but the Lutherans failed
by six votes to reach the majority needed for passage.
</P>
<P>
   A committee with representatives from both churches wrote a
compromise document; that proposal was approved Friday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the accord, though it does not combine the two
churches, allows each to recognize and embrace the other to the
extent they can share ministers, places of worship and other
resources. In addition to the symbolic significance, church leaders
said, the arrangement would benefit urban and rural regions where
one church is hard-pressed to serve all its members because of
inadequate buildings or lack of personnel. Churches in such areas,
for example, could share one pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders said the accord would also encourage local
churches to work together on projects they would perform
separately, like relief and missionary efforts.

PREGNANT FACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 09, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happily, teen pregnancy rates in the United States have been
dropping. But when it comes to comparisons with other countries,
the United States looks bad. Too often pop music offers more
straight talk to teens than politicians do. As a result,
government-funded programs can be oddly mute. Focusing on
``abstinence only,'' some mention contraception solely to discuss
failure rates. And too many teenagers don't get the information
they need.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Alan Guttmacher Institute highlights teenagers'
needs in its Guttmacher Report on Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The encouraging drop in teen pregnancy rates is 17 percent from
1990 to 1996, according to Guttmacher researchers. They link a
quarter of the decline from 1988 to 1995 to increased abstinence
and three-quarters to better use of contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon, however, to celebrate. US pregnancy rates remain
close to levels in Belarus, Bulgaria, and the Russian Federation,
complains Jacqueline Darroch, Guttmacher's vice president for
research.
</P>
<P>
   Many European countries and Canada have a far better record of
preventing teen pregnancies despite what some Americans consider a
more permissive attitude. It isn't that teenagers in those
countries are less sexually active than in the United States, but
that they have better access to counseling and birth control.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly embarrassing is a comparative look at France, where
a national campaign promotes contraceptive use. Some radio and
television ads are addressed to adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't forbid sex, but you can ask young people to be
responsible,'' Bridget Dusseau, an editor at a French news agency,
says in the report. This honest comment might get her fired if she
were doing US government work.
</P>
<P>
   Are French efforts outrageous? Apparently not. From 1992 to
1996, estimated adolescent abortion rates in France are a low 10.2
per 1,000 women, compared to 29.2 in the United States. French
adolescent pregnancy rates are estimated at 20.2 per thousand
women, compared to 83.6 in the States. Some 900,000 American teens
between 15 and 19 become pregnant each year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this record, the United States shouldn't just mimic
French programs. It must make its own progress.
</P>
<P>
   Basic communication should improve. ``Abstinence only''
campaigns claim the moral high ground, but they also discourage
meaningful public debate and ignore the reality of many
adolescents' lives. Why not just send information-needy teenagers
to doctors? Some go, but less than a third say they've discussed
how to prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   More public dollars should be better targeted on such efforts as
preventing repeat pregnancies among teenagers _ about one in five
births to teenagers or an estimated 110,000 births in 1998.
Research shows successful prevention programs stress life skills
and a pointed message about using contraceptives to prevent repeat
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnancy prevention remains the best way to reduce the
incidence of abortion and, with some forms of birth control, the
spread of many sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   States can reach out by using the State Children's Health
Insurance Program _ set up by Congress in 1997 _ to expand
insurance coverage and reproductive health services for teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the United States dominates the information age, it
should make revolutionary leaps in providing teenagers with the
best, most thorough information available on avoiding pregnancy.

FED TO THE PUMPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 09, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal Reserve policy has aimed primarily at reining in a
spirit of exuberance that threatened to turn strong growth into a
runaway boom. The Fed's principal concern has been that inflation,
a minor factor for more than a decade, would make a return and put
the economy into a tailspin. Now a new factor, rising energy
prices, deserves a prominent place in Fed thinking because of the
impact it could have on American economic psychology.
</P>
<P>
   The recent surge in oil prices has been downplayed because
energy represents a smaller slice of the overall economic pie than
it did during earlier spurts in 1967 and 1980. It now represents
about 3 percent of economic activity compared with about 6 percent
in the earlier years.
</P>
<P>
   Energy nevertheless is a part of everyone's life. People were
troubled by last winter's jump in heating oil prices and angered by
the current leap in gasoline prices. While there has been no
indication that higher prices are causing people to lower the
thermostat, shut off the air conditioner, form car pools, or buy
smaller cars, there clearly is frustration.

<P>
   The situation remains volatile. Saudi Arabia's announcement on
Wednesday that it would increase oil production by an additional
500,000 barrels a day was welcome. It had an immediate impact of
lowering crude oil prices around the world, but they remained above
$30 a barrel in most markets. Furthermore, the effect of the
increased production will take some months to be felt in actual
supplies of refined products on hand. The danger remains of another
surge in home heating oil prices this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty has never been a helpful ingredient in building
consumer or investor confidence. There is a real danger that energy
cost gyrations could infect decisions in other areas, to the
detriment of continued economic growth, especially with job growth
slowing, as reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed will have to keep a close watch on matters to avoid
over-restrictive policies if confidence erodes in the new energy
environment. It held steady on interest rates last month; it should
be prepared to move quickly toward lower rates if oil prices show
any signs of curbing an otherwise healthy economy.

ENCHANTING BUT DARKER HARRY POTTER BOOK 4 IS WORTHY OF HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKEN DENN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three-word answer for Harry Potter fans everywhere:
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's good.
</P>
<P>
   How good?
</P>
<P>
   In the generally accepted Potterific Scale of 1 to 10 _ in which
Book 1 in the wildly popular series rates an 11, Book 2 slips to a
10, and Book 3 surges to a 12 _ the madly anticipated fourth book
settles in around an 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' released to the public
at midnight Friday, is darker than the first three books detailing
the young orphan's magical adventures _ think of the sort of mood
shift that came between J.R.R. Tolkien's ``Hobbit'' and
``Fellowship of the Ring.'' Also, for the first time a Harry book
ends on a somber note.
</P>
<P>
   Book 4 doesn't have the emotional resonance of the best parts of
Book 3, focusing more on adventures than introspection. But it does
provide a satisfying depth for several characters in author J.K.
Rowling's carefully imagined world, including new insights into
Professor Severus Snape, Hagrid the groundskeeper and even the evil
Lord You-Know-Who.
</P>
<P>
   And the book keeps up the awesome inventiveness, deadpan humor
and gripping pace of previous installments, despite a 732-page
count that gives ``Goblet of Fire'' the heft of a decent
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   (Warning, Warning, Warning: Potter fans may want to stop reading
here, unless they want to know details in the plot the book's
publisher has guarded as zealously as an Azbakan prisoner.)
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly, Rowling tinkers some with the series formula. For
instance, she starts with a chapter featuring the evil Lord
Voldemort rather than hero Harry, and dominates Harry's year at the
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with a ``Triwizard
Tournament'' of challenges rather than the magical game Quidditch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's tradition to spare.
</P>
<P>
   The Sorting Hat is back, with a newly written song to boot.
(``It's got to be a pretty boring life, hasn't it, being a hat?''
comments Harry's friend Ron Weasley. ``I suppose it spends all year
making up the next one.'')
</P>
<P>
   Wronged outcast Sirius Black, eating rats for sustenance, keeps
a godfatherly eye on Harry's welfare. Quidditch is still Harry's
favorite game, with the book's first chunk dedicated to the
Quidditch World Cup (Ireland vs. Bulgaria), with a dark faction of
fans rioting in a scary rally against Muggles (non-magical people).
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Rowling flawlessly knits her plotlines together, with
seemingly casual early details taking on meaningful force by the
end. (Ever wonder why Hogwarts student Neville Longbottom lives
with his grandmother? It turns out to matter.)
</P>
<P>
   And as usual, Rowling slips in sly jokes that keep adults
entertained too (``Moi?'' says a hefty woman accused of giantess
blood. ``I 'ave big bones!'')
</P>
<P>
   The book focuses less on the funny-to-fascinating details of
life at a magical boarding school, with more attention on the
coming showdown _ it's a seven-book series _ between the good
wizards on Harry's side and the Death Eater followers of evil.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most-hyped aspects of the book pre-publication _ that
Harry and his friends would discover the opposite sex _ is fun but
not earthshaking. The romances, such as they are, are old-fashioned
for the real 14-year-old set, with on-target agonies about whom to
invite to the Yule Ball and a light-handed lecture against favoring
beauty over brains.
</P>
<P>
   The book doesn't hit every note perfectly, though.
</P>
<P>
   The previous timeless atmosphere is jarred a bit with mentions
of Playstations and Aqualungs.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a subplot with the characters called house elves _
whose dialect will grit the teeth of anyone who hated Jar Jar Binks
of ``Star Wars'' notoriety _ creating a parallel between the elves'
lives and slavery, which hovers uncomfortably between seriousness
and humor.
</P>
<P>
   The book's scarier sections are certain to re-ignite a debate
over whether younger children should read the book, technically
aimed at ages 9 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   A beloved character faces brief torture; another character (as
Rowling forewarned) is killed; there's one scene with a chopped-off
hand and another with magical curses that could easily raise the
hackles of protective parents. (``Abracadabra!,'' for instance,
will never have the same ring, now that Rowling has co-opted it as
the fatal ``Avada Kedavra'' spell.)
</P>
<P>
   But the book is unquestionably aimed at children, regardless of
its older fans, and adults often forget the horrors in older
children's classics that go over young readers' heads. It seems a
shame to deny the book's intended audience the creative world of
``Goblet of Fire'' simply because of its honesty in including doses
of both good and evil to illustrate the battle between the two.

SAFETY INNOVATIONS MAKE NASCAR FATALITIES A RARITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l, s and f coding; includes driver death text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another driver has been killed at New Hampshire International
Speedway, the second in less than two months to die in a wreck
during practice.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitable questions follow: Is it the track? Is it a safety
problem with the cars? Is it the speed?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: none of those. It is the sudden stops.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to a spectacular, but nonfatal, wreck last spring at
Daytona International Speedway in Florida. Ricky Rudd, in the Bud
Shootout, bounced off a couple of cars (a good thing), flipped his
Winston Cup car onto its roof (a good thing), and slid the length
of the straightaway (another good thing).
</P>
<P>
   Rudd walked away.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of wreck that gets the adrenaline pumping in the
grandstands. A wreck, in itself, is not a good thing, but Rudd was
relatively uninjured because his car was built to take all the
things Rudd's car did. Bouncing off other cars, flipping onto the
roof, and sliding on that roof dissipate the energy of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   As fans gather at NHIS in Loudon, N.H., Kenny Irwin and Adam
Petty are on the minds of all. Irwin died Friday when his car
slammed viciously into the wall at Turn 3 just yards from where
Petty was killed May 12.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to hold this thought, but fatalities are now rare
in NASCAR racing because of how the cars are built. Petty ran
straight into the wall at about 135 miles per hour. Accounts say
Irwin hit the wall hard and then flipped. He likely would have been
better off had he flipped and then slid into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in this type of crash, drivers and designers say, is
that although you can ``cage'' the driver's body _ strapping him
securely into a seat, surrounded by crumple zones _ you cannot
protect the neck and the brain in a sudden stop from high speed.
All else stops securely, but the head, heavy with helmet, keeps
moving, possibly resulting in a snapped neck or the brain smashing
against the skull.
</P>
<P>
   The car you drive on the highway is basically a stamped piece of
steel with soft crumple zones meant to withstand crashes that, by
NASCAR standards, are relatively slow-speed events. Winston Cup
cars crash at speeds of 130 miles per hour and far higher. The
challenge, then, in building a Winston Cup car is to balance
stiffness that will protect the driver with enough softness front
and rear to absorb the kinetic energy of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup cars are, in basic form, a body made of welded
pieces slipped onto a complex, tubular frame. The frame is made up
of four sections: front and rear clips (ends), center section, and
roll cage.
</P>
<P>
   John Valentine, chief engineer/racing, research and vehicle
technology for Ford Motor Co., described these sections. The most
important, he said, is the center section where the driver sits. It
combines the center section with the roll cage. The whole package,
Valentine said, ``is literally a cage.'' Steel tubing with wall
thickness of one-eighth of an inch protects the driver on the
sides, rear, front, and roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to maintain the structural integrity and keep the
occupant encased,'' Valentine said. In addition, he said, ``it
forms the backbone of the car. You don't want a racecar flexing in
the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinner, collapsible tubing .083-of-an-inch wall thickness is
used in the front and rear clips. Up front, the tubing crumples in
a crash, absorbing energy. In addition, the motor and transmission
are positioned so they will slide beneath the car, after the motor
mounts shear, rather than projecting into the driver's compartment.
In addition to the engine, the front clip also holds the
suspension. The suspension system is attached with restraining
straps so wheels and suspension parts don't go flying into the
stands, along the track, or back into the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Tubing of the same thickness is used in the rear clip as are
suspension straps. It, too, is designed to crumple in a crash, but
also holds the fuel cell, a fire-retardant fuel source far safer
than the gas tanks of old. There are check valves in the fuel lines
to shut off fuel if the engine is separated from the chassis.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR design, Valentine said, ``is all about energy
management.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the crashes that crowds like to see are often the
safest, he said. ``One where the car is sliding a great deal, the
tires are smoking, it's scraping off other cars, off the wall,
skidding into the grass. You're scraping off the energy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who spoke before Irwin's crash, said the worst
crashes ``are the ones where there's not a lot of energy
absorption.''
</P>
<P>
   Crashes like Petty's and Irwin's.
</P>
<P>
   But these types of crashes _ direct hits to an immovable surface
_ are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Safety evolves race by race, accident by accident. The airborne
crashes of the late 1980s have been mostly halted because of flaps
now installed at the rear of the roofline. They pop up when cars
get sideways or backward (and lose their aerodynamics) and keep
them from flying.
</P>
<P>
   Driver's seats have evolved, too, and today hug the driver tight
in an aluminum frame that is meant to hold up under huge crash
pressures while bending just enough to absorb energy.
</P>
<P>
   Nets on the window and behind the driver are ``basically to
contain the driver in the vehicle,'' said Valentine. They keep head
and arms inside and help prevent whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty, who lost his grandson, Adam, in May, said Friday,
``There ain't nothing the matter with the racetrack. These guys run
those things 200 miles per hour. It's circumstance with the way you
stop them so quick. The body just can't take it.''

.08 NATIONWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, July 10, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past two decades, the country has made great progress in
keeping drunks off the road and reducing the toll of accidents they
cause. But alcohol remains the single biggest factor in fatal
accidents, and it is past time to take the next step against drunk
driving: establishment of a national blood-alcohol limit of .08
grams per deciliter.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Senate passed a transportation appropriations
bill that includes a provision requiring states to adopt this
standard or lose federal highway money. The House has no such
clause in its appropriations bill, so it will be up to a conference
committee this month to decide whether the US moves toward a
nationwide standard, like the nationwide minimum drinking age of
21.
</P>
<P>
   The .08 provision is bitterly fought by the beverage and
restaurant industries, which claim it will ensnare casual, social
drinkers. But as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
notes, to reach the .08 level, a 170-pound male would have to throw
down at least four 12-ounce beers on an empty stomach. A 137-pound
female would have to drain at least three beers in an hour on an
empty stomach.
</P>
<P>
   At the .08 level, the ability of a driver to brake, steer,
change lanes, exercise good judgment, or focus attention can
decrease by as much as 60 percent. A driver with a blood alcohol
level between .05 and .09 is 11 times more likely to be killed in
an accident than drivers who have had nothing to drink.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states already have the .08 limit; most others set it
at .10. In Massachusetts, judges and juries can infer from an .08
reading that a driver was criminally impaired, but the test result
alone does not necessarily prove that. The Cellucci administration
has filed bills to make an .08 reading proof by itself, but the
Legislature has not gone along.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of a national .08 standard would bring this state and
others into line. The one House member from this state on the
transportation conference committee, John Olver, favors the .08
limit, which also has the endorsement of the Clinton
administration. Congress could improve the safety of the nation's
roads by turning a deaf ear to the lobbyists and adopting the .08
standard.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba _ The horse-drawn carriages and rickety bicycles
that course through the streets lend this town an air of permanent
expectation, as if it is waiting to catch up with modern life
magically and suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   The art of waiting was perfected here over the last seven months
as friends and relatives of this city's favorite son, Elian
Gonzalez, put his face on posters and banners during their vigil
for his return.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Elian is back in Cuba, the posters are gone. People
have begun to reclaim their routines, just as the posters of Elian
that once adorned the main drag have been replaced with brightly
colored mask paintings in preparation for this month's carnival.
</P>
<P>
   But the waiting that is part of daily life continues. On Elian's
street, his neighbors wonder when he will return from Havana, where
he has been readjusting since his arrival on June 28. Elian paid a
brief surprise visit to Cardenas on July 4, then returned to
Havana. Some wonder if his fame will bring better times to
Cardenas, which has seen many people leave secretly by boat.
</P>
<P>
   Along the marshy spots where Elian and his mother began their
doomed voyage, police officers and soldiers stand guard in case
anyone else tries to sneak out. And nearby, Juan Pedro Garcia waits
for the warm rains that will bring the crabs out of their hiding
places and eventually onto his dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything will be calm because Fidel said everything is
calm,'' said Garcia, who had gone out early in the morning looking
for crabs, only to return, tired and slick with sweat, with one
lonely crab. ``Let the crabs come now, so we can eat them and have
a beer for carnival. Elian is back, but they haven't come back
yet!''
</P>
<P>
   This area is so famous for its crabs that a huge statue of one
greets visitors on the road into town. And although most people had
never heard of Cardenas until they heard of Elian, people here like
to point out that it was famous long before. The nation's flag was
first flown here, by a Cuban patriot who sailed from New Orleans in
1850 and raised it in defiance of Spanish colonial rule. This was
the first Cuban city to have electricity, thanks to the booming
sugar and coffee industries in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think after recent events we will know Cardenas before and
after Elian,'' said Lazaro Mirano Chirino, the town historian.
``Among the symbols of the city, we have to include Elian, who
became a symbol of Cardenas who moved all honest people of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of that was in abundance in the local museum, where
Miriam Torres Perez watched over a room filled from floor to
ceiling with posters, letters, poems and even kites dedicated to
Elian. Pictures of visitors, including Fidel Castro himself, shared
space with that of others, like Patch Adams, the doctor whose life
inspired a Robin Williams movie. The items on display had come from
all over Cuba and beyond. The most recent addition was a painting
of Elian with angel wings attached to the back of his Tommy
Hilfiger shirt, fluttering over a book of the nationalist hero Jose
Marti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Elian returned I guess we'll take it down,'' she said.
``But we should save everything. He is a boy who made history, and
when he is a man he should know what was done for him. He may
remember some things, but he is only 6.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the changes he suffered,'' she said. ``They say you can
reason at 7, but when he was 5 he went through tragedies until he
was reunited with his father. Without wanting to, he became famous.
And we became famous too. For us, we had the luck of his being born
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the T-shirt that Loinaz Gonzalez wore was once as famous
as the ones that featured Elian's face. His sweat-soaked shirt read
``Together We Can Do Much,'' a revolutionary slogan that seems now
to refer more to the mutual help Cubans rely on to make it through
rough times. For hours, he and a dozen friends stood in a rice
paddy on the outskirts of town, cutting stalks, stripping them
clean and laying the grains out to dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been out since six this morning,'' said Gonzalez, who
like many people here shares sympathies and a surname with Elian
but is not related to him. He has done this for 33 years, he said,
to make sure he has enough food beyond what he receives from his
monthly ration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cleared this out and everyone has a place to plant their
own,'' he said. ``There is no rice in the stores. I eat a lot of
rice. I eat three plates. To do that, you need to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who said he retired from the Red Cross a few years
ago, was satisfied that the harvest would last through the year.
``A man needs more than one job,'' he said. ``With one job you
cannot live.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, no number of jobs would keep them here, and they try
to slip out to Miami on boats. The marshes near the bus garage
outside of town were a popular departure point until the world
learned of Elian and Cardenas last year. A military outpost is now
along the winding road that leads to the marshes, and a police
officer patrols on a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad place to walk through,'' said Mario Gonzalez, a bus
driver. ``It used to be the easiest way, but with Elian, it got
complicated there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Mendez, a co-worker, interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who want to leave,'' Mendez said.
``But it does not affect us. Who wants to go, let them go. That's
their business.''
</P>
<P>
   But if they want to leave, they now have to go farther out along
the coast to avoid detection. Mario Gonzalez said he was staying.
Life, he insisted, would return to normal, for him, for his town
and for Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will pass and people will forget,'' he said. ``Time will
erase it. He will walk on the street one day and people will not
notice him.''

CHINA FEARS USING WINDOWS FOR PCS MAY BE LIKE GIVING AWAY HOUSE
KEYS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Janet Reno is not the only one worried about
Bill Gates' software monopoly: China's leaders are, too.
</P>
<P>
   They are concerned that the country is growing overly dependent
on the Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system, which controls
microcomputers running everything from banks to President Jiang
Zemin's e-mail box. But the Chinese government, itself a master at
monopoly, is taking its case against Microsoft not to the
courtroom, but to the marketplace, albeit with a bit of
administrative fiat. It is backing the Linux operating system,
which was created by a Finnish university student in 1991 and is
distributed free to anyone who wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want one company to monopolize the software market,''
said Chen Chong, a deputy minister of information industries who
oversees the computer industry in China. With Linux, ``we can
control the security,'' he added, so ``we can control our own
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Chinese have likened dependence on Microsoft
to leaving the keys to the country's increasingly computerized
economy in the hands of a potential enemy. Some warn that secret
holes in Microsoft's computer code might allow the United States
access to Chinese networks or even enable it, in time of war, to
shut those networks down.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns were heightened last year when a cryptographer for
a Canadian software firm working in the United States said he had
found a feature in Windows called an NSAKey _ as in National
Security Agency, the U.S. government agency that gathers electronic
signal intelligence worldwide. Though Microsoft said the key was
innocuous and no support has been found for any sinister
explanation, ``no one can guarantee that Windows does not have back
doors,'' said Liu Bo, a former Microsoft executive who is now chief
executive of Red Flag, a Chinese government-backed company set up
to create software based on Linux, and to encourage a software
industry in China.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, various arms of the government have been warning of
the security risk posed by the country's reliance on Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without information security, there is no national security in
politics, economics and military affairs,'' declared an editorial
in People's Liberation Army Daily earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft calls such fears nonsense and says it continues to
enjoy a strong working relationship with the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shared product information with them,'' said Michael
Rawding, Microsoft's regional director in China, ``and I believe
that their comfort with our product information led them to allow
the launch'' of Windows 2000, Microsoft's new business-oriented
operating system, in China last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Windows source code, which Microsoft keeps secret,
Linux's code is open for all to see and is freely distributed with
the stipulation that anybody can improve it as long as any
modifications are shared with the rest of the world. The almost
communistic ``from each according to his ability, to each according
to his need'' approach appeals to China's Marxist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the government's stand, no one is suggesting that
Microsoft is finished in China. Though it will not provide specific
sales figures, the company says its software sales in China surged
80 percent last year and continue to grow. But the government's
move to diversify may reflect a broader dissatisfaction with
Microsoft and its founder, Gates, who just a few years ago was
hailed as a hero by China's young technology enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in Microsoft's image was the introduction of
its Chinese-language Windows 95 operating system, which was
programmed to display references to ``Communist bandits'' and to
exhort users to ``take back the mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing, infuriated to learn that Microsoft had used computer
programmers in Taiwan to write the software, demanded that the
company hire mainland programmers to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the company's critics is its former general manager
for China, Juliet Wu, who has become a national celebrity with her
withering, best-selling expose, ``Up Against the Wind: Microsoft,
IBM and Me.'' The picture she paints of Microsoft as an arrogant
Goliath feeds into the irritation many Chinese computer users feel
toward the company.
</P>
<P>
   Wu and other critics say Microsoft's pricing _ a software
program can cost as much as an average office worker's monthly
salary _ forces users to buy pirated copies of the company's
software. (The Business Software Alliance, a nonprofit trade group,
estimates that as much as 95 percent of all software in China is
pirated, though the industry hopes China's expected admission to
the World Trade Organization will change that.)
</P>
<P>
   Liu Dongli, an Internet entrepreneur in the southern province of
Fujian, was so enraged by having to pay $241 for the Windows 98
operating system that he sued the company for unfair pricing. The
suit was withdrawn when Liu realized that Microsoft charges no more
for its products in China than it does elsewhere. ``But that
doesn't mean we lost the case,'' he fumed, vowing to bring suit
again when he has more evidence. ``Monopoly is not a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The news media, meanwhile, have criticized Microsoft for suing a
company last year over the sale of pirated software. Microsoft,
which was asking for $200,000 in damages, lost the case because the
Chinese court ruled that it had sued the wrong company. The defeat
only darkened Microsoft's ominous silhouette in the eyes of many
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is a bully,'' said Hua Yuqing, a young Internet
entrepreneur, who complains that Microsoft's high prices and
proprietary computer code squelch creativity. He is building a
business creating software programs that run on Linux. ``I don't
want to feel that I'm subconsciously controlled,'' Hua said,
referring to the dependence on Microsoft that comes with using its
products.
</P>
<P>
   Hua and a half-dozen computer programmers are using Linux to
start a company that rents access to software, applications like
accounting and sales-tracking, through the Internet, rather than
selling copies of the software programs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's public relations in China has been a boon for Linux.
So far, several companies _ including Red Flag, which is backed by
President Jiang's son, Jiang Mianhang, and TurboLinux, based in San
Francisco _ have introduced Chinese-language versions of the Linux
operating system in China. Many other companies have started to
provide software and services for China's Linux users.

DAY RETURNS TO HOME AWAY FROM HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ At times, it appears that Pat Day was born
to win horse races. He's a four-time Eclipse Award winner, he's led
the nation in victories six times and is third in lifetime wins
behind only Laffit Pincay Jr. and Bill Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   But the 46-year-old Day is most dangerous when a $1 million
purse is at stake. The veteran jockey has won a record 21
million-dollar races, and he will try to add to that total Sunday
when he rides Cat Thief in the Grade I Hollywood Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Day has enjoyed past success at Hollywood Park, winning nine
Grade I races and 12 stakes overall at the Inglewood oval. It's his
home away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the main reason for my success there is that I've been
well-mounted,'' Day said by telephone this week from Louisville,
where he is about to wrap up his 28th riding title at Churchill
Downs. ``The horses I've ridden have been very well-prepared by
their respective trainers, and of course you have to have some
breaks in the races. Obviously, things have gone our way there.''
</P>
<P>
   Day rode his first million-dollar winner, Wild Again, in the
inaugural Breeders' Cup Classic at Hollywood Park in 1984. He
remembers the race like it happened yesterday, how he had to
overcome a three-horse driving, bumping finish with Gate Dancer and
Slew O' Gold and then sweated out a 10-minute stewards' inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember what I had for breakfast,'' Day joked, ``but
I've been blessed with the ability to recall horses in races and
their idiosyncrasies and any problems they might have had in the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Day said Wild Again was a handful that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd been tryin to get out basically from the time we went
under the wire the first time,'' he said. ``After a quarter-mile
into the race, the remainder of the race, he was leaning out pretty
severely. When we came off the turn and into the stretch, given as
hard as my horse had been running up to that point, when Slew O'
Gold ranged up on the outside of me, I really thought that my horse
would just hang it up. I don't believe I've ever ridden a horse
that tried any harder than he did in the stretch run, or showed any
more courage under fire than he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wasn't sure when I went under the wire if I had won
or if Gate Dancer had won. When I spoke to the stewards, I told
them my horse had been trying to get out basically the whole way
and that I did what I thought was a quality job of maintaining a
straight course while trying to keep him running. I wasn't sure if
I had drifted out and caused any of it.''
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy delay, the stewards ruled Gate Dancer was the
cause of most of the bumping between the three horses and Wild
Again's number stayed up.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 20 more million-dollar victories for Day, none
in the Gold Cup. When he won the race aboard Blushing John in 1989,
it was a $500,000 event. Blushing John was named top older male
horse that year.
</P>
<P>
   Blushing John was beaten by Sabona in The Californian, the final
major steppingstone to the Gold Cup, but Day said he was confident
he could reverse the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rode him in the Gold Cup the way I probably should have
ridden him in The Californian,'' he said. ``He relaxed back off 'em
early, went after the horses when he was ready and drew off in the
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Day has won four Breeders' Cup races at Hollywood Park,
including two in 1987 when he guided Epitome to victory in the
Juvenile Fillies and Theatrical to the winner's circle in the Turf.
He also won aboard 2-year-old champion and Horse of the Year
Favorite Trick in the 1997 Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Day will be aboard a horse he knows quite well. He's
ridden Cat Thief in 13 of the horse's 26 lifetime starts, including
victories in last year's Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park and the
Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park in November.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief is the type of horse that can frustrate both a trainer
and his jockey. He's won only four times, mostly because he's head
strong and refuses to give his best effort every time out,
according to Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like playing cat and mouse with him, it's more a
head game with him,'' Day said. ``You can't manhandle him or get
real aggressive with him or he gets aggressive back. So you gotta
kind of finesse him into the race, and hopefully you can conserve
him to the last three-sixteenths of a mile because he'll give you
that burst, that short acceleration to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember riding him in the Fountain of Youth and the Florida
Derby last year, two races he barely lost and could have won, and I
thought he was wimping on me. I say he wimped because I felt he got
right down on the wire and was not persevering for me. I didn't
ride him the remainder of the spring and then I got back on him for
the Swaps and he showed some tremendous tenacity that day, some
trem endous courage under fire. He was headed by General Challenge
at the top of the stretch, fought back gamely and was not to be
denied. It was just a very gutsy effort. But he doesn't do that all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   So which Cat Thief can we expect to see Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know for sure what you're dealing with when the
doors open,'' Day said. ``And he doesn't give you a fair indication
in the post parade. Some horses, maybe when they fire big, they'll
be really on their toes and bouncing and slightly lathered up over
the shoulders. And then maybe they'll be dull and lethargic in the
post parade and they run dull. He warms up basically the same way
every time. There's no real indication until you actually get into
the race.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the stakes are high, both Day and Cat Thief have proved
they can be difficult to beat.

 SHANGHAI, China: Linux users. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chinese government tried for more than a decade to develop
an operating system of its own, but was unable to keep up with the
fast-changing industry. Linux gives the country the tools to build
that system now _ and, in the Chinese view, the fact that the Linux
code is not privately owned assures that any security it wants to
build into its computer systems will not have undetectable
vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But even Linux enthusiasts profess some ambivalence about the
government's interest. Software developers writing programs for
Linux in China say some of their overseas colleagues worry that
China may not play by the rules for collaborating and sharing, and
may adapt Linux to create a proprietary system instead.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, China represents a market potential of such size,
and government influence over the market is still so strong, that
Beijing's support can turn almost any product into an industry
standard domestically. By the end of next year, the country may
well be the third-largest PC market in the world, and software
sales are expected to grow more than 30 percent a year for the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   As China's economy becomes increasingly integrated with that of
the region and the world, much of Asia is likely to follow its
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Liu, the chief executive of Red Flag, says a third of the
country's Internet servers _ the computers that power Web sites _
are already using Linux operating systems. He estimated that by the
end of next year Linux will run half of all servers in China and as
much as a third of the country's desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   However, those estimates may be exaggerated. Technology research
firm International Data Corp.'s Asia-Pacific division says its data
show less than 3 percent of all PC servers shipped to China last
year were loaded with Linux. But IDC expects the number to more
than double this year, and Linux's real market share is most
certainly higher because the operating system can be downloaded
free from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux, without doubt, has gained some headway among software
developers in China,'' Rawding said. ``However, I have yet to see
any mission-critical organization deploy Linux because the truth of
the matter is that in businesses, you want the support and service
to be available to you instantly when something does go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Great Wall Computer, one of China's biggest PC
makers, has already shipped 200,000 desktop computers loaded with
the Linux operating system, which looks much like Windows though it
cannot yet match all of Microsoft's features.
</P>
<P>
   Ma Li, marketing chief at Great Wall, says his company shifted
toward Linux at Beijing's urging. ``As a leading enterprise,'' he
said, ``we should respond to the call of the government.''

KENNY IRWIN GREW UP WITH THE SPORT OF RACING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes Kenny Irwin profile text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ His first racing event came at an age when many
youngsters are working to master multiplication tables instead of
racetracks. Kenny Irwin was just 6 years old, and his early
interest in the sport would translate into later success, including
rookie of the year honors on four racing circuits.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Indianapolis native and Charlotte, N.C.,
resident died Friday in a pre-qualifying crash at New Hampshire
International Speedway. It was the second tragedy at NHIS in less
than two months, and it left many NASCAR drivers to once again
reflect upon the talent, character, and promise of a fellow
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably go back 10 years with him, racing midgets,'' said
Mike Bliss, referring to the United States Auto Club Skoal Midget
Series, where Irwin posted eight victories and 20 runner-up
finishes in five seasons (1991-95). ``We weren't the best of
friends, but we raced against each other. We were competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart, also an Indiana native, said he met Irwin in 1991,
when both were running for the rookie of the year title at the
Indianapolis Speeddrome. He said their competition generated a
``love-hate relationship'' _ and a rivalry that continued to the
Winston Cup level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through nine years of rivalry, though, there's been a mutual
admiration and respect for one another and for what each other
could do in a racecar,'' said Stewart, the 1999 Winston Cup rookie
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart added that Irwin was the toughest competitor he has ever
faced. ``It didn't matter whether it was a sprint car on pavement
on Friday night, or a midget on dirt on Saturday night, or a Silver
Crown car on dirt on Sunday. You knew you had to be on your game
because if you weren't, he was going to beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin captured his first rookie honor in 1993, in the
Stoops/Freightliner Sprint Car Series. He captured another rookie
title the following season in the USAC Silver Crown Series and
finished second in the overall standings in 1995. He was the
National Midget Series champion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Irwin captured rookie of the year honors in the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series after posting two victories, seven top-5,
and 10 top-10 finishes. He ended the season 10th in the points
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin's fourth rookie of the year honor helped put him on the
map, because it came in the Winston Cup Series, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That year, he started in 32 races (finishing 28) and earned his
first pole position in his 36th career start (he raced four times
on the circuit in 1997). He also became the highest-starting rookie
in the history of the Brickyard 400 with a fourth-place qualifying
effort.
</P>
<P>
   He finished 1998 with one top-5 and four top-10 finishes, and
became the first rookie to top $1 million in earnings in a full
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this a thousand times since I started Winston Cup:
Kenny's part of the reason I got here because he pushed me to make
myself better each week,'' said Stewart. ``There's not a lot of
guys who have worked any harder than Kenny has to get where he's
gotten in his racing career.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1999, Irwin was beginning to enjoy the fruits of his labor.
He was named driver of the No. 42 BellSouth Mobility/Ericsson
Chevrolet on the Winston Cup circuit and also competed in 15 NASCAR
Busch Series events in the same car.
</P>
<P>
   He never won a Winston Cup race (his best finish was third at
the prestigious Daytona 500 last season), but being added to the
BellSouth team prompted him to speak with much enthusiasm about
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Many drivers spoke about Irwin's demeanor, and many uttered the
same words used to describe Adam Petty, the 19-year-old who was
killed May 12 in the same area as Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny was one of the young drivers who was full of energy and
he always had a smile,'' said Ricky Craven. ``That's what I liked
about him; he was always able to stop by and say a few words.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Park, who Friday questioned whether the NHIS track should
be investigated because of the tragedies, said he believed the
drivers should conduct themselves the remainder of the weekend with
a show-must-go-on demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Adam and Kenny would want the show to go on and I believe
they will be watching down on us,'' he said, referring to Sunday's
thatlook.com 300. ``It's just sad that they won't be with us. Both
(racers) were devout Christians, so I know they are in good
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Craven, who fought back emotions Friday, said: ``This is as
uncomfortable as it gets. Nothing prepares you for this. You're
aware of the risks, but nothing prepares you for this.''

INQUIRY SUPPORTS HARASSMENT CHARGES AGAINST GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two-star general accused of sexually harassing
the Army's highest-ranking woman has requested early retirement
after military investigators substantiated the charges against him,
Pentagon officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith has denied any wrongdoing, but he asked
to step down after a letter of reprimand was entered into his
personnel file, the officials said. He is to retire on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's inspector general determined that he harassed and
assaulted Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy in her Pentagon office in 1996.
But officials said there were no plans to reduce his rank or
retirement benefits through a Grade Determination Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, whose high-profile allegations were closely followed
throughout the armed services and by women's rights advocates,
released a statement expressing satisfaction at the conclusion of a
case she had pursued reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am satisfied with the Army's action in this case,'' she
said. ``As far as I am concerned, this matter is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the Army, Smith said: ``I have always
and continue to maintain that I did not commit these allegations
and I am deeply disappointed with the decision to substantiate
them. However, for the good of my family and the Army, we have
elected to put it behind us and move on with our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The action against Smith, a veteran of three tours in Vietnam,
ended the first instance of sexual harassment charges lodged by one
Army general against another. The case embarrassed the Army, which
has been roiled by a series of sex scandals and has sought to
appeal to women by insisting that it will not tolerate sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In a heavily edited report released Friday under the Freedom of
Information Act, the Army's inspector general, Lt. Gen. Michael
Ackerman, concluded that Kennedy told the truth about the encounter
with Smith even though only the two generals were present.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the incident, the two were of equal rank, and
they both said only that they had met in Kennedy's office and that
the encounter ended with a hug, the report said. Beyond that, they
``were in total disagreement as to what happened when they were
alone,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith testified that he gave Kennedy ``a hug and possibly a
`cheek kiss,''' the report said, but he ``strongly denied any
wrongdoing.'' Prior to her allegations, Smith said he considered
Kennedy a ``family friend,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   But the inspector general concluded that Smith's actions
amounted to assault and battery and sexual harassment. The evidence
did not support a more serious charge of indecent behavior to
gratify sexual desires, the investigation found.
</P>
<P>
   ``By holding her and kissing her against her will,'' the report
said, Smith displayed conduct that ``was unbecoming of an officer
and a gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general largely based his conclusions on the
strength of Kennedy's testimony and the belief that she had more to
lose than to gain by making her charges public.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy filed charges against Smith only last year, three years
after the incident. She pressed the case after Smith was named to
become the Army's deputy inspector general, a post that would have
given him responsibility for investigating charges of sexual
harassment, among other types of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evaluating the allegations came down to a question of
credibility,'' the report said. ``There appeared to be no motive
for'' Kennedy ``to jeopardize her career and reputation by making
false allegations against'' Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not in competition for assignments,'' the report
said. ``She did not arrange the office call. There was no apparent
incentive for her to ruin his unblemished career and destroy their
friendship with false allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general concluded: ``When one weighed all the
testimony and considered all the evidence, coupled with the lack of
motive to lie, the preponderance or greater weight of the evidence
was sufficient to substantiate'' Kennedy's allegations against
Smith.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Eugene R. Fidell, an expert on military law, said there was
nothing unusual about the inspector general's approach to the sort
of dispute frequently dismissed as ``he said, she said.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They found her a credible witness based on her demeanor,''
Fidell said. ``They decided she's telling the truth, and one of the
factors that decided it is she doesn't have a motive to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the investigation was not part of a criminal proceeding
or a court martial, investigators did not have to pursue proof
beyond a reasonable doubt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith asserted that he had been treated unfairly. He provided 52
character witnesses in his defense. The inspector general's office
interviewed seven of those references and six others before
determining that there were no other known reports of prior
misconduct by Smith, whom it called ``a highly respected officer.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general noted that while Kennedy did not formally
pursue the case against Smith until last year, she referred to the
incident in 1997, five months after it occurred. Without providing
details, the report noted: ``The complainant, in an open forum,
cited it as an example of how she had been sexually harassed'' by
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The report said she eventually decided to report the incident
``out of loyalty to the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony in May honoring her 31 years of military service,
Kennedy, who is scheduled to retire next month, urged women in
uniform to report incidents of harassment, or ``misconduct will
continue to harm us.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the memorial to Women in Military Service to America
at Arlington National Cemetery, she exhorted the crowd of 100
well-wishers to heed the advice of French novelist Emile Zola to
``live out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Living out loud begins by telling a friend and then later by
telling people in authority who care,'' Kennedy said. ``Our army is
filled with women and men who care and are in a position to change
and improve the conditions in which we serve.''

FOR VENUS WILLIAMS, SINGLES TITLE HER JUST DESSERT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TEN-WIMBLEDON) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ There were drive-by shootings that jangled
the nerves of the residents who flinched through life in Compton,
Calif., but the sound that still lingers in the head of Venus
Williams has nothing to do with gang grudges.
</P>
<P>
   For a spindly child who was barely bigger than her racket
handle, there was nothing better to perk up Williams' ears than the
faint music-box jingle from the ice-cream truck rambling toward the
tennis courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you know, maybe living in Compton isn't like the most
desired place to live, not in the top 100,'' Williams said with a
sly smile after her semifinal victory against her sister, Serena,
on Thursday. ``But I had a great time. I still miss the ice-cream
trucks. They had the best ice-cream trucks. Spent all my allowance
on the ice-cream trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   She's a grown-up now. And with nearly $5 million in career
earnings, she is a 20-year-old who has made the leap from
Dreamsicles to strawberries and cream. After an improbable rise
with the aid of her father's unorthodox ways, she is in position to
make history. If Williams can counter the power of the defending
champion Lindsay Davenport on Saturday, she will become the first
African-American woman since Althea Gibson to win Wimbledon. And if
she captures this title, Venus Williams will join her sister Serena
Williams as a Grand Slam winner. No sisters in tennis history have
each won Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't go on no `ifs,' like `If this happens,''' Richard
Williams said after signing autographs on the grounds Friday.
``We're here to make things happen. We're here to set any kind of
history for anyone who wants to see history. I understand Althea
Gibson won a singles title here, and we're here to follow in the
footsteps she laid.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport could be the snag in the grand plan. Beneath the hype
whirling around every move made by the Williams sisters and every
word uttered by their father, Davenport has just blended into the
colorful scene. No one would know it from the bravado and
confidence gushing from the Williams' family, but Davenport has
handled Venus Williams over the years, winning nine out of the 12
matches they've played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played her a lot in the past, and a lot of times I found
the key was, you know, find a way to get her serve back,''
Davenport said. ``You have to get them back deep so she obviously
doesn't have put-away shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams craves the soft, short floaters off her
opponents' return. Her favorite shot is the swinging forehand
volley, a weapon she used to dismantle top-ranked Martina Hingis in
the quarterfinals. She also put away her little sister with it on
occasion during the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday, the awkwardness of the sisters' semifinal was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not easy,'' said Richard Williams who did not watch the
match but was there to console Serena after losing to Venus. ``I
went home with Serena. You could see the tears in her eyes. She
hates to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, the smile was back for Serena Williams after
she laughed, joked and shared a doubles win with her big sister.
Together, they advanced to the women's doubles final after
defeating Anna Kournikova and Natasha Zvereva in straight sets. And
with that, the Williams sisters became the first African-American
team to reach the doubles final at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great tournament,'' Richard Williams said. ``It's
been phenomenal for the family. I think if Venus is serious, no one
can touch her.'' Three years ago, Venus Williams had a chance to
take the U.S. Open title long before her little sister won it last
summer. But at age 17, she wasn't savvy enough to beat Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my third Grand Slam to play in,'' Venus Williams
said. ``I wasn't even full-time on the Tour. I didn't understand
any strategy as far as, let's say you're down a breakpoint, and
maybe you should get your first serve in. Things like that never
came to my mind. It was totally different circumstances, yeah. It's
extremely different from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, everything has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's come so far,'' Richard Williams said. ``The first day I
took Venus out there on the courts, I knew she was a champion. The
reason I knew it was that I was working with three other girls who
were much older than she was. And I had a shopping cart with 550
balls in there. And those three girls were taking so long to hit
them. I had to patronize them to get them to do it. Venus never
wanted to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stopped her, she'd start crying. It got to the last
ball, and she'd say, `Say, last ball.' To this day, I still say,
`last ball' to her. I walked home, and I told my wife, `We have a
champion.' And she said, `you're just a proud father.' She was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In what seems like an instant, Venus Williams has gone from the
gangly child in Compton with the ice-cream fascination, to the
statuesque center of attention at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it's my life,'' Venus Williams said. ``The whole time
I've had a great time. I've had a great life.''

GORE FAVORS DELAY IN A FEDERAL EXECUTION, BUT NOT NATIONWIDE
MORATORIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURGETTSTOWN, Pa. _ Vice President Al Gore said Friday that he
backed the Clinton administration's decision to postpone the first
federal execution in 40 years but did not support a nationwide
moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a long-time death penalty supporter, spoke as the White
House indicated that the execution of Juan Raul Garza, now
scheduled for Aug. 5, would be postponed to await Justice
Department regulations for death row inmates to follow in seeking
clemency from the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do support the decision to put these clemency procedures in
place and, pending that, to hold off on this particular case,''
Gore said at a late afternoon news conference while campaigning in
the battleground state of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But he drew a line, at least for now, between the temporary
reprieve and any broader halt to executions because of questions of
racial or geographical disparities in application of the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not yet seen evidence that to me would justify a
nationwide moratorium,'' Gore said. ``If such evidence emerges, I
would not hesitate to support that step. But I have not seen it
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore and Bush both support the death penalty, the issue
has gained some prominence in the presidential rate because of the
decision by Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican, to declare
a moratorium on the death penalty in his state after evidence came
to light that at least a dozen death row inmates were innocent of
the crimes for which they were convicted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On his campaign trip, Gore continued his week-long assault on
pharmaceutical companies and accusing Bush of being the candidate
of the industry.``I will lead the fight for you and not for the
powerful,'' Gore told a group of the elderly at a senior citizen
center in Bridgeville. ``The HMOs and insurance companies are
supporting my opponent. I am fighting for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a half-hour later, he declined to criticize his own chief
media adviser, Carter Eskew, for the revelation that he had once
tried to obtain a lucrative public relations contract from the
pharmaceutical industry to help fight legislation like Gore's own
proposal for a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported on a memo to the industry from
Eskew and his former public relations firm, BSMG Worldwide, arguing
that prescription drugs could become a central issue of the 2000
presidential campaign and proposing a public relations drive to
``chill support'' for legislative efforts on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he countenanced such a proposal by Eskew, Gore said:
``You'll have to ask him that. What he did before he worked for me
is something you'll have to ask him.'' He called the efforts by
Eskew and his former company a ``completely separate matter'' from
his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would ask Eskew to speak to the press about his
former business activity, Gore said, ``Sure, but that's up to
him.'' Eskew did not return a call to his office. Gore's aides said
they did not contest that the memo was genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Gore accused Citizens for Better Medicare, a
group started by the drug industry of running a media campaign that
was ``polluting the airwaves.'' Democrats than tied the group to
the Bush campaign by noting that the firm of Alex Castellanos, the
media consultant working on the ads, had done work for the Bush
campaign placing its television commercials.

JOBS REPORT ADDS TO EVIDENCE ECONOMY IS SLOWING

<TEXT>
<P>
   After a disastrous May, American companies added modestly to
their payrolls in June, creating 206,000 new jobs, the Labor
Department reported Friday _reinforcing the impression that the
economy is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Job creation in the private sector has now fallen from an
average of 244,000 a month in the first quarter to only 110,000 a
month from April through June. But if companies are reluctant to
hire, they are still doing so in sufficient numbers to keep the
unemployment rate at only 4 percent in June, down from 4.1 percent
in May _ the lowest levels since the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic growth is slowing, but gently, so far,'' said James
Glassman, a senior economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The coming and going of thousands of census takers skewed the
overall job numbers in June as they had in May. The total number of
jobs created in June _ covering government employees as well as the
private sector _ was only 11,000. That was mainly because 190,000
census takers, having finished their work, left the Census Bureau's
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   In May, however, 356,000 census takers were hired, swelling the
total job count to 171,000. Without them, private sector employment
fell by 165,000, the largest decline in eight years and the first
of any size since the economy began to soar in the mid-1990s. The
May job loss had been estimated originally as 116,000, but was
revised Friday to 165,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have about 428,000 temporary census takers out
there, and they will come off the payroll, probably in July and
August,'' said Thomas Nardone, chief of the division that prepares
the employment data at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration acknowledged that the new job report
adds to the evidence that the economy is slowing. ``We do see signs
of moderation,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, ``but the
economy is still steady and stable and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices soared Friday in response to the new evidence of
slowing, the view being that the Federal Reserve will be less
likely to raise interest rates at its next policy meeting, on Aug.
22. Rising rates encourage investors to switch their money out of
stocks and into interest-bearing investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another weak month would kill an August rate hike,'' Ian
Shepherdson, chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics,
advised his clients Friday, referring to the June job report.
</P>
<P>
   But some Wall Street economists argued that while job creation
may be slowing, inflation remains an issue, even in a weakening
economy, and the Fed will have to deal with it. Labor shortages and
competition for workers, this argument goes, must eventually force
up wages and then prices, although that has not happened yet to a
significant degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is discounting any further Fed rate increases,
which I think is a mistake,'' said Peter Hooper, chief domestic
economist of Deutsche Bank North America. Mortgage rates and other
consumer rates, he argued, are not yet high enough to dampen demand
sufficiently to discourage price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Others noted that average hourly earnings for production
workers, representing about 75 percent of the 131.6 million people
in the work force, rose by 5 cents in June, to $13.71, as the
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. The increase in May had
been only 2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   When viewed over 12 months, the increase is a mild 3.6 percent.
But since January the average hourly pay for production workers
turns out to have risen at an accelerated 4 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hourly wage increase was not comforting at all,'' said
Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. But the
National Association of Manufacturers saw the glass as half full.
It noted that recent improvements in productivity have more than
paid for the hourly wage increase. The productivity growth rate
measures an average worker's output during each hour on the job.
The higher the output, the more revenue the worker brings in for
his employer to pay for wage increases without raising prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wage path implies an underlying rate of inflation of only
about 1 percent a year,'' Jerry Jasinowski, president of the
National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement. The
manufacturers have been arguing against any further Fed rate
increases, insisting that more will slow the economy too much.
</P>
<P>
   There have been six rate increases since June 1999 totaling 1.75
percentage points, and their impact on demand helps to explain why
the economy has begun to slow down, economists say. Other reasons
are also cited. One is gasoline price increases, which divert
family income from other spending. Another is heavy buying of
homes, cars, appliances, furniture _ to the point that demand is
sated.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market wealth effect no longer has its old kick,
others argue. With stock prices going sideways in recent months, or
falling in the high-tech sector, consumers no longer feel as
confident about their wealth. And a strong dollar is restricting
exports, particularly manufactured exports.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the job growth in June came in the service sector,
particularly business services, which added 54,000 jobs, and in
retailing, which added 49,000 jobs, most of them at restaurants.
Consultants led the growth in business services, with healthy
increases also in temporary help, health services, engineering and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Employment in the financial sector seemed to show the effects of
the slowing economy and higher rates. Jobs in this sector fell by
6,000 last month and 20,000 so far this year, with cutbacks in
commercial and mortgage banking, insurance and real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Construction employment, which has fluctuated sharply with the
weather, grew by 3,000 jobs in June, raising the average monthly
gain to 20,000 this year, down from 25,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the June figures gave evidence of the tight labor market.
The unemployment rate for women who support families fell in June,
as it did for teenagers and people with a high school education or
less. The number of people holding part-time jobs because they
could not get full-time work also fell.
</P>
<P>
   For blacks and Hispanics, however, the unemployment rate, which
had jumped in May, failed to fall back in June. And among the
unemployed, the percentage of job leavers _ people who quit a job
confident they can get another in a strong economy _ fell by 1.1
percentage points in June, to 12.1 percent, its lowest level in
months.

SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT CONFRONTS AIDS, AND CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SCI-AIDS) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ It was just past midnight when the phone
jangled in the home of Malegapuru Makgoba, one of South Africa's
most influential scientists. To his astonishment, he heard the
voice of President Thabo Mbeki rumbling across the line.
</P>
<P>
   The president was thumbing through scientific journals, surfing
through cyberspace and pondering the AIDS epidemic that is ravaging
this country. He was calling for advice late that January night,
but he ultimately disregarded Makgoba's counsel and began exploring
the work of two Americans who argue that HIV does not cause AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Mbeki's interest in such a theory _ though he has
never explicitly adopted it _ exploded in the world's newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent doctors accused Mbeki of dabbling in pseudoscience
while people were dying. Even government officials wondered why the
president had unleashed such a furor. ``Why not just keep quiet?''
asked Joel Netshitenzhe, the chief of government communications,
describing the concerns of some anxious officials.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday Mbeki will confront many of his critics, including
Makgoba, when he addresses thousands of researchers here on the
opening day of the 13th International Conference on AIDS. He will
stand before them, the leader of a country swept up in the plague,
with his reputation bruised and his credibility questioned.
</P>
<P>
   But if he has stumbled in his handling of the AIDS crisis here,
his struggle has also offered rare insight into the thinking of an
intensely private leader in his first year in office.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two months, as he has tried to clarify his stance,
Mbeki has painted a self-portrait of a restless intellectual, a
meticulous hands-on manager who rarely delegates decisions and a
chief executive who challenges convention, even when advisers
suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go into this work, into this office, in search of
popularity,'' Mbeki said, according to Netshitenzhe, when some
officials suggested that the president should have shied away from
the fray. ``If there are issues to be dealt with, they need to be
pursued.''
</P>
<P>
   For South Africa, it is a striking shift in substance and style.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Mandela, the country's first democratically elected
leader, delegated many of his responsibilities, serving as a
charismatic caretaker president. Mbeki thrives on details, closely
manages his cabinet and often analyzes important matters way into
the night.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's critics say this means that the president sidelines his
own ministers and experts. His supporters say this means his
ministers must be prepared to study the issues as carefully as the
president does. In practice it means that all but his most capable
of ministers sometimes fade from public view.
</P>
<P>
   For instance it was clearly Mbeki, not the health minister, who
drove the government's inquiry into the causes and treatment of
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   He was the one who came across the research by two American
biochemists, Peter Duesberg and David Rasnick, who argue that
poverty and malnutrition _ not the human immunodeficiency virus _
cause AIDS. He was the one who began questioning the safety of the
commonly prescribed drug AZT after reading criticism of the drug on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki contacted local and foreign researchers, surrounded
himself with books and journals and consulted with the minister of
health when he came across medical terms he did not understand. And
when he noticed opinions that challenged established views, he did
not hesitate to pursue them.
</P>
<P>
   He is, after all, no stranger to challenging the establishment.
During the apartheid years, he was among the first members of the
African National Congress to argue that negotiation with whites _
not armed revolution _ would lead to the demise of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   As president, he has been willing to challenge his own allies,
the labor unions, by taking a tough stance on labor negotiations
and vowing to speed privatization and to relax some protections for
workers, a position that has helped strengthen investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   And it was only natural, officials say, that Mbeki would turn
his scrutiny to AIDS. According to the United Nations, South Africa
has the largest number of people living with HIV, an estimated 4.2
million of its 44 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, he's raising these issues because in South
Africa, in our region, we've got to find, we have to find the
necessary solutions to enable us to deal with this pandemic,'' said
Essop Pahad, the minister of the office of the presidency and one
of Mbeki's close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he wants to understand something, he will not rely only
on other people's views,'' Pahad said in an interview. ``He wants
to understand it for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki is not scientifically trained, but he was an outstanding
student in South Africa and earned a scholarship to the University
of Sussex in England, where he received a degree in economics.
</P>
<P>
   His critics say the controversy shows how Mbeki's
single-mindedness and reluctance to defer to experts can be risky.
Even some government officials worry that Mbeki's ruminations on
AIDS (and the media's simplification of his views) may have
undermined efforts to prevent the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Mbeki's consultation with the two Americans was
widely broadcast on television and radio here. And counselors say
they are encountering people who assume they can engage in risky
sexual behavior because the president has suggested that HIV is not
the real cause of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much international consternation over Mbeki's
suggestions and the impact they may have that 5,000 scientists from
across the world signed a declaration affirming that HIV causes
AIDS. The statement was published this week in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are outraged at what's happening,'' said Mary Caeser,
the national coordinator of the AIDS Legal Network, a human rights
and service organization. ``While the president has the prerogative
to address any issue, people feel that the manner in which he is
handling the issue is irresponsible. It's created confusion. We've
lost ground in terms of the work we have done.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has already begun a quiet retreat. Mbeki, who
angrily described the criticism as a ``campaign of intellectual
intimidation and terrorism'' in a letter to President Clinton,
began tempering his comments during a visit to the United States in
May.
</P>
<P>
   This week the health minister, Dr. Manto Tshabalala-Msimang,
admitted in Parliament that government officials, including Mbeki,
were mistaken when they said AZT was too toxic to prescribe to
pregnant mothers. She said research showed that the benefits of the
drug clearly outweighed the risks, though she says it is still too
expensive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And an international panel of scientists convened by Mbeki
disbanded this week without making any proclamations on the
question of what causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Netshitenzhe and Pahad emphasized that Mbeki did make important
points that were rarely mentioned, including the inability of
Western science so far to cope with the disease in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The president highlighted the differences between the virus in
Africa, which is typically transmitted heterosexually, and the
strain in the West, which is most commonly transmitted through
homosexual contact and intravenous drug use. And the officials
praised him for being in the forefront of a push for a vaccine
developed in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Makgoba, who has become one of Mbeki's fiercest critics,
nevertheless says the president should get credit for financing
research into a vaccine and for being willing to evolve in his
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Makgoba admits, he was angered by the president's
public musings about AZT and by his decision to consult with the
American researchers. But he describes that as ``water under the
bridge.'' In hindsight, he says, the whole issue has helped him
better understand the man who is leading the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a continuous learner,'' said Makgoba, who heads the
Medical Research Council, the South African equivalent to the
National Institutes of Health. ``He wants to understand things.
He's basically a man who wants to exercise his power with knowledge
derived from his own understanding of things. That sets him apart
from presidents in the Western world, where most people rely on
being fed information from advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means he doesn't take accepted views easily,'' Makgoba
said. ``Sometimes it's part of his strength. It can also be his
weakness.''

ENCHANTING BUT DARKER HARRY POTTER BOOK 4 IS WORTHY OF HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKEN DENN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three-word answer for Harry Potter fans everywhere:
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's good.
</P>
<P>
   How good?
</P>
<P>
   In the generally accepted Potterific Scale of 1 to 10 _ in which
Book 1 in the wildly popular series rates an 11, Book 2 slips to a
10, and Book 3 surges to a 12 _ the madly anticipated fourth book
settles in around an 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' released to the public
at midnight Friday, is darker than the first three books detailing
the young orphan's magical adventures _ think of the sort of mood
shift that came between J.R.R. Tolkien's ``Hobbit'' and
``Fellowship of the Ring.'' Also, for the first time a Harry book
ends on a somber note.
</P>
<P>
   Book 4 doesn't have the emotional resonance of the best parts of
Book 3, focusing more on adventures than introspection. But it does
provide a satisfying depth for several characters in author J.K.
Rowling's carefully imagined world, including new insights into
Professor Severus Snape, Hagrid the groundskeeper and even the evil
Lord You-Know-Who.
</P>
<P>
   And the book keeps up the awesome inventiveness, deadpan humor
and gripping pace of previous installments, despite a 732-page
count that gives ``Goblet of Fire'' the heft of a decent
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   (Warning, Warning, Warning: Potter fans may want to stop reading
here, unless they want to know details in the plot the book's
publisher has guarded as zealously as an Azbakan prisoner.)
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly, Rowling tinkers some with the series formula. For
instance, she starts with a chapter featuring the evil Lord
Voldemort rather than hero Harry, and dominates Harry's year at the
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with a ``Triwizard
Tournament'' of challenges rather than the magical game Quidditch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's tradition to spare.
</P>
<P>
   The Sorting Hat is back, with a newly written song to boot.
(``It's got to be a pretty boring life, hasn't it, being a hat?''
comments Harry's friend Ron Weasley. ``I suppose it spends all year
making up the next one.'')
</P>
<P>
   Wronged outcast Sirius Black, eating rats for sustenance, keeps
a godfatherly eye on Harry's welfare. Quidditch is still Harry's
favorite game, with the book's first chunk dedicated to the
Quidditch World Cup (Ireland vs. Bulgaria), with a dark faction of
fans rioting in a scary rally against Muggles (non-magical people).
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Rowling flawlessly knits her plotlines together, with
seemingly casual early details taking on meaningful force by the
end. (Ever wonder why Hogwarts student Neville Longbottom lives
with his grandmother? It turns out to matter.)
</P>
<P>
   And as usual, Rowling slips in sly jokes that keep adults
entertained too (``Moi?'' says a hefty woman accused of giantess
blood. ``I 'ave big bones!'')
</P>
<P>
   The book focuses less on the funny-to-fascinating details of
life at a magical boarding school, with more attention on the
coming showdown _ it's a seven-book series _ between the good
wizards on Harry's side and the Death Eater followers of evil.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most-hyped aspects of the book pre-publication _ that
Harry and his friends would discover the opposite sex _ is fun but
not earthshaking. The romances, such as they are, are old-fashioned
for the real 14-year-old set, with on-target agonies about whom to
invite to the Yule Ball and a light-handed lecture against favoring
beauty over brains.
</P>
<P>
   The book doesn't hit every note perfectly, though.
</P>
<P>
   The previous timeless atmosphere is jarred a bit with mentions
of Playstations and Aqualungs.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a subplot with the characters called house elves _
whose dialect will grit the teeth of anyone who hated Jar Jar Binks
of ``Star Wars'' notoriety _ creating a parallel between the elves'
lives and slavery, which hovers uncomfortably between seriousness
and humor.
</P>
<P>
   The book's scarier sections are certain to re-ignite a debate
over whether younger children should read the book, technically
aimed at ages 9 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   A beloved character faces brief torture; another character (as
Rowling forewarned) is killed; there's one scene with a chopped-off
hand and another with magical curses that could easily raise the
hackles of protective parents. (``Abracadabra!,'' for instance,
will never have the same ring, now that Rowling has co-opted it as
the fatal ``Avada Kedavra'' spell.)
</P>
<P>
   But the book is unquestionably aimed at children, regardless of
its older fans, and adults often forget the horrors in older
children's classics that go over young readers' heads. It seems a
shame to deny the book's intended audience the creative world of
``Goblet of Fire'' simply because of its honesty in including doses
of both good and evil to illustrate the battle between the two.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine _ In a rare face-to-face interview about
his son's presidential campaign, former President George Bush said
Friday that Gov. George W. Bush would emerge victorious in November
largely because American voters periodically craved change, and
because President Clinton's conduct in office had sharpened that
appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush, who sat with his wife, Barbara, for a
nearly hour-long interview at the family' compound here, said that
Vice President Al Gore's ties to Clinton would not allow him to
present himself credibly as a fresh start, and that Gov. Bush's
ability to do so would prove decisive.
</P>
<P>
   The former president also cited that same cyclical impulse in
the electorate as the reason he was defeated in 1992, after one
term in office, by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was the victim of people wanting change,'' said
Bush, who served as vice president under President Ronald Reagan
for two terms before winning the presidency in 1988. He described
voters' sentiments in 1992 as ``eight years of Reagan, four years
of Bush, we want a change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think the same thing is true now,'' he said. ``I think
people kind of like change, like the idea of change from time to
time. I think that works for George's benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Mrs. Bush, the former first lady, also said that that
they thought the notion of ``Clinton fatigue'' was real, and that
their son's frequent pledge to ``restore honor and integrity'' to
the Oval Office was one that would resonate with voters who felt
that those virtues had indeed been compromised under Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't even debatable, in my view,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that the Bushes' joint interview Friday was one of
only three or four they had done over the last year, and their
comments were striking for several reasons, chief among them the
way in which Bush interpreted both his and his son's presidential
fortunes in terms of historic forces outside their control.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing his son's prospects for victory, Bush dwelled
longer on the country's itch for something different than on the
Texas governor's record and positions on issues, though he did
offer hearty praise for both. And in chalking up his own defeat in
1992 to that same itch, he rejected the prevailing view that he
lost because he failed to articulate coherently any domestic agenda
or to run as spirited a campaign as Clinton did.
</P>
<P>
   The former president and the former first lady also spoke more
harshly of Clinton's behavior in office than they had usually
allowed themselves to in the past. And while they and the Texas
governor have flatly dismissed suggestions that his candidacy was
an act of redemption and revenge, his parents' words and demeanor _
especially his mother's' _ suggested that they had not left 1992
completely behind them.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, they indicated a sensitivity to President
Bush's legacy. Mrs. Bush, almost as an aside, murmured that the
good economy now was really her husband's doing, and the former
president mentioned that he was bothered by Clinton's assertions
that Gore was perhaps the best vice president ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to argue that on my own behalf,'' Bush said,
referring to his own years as vice president. ``We had the, you
know, drug interdiction program. We had the deregulation task
force. I headed up the anti-terrorist task force. I took the case
for American missiles to Germany, the Pershings. I mean, there was
a lot of substance there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Monica Lewinsky affair and Clinton's
impeachment had hurt the country in real, meaningful ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a diminution of respect for the office of the
presidency, and it's not just here, it's abroad,'' he said, adding
that voters' concern about that ``is going to manifest itself on
election day.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's had initially come up, Bush signaled that she and
her husband would take a pass on the topic, in accordance with a
long-held vow not to speak ill of Bush's successor.
</P>
<P>
   But minutes later, Bush was discussing Americans' lowered
expectations for public officials, and when her husband said she
could not blame that entirely on Clinton, she responded, ``Oh, I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes also addressed head-on the persistent questions about
whether their son had enough knowledge about foreign affairs to
lead the nation. George Bush _ a former ambassador to the United
Nations, envoy to China and director of Central Intelligence who
campaigned for the White House on his foreign policy expertise _
acknowledged that his son did not know as much as he did when he
did when he became president.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``He knows every bit as much about it as Bill
Clinton did.''
</P>
<P>
   Did his son know as much as Gore?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's had eight years of experience there,'' the former
president acknowledged. ``But the way I should be judged on whether
I knew foreign policy is by the kind of people I had around me.
Because I didn't know all this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get good people,'' he added, echoing his son's frequent
refrain that a president principally assembles a team, delegates
responsibilities and makes final decisions based upon good advice.
``George knows enough to do that and enough about the world to have
good judgment on his own at this point,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, unprompted, he returned to the question of his son's
preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going back in my mind,'' he said. ``You had Reagan,
Carter, Clinton. What was their foreign affairs experience? They
got elected president.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush then chimed in with a reference to Gore's awkward
toast, during a visit to China in 1997, with Li Peng, who had
ordered the violent crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we ought to think of Al Gore in China at the
time that he was caught with the champagne glasses,'' she said.
``I'm not going to think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing?'' Bush said, acting displeased with her
acidic interruptions but never really seeming so. ``You're not
going to be in this interview if you're going to start talking like
that. George will call and he'll be furious.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes have kept a fairly low public profile throughout
their son's presidential campaign, taking care not to overshadow
him, to invite criticism that he was simply riding on his family's
name, or to make accidental statements that could become
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Republican convention just a few weeks away, they
decided to grant a few interviews. They are clearly eager to make
the case for his candidacy. And they realize that the nostalgia
that many Americans now feel for them can work to their son's
advantage. (``Time heals a lot of wounds,'' the former president
said.)
</P>
<P>
   And they clearly have a hard time containing their pride in what
could be a historic circumstance. If George W. Bush is elected
president, it will be only the second time in U.S. history that the
son of a president ascended to the same post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling for me,'' the former president said during
the interview, which began in the living room of the main house,
continued over a lunch of lobster salad on a rear terrace
overlooking the Atlantic, and ended when he had to rush off with
his son Jeb, the governor of Florida, for a 12:30 p.m. tee time at
a nearby golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, who joined his parents for lunch, said that his
brother George was benefiting from a Republican yearning to take
back the White House _ a desire so strong that the party was
managing to paper over internal divisions that had fractured it in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years in the wilderness brings a higher tolerance for
diversity,'' Jeb Bush said, adding that 12 years in the wilderness
had made the Democratic party rally in a similar way around Clinton
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you looked at Bill Clinton's record as governor of
Arkansas, he was given a huge break by groups that were anxious to
have a Democrat in the White House,'' Jeb Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not make any sort of similar appraisal of his
brother's record, he later added, ``Well, I think the same thing
applies this year and benefits George, rather than Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President and Mrs. Bush acknowledged that in 1992 or 1993
or even the beginning of 1994, they never expected a day like this
to come. Bush left Washington as something of a pariah in the
Republican Party, a man who had acquiesced to a tax increase and
lost the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to have anything to do with me,'' he
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   And George W. Bush had never really demonstrated the sort of
political ambition that his brother Jeb had. When he told his
mother that he planned to run against the incumbent Texas governor,
Ann Richards, in 1994, she told him he would lose. His mother was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the difference between then and now, his father
said, ``I'm amazed _ still amazed _ at the way he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents said that they never doubted that he had the talent
and temperament for politics and governing, and they praised his
performance as governor, saying that he had set priorities, stuck
to them and delivered on his promises.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about the reason for his short trajectory from
new governor in January 1995 to presidential hopeful as early as
1998, his father again cited an external reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was that he was elected governor of the second
biggest state in the nation, and then he was re-elected with 70
percent of the vote, and anybody who's governor of a big state
probably thinks, `Hey, I could be president','' the former
president said. ``And somewhere in there, I don't know where it
was, George made up his mind. He didn't come ask us,
incidentally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If George weren't running for president,'' his father added,
``whoever was the nominee of the Republican Party would surely be
looking at him, among others, to be vice president. It's a six-inch
putt. Because of the importance of the electoral votes and the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was not getting involved in his son's search for
a vice president, and he unequivocally denied rumors that he might
act as an intermediary to convince Gen. Colin Powell, a close
friend, to reconsider his reluctance to take the job. He said that
Powell was unequivocally unwilling.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he said, he reserved the right simply to be an
extraordinarily proud father, generous with emotional support but
not with advice on strategies or issues. ``If you asked me, life or
death, You've got to tell me how big the tax cut is that George is
proposing, I couldn't tell you,'' he said. ``I don't give a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Both former President and Mrs. Bush had generally kind words for
the current vice president, Al Gore, saying that when they were in
the White House and he was a senator, they had met and liked him.
When asked whether Gore had gone overboard, during the impeachment
proceedings, by calling Clinton one of the greatest American
presidents, Bush expressed sympathy for the political bind in which
Gore found himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you accept the vice presidency, then you've got to be a
loyal vice president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the whole nation is embarrassed by something,'' he
added, ``that loyalty can hurt you in terms of your own
credibility. And if you waffle on it, that hurts you. It's a
Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Greatest president, though?'' Mrs. Bush asked, referring to
Gore's remark. ``In history?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're saying too much,'' Bush told her.

ROSE BOWL ADDS 2006 TITLE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ TheP'J{c3H &QR;  R-Z,Z %-MQ its first national
championship football game for the Bowl Championship Series in
2002, will again host the game in 2006 as part of a $122-million
television package, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally a game that pits the champions of the Pac-10 and
Big Ten conferences, the Rose Bowl is quickly becoming the
centerpiece of the BCS. To that end, Tournament of Roses and ABC
television officials have agreed to a $122-million package that
culminates in 2006 the same year the TofR will have its first woman
president, Libby Evans-Wright.
</P>
<P>
   The money, to be paid in installments beginning in 2002, will be
split between the Pac-10 and Big Ten conferences, said Harriman
Cronk, head of the TofR's football committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letters are in the process of being signed,'' Cronk said.
``They are in the form of a proposal to extend the Rose Bowl's
agreement with the BCS and ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   The current deal, which guaranteed about $19 million to the
conferences, would have expired in 2002. The TofR had an option to
extend through 2006 and its choice of years between 2003 and 2006
in which to host a second BCS championship.
</P>
<P>
   ABC officials in New York did not return phone calls Friday
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS promises to match the No. 1 and No. 2 college football
teams in the country in a national championship game. The game
rotates each year between the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz.; the
Sugar Bowl in New Orleans; the Orange Bowl in Miami and the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 game will be held in Miami. Pasadena gets its shot in
2002. It will be a first for the Rose Bowl game, which has pitted
the champions of the Pac-10 and Big Ten annually since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   For extending the BCS contract, the Pac-10 and Big Ten will get
$20.5 million from ABC for the 2002 game, $24 million in 2003, $25
million in 2004, $26 million in 2005 and $27 million in 2006, Cronk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extending the contract out through 2006 will give us another
national championship,'' Cronk said. ``I'm excited about that. The
BCS has been very successful and I'm very excited about bringing
teams here that have never played in Pasadena.''

(For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For shoe seismologists, the fourth-floor women's shoe department
at Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan is a prime place to detect early
tremors.
</P>
<P>
   To please its demanding, moneyed clientele, Saks specializes in
delivering the newest, comeliest creations from Spain and Italy
before other retailers do. But while the department is nearly
always chock-full of well-pedicured women, they are arguably not
its most ardent clientele.
</P>
<P>
   The capacious salon is an important hunting ground for
trend-spotters _ the stylists from mass-market shoe designers who
need to know what will soon be the retail rage from Denver to
Dubuque.
</P>
<P>
   And last February, Saks sent off powerful shock waves. The
store's shelves were stocked with purple paisley-print wooden
wedges, tiger-striped thongs in neon jungle greens and gold-mesh
pumps with laminated gold heels. Imagine the types of shoes that
Jerry Garcia might have designed in the throes of a Grateful Dead
concert and you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, shoes at other retailers and on feet everywhere
were equally dazzling. The chunky black pump that had been the
standby for everything from pants suits to summer minis was looking
a little too chunky. Instead, cool mavens were wearing gingham
print open-toed pumps in the office, multicolored embroidered and
beaded slides or suede moccasin-sneaker hybrids in the park and on
the street, and python-print sandals with dizzying come-hither
heels as soon as the sun went down.
</P>
<P>
   This sensory attack was not just the fashion indulgence of a few
wayward designers; it was a coordinated industry assault from
merchants like Bloomingdale's and design houses like Steve Madden
and Via Spiga. Despite the overall boom in consumer spending, shoe
sales have grown at a minuscule 1.8 percent a year for the last
decade, according to Footwear Market Insights, an industry research
organization based in Nashville. That is in keeping with historical
growth going back to the 1940s, but disappointing in comparison
with the 1980s, when, fueled by the athletic craze, shoe
consumption jumped about 6 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   So the footwear industry had to tackle a problem that now and
then plagues consumer industries from clothes to cars: When cash
registers stop ringing, how do you entice consumers to go out and
buy more?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, in a word, was revolution, not evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by current psychedelic clothing styles and able to
exploit new technologies that easily allow fancy embellishments
like beading, shoemakers are dreaming up fantasy styles that have
never been seen before. And they hope that their exotic new
confections will re-ignite consumer interest with a passion.
</P>
<P>
   The changes affect women's fashion shoes at all price levels.
Some children's shoes and even some men's footwear, usually very
conservative, are getting an infusion of shade and attitude, too.
(Even the staid Brooks Brothers is selling slide-on sneakers in
nubuck for men with style acumen.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has been in a rut,'' sighed Fawn Evenson,
president of the Footwear Industries of America, a trade group.
``All that you see out there is a desperate attempt to change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Going for a bit of brightness and whimsy sounds obvious enough _
even Apple Computer scored big when it thought to market its wares
in shades brighter than beige _ but it also carries risk. Business
history is replete with newfangled fashions and products that
consumers refused to buy (remember the maxi-skirt?), and retailers
and manufacturers alike must walk a fine line between attracting
and alienating customers.
</P>
<P>
   For the shoe industry, the move is a surprisingly bold
experiment. Over most of the last decade, women seemed to want to
buy only one thing: black. Or, more specifically, Evenson said,
``black-leather, square-toed, fat-heeled.''
</P>
<P>
   About 362 million pairs of women's dress and casual shoes were
sold at retail last year, according to Footwear Market Insights,
and roughly 85 percent of them were black or brown, according to
Mike Kormos, the organization's president.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Boettge, president of the National Shoe Retailers
Association, the trade group of the independent retailers, agreed.
``We got into a black key that was just incredible,'' Boettge said.
``The first five colors were black, black, black, black and
black.''
</P>
<P>
   That preference struck fear into the hearts of manufacturers and
retailers alike: The more that footwear became separated from the
rest of fashion, the less likely that women would feel compelled to
refill their shoe closets with any frequency. ``You can't keep
selling black dumb shoes, when women already have seven pairs in
their closet,'' Evenson said.
</P>
<P>
   So now the bet is whether season-shifting colors and the latest
decorations can bring out the average shopper's inner Imelda
Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   Changing fashions, of course, got shoe designers into the color
bind in the first place. For a long time, many American women
obeyed the fashion dictum to coordinate the color of their shoes
with that of their clothing. A turquoise sundress required
turquoise slingbacks, and a red suit called for power red pumps.
</P>
<P>
   But sometime in the 1990s, the New York-centric affinity for
black and neutral outfits became the uniform for women elsewhere.
Some trace the trend to the rise of the designer Kenneth Cole,
whose pared-back urbanite look has been a major influence for the
last five years. Whatever the reason, black, once strictly for
winter and evening wear, suddenly became ubiquitous. Even in the
South, the signature, post-Memorial day white pumps went the way of
hand-churned ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   But what sartorial caprice can take away, it can return as well.
And lately the neutral-shade monopoly has been overthrown. Janet
Moran, vice president and divisional merchandise manager for shoes
at Saks, thinks she can place her finger on the moment when things
went wild. ``It goes back to the Gucci runway collection for the
spring, 1999,'' she said. ``Tom Ford did the beaded jeans and
Hawaiian prints. He did it at his level and then everyone
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   By this year, ready-to-wear collections were ablaze in colors
(magenta, mandarin, lime), patterns, embellishments (beads,
feather, embroidery) and novelty materials (both real and faux
python and crocodile).
</P>
<P>
   With their pent-up creative juices suddenly freed, the most
influential shoe designers ferociously began offering their own
interpretations of the season's biggest trends. There was color _
as in suede moccasins by J.P. Todd in a power-pastel rainbow of
lilac, burnt orange and lemon frappe. There was decoration, as in
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana's romantic-as-a-spring-picnic-in-the-Tuscan-hills
slides, in white satin, embroidered with strawberries on the vine.
(The seeds and leaves on the strawberries are actually tiny black
and green beads.) And there was novelty, most influentially
represented by the understated round-toe 1940s-style dance pumps in
ostrich by Prada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designers wanted to do something pretty and this year it was
quite fun,'' said Stuart Weitzman, whose privately owned label is a
department store mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Department stores, which increasingly rely on shoes and
accessories as a profit center, have followed the designers' leads
and bet big on out-there offerings. Nordstrom, which specializes in
carrying a particularly large shoe selection, estimates that it had
three times more color on its sales floor this spring than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion is not the only influence on shoe offerings. Some of
this year's most whimsical creations would not have been available
in the mass market if not for new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   New techniques let shoemakers enamel heels in the same durable
paints that carmakers like Mercedes-Benz use to coat their
vehicles. Titanium fillers allow heels to be sculpted into the most
improbable shapes and heights, while sustaining strength. One of
Weitzman's popular evening designs has the foot-coddling portion of
the shoe perched on a rhinestone-studded, pyramid heel that narrows
to a tiny pinpoint beneath the foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like an optical illusion,'' he said. ``We definitely
could not have made that five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, decorations like multithread embroidery had to
be done mostly by skilled artisans, meaning that the process was
impractical for shoes priced below $100.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are all sorts of automated machines that make these
embellishments doable at $70 retail, not $250. And because the new
machines, unlike artisans, will work in any country, they let
manufacturers shift even more production to places like China,
where the remainder of the labor can be done at much lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   Because the savings in labor costs are mostly passed on to the
consumer, profit margins are no greater on these shoes than on
unadorned Mary Janes. Companies stand to make big money only on big
volume.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the advantage of the machines is not only that they can
spangle and bead clothing and footwear, but that they are also
doing a really good job of it. The factories, for example, work
with the same nylon cord used by commercial fisherman to catch
60-pound tuna. That solves one age-old footwear problem:
decorations can now be fastened to stay on past the first week of
wear.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is improved leather imprinting that makes
crocodile and python skins real enough to fool a taxidermist.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has also aided in making the mass market as swiftly
fashion-responsive as the upper echelons of the shoe business have
long been, but in a way that dismays high-end shoemakers: it also
greatly speeds the copying of their designs.
</P>
<P>
   Trend-spotters for an American design house shopping in Paris
``can take a digitized picture of a shoe they like, and it can be
beamed to a factory in China within an hour,'' said Boettge, of the
shoe retailer association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The factory can then make a sample, send it by FedEx back to
the company's office in Boston within 36 to 48 hours,'' he added.
``They can then decide to put it into production for the U.S.
market, with a total turnaround of less than two months.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, there are plenty of examples that prove his point.
``We've had two shoes from Prada, one in silk linen, the other
denim-colored, that we copied for the U.S. market,'' said Alan
Abbott, director of sales and marketing at Majilite, a leading
fabric provider for shoes and handbags, based in Lowell, Mass. ``It
takes no longer than two months. Leathers can be done in two weeks.
We are extremely proficient.''
</P>
<P>
   So with the shoe industry casting out new lines, the question
is: Are women responding to the bait? Retailers say their gamble
has been rewarded. ``Our customers have strongly embraced'' the new
patterns, said Jack Minuk, Nordstrom's vice president for shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Moran at Saks agreed, adding that sales in her shoe departments
were ``outpacing sales in the rest of the store.''
</P>
<P>
   NPD, a market research firm based in Port Washington, N.Y., that
tracks shoe sales in department stores only, says that in the first
quarter of this year, women's shoe sales rose 10 percent, even as
the sales percentage of black shoes declined by a little under a
point. Meanwhile, the number of pairs sold with animal print
patterns increased sixfold and the number with platform heels rose
70 percent, NPD said.
</P>
<P>
   But Boettge, who represents the independent shoe sellers, says
he is disappointed. ``It has helped, but it hasn't ignited the
market,'' he said. ``People are buying, but they are not throwing
out their old wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why merchants expect that next season will be even
wilder: thigh-high red python boots, open-backed slides for winter
and platform heels towering above 6 inches. Dream on, shoe
designers, dream on.

NOT ALL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE NAMED GORE OR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ind., Md., Hawaii, Neb., Mass., Calif., Ala., Fla., N.M.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If only she had more money, Paula Bennett said, she could get
her message out. For now, she talks to relatives, civic groups and
social service workers. ``I've only raised a few hundred dollars,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, a political independent from Lincoln, Neb., is running
for president this year in a field that is far more crowded than
you may think. As of last month, 226 people had filed papers with
the Federal Election Commission indicating their intention of
seeking the White House. The list includes major party candidates
like Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas but
also candidates so far on the political fringe _ in some cases,
even beyond _ that they make people like Pat Buchanan of the Reform
Party, John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party and Ralph Nader of the
Green Party seem like mainstream contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Take Martin J. McNally, for example. His filing says he
represents the National Christian Party, but it is unlikely anyone
might find him on the campaign trail. He is serving a life sentence
for aircraft piracy at a federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Julian Starr of Huntington, N.Y., likely to upset any
favorites. He is only 18 years old, a high school graduate headed
for the State University of New York at Stony Brook this fall. He
said he filed this year in anticipation of running for president in
2016, when he will turn 35, the youngest age a president can be.
``This should be a very good learning experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential elections historically attract a wide range of
contenders. Over the years, voters have cast ballots for Free
Soilers, Know Nothings, Prohibitionists, Greenbacks, Bull Moose
Progressives and States Righters as well as for members of
mainstream parties, like Republicans, Democrats, Federalists and
Whigs. In 1996, besides casting ballots for the Republican,
Democratic and Reform tickets, voters also supported at least eight
other parties. This year, the party choices include Socialist,
Corrective Action, Progressive, Common Sense, Fly Birds, Veterans
Industrial, Populist-Democratic Viking, Priorities, Light,
Anti-Hypocrisy, Freedom, Church and Family Values.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been a slow year, perhaps reflecting a nation
enjoying peace and economic stability. The number who have filed
the single form required by the election commission is the fewest
since the commission was formed in 1974, and a sizable drop from
the record year of 1988, when 330 people filed.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who expect to raise at least $5,000 must file; all
others file voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, most of those running this year will slip
through the campaign without so much as a nod of acknowledgment.
Not only do they lack the money and staff to compete, but they take
no steps to comply with state regulations to get onto the ballot,
leaving them to gain votes only as a write-in. It is the rare
member of the fringe who has the resources to finance a campaign,
although it happens. Heather Harder, a Democrat from Crown Point,
Ind., said she has addressed groups in 42 states, talking about her
pet issue, structural change in government to bring it closer to
average citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Harder is typical of the outsiders who filed
papers. At best, many say, they hope to influence Gore or Bush on
an issue or two. But even better-known alternative candidates, like
Nader, Harry Browne of the Libertarians or Ross Perot, who
represented the Reform Party in 1992 and 1996, do little more than
draw new focus to old issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the fringe parties take up a cause they feel is
important and not being addressed,'' said Ross K. Baker, a
professor of political science at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   But as Alan Brinkley, a history professor at Columbia
University, noted: ``It's very hard for a third party candidate to
do more than influence the behavior of the Republicans or
Democrats. It's slightly unusual to have two, perhaps three
alternatives who could claim to be taken seriously, but I don't see
any major new party emerging.''
</P>
<P>
   For many candidates, running for president is a quadrennial
affair. Harder, an author and bookstore owner, engaged in a
``practice'' campaign four years ago and is running what she called
``a symbolic campaign'' to draw attention to government reform.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago she probably did not notice her competitor from
Newburyport, Mass. _ Michael T. Strauss, the standard bearer for
Mike's Party, of which he is the only member. In 1996, Strauss
said, his campaign slogan was ``Vote for Mike or don't vote at
all.'' How successful was he? ``More than half the people
registered didn't vote that year,'' he said, referring to the 49
percent turnout in 1996. ``So I did quite well, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   For this year's campaign he bought 1,000 wooden nickels to pass
out. They say, ``Re-elect Mike Strauss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me sound more experienced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates seem more serious. Bernard Palicki of
Huntsville, Ala., who ran for Congress six years ago as a
Republican and now heads the Corrective Action Party, has an
Internet site to rail against global trade and federal banking
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm using my candidacy as a vehicle to get ideas across,''
Palicki said. ``But I'm not accepting any money and I'm not making
speeches. I'm strictly on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Temperance Lance-Council, a local activist in Los Angeles,
formed the Anti-Hypocrisy Party last year as a protest against the
arrogance of public officials. A candidate from Mill Valley,
Calif., named Da Vid (who was born 56 years ago in New York as
Dolph Ornstein), founded the Light Party to highlight the
relationship between environment and health. Ernest Lee Easton of
South Bend, Ind., head of the Veterans Industrial Party, is a
Vietnam veteran who is concerned about veteran rights, campaign
finance reform and issues related to job security.
</P>
<P>
   But others leave the clear impression that they do not really
expect to dwell in the White House anytime soon. Daniel Pearlman,
an independent candidate from Taos, N.M., believes presidential
ballots should contain no names so voters can select anyone they
choose. To enhance his political stature, Pearlman has already
declared himself ``President of New Mexico.'' Freddy Sitnick of
Owings Mills, Md., an independent, said he had written to all 50
states asking to be placed on the ballot. So far, none have
responded. Maybe that is because Sitnick tells people he is the
Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   And Clay Oliver Hill of Kissimmee, Fla., another independent,
said he is worried about the international terrorist rings that he
believed had headquarters near his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt I'll be invited to the debates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But among those who have filed with the election commission,
Raymond Kenneth Petry, an independent from Honolulu, chose a
different path to power.
</P>
<P>
   He declared himself a candidate for vice president.

NO EVIDENCE WORLD BANK EXECUTIVE PASSED SECRETS TO RUSSIAN BANK,
OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The World Bank said this week that an eight-month
investigation found no evidence to support allegations that a
former Russian representative at the World Bank passed confidential
information to a Russian commercial bank in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The bank did conclude that the representative, Leonid Grigoriev,
had established a business relationship with Inkombank, which is
now defunct, and that he received $13,000 for out-of-pocket
expenses from the bank in 1993. A bank official said that while
that relationship did not specifically violate World Bank rules, it
was not conduct the bank considers acceptable activity for one of
its executive directors.
</P>
<P>
   Grigoriev's actions were the subject of articles in The Wall
Street Journal, The New York Times, and other publications in the
fall of 1999. Some of the articles, which explored issues related
to an investigation into how billions of dollars in suspect Russian
money flowed through the Bank of New York, raised questions about
Inkombank's operations.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 22, 1999, The Wall Street Journal reported that the
World Bank was investigating Grigoriev's ties to Inkombank. The
newspaper cited a memo purportedly written by Grigoriev to
Inkombank officials that discussed ways for the bank to profit from
the Russian bond market. It reported that the memo was labeled
``strictly confidential'' and that it contained sensitive
debt-market investment advice.
</P>
<P>
   Lending to Russia by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, its sister agency, was considered crucial to the
health of the country's bond market at the time.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank officials said that they began investigating
Grigoriev only after The Journal provided them with a copy of the
memo.
</P>
<P>
   The Times reported last January that the memo might have been a
fake provided to The Journal by Emanuel Zeltser, an emigre Russian
lawyer who became a source of information about Russian money
laundering. The Times report examined Zeltser's role in spreading
allegations about matters that were tangential to the money
laundering investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Merrell Tuck, a World Bank spokeswoman, said Friday that bank
officials and an outside law firm hired to lead the bank's
investigation were ``unable to authenticate'' the memo. Because the
bank could not determine if the memo was genuine, it found no
evidence that Grigoriev passed sensitive information to Inkombank
while working at the World Bank, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Grigoriev left the World Bank in 1997. When the World Bank began
an investigation into his conduct last fall, he was put on leave
from his job as director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a
Moscow-based think tank that receives World Bank funding.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said in a statement this week that the payments
Grigoriev received from Inkombank would ``prejudice against'' any
employment he might seek at the bank itself for the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   But it said it now has no objections to Grigoriev resuming his
post at the think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Bank has informed Russian officials that the bank
has no objection to the lifting of Grigoriev's administrative
leave,'' the bank statement said.

DRIVING GOES ON, DESPITE GLOOM OVER TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SMITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ For Team SABCO, its priorities forever shifted at
11:23 a.m. when Kenny Irwin was killed in a crash on Turn 3.
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of the field, practice and qualifying runs
continued for Sunday's New England 300. For the rest of the day at
New Hampshire International Speedway, it was, for the most part,
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The show went on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if it were up to Bobby Labonte, the doors to his and every
other NASCAR trailer would have closed as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have bothered me to close the garage and go
home,'' said Labonte, a nine-year veteran of the Winston Cup
Series, who stayed and finished 20th in Friday's qualifying. ``I
think that would have been more respectful to Kenny than practicing
30 minutes after that happened. We probably should have just gone
home and started over tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd just rather not even be here. Some people are different.
That's just my thought. Everybody can always say, `He was doing
what he loved' and `He'd want everybody to keep going.' Well, he
ain't here to say that for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Spencer had similar feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, I know there's nothing we can do about it, it's in
God's hands, but everything just went on,'' said Spencer, who
finished 18th. ``Everything just went on and that really bothers me
a lot. That bothers me more than anything. We all feel it, you
know, and you think that we don't feel that. But every competitor
in here and every person in this garage area feels like the best
thing we can do is load up and go home, but we know we can't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Crashes may be common in the sport, but that doesn't take any
sting out of what happened here Friday or what happened here May
12. Irwin's death came eight weeks after an accident took the life
of 19-year-old Adam Petty, son of NASCAR driver Kyle Petty and
grandson of the legendary Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, like Irwin, also crashed on Turn 3. The sharp corners on
the 1.058-mile track leave little room for error or mechanical
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real long straightaway and you got no banking in the
corners,'' Labonte said. ``When something like that happens, it's a
critical area to be in trouble because you are going so fast with a
sharp corner like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident stunned Irwin's fellow drivers, for whom the race
is now secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes everything else not really seem to matter,'' said
Dale Jarrett, who in 1998 and '99 was a teammate of Irwin's on the
Robert Yates Racing Team. ``It's just very unfortunate. I'm just
glad to be able to say I knew him as a teammate, but more than
anything else, he was a friend and we've all lost a good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton finished fourth in the qualifying race, something
that now means very little to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be a good starting spot for us, but that's all
minuscule compared to what's gone on here today,'' Burton said.
``It's a real sad day here. Qualifying and racing and everything
else is way less important than what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows you how fragile life is. It's bad to even be here
today, but we have to do our business.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll have to do the same through the weekend. The tragic loss
of Irwin will make their jobs much tougher to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say that you won't be yourself for the weekend,''
Labonte said. ``The whole weekend here won't be the same as it
would have if that hadn't happened.''

SAFETY INNOVATIONS MAKE NASCAR FATALITIES A RARITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Reslugging; includes driver death text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another driver has been killed at New Hampshire International
Speedway, the second in less than two months to die in a wreck
during practice.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitable questions follow: Is it the track? Is it a safety
problem with the cars? Is it the speed?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: none of those. It is the sudden stops.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to a spectacular, but nonfatal, wreck last spring at
Daytona International Speedway in Florida. Ricky Rudd, in the Bud
Shootout, bounced off a couple of cars (a good thing), flipped his
Winston Cup car onto its roof (a good thing), and slid the length
of the straightaway (another good thing).
</P>
<P>
   Rudd walked away.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of wreck that gets the adrenaline pumping in the
grandstands. A wreck, in itself, is not a good thing, but Rudd was
relatively uninjured because his car was built to take all the
things Rudd's car did. Bouncing off other cars, flipping onto the
roof, and sliding on that roof dissipate the energy of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   As fans gather at NHIS in Loudon, N.H., Kenny Irwin and Adam
Petty are on the minds of all. Irwin died Friday when his car
slammed viciously into the wall at Turn 3 just yards from where
Petty was killed May 12.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to hold this thought, but fatalities are now rare
in NASCAR racing because of how the cars are built. Petty ran
straight into the wall at about 135 miles per hour. Accounts say
Irwin hit the wall hard and then flipped. He likely would have been
better off had he flipped and then slid into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in this type of crash, drivers and designers say, is
that although you can ``cage'' the driver's body _ strapping him
securely into a seat, surrounded by crumple zones _ you cannot
protect the neck and the brain in a sudden stop from high speed.
All else stops securely, but the head, heavy with helmet, keeps
moving, possibly resulting in a snapped neck or the brain smashing
against the skull.
</P>
<P>
   The car you drive on the highway is basically a stamped piece of
steel with soft crumple zones meant to withstand crashes that, by
NASCAR standards, are relatively slow-speed events. Winston Cup
cars crash at speeds of 130 miles per hour and far higher. The
challenge, then, in building a Winston Cup car is to balance
stiffness that will protect the driver with enough softness front
and rear to absorb the kinetic energy of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup cars are, in basic form, a body made of welded
pieces slipped onto a complex, tubular frame. The frame is made up
of four sections: front and rear clips (ends), center section, and
roll cage.
</P>
<P>
   John Valentine, chief engineer/racing, research and vehicle
technology for Ford Motor Co., described these sections. The most
important, he said, is the center section where the driver sits. It
combines the center section with the roll cage. The whole package,
Valentine said, ``is literally a cage.'' Steel tubing with wall
thickness of one-eighth of an inch protects the driver on the
sides, rear, front, and roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to maintain the structural integrity and keep the
occupant encased,'' Valentine said. In addition, he said, ``it
forms the backbone of the car. You don't want a racecar flexing in
the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinner, collapsible tubing .083-of-an-inch wall thickness is
used in the front and rear clips. Up front, the tubing crumples in
a crash, absorbing energy. In addition, the motor and transmission
are positioned so they will slide beneath the car, after the motor
mounts shear, rather than projecting into the driver's compartment.
In addition to the engine, the front clip also holds the
suspension. The suspension system is attached with restraining
straps so wheels and suspension parts don't go flying into the
stands, along the track, or back into the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Tubing of the same thickness is used in the rear clip as are
suspension straps. It, too, is designed to crumple in a crash, but
also holds the fuel cell, a fire-retardant fuel source far safer
than the gas tanks of old. There are check valves in the fuel lines
to shut off fuel if the engine is separated from the chassis.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR design, Valentine said, ``is all about energy
management.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the crashes that crowds like to see are often the
safest, he said. ``One where the car is sliding a great deal, the
tires are smoking, it's scraping off other cars, off the wall,
skidding into the grass. You're scraping off the energy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who spoke before Irwin's crash, said the worst
crashes ``are the ones where there's not a lot of energy
absorption.''
</P>
<P>
   Crashes like Petty's and Irwin's.
</P>
<P>
   But these types of crashes _ direct hits to an immovable surface
_ are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Safety evolves race by race, accident by accident. The airborne
crashes of the late 1980s have been mostly halted because of flaps
now installed at the rear of the roofline. They pop up when cars
get sideways or backward (and lose their aerodynamics) and keep
them from flying.
</P>
<P>
   Driver's seats have evolved, too, and today hug the driver tight
in an aluminum frame that is meant to hold up under huge crash
pressures while bending just enough to absorb energy.
</P>
<P>
   Nets on the window and behind the driver are ``basically to
contain the driver in the vehicle,'' said Valentine. They keep head
and arms inside and help prevent whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty, who lost his grandson, Adam, in May, said Friday,
``There ain't nothing the matter with the racetrack. These guys run
those things 200 miles per hour. It's circumstance with the way you
stop them so quick. The body just can't take it.''

BAHRES STUNNED BY SECOND FATALITY IN EIGHT WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Two months. Two crashes. Two deaths.
</P>
<P>
   A day that could have provided a little bit of closure for Bob
and Gary Bahre and the racing fraternity at New Hampshire
International Speedway instead became another black and fatal
Friday at the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Eight weeks to the day that his grandson, Adam, crashed and was
killed in Turn 3 during a NASCAR Busch Series practice session at
the track, Richard Petty was in the infield media center late in
the morning and talked about his family and its loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahres were in the audience and afterward met with Petty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard came up today and gave me a big hug,'' Bob Bahre said
later Friday. ``That meant the world to me, you know what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Wounds might have been closing just some.
</P>
<P>
   They were about to be ripped wide open again. Just about the
time Bob Bahre and Richard Petty got together, Kenny Irwin, 30, hit
the concrete wall. Also in practice. Also in turn Turn 3.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the afternoon, NASCAR announced that Irwin, too,
had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a few knots in your gut, I'll tell you that,'' Bahre
said. ``It's one of those bad things. This time, I was up in the
office. It's just, you ask, Why? You know?''
</P>
<P>
   Why.
</P>
<P>
   It was the operative word Friday and likely will be around the
track and around the racing world in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Why New Hampshire International Speedway? Why Turn 3? Why two
fatalities in back-to-back events? Why now?
</P>
<P>
   ``By the same token, the 10 years we've gone with no incidents
should provide some evidence,'' said Gary Bahre, Bob's son and the
track president. ``That's got to be taken into consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation started with stuck throttles and drivers talked
about the track and how NASCAR should look into barriers to protect
them from solid walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, there's no question it's mechanical,'' Bob
Bahre said of both crashes. ``Both cars went straight in. You're
just going down the backstretch and going straight in. If the guy
lost it turning or something it would be one thing. I mean, this is
like a dragstrip.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bahres somberly watched the Modified race that followed the
practice session and qualifying and kicked off their first Winston
Cup weekend of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not criticizing anybody or anything, but in the 10 years
we were without anything like that, count how many guys were killed
skiing,'' Bob Bahre said. ``That doesn't make this any better, I'm
not saying that at all. It's one of those unfortunate things.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the Bahres had problems with the surface of
their track tearing up and they fixed the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, drivers mentioned those barriers that are becoming
popular at some tracks and are more forgiving than concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace talked of a bump going into Turn 3 that racers
must handle.
</P>
<P>
   The track, the Bahres said, is as smooth as racing surfaces
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This racetrack is as safe as any other racetrack I've raced
on,'' said Ricky Craven, who starred here and throughout the North
before moving South and qualified fifth Friday. ``I don't know if
you call it an oxymoron, or what, to say that a racetrack is safe.
But this track is not unsafe, absolutely not. When a driver loses
control of his race car for whatever reason, mechanical, a cut
tire, whatever the case may be, then he's not in control and then
it becomes dangerous. But other than that this is a safe sport.''
</P>
<P>
   But it has been anything but safe the last two events here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel awful about it, my father feels awful about it,'' Gary
Bahre said. ``We feel awful for Kenny Irwin and awful for Kenny
Irwin's mom and dad. It's just really tough for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Two events, two deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The racetrack owners take the same approach as the racecar
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like anything, you could be working on a construction
site and a guy gets killed,'' Bob Bahre said. ``It bothers you, but
you just have to go back to work. It bothers you, but at the same
time, God forbid, you just don't want it to happen again. But it
did.''

AUTOPSY RULES OUT SUICIDE IN DEATH OF BASKETBALL GREAT'S SON 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANFORD, Fla. _ Sheriff Don Eslinger of Seminole County said
Friday that the 19-year-old son of basketball legend Julius Erving,
Cory Erving, whose body was found in a pond on Thursday by
searchers, did not commit suicide. Eslinger said there were no
obvious signs of trauma, but he declined to dismiss the possibility
of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause and manner of death have not been determined,
pending further tests,'' the sheriff told reporters here. He said
an autopsy had ruled out suicide, but a toxicology report was not
ready. Cory Erving had a history of drug problems and had completed
five rehab programs.
</P>
<P>
   Seminole investigators found his body on Thursday afternoon in a
pond about a half-mile from his family's residence in the affluent
Alaqua Lakes neighborhood. They had dragged 36 bodies of water in
three counties before finding him about 20 yards from shore,
submerged in his 1999 Volkswagen Passat.
</P>
<P>
   The windows were up and Erving was not wearing a seat belt. The
airbags had not been deployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an obligation to provide information to the family and
find some resolution,'' Eslinger said. ``We don't want to speculate
or draw false conclusions. We want to maintain our objectivity in
this case. We want to look at all possible scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff's Department plans to enlist help from the Florida
Highway Patrol in reconstructing the scene and to make a mechanical
inspection of the vehicle, a department spokesman, Steve Olson,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eslinger said it had been determined that Erving was in the same
clothing that he wore on May 28, when he went to a nearby bakery to
pick up some bread for a family party. He called his father to say
he would be home in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last communication his family had with him.
</P>
<P>
   Eslinger described the Ervings as ``grief-stricken.'' Pat
Williams, the president of the Orlando Magic, who was instrumental
in hiring Erving to work for the team three years ago, talked to
Erving Friday, and said he was coping with the reality of losing a
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has some closure,'' Williams said. ``He used that word to
me several times. I think the unknown was what was so hard for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Erving, who achieved his basketball fame with the Philadelphia
76ers, issued a statement. It said in part, ``We have learned a lot
from this tragedy and we will be a stronger family as a result. The
Erving family will go forward from here. We have no other choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was a 76ers executive when Erving played there,
said he envisioned Erving becoming a spokesman for the campaign
against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Julius for a long time,'' Williams said. ``He
didn't tell me this, but I just believe he will not want his son's
life to have ended in vain. I see him using what happened in a
positive way. I see him speaking out against drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Cory Erving had been missing for 16 days that
his family made his disappearance public. His father at first
offered a $25,000 reward for information about his whereabouts.
Three days later he increased that to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   That produced hundreds of phone calls to a special number, but
no significant leads.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Erving began using drugs at age 14, his father said, after
bad grades eliminated his chance of being a schoolboy athlete. He
operated between two distinct worlds, immersing himself in metro
Orlando's drug culture, while usually returning to a million-dollar
home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Erving said that in recent years his son seemed to become
more determined to straighten out his life. Embarrassed early in
his school years about having a learning disability, he eventually
received his high school equivalency diploma at Seminole Community
College.

 &HT;    ``Visionary'' alleged to be prominent figure in government
corruption cases
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Commerce Club in downtown Atlanta was filled with
the usual crowd: elected officials, county employees and, most
important, political contributors. But in this familiar setting for
a fundraising reception in the fall of 1998, Juanita Hicks recalls,
one newcomer stood out.
</P>
<P>
   George H. Greene moved through the crowd, shaking hands,
introducing himself, introducing other people to one another. He
was, Hicks remembers, working the room with an intensity unmatched
by any candidate at the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he would strike you is that he knew everybody,'' said
Hicks, the clerk of the Fulton County Superior Court. ``That he
knew people.''
</P>
<P>
   Who Greene knew and how he knew them have now become key
elements of a federal investigation into corruption in local
government.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the fundraiser and through 1999, authorities say,
Greene was paying bribes to Fulton County Commissioner Michael
Hightower. Greene's intent, they say, was to help his firm, Sable
Communications Co. of Georgia Inc., win county technology contracts
worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Greene has pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court, as have
Hightower and Josh Kenyon, the former chief of staff to two county
commission chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   And this may be only the start. Greene, 55, whose company also
had contracts with the city of Atlanta and other public agencies,
has agreed to assist the ongoing federal investigation. In
exchange, he may receive less than the maximum sentence of 10 years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty pleas and the pledge to help federal authorities
appear to cast Greene as a central figure in what could be one of
the farthest-reaching public corruption cases ever in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Greene declined requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But his lawyers and friends depict Greene as a victim. They say
he was drawn into a bribery scheme by a system that forces honest
business people to pay off government officials to win government
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that this fellow never did a thing wrong,
as far as I know, until he got caught up in this situation in the
county and the city,'' said Jeff Bogart, one of Greene's lawyers.
``He ran a pretty clean ship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been a one-man crime wave all his life,'' said
another of Greene's attorneys, Wilmer Parker III. ``He's not a
mobster.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth about George Greene, though, is more complicated than
the tale spun by his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his own description of who he is turns out to be at
least exaggerated, if not fabricated, according to interviews,
court records and government files.
</P>
<P>
   He said he graduated from the University of Miami. He did not.
</P>
<P>
   He said he founded a chamber of commerce for black-owned
businesses in Miami. He did not.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had never been in trouble before the federal
corruption case. But he had been. In 1982, an insurance company
accused Greene of stealing premiums, and a judge ordered him to pay
the insurer more than $300,000. Greene was not charged with a
crime, however.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 12 years, Fulton County, the city of Atlanta,
and Grady Health System, among others, have paid his company
millions of taxpayers' dollars. It wasn't until he pleaded guilty
that government officials publicly questioned the deals. ``It's
amazing that they wouldn't do a background check,'' said Lee Parks,
an Atlanta lawyer who sued Greene in the insurance case. ``Or, if
they did, that they found it and didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   A `VISIONARY' FALTERS
</P>
<P>
   Greene grew up in West Palm Beach, Fla., the son of a podiatrist
and a high school teacher. By the early 1970s, he was living in
Miami and something of an anomaly of the times: a successful black
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   He opened a string of insurance agencies, often in poor
neighborhoods that other insurers avoided. He never obtained an
insurance license, but hired agents to write policies _ mostly a
new kind of automobile coverage called ``no-fault.''
</P>
<P>
   As he expanded to other Florida cities, the namesake of the
George H. Greene Insurance Agency became something of a celebrity.
He taped his own radio ads, which ended with a catchy signature
phrase: ``Don't get caught without no fault.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was a visionary for African-American economic
development and business development here in the South Florida
area,'' said Wilbert Holloway, an executive with BellSouth in Miami
who has known Greene since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's vision extended well beyond South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   By 1980, he owned 22 insurance agencies in four states, at least
a half dozen in Georgia. The first Georgia office opened in 1976
with a ceremony that attracted local news coverage. Greene split
his time between Miami and Atlanta, where he kept a condominium.
</P>
<P>
   His agencies' main business was selling policies and collecting
premiums for American Interstate Insurance Co. of Georgia. Greene's
employees were supposed to deduct a commission _ 12 to 15 percent _
before forwarding the premiums to American Interstate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the employees sent the premiums _ which had totaled
about $291,000 by 1980 _ to a holding company Greene had set up in
Miami, according to court records. When American Interstate tried
to collect, the insurer alleged, Greene refused to pay.
</P>
<P>
   So American Interstate filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``George H. Greene has absconded with . . . funds owed to
American,'' the lawsuit charged. ``He has employed an elaborate
corporate shell game in an attempt to circumvent individual
liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene denied all the accusations _ that he had kept the
insurance company's money, even that he had done business with
American Interstate in Georgia. Bogart, one of his lawyers in the
current federal corruption case, characterizes the insurer's
lawsuit as ``a business dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Greene settled the lawsuit before it went to trial.
Superior Court Judge William W. Daniel of Fulton County ordered him
to repay the full amount that American Interstate had sought, plus
interest. The settlement totaled $335,812.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no defense to it,'' said Parks, American
Interstate's lawyer. The company never sought criminal charges, he
said, because ``the quicker way of getting the money back was the
civil suit. He had assets and was solvent.''
</P>
<P>
   After the case concluded, Parks said, Greene ``certainly
couldn't have done any more insurance work in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   A PROMOTIONAL BENT
</P>
<P>
   Greene's wife, Elaine, offered another reason for the demise of
their insurance agencies. The business, she told a city official in
Atlanta in 1994, had become ``too competitive,'' so they shifted
their efforts to another industry: cable television.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, the Greenes formed a company they called Sable Cable,
which sold commercial time on such networks as BET, the black
entertainment channel. Three years later, they opened a second
office in Atlanta and moved here.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenes took advantage of programs that required contractors
with local government agencies to hire minority-owned
subcontractors. Beginning in 1987, Sable Communications Co. of
Georgia was certified as a minority-owned business enterprise with
the city of Atlanta. Initially, the firm was registered to get
government work only in marketing and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, according to documents the company filed with the
city of Atlanta, Elaine Greene owned 75 percent of Sable's stock.
The head of its Miami office, David Levin, held the remaining
shares. George Greene was listed as the firm's manager, responsible
for ``all marketing and operations.'' But Elaine Greene had the
sole authority to write checks on the company's bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   George Greene became Sable's president in 1994, corporate
records indicate. By that year, Sable Communications had qualified
as a minority-owned subcontractor not just in marketing and
advertising, but also in cable television and telecommunications,
including pay telephones and long-distance service. It later added
installing fiber-optic cable to its repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Fulton County and Atlanta, Sable was hired _ usually as
a subcontractor to a much larger firm _ by MARTA (Atlanta's public
transportation system) Grady Memorial Hospital, the city of New
Orleans, the Louisiana prison system, Georgia Power Co. and others,
according to the company's promotional material.
</P>
<P>
   Sable's work got good reviews. IBM said Sable had ``performed
well'' on a government project, ``bringing it in on time and on
budget.'' TRW told Greene he was ``a man of (his) word'' who hired
``top drawer'' employees.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, Sable played up minor roles on major
projects.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a 1995 document the company gave Grady said that
Sable ``teamed'' with AT&AMP;T, BellSouth and two other firms to ``win
a 5-year contract'' to operate 1,400 pay phones at Atlanta's
Hartsfield International Airport. In fact, according to city
records, Sable, as a subcontractor, was a relatively minor party to
the deal. It borrowed $150,000 from AT&AMP;T and bought 74 telephones _
less than 6 percent of the total _ from the city for $13,500.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's depictions of himself also took on a promotional tone.
On a resume that he submitted to the city of Atlanta in 1996, he
said he was ``a successful entrepreneur'' with ``a passionate drive
and a constant quest for excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   That resume also contains assertions that can't be backed up.
</P>
<P>
   Greene claimed to have earned an ``A.S. degree'' from the
University of Miami in 1965. But Sandra Perryman, a spokeswoman for
the school's registrar, said records show Greene attended classes
only from September 1961 to January 1962. He received no degree,
Perryman said.
</P>
<P>
   Greene also said on the resume that he ``founded'' the
26-year-old Miami-Dade Chamber of Commerce, which promotes
black-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But when Dorothy Baker, the chamber's president and chief
executive, checked her founders' list, none of them were
``Greene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see his name,'' Baker said. ``These are our articles
of incorporation, and I don't see his name.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbert Holloway, a friend from Greene's Miami days, recalled
that Greene once served as the chamber's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a leader of our chamber,'' Holloway said. ``He was not
one of the founding members of the chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   SUCCESS AND SCRUTINY

   In Atlanta, Greene and his wife seem to have prospered. Elaine
Greene bought a Jaguar convertible, according to public records.
The couple built a cedar- and stone-sided house with its own tennis
court in an upper-middle class subdivision across the highway from
boxer Evander Holyfield's gigantic estate. They recently sold the
house for $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   The trappings of the Greenes' success have also included an
$800,000 Florida beach house that they bought in 1996 and sold for
$900,000 two years later.
</P>
<P>
   In both Florida and Georgia, George Greene formed an array of
companies, from a marketing firm to a steel-products distributor to
a formalwear store. Some prospered, others didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is an entrepreneur,'' said Cornell McBride Sr., a
prominent black businessman from Atlanta who described Greene as a
good friend. ``He truly understands a business. He's not really
restricted to any one area. . . . He has been able to shift his
interest and be successful in different things, learning those
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene also seems to have learned politics.
</P>
<P>
   From 1997 to 1999, Greene, his companies and members of his
immediate family donated more than $29,000 to 11 candidates for
city, county and state offices, according to campaign financial
disclosure reports. At the same time, several political officials
say, Greene became a prominent figure at fundraisers and other
political events.
</P>
<P>
   But with his visibility and success came scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have said little about how their
investigation of local political corruption developed. But they
have acknowledged that when investigators confronted County
Commissioner Hightower with allegations of corruption, he turned in
Greene. Subsequently, authorities said, Greene turned
investigators' attention to Kenyon.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, Greene stood before U.S. District Judge Richard W.
Story and admitted that ``on several occasions'' in 1998 and 1999
he had given cash to Hightower, hoping to ``influence and reward''
the commissioner's role in awarding county contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is free on bond awaiting sentencing. His lawyer, Bogart,
would not say whether Greene is using this time to implicate
officials beyond those who have already been charged.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't clear how credible a witness Greene might make for the
government. His personal history and his recent guilty plea would
give a defense attorney ammunition to try to impeach his testimony,
said Jack Martin, an Atlanta lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any prior instances of wrongdoing _ especially dishonesty _ by
a government witness can be used by the defendant,'' Martin said.
But, he added, ``Cooperating witnesses are always someone who has a
checkered past.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride said he was shocked to see his friend on television,
entering the federal courthouse to face corruption charges. But the
blame, he contends, lies less with Greene than with forces beyond
his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say that after I hear about it, the one question I have
for all politicians and all governments is: Tell me any person who
has ever gotten a contract from a city or a county or a national
government without being politically connected,'' McBride said.
``Show me that one person.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, the system itself is kind of
defective.''

CIENFUEGOS TRIES TO REGAIN HIS TOUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Usually when Mauricio Cienfuegos does
something special, he pumps his fist like Tiger Woods. But after
scoring the lone goal in a 1-0 victory over Columbus on Tuesday,
the 32-year-old midfielder went a little bonkers.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he showed his trademark fist pump to the crowd at the Rose
Bowl, then he ran toward the Galaxy bench, leaping into the arms of
Dudley Hitchman, the team's assistant strength and conditioning
coach.
</P>
<P>
   It was only Cienfuegos' second goal of the season to go with a
paltry four assists. But in what has been a so-so season for the
four-time all-star, the burst of emotion explained how he felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mauricio has been at this game for a long time, he knows when
he is playing well and when he's not playing well,'' said Galaxy
coach Sigi Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy (9-5-7, 34 points) is hoping to win their second
consecutive match today in Miami, which would further extend their
playoff hopes and chances of catching Western Division leader
Kansas City (11-2-5, 38 points).
</P>
<P>
   To keep winning, Cienfuegos needs to keep producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``His (Cienfuegos') game of late hasn't been the quality and
standard he wants it to be,'' said Schmid. ``He's really trying to
lift his game so when he scored, all the emotion and energy came
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the inaugural season, Cienfuegos has been the team's
primary midfield general. But with so many changes, especially with
the acquisition of Luis Hernandez combined with losing fellow
playmaker Roy Myers to New York/New Jersey in order to acquire
Hernandez, Cienfuegos started losing his touch and timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never satisfied with your own performance but in this
case I knew I had to perform much better if this team was going to
start winning again,'' said Cienfuegos. ``I felt I needed to expose
myself more to my teammates and keep pushing the ball forward. I
have to drive this team and right now I'm getting a handle on it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid moved Cobi Jones to right midfield and shifted Simon
Elliott on the left to provide relief for Cienfuegos. It has given
Cien more room to operate and he is finding Hernandez and Jones in
space much easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a much better team than when Luis first
arrived,'' said Cienfuegos. ``We not only understand Luis and his
runs better, but everyone is feeling more comfortable with each
other since all of the changes were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, a long time member of El Salvador's national team,
passed Tampa Bay midfielder Carlos Valderrama Thursday as the top
vote getter for the MLS all-star match later this month in
Columbus. Cienfuegos thanked his countrymen for their support,
explaining that it was his popularity and not necessarily his
performance this season which resulted in 32,820 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's not sure if he will be selected to El Salvador's
national team when World Cup qualifying begins against Honduras
(July 16) followed by a match against fellow teammate Ezra
Hendrickson and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (April 23).
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to be part of your national team,
unfortunately our federation always waits till the last minute to
decide,'' said Cienfuegos.
</P>
<P>
   Two young players have said that Cienfuegos' time has passed him
bye and that he shouldn't be selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out in the paper and said they weren't convinced in
what I'll bring,'' said Cienfuegos. ``That's okay, I'm glad they
put their name to their opinions. I don't want to be an
inconvenience, I want what's best for my country but I know I still
have more to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The way he's playing again, the Galaxy wouldn't mind if he was
left behind.

TEST OF PROPOSED U.S. ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEM IS BEING WATCHED AROUND
THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Will update as developments warrant)  
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Protesters took to the seas, scientists voiced
their doubts and Pentagon planners monitored weather patterns
Friday as the United States prepared for a high-altitude test that
is expected to determine whether President Clinton approves a plan
to build a shield of missiles aimed at protecting U.S. soil from
enemy attack.
</P>
<P>
   The test lasts only thirty minutes; it costs $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The test Friday night is being watched around the world. Not
since 1983, when President Reagan envisioned a defense based in
space that would render nuclear weapons obsolete, has an issue of
military technology seized the imagination of U.S. policy-makers
and politicians and alarmed America's friends and foes.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has also entered the presidential campaign, with Vice
President Al Gore endorsing a limited version of the plan and Gov.
George W. Bush backing a more ambitious plan that could be deployed
in space.
</P>
<P>
   And it has raised a chorus of criticism from a sizable swath of
scientists in the United States, some of whom argue that the
proposed $60 billion system is not feasible and that the tests are
rigged.
</P>
<P>
   The test calls for sending a 37-year-old remodeled Minuteman
missile containing a mock warhead and a decoy balloon thundering
aloft over the Pacific from a tightly-guarded launch pad at
Vandenberg Air Force Base, 125 miles north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, a 54-inch, 130-pound ``exoatmospheric kill
vehicle'' was to launch from Kwajalein Atoll about 4,300 miles away
in the Pacific and to guide itself to a collision with the incoming
mock warhead in midflight. If the kill vehicle destroys the mock
warhead, the sky will be filled with a blinding flash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting a bullet with a bullet,'' is the way one Pentagon
official described the hoped-for collision. ``Steel on target,''
said another.
</P>
<P>
   The test follows two previous tests attempts to intercept a
target, part of a series of nineteen planned tests.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Pentagon hailed its first intercept test as a
complete success, but later acknowledged that the kill vehicle
initially had drifted off course and picked out the large bright
decoy balloon instead of the mock warhead.
</P>
<P>
   In the next and more complicated test in January, the kill
vehicle missed the mock warhead by between 300 to 400 feet after a
cooling line clogged and shut its heat-seeking sensors. ``There was
an ice cube in one of the lines,'' a Pentagon official explained.
``We fixed that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the last test, this time a communications system has been
added that transmits information directly to the kill vehicle about
the location of the target after it has lifted off. Called a
global-positioning-system transmitter, it uses the same technology
that helps motorists from getting lost.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that the new test is a misleading guide because it
is taking place under conditions that do not reflect a real attack.
They say that the decoy is not a true decoy, but is more like a
lure that attracts the kill vehicle to the real target, and that an
adversary would use many decoys, not one. About two weeks after the
test, Secretary of Defense William Cohen is to give Clinton a
formal recommendation of whether it is feasible to build the
system. Even if the test is a failure, he may recommend that the
plan proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to decide this fall whether to push the
United States down the road to a national missile defense system by
starting construction of a radar in the Aleutian Islands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Administration lawyers have advised Clinton that, in their view,
he could begin building this first phase of the missile defense
without violating the 1972 AntiBallistic Missile Treaty with
Russia, one of the cornerstones of arms control agreements between
Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has been hit by a storm of criticism from
prominent scientists, arms control experts, former officials and
the General Accounting Office over the cost, technology and effect
on relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Korb of the Council on Foreign Relations called the
entire system a ``shield of dreams'' whose supporters believe that
``if you build it, it will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even within the administration, a debate is raging among
intelligence and Pentagon officials and policy analysts over the
nature and extent of the potential threat from countries like North
Korea, Iran and Iraq that is the official justification for
building a missile shield. Some senior Pentagon officials have
warned that the administration's schedule is much too accelerated
and therefore risky, because testing would continue even as
construction has begun.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to stop the test, Greenpeace, the anti-nuclear
organization, said that a small team of missile defense opponents
entered the grounds of Vandenberg Air Force Base on foot. Equipped
with survival gear and supplies for several days, they intended to
stay inside the area as long as they could, according to a
Greenpeace statement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Dutch vessel Arctic Sunrise threatened to enter
one of the hazard zones designated by the Pentagon in the shores
off Vandenberg.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified man was caught entering the base, but base
spokesman John Cherry said that there was no evidence of intruders
in the heavily-guarded area around the launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing in Washington, a group of business leaders
and scientists weighed in with eleventh-hour criticism of both the
test and the entire plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop this insensate and tortuously rationalized arms race that
drains money away from our vital civilian programs,'' said Alan
Kligerman, the chief executive officer of Akpharma Inc., and a
board member of Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, which
seeks to cut military spending. He added, ``If I would represent my
products and sell them with the same shortcomings in the products
as regard to what they are supposed to do, I would be indicted. My
products would be seized'' by the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Blair, president of the Center for Defense Information,
argued at the same briefing that the development of a national
missile defense is justifiably seen by Russia as a threat to its
nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia today can barely cope with U.S. offensive power, let
alone a combination of offense and defense, a one-two punch that
could deliver the knockout blow to their strategic forces,'' Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China are adamantly opposed to aU.S. missile defense
because they consider it a threat to their ability to defend
themselves. European countries are also distressed that the United
States would take such a position without regard to Europe's
security.

IN THIRD WORLD, HOPES DASHED FOR EASY PREVENTION OF AIDS IN
INFANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ A U.N.-sponsored study of AIDS infection
among infants has dashed the hopes of scientists who thought they
had found a simple way to prevent mothers from giving their infants
the AIDS virus during breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study, discussed during interviews here ahead
of an international AIDS conference, confirmed earlier reports that
a relatively simple drug regimen could stop many infected mothers
from infecting their children during pregnancy and childbirth. But
it also found that the protection did not last for as long as
experts had hoped, and the therapy appears to leave children
vulnerable to infection from breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists had hoped that the treatment would be a powerful
weapon in their broad effort to shield very young children from the
AIDS epidemic in Africa, without the need to tackle the difficult
issue of breast-feeding, which is a medical risk but a cultural,
religious or economic necessity for millions of African women.
</P>
<P>
   For about the last five years, doctors have been giving women in
the United States and elsewhere infected with HIV, the AIDS virus,
one of two treatments during pregnancy to prevent the spread of the
disease to their unborn children. The infants were treated in the
first few days after birth, and an earlier study showed significant
reductions in AIDS infections in the first six weeks of life. The
success had been hailed as one of the rare triumphs in the war
against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, which involved 1,797 people and was the largest
ever performed on the transmission of AIDS from mothers to
children, followed children who were born to these mothers and
found that by 18 months the initial benefit was completely lost as
the infants who had been spared infection at birth later became
infected through breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   At the sixth week of the study, 6.7 percent of the babies born
to mothers who took the two-drug combination were infected or had
died, compared with 16.4 percent in the group that received no
drugs. But the infection and death rates after 18 months were 21.3
percent in the treatment group compared with 26.8 percent in the
placebo group.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are to be reported at the 13th International
Conference on AIDS, which begins Sunday. But the study's leaders
disclosed the findings in extensive interviews in advance of the
meeting because of their public health importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad news,'' said Dr. Joep M.A. Lange, of the Academic
Medical Center in Amsterdam, the study's principal investigator.
The study was conducted in South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda by
researchers from the three African countries and his Dutch team.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, said Dr. Hoosen M. Coovadia, head of department
of pediatrics and child health at the University of Natal and the
AIDS conference's chairman, who helped design the U.N. study, ``it
was naive to believe that continued breast-feeding would not make
an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, said Dr. Glenda Gray, who heads the perinatal
research unit at Baragwanath Hospital and the University of
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, ``it's not all or nothing because we
can still make a difference'' by trying other approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The new challenge for AIDS researchers and government officials
is to preserve the benefit of drug therapy in pregnancy and find
safe alternatives to breast-feeding. That is a formidable task in
Africa where the overwhelming majority of women breast-feed their
infants for long periods. Poverty limits the ability of women to
buy formula and breast-milk substitutes. Widespread contamination
of water supplies and poor sanitation make it dangerous to mix
formula. Also, male domination leaves many women with little
ability to choose an alternative to breast-feeding. And a woman who
avoids breast-feeding her infant can be stigmatized as having AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the findings seem certain to renew the often bitter
controversy over breast-feeding, which pits the new public health
emergency of AIDS against a fundamental, even ideological,
pediatric practice. Proponents say ``breast is best'' for infant
nutrition and that the dangers of contaminated water make the use
of formula too risky.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents contend that formula and other substitutes are
needed in the face of a growing epidemic in which an estimated
570,000 children became HIV-infected last year, mostly in Africa
where more than a third of pregnant women in some countries are
infected.
</P>
<P>
   UNAIDS, a joint U.N. program, has issued recommendations
intended to discourage HIV-infected women from breast-feeding, but
it said the decision should be left to each mother, in part because
the controversy cuts across cultural and religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings could also have political ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   South African President Thabo Mbeki has caused an international
furor in recent weeks over his questioning of the use of AZT in
combating mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   And the findings could bring added pressure on governments in
Third World countries for wider testing among pregnant women to
identify those who can breast-feed safely and to identify and
counsel mothers who are infected but whose infants are not.
</P>
<P>
   When the benefits of drug therapy during pregnancy were first
reported, AIDS researchers were surprised that a relatively short
course of drugs could have such an impact in preventing
mother-to-child transmission of HIV. But there was no way to know
in advance how long the benefit would last.
</P>
<P>
   In the regimen found most effective in that study, a woman takes
AZT and another drug, 3TC (lamivudine), for four weeks before her
expected delivery date and again during labor. Then both mother and
infant take the two drugs for one week after delivery.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. study was also pivotal in leading to apparent success
with an even simpler, cheaper and seemingly more effective therapy
_ a single pill of nevirapine given to a mother at the time of
delivery and one dose in fluid form to the infant. That study was
conducted in Uganda by Johns Hopkins University researchers with
funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   But Lange said ``there is no reason to believe that this loss of
effect is specific for'' the combination of AZT and 3TC.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a follow-up of the nevirapine study in Uganda shows the
same negating effect in the breast-feeding period, said Francis
Mmiro, a professor of obstetrics at Makerere University in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, Boehringer Ingelheim, which makes and
sells nevirapine as Viramune, announced Friday that it would offer
the drug at no charge for five years to prevent mother-to-child
transmission in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the action was part of its commitment to the
collaborative effort of five companies, the United Nations, the
World Bank and cooperating governments to explore practical
collaborative efforts to make AIDS drugs more affordable and more
widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the U.N. study said they would now have to search for
new ways to block mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``No single intervention will control pediatric AIDS,'' said
Coovadia. The challenge now is ``to make breast-feeding safer just
as we have made sex safer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coovadia and Mmiro of Uganda were among those who said they were
concerned that government leaders might stop paying for public
programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission on the grounds
that breast-feeding reversed many of the early gains.
</P>
<P>
   Geert Haverkamp, who coordinated the U.N. study, said his Dutch
team from the Academic Medical Center now planned to conduct at
least one follow-up study to help identify new ways to prevent
infection of newborns.
</P>
<P>
   In the planned study involving 500 children, they will receive
either nevirapine or 3TC during the entire period their mother
breast-feeds.
</P>
<P>
   In a possible second study, about 500 mothers will receive three
anti-HIV drugs (AZT, 3TC and a third to be chosen) for the entire
period she breast-feeds.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sorry guys, she's taken.
</P>
<P>
   During the men's Division I epee competition at the U.S.
National Fencing Championships Vahktang Iagorashvili walked over to
a large fencing bag. He pulled out a copy of the August issue of
Esquire, the one touting ``a Portfolio of America's 10 Sexiest
Athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   The cover girl for the issue is pentathlete Mary Beth Larsen.
Make that Mary Beth Larsen-Iagorashvili. The two pentathletes, both
of whom are fencing here this week, have been married a little less
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither will make the U.S. Olympic team as a fencer,
both will be going to Sydney. Mary Beth will be in the first-ever
women's Olympic pentathlon competition and ``Vaho,'' as he's known,
will go as her coach.
</P>
<P>
   Fencing is one of five sports contested in the modern
pentathlon, along with riding, running, swimming and shooting. The
weapon used there is the epee, so pentathletes like to enter those
competitions when they can. On Friday, the U.S. men's pentathlon
team was out in force, although rising star Chad Senior stayed out
of the competition with a small injury. Mary Beth will compete in
the women's epee competition today.
</P>
<P>
   Vaho fenced Friday with a small contraption near his elbow. He
has an elbow injury from playing tennis and teaching fencing.
Although he's now 36, he still does quite well in the pentathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was ranked No. 1 in the world,'' he said. ``This
year I'm still No. 5, even though I haven't competed much.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Vaho captured his third San Antonio World Cup title.
He was also on the U.S. team that crushed Russia and Hungary in a
World Cup team relay event to take the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he said, ``The rules said I could not compete in the Olympic
qualifier. Probably next year I will get my citizenship. I'm not
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaho won a bronze medal for Russia in 1988 and was the Russian
national champion in 1991. Back then, Russia and his home country
of Georgia were splitting up. The Russians didn't want Georgians on
their team, and Georgia didn't have a team.
</P>
<P>
   About that time he came to the United States as a trainer to two
Austin pentathletes, Rob and Doug Stull. In 1996 he competed for
Georgia in the Olympics. He's been living in San Antonio the past
two years, where many pentathletes have trained, including Mary
Beth.

WORLD BANK REJECTS CHINA RESETTLEMENT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for restructuring, rewriting and additions.)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under heavy pressure from the United States, the
World Bank's board overruled the bank leadership Friday and denied
financing for a sensitive Chinese antipoverty proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The $160 million plan, part of which would have resettled 58,000
farmers, most of them ethnic Chinese, in an area that nomadic
Tibetan herdsman once dominated, divided leading borrowers from
rich nations, including the United States. Rarely has any World
Bank project aroused as much internal dissent and outside protest.
</P>
<P>
   China withdrew the project from consideration Friday morning,
when the board made it clear that it would not agree to finance the
project and would reconsider the plan only after a lengthy and
potentially intrusive study on its environmental and social
effects.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese delegate to the bank, Zhu Xian, attributed the
defeat to ``enormous political pressures'' brought to bear by
wealthy nations and pledged that China would use its own money to
finance the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous outside groups campaigned to stop World Bank support
for the project, and demonstrators gathered outside the bank
headquarters here and cheered the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for Tibet have argued that resettling the Chinese
farmers in Qinghai Province would reinforce Chinese claims to
historically Tibetan lands.
</P>
<P>
   For the 181 member nations of the bank, the struggle was over
controlling the tens of billions of dollars that the bank lends to
developing nations each year. Developing nations, which were led by
China, the bank's No. 1 borrower and a nation that has often
successfully defended its interests in international organizations,
pushed the board to finance the project and leave its execution in
the hands of bank managers, people involved in the debate said.
</P>
<P>
   But leading industrial nations argued that the bank management
had ignored its internal procedures when approving the project. The
United States signaled that it believed that the board had to take
a more active role in reviewing lending programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We and numerous other shareholders were not prepared to
support this project, because we did not believe that it was in
compliance with the bank's own policies,'' a senior Treasury
Department official said. ``The bank needs to prepare specific
proposals to give the shareholders a greater sense of confidence
that management has the internal capacity to apply its established
internal policies.''
</P>
<P>
   An inspection panel commissioned by the board of the bank
reported last month that the bank had violated its guidelines when
it approved the proposal. Bank officials acknowledged errors but
dismissed the report as an attempt by some board members to exert
more control over day-to-day affairs.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the discussion said that the United States
and Japan wanted to kill the project outright and that Britain,
Germany and other European nations were prepared to consider the
case again after the bank had studied its effects more thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   But China objected strenuously to a fresh review. Zhu said some
nations were using the cover of internal guidelines as a way to
inject political control over lending. ``Compliance policies have
been interpreted by some to an extreme and used for political
purposes,'' Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
   China's decision to withdraw the project is a setback for the
bank president, James Wolfensohn. He had urged the board to approve
the proposal. Wolfensohn, recently reappointed with President
Clinton's support, favored the plan despite U.S. opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The bank thinks of China as one of its most successful
customers. It has loaned China $4 billion for 31 antipoverty
projects and helped 200 million Chinese climb out of poverty in the
last 20 years, bank officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But the Qinghai project, which is most likely to be the last one
eligible for the bank's most-subsidized loan program because
average per capita income in China has risen so high, became the
most sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of
Tibet who was born in eastern Qinghai, have argued that the bank
would have contributed to increasing Chinese domination in the
Tibetan region by helping to move mostly Han Chinese and some Hui
Muslim farmers into a largely unsettled area of Qinghai. Some
Tibetans claim that area as part of their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The resettlement part of the project had been scheduled to cost
$40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like moving people from Denver to a Native American
reservation in Colorado,'' said John Ackerly, president of the
International Campaign for Tibet, which has fought the project.
``This is an area where Tibetans have lived for generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank said those arguments were unjustified. The project
would have paid to move farmers who live in arid eastern Qinghai to
irrigated lands farther west in the same province. The bank also
said Qinghai, which was part of China before Beijing invaded Tibet
in 1951, was already predominantly Han, the dominant Chinese ethnic
group.
</P>
<P>
   Nations that opposed the proposal said they did so more because
of how the bank had handled it rather than because of the project
itself. Though the board gave initial approval to the plan last
year, it ordered an inspection panel to address concerns that the
bank had not sufficiently explored all aspects.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's report said the bank had originally classified the
project as needing a relatively low level of review when it should
have required the highest level. The report added that the bank had
failed to explore alternatives, and it strongly implied that China
had intimidated bank managers to expedite the approval.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Japan argued that the panel's conclusion
should be enough to end discussion of the plan. But several other
wealthy nations thought that it still made sense for the bank to be
involved, especially because China intended to pursue the project
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Britain issued a statement Friday calling the outcome a Pyrrhic
victory for opponents. ``World Bank involvement,'' the statement
said, ``would have ensured that high social and environmental
standards were adhered to.''

 &HT;    Irwin's was a life full of racing
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kenny Irwin struggled to establish himself in Winston
Cup racing, but he was a winner and champion in just about every
other series in which he competed.
</P>
<P>
   From the same Indianapolis area that produced Jeff Gordon and
Tony Stewart, Irwin grew up on open-wheel racing before making the
move to stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin died Friday at the age of 30 after a practice-session
crash at New Hampshire Speedway. He was in his third full Winston
Cup season.
</P>
<P>
   He began racing at the age of 6. He formally started his United
States Auto Club career in 1991 at age 22, driving midget cars. Two
years later, he was rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Irwin also raced in the Silver Crown series and was
rookie of the year. A year later, he was the points champion. Irwin
won the USAC midgets series title in 1996 and also ran five races
in the fledgling NASCAR Craftsman truck series. His USAC midget
career included eight wins and 20 second-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin moved full-time to the truck series in 1997 and met with
immediate success: two wins, seven top-five finishes, a 10th-place
finish in the points race and the rookie of the year award. In only
his second truck-series start, he won the pole at Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   That August, the week of his 28th birthday, he was introduced as
owner Robert Yates' new driver for the fabled No. 28 Ford, to
replace Ernie Irvan for the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   He warmed up for his Yates debut by running four Cup races
toward the end of 1997. He started second and finished eighth in
his debut at Richmond, becoming the first driver in NASCAR's modern
history to start on the front row and finish in the top-10 in his
first race.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth start for Yates in 1998, Irwin led much of the
Primestar 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway and finished fifth. ``I was
thinking the whole year was going to be like that,'' he said, upon
going into an early season slump during which he failed to make the
field for the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte that May.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin rebounded by the end of the season, however, taking his
first career pole in the season-finale at AMS. He became the first
Winston Cup rookie to earn $1 million in a season and won rookie of
the year by 13 points over Kevin Lepage.
</P>
<P>
   His highlights that season incuded being the highest-starting
rookie in the history of the Brickyard 400, with a fourth-place
qualifying effort, and posting one top-five and four top-10
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin opened the 1999 season by finishing third in the Daytona
500, which would turn out to be his best career finish in 87 Cup
races. But even before the season began, his relationship with
Yates was in trouble. He was criticized for being too fun-loving
and was taken to task for being seen too often shooting pool in
billiards parlors around Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Pool and golf were Irwin's other passions besides racing. He and
fellow Cup driver Mike Skinner occasionally got together for their
own friendly pool competition.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin had a better sophomore season than his rookie year, moving
from 28th in points to 19th. But late in '99, Yates announced that
he was letting Irwin go, and Irwin was hired to drive the No. 42
Chevrolet for Felix Sabates. He also was to drive 15 races for
Sabates' No. 42 entracked into the rear of Stewart's Pontiac on lap
147, sending it into the wall. Stewart climbed out of his car and
waited on the track for Irwin's car to come back around, tossed the
fire-shield pads from his shoes at the No. 28 Ford and attempted to
throw a series of left-handed punches into the cockpit area.
Stewart was reprimanded by NASCAR.

SHOULD MOTHERS VICTIMIZED BY DOMESTIC ABUSE HAVE CUSTODY OF
CHILDREN? 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the supervising judge in Bronx Family Court, Judge
Clark V. Richardson spends most days presiding over one arduous
decision after another _ when to sever a mother's legal ties to her
child, when to throw a teen-age troublemaker behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   But these days there is a particularly vexing category of cases
on his docket: Richardson handles all of the cases in the Bronx
when the city's child welfare agency has removed children from
their homes because, in essence, one of their parents has been the
victim of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The city can take children into foster care if a parent is
believed to ``engage in acts of domestic violence.'' Its authority
to do so was strengthened by a 1998 state court ruling that
declared incidents of domestic violence in the presence of a child
to be sufficient grounds for a finding of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, Richardson said, that usually means that a mother
who is a victim of abuse can be accused of failing to protect her
children from danger. Often, she may have done nothing wrong or
negligent, but simply lacked the financial or emotional resources
to leave an abusive partner.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, it falls to Richardson, and other Family Court
judges across the state, to decide whether those mothers get their
children back, and under what terms. After all, he and other child
welfare experts acknowledge, abusive parents can frequently be
players in the most tragic cases of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   And so for Richardson, who deals daily with disputes of law and
love, violence and poverty, these cases present an especially
daunting exercise in balancing interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is difficult is that you're victimizing them twice,'' he
said of the mothers. ``On the other hand, you have the notion of
protecting the children. And they are not necessarily consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He cited two recent examples: in both, the city had taken
custody of children after a violent fight between their parents.
And in both, the women implored him to send their children back
home.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, a woman with a black eye stood before him,
claiming to have hurt herself by banging into a refrigerator. Her
husband sounded belligerent. Their 13-year-old daughter insisted
she had never witnessed any domestic violence at home. The judge
suspected she had been coached.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, a woman appeared alone, her arms pocked with
bruises, her face glazed by weariness. She told the judge of being
terrified of her husband. She agreed to move, to take her children
someplace where he would never find them. For the judge, the
questions were plain, if painfully hard to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Is it fair to punish an abused woman by taking her children
away? Is it wise to return children to a parent who has been unable
to shield them from the danger of an abusive partner?
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the judge, who under a pilot program sees all
such cases in the Bronx, ultimately allowed the children to return
home, but only after being assured that the women would make use of
counseling and other support services, he said. In the first case,
he waited even longer, until the couple acknowledged that there had
been a problem with violence in the home.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, such cases reflect an unintended consequence of
new and arguably enlightened perspectives on domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   It is now widely acknowledged that watching adults fight at home
_ and especially witnessing a parent being beaten _ can scar
children forever. Moreover, domestic violence can sometimes be part
of a package of dysfunction at home, a red flag for egregious forms
of child abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there's a close correlation between domestic violence
and child abuse,'' said Nicholas Scoppetta, commissioner of the
Administration for Children's Services, in an interview. ``Very
often where there's physical abuse of children, there's also
domestic violence in the home, in particular, when there's an
unrelated male in the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, Scoppetta said, caseworkers routinely inquire into
domestic violence. The fact that one parent is abused, he asserted,
should not be the sole reason to remove their children, but if the
victim resists taking the steps necessary to protect the children _
by failing to keep the batterer away, for instance, or refusing to
move to a safe place _ the children should be removed for their
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials said they did not keep figures on how many
children were removed principally because of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a judgment call on the part of caseworkers,'' Scoppetta
said. ``I would hope they would make that call only when there's
evidence that the child is in imminent danger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we always get it right?'' he asked. ``I suspect it doesn't
always happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women's advocates contend that the agency often does not
get it right. They have recently filed a class-action lawsuit
claiming that the city violates the due process of rights of
parents who have been victims of domestic violence by removing
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of punishing the perpetrator, these advocates say, an
overzealous application of the law ends up punishing the victim.
That fear can keep victims of domestic violence from taking action
against their batterers, they say. And just as it can hurt children
to watch a parent being abused, they add, it can also hurt them to
be suddenly taken from that parent's care.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They offer the example of women like Sharlene Tillett, who was
accused of exposing her child to domestic violence even though the
child had not yet been born. Tillett, 29, was pregnant with her
second child last year when the baby's father, her ex-boyfriend,
from whom she had already separated, came to her apartment one
night and, in a bout of anger, began pummeling her.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time he had assaulted her, she said, but it
would be the last. She had decided, she said, to move to
California, where she had family, after the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans unraveled the day she gave birth to a healthy baby
boy, whom she named Uganda. When a social worker at Jamaica
Hospital Medical Center asked about domestic violence as part of a
routine questionnaire, Tillett said, she answered candidly.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, in a move that she soon realized was a grave
mistake, she agreed to let the baby's father, Jamie Gray, take them
home from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   City records indicate that the social worker filed a complaint
to the state central register on child abuse and neglect. The next
day, child welfare caseworkers, accompanied by police officers,
carried away her 2-day-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Tillett was charged with child neglect. ``The respondents engage
in acts of domestic violence in the present of the subject child,''
the caseworker's report said.
</P>
<P>
   Tillett was also charged with not having a crib for the baby. It
did not help, she said, when she explained she was planning to move
to California. She had a plane ticket in hand, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It took Tillett seven weeks to get Uganda back, as well as 19
weeks of court-ordered workshops for domestic violence victims, 10
hours of classes on being a good parent and counseling once a week.
She now lives in a homeless shelter for battered women. The city
child welfare agency is continuing to monitor her case.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tillett, Sharwline Nicholson said she was wholly unprepared
for the arrival of the child welfare agency in her life. She, too,
had separated from the father of her second child. He had never
been violent until one wintry afternoon last year, when in an
apparent fit of jealousy, she said, he went to her Brooklyn
apartment unexpectedly, hurled whatever was in sight, and kicked
and hit her so severely that her arm was broken. The baby,
Destinee, was sleeping in another room; her 6-year-old son,
Kendell, was in school.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-boyfriend, Claude Barnett, fled. When the police and
paramedics arrived, Nicholson said, she asked a neighbor who
frequently watched her children to baby-sit until her cousin could
pick them up later that day. Knowing her children would be safe,
she said, she slept peacefully at Kings County Hospital that night.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, a child welfare caseworker called the
hospital. ``They said they had possession of my kids,'' Nicholson
recalled. ``I was devastated. I've always heard the worst when they
get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The city charged her and Barnett with child neglect. Barnett,
the court papers added, had hit the little boy in the mouth once
before. ACS officials also said Nicholson had not showed up in
court and had refused to move to a new apartment.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Nicholson denies that Barnett had hit Kendell. She
admits she missed one court appointment, citing a severe snowstorm.
And she calls the child neglect charges ``ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I called 911 I was bleeding so badly I knew I needed
medical attention,'' Nicholson, 31, a store cashier and part-time
student at Mercy College, said the other day. ``I didn't know I'd
end up down that road, that calling for help would escalate and I'd
end up losing my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   A Family Court judge in Brooklyn returned her children in a
week, while the child welfare agency continued to monitor her case.
Her case has since been closed, but Nicholson's outrage at the
child welfare agency remains.
</P>
<P>
   She is the lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit filed in
April against the agency, claiming that her due process rights were
violated. Carolyn A. Kubitschek, the lawyer who filed the suit,
said she did so to compel the city to better train its caseworkers,
so that children would not be removed just because a parent had
been abused.
</P>
<P>
   By everyone's admission, deciding when a child is safe with a
parent can be a nuanced, difficult question. The circumstances of
each family are different, as are the highly subjective approaches
of judges.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, the pilot project placing all such cases under one
judge was driven by the theory that doing so would bring a greater
uniformity to how those decisions are made.
</P>
<P>
   In the vast majority of the 35 to 40 cases that Richardson has
handled in the last six months, the city had removed the children.
And, in the vast majority of cases, he reversed the city's decision
and sent the children back home. When a parent has agreed to take
all the prescribed precautions, he said, it is unnecessarily harsh
to keep their children in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the worst thing to do at that point is to remove their
children,'' he said. ``Then that person has absolutely nothing,
nothing to hope for.''

   LOUDON, N.H. _ From inside the Hills Brothers Coffee hauler,
neither the sound of screeching brakes nor the crash of metal
hitting concrete was heard Friday. Mechanic Mike Shiflett did not
know why he turned his head just in time to witness the crash that
killed 30-year-old driver Kenny Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Through the sliding glass doors at the back of the hauler,
Shiflett watched as Irwin skidded across Turn 3 at the New
Hampshire International Speedway. The tires of Irwin's No. 42
BellSouth car locked in place and left a trail of smoke leading up
to the initial impact. The right-front section struck the wall
first, while the rear end shot into the air. Then, the car flipped
onto the driver's side and scraped along the banking. At the start
of Turn 4, the vehicle flipped onto its roof and stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Once emergency crews rushed to the scene, crew members and
drivers began to piece together what happened and speculate about
what caused the crash. Many recalled a similar incident eight weeks
ago that claimed the life of 19-year-old Adam Petty. Friday's fatal
accident took place just yards from where Petty died. Concerns
about Turn 3, track safety, and hung throttles were raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw that, when a car hits like that and it goes up and
it disappears, that's big,'' said Shiflett. ``I thought it was
going to be on the other side of the wall. I thought it was going
to be hung up in the fence. But when I got to the back of the
truck, I saw it was on its roof. Most of the times you see these
cars crash and the guys get up and walk out of them. It kind of
gave me the willies because I heard it's the same place Adam hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Added America Online crew member Vance ``Weasel'' Howell, ``It's
sort of odd to have two people die on the same turn, but then again
this is racing. You get in a racecar and that's the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But many in the racing community were less resigned to fate and
more interested in finding fault with either the track or car. Some
drivers and crew members criticized the design of Turn 3, echoing
the sentiments of Ward Burton who said, ``Two means it's a problem.
I think it needs to be addressed.'' Burton suggested that the 12
degrees of banking be increased and others agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just on the very edge and this track is so flat,'' said
Mike Butcher, a crew member for the Petty Enterprises Hot Wheels
car. ``There's not a lot of banking to it so there's very, very
little room for error. Without a lot of banking in the turns, it
doesn't give anything for the car to lean on, You're more or less
on the verge of spinning out when you are in the turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Driver Rusty Wallace, who earned the pole position for Sunday's
New England 300, suggested the structure of the track might be
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got long straightaways an tight corners and you've gotta
understand what you're getting into when you go there,'' said
Wallace. ``There's a big bump going into Turn 3 and you're flying.
Just about the time you're getting off the brake you go flying off
this bump down there and you know it's there. You've gotta
negotiate it, you've gotta shock for it, you've gotta spring for it
. . . All these racetracks have different personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular car-related theories involved a stuck throttle,
the same suspicion many drivers and crew members had following the
Petty crash. Coming down a straightaway, drivers are at full
throttle. When they come into a turn, drivers must get off the gas.
If the throttle does not come back, the driver cannot turn and
usually find themselves heading straight for a wall.
</P>
<P>
   During the morning qualifying session, several drivers guarded
against stuck throttles by placing a piece of metal over their
shoes, allowing them to pull the throttle up if it jammed. After
the Irwin crash, Wallace vowed to make the metal throttle release
mandatory in all his cars.
</P>
<P>
   Other rumors circulating after the crash involved brake failure
or a blown tire. But skid marks visible 100 yards before the
initial point of impact dispelled the notion of brake failure. A
flat tire was also considered a possible, but unlikely cause.
</P>
<P>
   Said Danny Shull, a crew member for the No. 32 Tide car,
``There's only one person who knows what happened and he's dead.''

ROUGH, TOUGH, BUT ON A ROAD TO LADYLIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By NANCY HASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Natasha Lyonne sat on a bench outside a coffee bar
near her Gramercy Park studio apartment last Tuesday, shuddering
slightly even in the 90-degree heat. She was detoxing from
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to breakfast,'' said the 21-year-old actress whose
quirky performances in ``Slums of Beverly Hills,'' ``American Pie''
and ``But I'm a Cheerleader,'' which opened this weekend, have
marked her as the New York doppelganger of such plump-lipped
ingenues as Neve Campbell and Jennifer Love Hewitt, a sort of
antistarlet. She lifted a large iced coffee to go and took a deep
drag of a Marlboro. Her voice was throaty, her tone ironic: ``Real
movie star stuff here, real glamour.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most people in her profession Lyonne spends much of her
time working in Los Angeles, but it takes a lot of imagination to
picture her tooling down Rodeo Drive in a BMW convertible or
lolling in the Hollywood Hills. Although she is only
5-foot-3-inches and waifish (the huge breasts she sported as the
focus of the comedy in ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' were
prosthetics), she walks like a truck driver. And swears like one,
too. Between drags of her cigarette (she carries both Marlboros and
Camel Lights because she ``likes to switch off''), her monologues
tumble out in a side-of-the-mouth stream of consciousness. Her
references careen from Ionesco to patent leather G-strings.
``Sometimes the things that come out of my mouth are mortifying,''
she conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her cultivated toughness, Lyonne's latest obsession is
``being a lady.'' She is tired of her old punk wardrobe of black
fishnets and leather. To prove it, she was wearing a Jill Stuart
halter dress in demure shades of brown. Stuart gave her the dress
to wear to a star-studded AIDS benefit in Manhattan the night
before. It set off Lyonne's eyes, which are huge beneath soft
spidery lashes. To complete the genteel image, she was now carrying
a big off-white fake alligator purse that she picked up for $2 at
the 26th Street flea market. ``I used to go to the airport in
fishnets and combat boots, and kids would call me Herman Munster,''
she recalled. ``That wasn't so great.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lyonne hasn't traded in her Doc Martens for the haute
vintage look now popular with many young women in the East Village.
``I'm so over polyester,'' she said. Nor does she cotton to the
``floraly'' sundresses that seem to be the uniform for her actress
peers in Hollywood. ``I prefer to look like that but gone a little
wrong. I'd rather confuse people.'' (In keeping with the spirit of
confusion, she has paired Stuart's dress with gold lame platform
sandals from Frederick's of Hollywood.) Lyonne insisted she was
sincere about giving herself a full-fledged fashion makeover. In
fact, she wanted to start that very minute. After a final
cigarette, she clumped off to Ferragamo, where she had read in the
paper there was a sale. ``Now that is a ladylike place, I'll bet,''
she said, hailing a cab.
</P>
<P>
   Once uptown, her expression grew a bit worried. Standing outside
the massive glass doors of the venerable shoe store, she looked
like a lost child. ``OK, men, I'm going in,'' she deadpanned to an
invisible Army brigade. The first thing that caught her eye was a
piece of luggage. She turned pale when the saleswoman told her it
cost $1,000. ``See, it rolls,'' the woman added, cheerily. ``Oh,
that makes all the difference,'' Lyonne said, moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Lyonne wandered over to survey the spectator pumps, considering
for a moment whether the matronly two-toned shoe might have camp
potential, but the impulse lasted only a moment. ``Even I am not
this crazy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After perusing a pair of $1,250 alligator stilettos, she asked
for a lady's room. A reproving salesman told her that the store's
restrooms were out of order. He suggested she go down the street to
Burger Heaven. ``OK,'' she said under her breath with a theatrical
scowl. ``So why don't you just say, like: `Get out of here, you
can't afford these things. Go back downtown, you loser.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her grumbling during the trek to Burger Heaven, Lyonne
actually seemed perfectly happy playing the outsider. In two recent
roles, ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' and HBO's ``If These Walls Could
Talk 2'' she has played a lesbian, a stretch she shrugs off. ``It's
no big deal,'' said Lyonne, who like many of her Hollywood peers
thinks such concerns are dated. ``To me it's about as controversial
as the interracial stuff in `Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'''
</P>
<P>
   She comes by such off-hand bohemianism honestly. Her mother was
the European-educated daughter of Holocaust survivors. She
describes her father as a bit of a shady character from Brooklyn.
``It was unclear what my parents did for a living,'' she said.
``They were the black sheeps of Auschwitz and Flatbush.''
</P>
<P>
   She spent the first eight years of her life in Great Neck, where
she and her family lived in Herman Melville's old house. They kept
a sheep on the rambling property, until one day it ``just
exploded.'' ``I had a rabbit that exploded, too,'' she added.
``Things like that happened to us. We were very weird.''
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to Israel, where Natasha's father became a
boxing promoter. Her parents' marriage broke up soon after, and her
mother brought her and her older brother to Manhattan. She has not
heard from her father since. Her grandmother offered to pick up the
cost of private school, but only if Natasha went to a yeshiva.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't fit in and ``got kicked out pretty easily,'' she
said, adding that she also got kicked out of army summer camp in
Israel when she was 15. ``I was wild. I broke a whole bunch of kids
out of the barracks in a covert nighttime maneuver. I was like
Bette Davis on crank.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lyonne got cast by Woody Allen in ``Everyone Says I Love You,''
when she was 16, a fact she recalled wistfully as she passed the
fortress-like Fifth Avenue headquarters of Harry Winston where one
of the film's musical numbers was shot. ``We could go in and just
say hi,'' she said brightly, as she glanced at the ornate gates and
improvised a little Fred Astaire glide. Then she got a bit
embarrassed over her own enthusiasm. ``Or maybe not.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the paycheck from ``Everyone'' that enabled her to buy
the small apartment near Gramercy Park when she was 18. She has
been financially independent ever since. For the last year, she has
been dating Edward Furlong, another young actor, who works mostly
in independent films. (After shopping, she planned to go to the
airport _ no ticket yet _ and hop a plane for Rome, where Furlong
is working.)
</P>
<P>
   Because her talents have been so much in demand lately, Lyonne
has put off going to college, though she was accepted at her first
choice, New York University. (In her entrance essay she compared
working with Allen to T.S. Eliot's ``Wasteland''). But part of her
longs to join the brainy set of young actors that includes the Yale
student Clare Danes and Natalie Portman, who is at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty good with ideas,'' she said, ``and that life really
appeals to me.'' Unlike those actors, she has not made enough money
to retire on. For her, $30,000 a year tuition would be a wipeout.
``I could ask my grandmother for the money, but I really have this
thing about being independent.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m., Lyonne had become disillusioned with the relentless
ladylikeness of Fifth Avenue. ``Let's go somewhere less phony,''
she said, after a browse through Fendi, where she just shook her
head at the price of the elaborately beaded accessories.
</P>
<P>
   She opted for a cab ride back downtown, to Ina, the designer
resale shop in NoLIta. ``This is more my speed,'' she said, trying
on a $100 pair of pink Prada hot pants. ``Though even these are
still overpriced, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she wound up with a straw fedora _ no fancy label.
``In my line of work you need something to keep the sun out of your
eyes,'' she said, sounding as though she worked construction
instead of movies. She glanced at herself in the store window.
``It's a look. It's not Ferragamo, but it's a look.''

Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers) SUGAR
BACKERS STICK WITH THE PROGRAM  
 By CARL HULSE  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   WASHINGTON _ While opponents of
federal sugar subsidies raise Cain about the cost to taxpayers and
consumers, supporters of the controversial program have managed yet
again to keep the price supports intact.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before leaving for the Fourth of July recess, House backers of
the sugar program defeated the latest assault by sugar foes who
wanted to prevent the government from buying any surplus sugar
beyond the $54 million worth already acquired by the Agriculture
Department this year.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a new report that showed artificially high prices for
sugar costs users about $2 billion annually, hostile lawmakers said
it was time to turn off the federal spigot for sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us stop wasting taxpayers' dollars on the sugar program,''
said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., who has tried unsuccessfully for
years to kill the aid.
</P>
<P>
   Farm industry allies argued it was unfair to try to rewrite the
sugar program in a spending bill. They said the proper time for any
revisions would be when Congress undertakes a sweeping review of
farm programs. A vote on Miller's amendment was blocked on
procedural grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Ewing, R-Ill., questioned the findings of the study by
the General Accounting Office and said candy manufacturers and
other large sugar consumers couldn't be counted on to pass on any
savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar prices are low and I have not ... seen any reduction in
candy bars or soda pop,'' observed Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Other defenders of the sugar program said critics are picking on
a plan that aids small farmers and puts food on American tables.
``If we complain about farmers, do not do so with our mouths
full,'' said Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., who represents the stage's
sugar-growing region.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent sugar victory, the fight will persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the height of absurdity,'' said Rep. Joe Hoeffel,
R-Pa. ``We encourage overproduction of sugar through subsidies and
trade restrictions and then when sugar is overproduced we buy it
and give it away to a third country for free.''
</P>
<P>
   RIVER PROGRAM ROLLING
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of a Clinton administration effort to revitalize U.S.
riverfronts won an easy congressional victory over conservatives
seeking to cut off funding for the American Heritage Rivers
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers representing districts that contain some of the 14
rivers given the special designation successfully struck language
from the agriculture appropriations bill that would have prohibited
any spending on the effort. Authors of the restriction did not even
bother to put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said the program, seen by critics as a way to impose
more federal controls on private property, is misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade from now, indeed 100 years from now, people will
recognize the American Heritage Rivers initiative coming from the
Clinton administration was one of the important environmental
initiatives,'' said Rep. Maurice Hinchey, D-N.Y. Rivers in Florida,
North Carolina and Louisiana are among those in the program.
</P>
<P>
   EMERGENCY AID
</P>
<P>
   With the budget surplus growing dramatically in recent
estimates, some lawmakers want to return the money to health care
facilities that continue to struggle with past spending reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., is calling for dollars to be
diverted to hospitals reeling from 1997 cuts made in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hospitals in Alabama are hurting,'' he said. ``Seventy
percent are operating in the red and 14 are predicted to run out of
money this year and could close. Improving the financial health of
our hospitals is crucial to maintaining the quality of health care
we've all come to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   His proposal drew widespread support in the House.
</P>
<P>
   HOW DOES GORE/GRAHAM SOUND?
</P>
<P>
   Was it an audition for a potential starring role in the fall?
</P>
<P>
   It cannot be mere coincidence that Vice President Al Gore
recruited Democratic Sen. Bob Graham of Florida to chat with
campaign reporters a few days ago about Medicare drug coverage and
the virtues of Gore's emerging plan.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of vice presidential smoke signals immediately seized on
the Gore invitation as evidence that Graham was being given an
opportunity to prove himself as a potential running mate. Graham
aides said he was sought out as a recognized Senate expert on the
potent campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Graham's name remains alive in the Democratic
veepstakes as does that of another Southerner, Gov. Jim Hunt of
North Carolina. Both could add competitive spice in states that
lean Republican in presidential contests.

COUPLE COMBS JAMAICA BEACHES FOR MISSING DAUGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEGRIL, Jamaica _ In the dying light, the prayers for the
missing woman poured out of the hilltop church near Montego Bay,
two hours' drive from this beach resort town.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick and Mary Ann Kirschhoch stood up beneath whirring
fans. The Moravian congregation was asking God for the safe return
of the couple's daughter, Claudia, 29, a travel editor for
Frommer's who vanished from Negril around May 27.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Kirschhoch had grown up with the Moravian church in
New York. He knew the hymns by heart. But the Jamaicans sang with
an intensity that sounded almost otherworldly to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an outpouring of warmth and comfort and empathy
that was overwhelming,'' Kirschhoch said. ``It's something we'll
never forget, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   There are few things about Jamaica that these parents from
Morristown, N.J., will be able to erase from their memories. This
was their second visit in three weeks to help in the search for
their daughter, a resident of New York.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to the lush, mountainous island on June 22, even
though investigations by the police, the FBI and a private
detective were coming up empty. (The detective had been hired by
Gordon Stewart, the owner of the resort where Claudia Kirschhoch
had been staying, and the FBI had sent agents at the request of the
Jamaican police.)
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, newspapers, radio stations and television
programs have been running reports on the disappearance every few
days. Several days before the Kirschhochs arrived, they increased
their reward offer for information leading to their daughter's
whereabouts, to $25,000 from $6,200; the new amount is about 10
times the average annual income in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, four days after the Kirschhochs returned home,
Stewart added another $25,000 to the pot. The parents plan to fly
back to Jamaica on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like this in Jamaica,'' said Daniel
Grizzle, chairman of the resort board at the Negril Chamber of
Commerce. ``There's never been a search of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Kirschhoch arrived in Jamaica on May 24 and stayed at
Beaches Negril, part of a 15-hotel Caribbean chain run by Sandals
Resorts International, after a trip to Cuba sponsored by Sandals
was canceled. She was last seen by Tania Grossinger, a freelance
travel writer from New York, at breakfast on May 27.
</P>
<P>
   When she did not fly back to New York on June 1 as scheduled,
her parents called the hotel. In her room, hotel staff found
clothes, luggage, her passport, and a wallet with cash and credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   The parents said the only things missing were a blue-striped
bathing suit, sunglasses, a portable radio and possibly a notepad.
Helicopter and boat searches turned up nothing. The local police
said they had no leads.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 people have been reported missing in Jamaica so
far this year, the police said. Most were local teen-agers who had
run away from home, only to turn up after a few days. Despite being
pressed by reporters, police officials said they had no statistics
on how many foreign visitors were reported missing, but insisted
that the number was low.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Kirschhochs were methodical in their search. Frederick
Kirschhoch, 57, a part-time engineer, approached the task the same
way he does when finishing buildings: making a checklist, going
through the details, marking off the loose ends one by one.
</P>
<P>
   The Kirschhochs were staying at another Sandals resort in Negril
in a room paid for by Stewart, owner of the Sandals chain. The
resort was loud, with partying couples, swim-up bars and blaring
reggae, not the kind of place where they would have chosen to spend
time.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no vacation, and when Frederick Kirschhoch walked
into their room, he opened the tourist brochure and tried to think
like his daughter. Where would I go? Whom would I speak with? He
considered her an experienced traveler. She had visited Italy and
the Canary Islands, and she had lived for seven months in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that nobody knows anything,'' her father said.
The Kirschhochs came here because they believed they could describe
their daughter to Jamaicans in a way that only parents could. Or
maybe people who had information would be more forthcoming with
them than with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Kirschhoch, 60, a retirement account manager at
Honeywell, carried a notebook in which she meticulously recorded
their findings. She scribbled questions they wanted to ask hotel
workers and other people who had seen their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Jones was one of those. The young man worked as a
lifeguard on a beach that Claudia Kirschhoch might have visited.
After her parents tracked him down, he pointed to a far-off spot
next to a trash bin where he thought he had seen their daughter a
month before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a black lady, a local lady, talking to her,'' he
said. ``She told the lady she wanted to go to Westmoreland, maybe
to the Black River area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you be sure it was her?'' Frederick Kirschhoch asked. His
wife held up a flier with two photographs of their daughter and a
description: 5 feet 2 inches tall, slim build, long dark brown
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Jones stared ahead, pondering.
</P>
<P>
   ``How tall was she?'' Kirschhoch asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 5-6.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you remember what day it was?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, mon, I can't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of their mornings, they walked the seven-mile white-sand
beach and passed out fliers. They believed this did some good. They
could not follow up on each of the 377 telephone tips the police
had received.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people whom the Kirschhochs met on the beach held
their hands and told them how much they felt for them. But after
the parents walked away, some people said that the American woman
must be dead, or had somehow made her way to Cuba, and that if the
search turned up anything, it would be something horrible.
``Somebody must have kidnapped her,'' said Carmen Purchase, a baby
sitter. ``Because she's gone so long, then maybe she's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   At night the Kirschhochs went to the half-dozen or so reggae
clubs in town. Their daughter liked reggae, and maybe someone had
seen her.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Mary Ann Kirschhoch went, she stared at every young
white woman. Was it Claudia? She looked under beach umbrellas. She
looked in car windows.
</P>
<P>
   The Kirschhochs also spent much of their time meeting with
newspaper reporters and speaking on radio talk shows. On June 27
they flew from Negril to Kingston, the country's capital, for a
news conference arranged by Sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica depends on its $1 billion-a-year tourism industry for
over half of its foreign-exchange earnings, so some people were
sensitive about news reports on missing travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The police tried to sound optimistic. Two officers at the news
conference said they had a ``95 percent feeling'' that Claudia
Kirschhoch was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour into the conference, Leo Lambert, a Sandals
spokesman, suggested to reporters that the missing woman might have
had an adventurous spirit. He said that she had admitted to
Grossinger, her fellow guest, that she smoked marijuana, went
skinny-dipping and had gone out one night with a hotel bartender.
</P>
<P>
   The statement took her parents by surprise. (Grossinger declined
to comment on Lambert's statement, because of the continuing
investigation.)
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the owner of Sandals, later removed Lambert as
spokesman in the case and called the parents to apologize. But at
the conference the Kirschhochs had to face the journalists.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter from a Jamaican newspaper asked Frederick Kirschhoch
whether his daughter had ``social problems.'' Another asked whether
she was ``loose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mary Ann and I know our daughter better than
anybody,'' Kirschhoch said. ``Those things are not like her.
They're not true. They're absolutely not true.''
</P>
<P>
   As photographers clicked away, he stood at the lectern,
seething. Just the day before, he had chewed out an editor of The
Sunday Herald over the phone. The Jamaican tabloid had run a
front-page headline saying that Claudia Kirschhoch ``broke loose''
on the island.
</P>
<P>
   That was the phrase Jamaicans used to describe how young
tourists, mostly North Americans, sometimes came here to drop out
of society. In the 1970s, Negril drew American hippies looking for
surf, spirituality and ganja. Many Jamaicans spoke of foreign women
who went into the hills to live with Rastafarians, and they
believed Kirschhoch might be among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people here have a very romantic notion that Claudia
just came over here and dropped out,'' Mary Ann Kirschhoch said one
morning on the beach. ``That's not the Claudia I know. But that
would be the best scenario for them. And for us too, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, the Kirschhochs boarded a small plane
bound for Negril. For the entire flight, they stared out the window
at the mist and undulating hills. The island looked much larger
than it did on any map, and the canopy of trees seemed dense enough
to hide a lot of things.

CRASH CLAIMS KENNY IRWIN, 30, AT NASCAR PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ For the second time in eight weeks, a pall was
cast over New Hampshire International Speedway after NASCAR Winston
Cup driver Kenny Irwin, 30, of Indianapolis, was killed Friday
morning during practice at the 1.058-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin's heavy wall impact occurred in almost the same spot where
19-year-old Adam Petty was killed May 12 during a morning practice
for a Busch Series race.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement released by Conord Hospital officials,
Irwin died from multiple injuries. Irwin, a third-year veteran of
the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, was in his first year as driver of
the No. 42 BellSouth Chevrolet Monte Carlo owned by car owner Felix
Sabates.
</P>
<P>
   After he spent his first two years with Robert Yates Racing as
driver of the No. 28 Texaco Havoline Ford Taurus, Irwin was hired
by Sabates to replace Joe Nemechek, whose only victory with Team
SABCO came last September at NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   At Sabates's request, Irwin's team withdrew from competition in
Sunday's thatlook.com 300 at NHIS and returned to its home base in
Charlotte, N.C. Team SABCO's other entry, the No. 40 Coors Light
Chevy driven by Sterling Marlin, was withdrawn from Friday's pole
qualifications but is expected to qualify Saturday and participate
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply saddened at today's passing of Kenny Irwin,''
NASCAR president Bill France said in a statement. ``On behalf of
all of us at NASCAR and the entire NASCAR community, our deepest
sympathies, all our thoughts and prayers are with Kenny's family,
friends, and everyone at Team SABCO. Kenny was a fine competitor
and will be missed very much by the entire NASCAR community.''
</P>
<P>
   Although NASCAR officials declined to elaborate on what caused
the accident, many in the garage area speculated it was the result
of a stuck throttle, which was initially thought to have been the
problem in Petty's crash. NASCAR officials, however, ruled out any
mechanical problems in that crash.
</P>
<P>
   Track rescue workers had no sooner arrived on the scene to
extricate Irwin from his upended car when crew chiefs radioed their
teams to have their throttle rods and linkage inspected and
reinspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned, but without some answers it's pretty
hard to understand what happened,'' said NASCAR Winston Cup
director Gary Nelson, who indicated Irwin's car had been impounded
and taken to an off-site facility for further inspection. ``The car
is bent and twisted so much it's hard to figure out, as we're
looking at it, what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was on his first practice lap in a new car when the
accident occurred at 11:23 a.m. Traveling at approximately 150
miles per hour, the car hit the wall entering Turn 3, rolled over
onto the driver's side and skidded along the banking before landing
on its roof in Turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report from one driver, Scott Pruett, who
witnessed the accident from the observation perch of his team's
transporter, Irwin entered the corner at a high rate of speed
before hitting the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he went to turn in and all of a sudden he went
straight,'' Pruett said. ``He didn't lift and he went straight into
the wall. It looked like as he started to turn, he had the whole
thing locked up. He hit the wall pretty hard _ not at a straight 90
(degree angle), but almost a 45. He took a pretty good shot,
climbed the wall, and came down on (the driver's) side and just
slid all the way around on his side. Once he came to stop, he came
back down on his roof.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatality was another jarring blow to the NASCAR community,
which arrived here mindful of the circumstances surrounding the
loss of Petty Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrific,'' Pruett said. ``It's devastating for the sport
and the families. Whenever somebody gets hurt in this sport, it's
horrific. When it happens at the same track and the same place, we
need to take a closer look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Andrews, crew chief of the No. 1 Pennzoil Chevrolet driven
by Steve Park, said a stuck throttle could have resulted from any
number of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be something on the floorboard, it could be from a
malfunction on the carburetor, it could be something in the air
cleaner; several things could make a throttle stick, it doesn't
matter where you are,'' Andrews said. ``It's just mind-boggling
that it would happen here in two races, at two NASCAR events in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Park, ``New Hampshire had an impeccable record in previous
years, but what many people don't realize is that we go in excess
of 150 (miles per hour) here and anything can happen. We all know
the inherent risks of our job, but as I mentioned, you just don't
think New Hampshire would be a life-taking track.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if teams had cause for concern, Andrews said, ``I think
that's a concern throughout the sport anytime that happens. Even if
you're lucky enough to get off the throttle and get the motor shut
down before you hit anything, you're still going to do some damage.
That obviously didn't happen with Kenny. He didn't have a chance to
shut anything off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Rudd, driver of the No. 28 Texaco car, had experienced a
similar problem _ but not at NHIS. Still, he said the configuration
of the Loudon track, with its long straightaways and tight corners,
left little room to react to a stuck throttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had 'em stick before and it's not like there's a whole
lot a driver can do about it,'' Rudd said. ``If you get off the
gas, you might the car settled, but it's still going wide open.
You've got to get your foot on the brake, and that's about all you
can do. But when the motor is wide open and you get on the brakes,
though, it doesn't slow you down a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Track officials did not officially release word of Irwin's death
until 2:30 p.m., when Winston Cup qualifying was scheduled to
begin. Afterward, it overshadowed the effort of Rusty Wallace, who
won the pole position in record fashion with a lap of 132.089 miles
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he managed to get through the remainder of the day,
Wallace said, ``I don't even know how to say that except that these
are days that make you really sit back and look at yourself in the
mirror and go, `Why do I do this?' ''

 PRECONVENTION DISPUTE IN PHILADELPHIA  
 CALIFORNIA BILL WOULD LIMIT CONTRIBUTIONS

<P>
   When Michigan voters consider a three-way presidential race
among George W. Bush, Al Gore and Pat Buchanan, the expected Reform
Party nominee, Bush and Gore are statistically tied, with Buchanan
coming in a very distant third, a new poll indicates. But when the
name of Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, is added, Gore
slips well behind Bush, trailed by Nader and then Buchanan. Nader
appears to draw some labor support at Gore's expense because of
differences over trade issues. In a statewide telephone poll
conducted for The Detroit Free Press by the research group
EPIC/MRA, a research group based in Lansing, Bush drew the support
of 45 percent of likely voters, Gore 40 percent and Buchanan 4
percent. When Nader was added, Bush was the choice of 46 percent of
the voters, Gore 34 percent, Nader 8 percent and Buchanan 3
percent. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.

   WORK DISPUTE IN PHILADELPHIA
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Philadelphia has agreed to try to resolve an
intensifying dispute between local unions and the network news
divisions that is threatening to disrupt preparations for the
Republican National Convention, according to several people with
knowledge of the negotiations. The fight, they said, has to do with
whether the locals have jurisdiction in network work spaces at the
First Union Center, where the convention will be held. Network
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they had their
own employees to do wiring and installation and thus had no need
for local workers. Barbara Grant, a spokeswoman for Mayor John F.
Street, said, ``The mayor was approached to try to step in and sort
things out.'' Tim Fitzpatrick, a convention spokesman, said work
had not been delayed so far.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE STATES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A CAMPAIGN SPENDING LIMIT
</P>
<P>
   The California Legislature, worried that special-interest
contributions to campaigns for state offices have gotten out of
hand, has passed a bill aimed at limiting them. Should Gov. Gray
Davis sign the bill, as he has indicated he probably will, the
proposal will be put before California voters in November. Under
the measure, individuals could give no more than $20,000 to a
candidate for governor, though political parties could still
contribute unlimited amounts. Other statewide candidates could get
up to $5,000 per election from most sources, including individuals
and businesses, and $10,000 from ``small-contributor committees'' _
groups of at least 100 people who each chip in no more than $200 a
year and donate to at least five candidates. For legislative
candidates, the limits would be $3,000 from most sources and $6,000
from small-contributor committees.

   The family renting a Tennessee home from Vice President Al Gore
is moving to Ohio _ with the help of seven volunteer movers and
officials from the Tennessee Republican Party. The moving team
arrived Friday at the home in Carthage to load two trucks with the
household goods of Charles and Tracy Mayberry and their four
children. Mayberry called Gore a ``slumlord'' last month, saying
she wanted to get his attention so that much-needed repairs would
be made. Gore promised to get the repairs done, but Mayberry
contends that nothing has happened. A Gore spokesman, Douglas
Hattaway, said all the repairs requested had in fact been made.

EXCERPTS FROM INTERVIEW WITH FORMER PRESIDENT AND MRS. BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (with BUSH-PARENTS)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine _ Following are excerpts from an interview
Friday with former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara,
about the presidential campaign of their son Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you confident your son will win?
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE BUSH. I think he'll win. Again, it's mind-boggling for
me, a former president, to think our son will be president. I think
a lot of it is that after this primary, where he took such a huge
pounding, the press had a massive love affair with John McCain _
nobody can question that, that's just objective, even from a
nonobjective guy _ but after that, there was a distorted view of
George, I think, and now . . . people are beginning to see what his
heartbeat is, what he's really like, that he's a decent person,
that he likes people, has done a good job in his state. I don't
think in the fall that the press is going to have the same love
affair with Gore that they had with John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why?
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE BUSH. Well, I think they don't like him so much.
</P>
<P>
   Q. For a good reason?
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE BUSH. Oh, I don't know about that. I'm going to leave it
to George's campaign to define Al Gore. He can identify with
people, and I think that's coming through. And also, they're going
to want change. And I believe there is a Clinton fatigue. And all
of these things will inure to George's benefit just as Gore will be
trying to have this good economy inure to his . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do you think there's Clinton fatigue?
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA BUSH. We took a vow. Can't break it. Never to speak
badly about your, your __
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE BUSH. We don't get into that because he beat me and then
it looks like a poor sport, but I did speak out once in the depths
of the Monica Lewinsky thing and said this is disgraceful. But I
think it's more than that very unhappy time period of impeachment.
I think it's change. I think I was the victim of people wanting
change: ``Eight years of Reagan, four years of Bush, we want a
change.'' And all the things that I felt strongly about never
materialized as issues. And I think the same thing is true now. I
think people kind of like change, like the idea of change from time
to time. I think that works for George's benefit. I don't think
Gore can present himself as a candidate of change. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. That honor and integrity have been lost?
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE BUSH. There's been a diminution of respect for the office
of the presidency, and it's not just here, it's abroad. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does your son know as much about foreign affairs as you did
when you were elected?
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE BUSH. No. But he knows every bit as much about it as Bill
Clinton did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. As much as Gore?
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE BUSH. Gore's had eight years of experience there. But the
way I should be judged is . . . by the kind of people I had around
me. Because I didn't know all this stuff. You know, how much
reduction you can do on atomic weapons. But Brent Snowcroft did. I
didn't know how Gorbachev was going to react when the Iraqis
invaded Kuwait, but Jimmy Baker was over there the next day. . . .
You get good people. George knows enough to do that and enough
about the world to have good judgment on his own at this point. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you were campaigning against your son, wouldn't you be
calling his tax cut too large?
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE BUSH. You won't believe this. I literally don't go into
the analysis of these issues. If you asked me, life or death,
you've got to tell me how big the tax cut is that George is
proposing, I couldn't tell you. I don't give a damn. Because I'm
out of it. I'm out of it. And I don't do television and I don't do
interviews because the minute I said I would differ with Jeb or
with George, you would have an obligation to rush down there and
say, ``Your nutty father doesn't agree with you, what do you
think?''

APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS CONTEMPT CITATIONS AGAINST WILMINGTON,
N.C., REPORTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., has overturned a
criminal contempt citation against a reporter who disclosed details
of a sealed legal settlement that were inadvertently handed over by
a court clerk.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, Kirsten B. Mitchell, was following a lawsuit
brought by residents of a trailer park in Wilmington, N.C., against
Conoco Inc., a company whose operations, they contended, were
contaminating their water supply. When, in October 1997, a court
clerk gave the reporter a group of documents, one of which was the
$36 million settlement agreement, Mitchell used the material in an
article published the next day in her newspaper, The Morning Star.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco's lawyers requested that the federal judge who originally
sealed the document, W. Earl Britt, hold Mitchell and her
colleague, Cory Reiss, who was also writing about the case and
obtained information about the settlement from other sources, in
contempt. The judge found Mitchell guilty of criminal contempt and
also found her and the paper liable for civil contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Britt also upheld a demand from Conoco that Reiss should reveal
his sources. When Reiss refused, Britt held him in contempt and
ordered him jailed _ an order stayed by the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday
overturned the conviction of Mitchell for criminal contempt of
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is simply no evidence whatsoever'' that would allow the
court ``to infer an intent to violate a court order or
confidentiality,'' the judges wrote. The ruling added that the
evidence ``all but confirms that Mitchell acted wholly innocently,
and certainly innocently insofar as the law is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also reversed the contempt finding against
Reiss. When Britt originally sealed the settlement document, the
appeals court held, he failed to follow required procedural steps
and give interested parties, like newspapers, a chance to object.
</P>
<P>
   A third contempt citation against Mitchell and The Morning Star
was voided under the same reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sasser, the lawyer for Conoco, said Friday that the
appeals ruling ``will make litigation more cumbersome and
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time a party to a lawsuit wants to provide the court with
a document that it considers confidential, whether it's a chemical
formula that's a trade secret or the name of a child in a sexual
assault case, the party must engage in a minitrial with the
media,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I do think this additional layer of litigation will
add to the delays inherent in court proceedings'' and increase
public disrespect for the courts.
</P>
<P>
   George Freeman, an assistant general counsel for the New York
Times Co., which owns the Wilmington newspaper, said Friday that
the decision ``confirms the long-held principle that the media
cannot be punished for publishing truthful, newsworthy information
which it legally obtains.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the ruling ``emphasizes that judges can't
willy-nilly seal court documents.''

FILM COMMEMORATES LUFTWAFFE'S DEVASTATION OF BASQUE TOWN IN 1937 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERBERT MITGANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUERNICA, Spain _ Strolling around the serene square of this
Basque town not far north of Bilbao, it is hard to imagine the
scene as it was 63 years ago, when an indelible atrocity occurred
on the eve of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few outward marks of physical devastation are still
visible, but the human damage remains embedded in people's minds.
</P>
<P>
   If you tap the memories of the survivors of the German bombing
during the Spanish Civil War, and listen to local officials and
historians who are trying to turn one of the symbols of fascist
militarism into a place of peace and reconciliation, the time is
always April 26, l937. That Monday _ a crowded market day when
farmers from nearby villages came to Guernica to sell and exchange
livestock and produce _ was deliberately chosen by the Luftwaffe to
inflict the greatest number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new documentary film titled ``The Bombing of Guernica: The
Mark of Men'' has been produced by a peace research center here and
is being offered to public and commercial broadcasting stations all
over the world. It includes the voices of the people who survived
the attack. (The Basques call their most sacred town Gernika;
elsewhere, it's known by its Spanish name.)
</P>
<P>
   Before the civil war, Spain's Republican government commissioned
Picasso to create a painting for its pavilion at the Paris World's
Fair. After learning of the bombing, Picasso said, ``The painting
which I am presently working on will be called `Guernica.' Through
it, I express my abhorrence of the race that has sunk Spain in an
ocean of pain and death.''
</P>
<P>
   Working steadily in 1937, Picasso laid out ``Guernica'' in a
matter of weeks, creating an apocalyptic scene of grotesque and
mutilated human and animal figures depicted in tones of black,
white and gray. The painting now hangs behind bulletproof glass in
its permanent home at the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   A permanent exhibition at the Guernica Museum in the center of
town documents the bombing with photographs and artifacts,
including bomb fragments bearing German markings. On that fateful
market day, a single fighter from the Luftwaffe's Condor Legion
circled the town, scouting the best target areas. The bells from
Santa Maria Church alerted the townspeople that an air attack might
be coming. A month before, the Condor Legion had bombed the nearby
town of Durango, a center of communications and armaments factories
behind Republican lines. The people of Guernica immediately built
several flimsy wooden shelters, protected by sandbags, around the
town center.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing began at 4:30 p.m. and continued for three hours.
Low-flying Junkers transports being used as bombers appeared over
the horizon, coming in waves, unloading thousand-pound bombs and
thousands of incendiary projectiles. The German squadrons were
protected by Italian fighter planes _ the first coordinated attack
by the forces of Hitler and Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Luftwaffe's fighter planes, machine-gunning
anything that moved. Guernica was flattened in a day; hundreds of
people died from the bombs, shrapnel and fires. Nobody knew the
exact number of casualties because the town's population had
swelled on that market day.
</P>
<P>
   On one wall of the Guernica Museum is a framed letter from
former President Roman Herzog of Germany, dated March 27, l997. It
acknowledges that the Condor Legion was responsible for the attack.
``It was an indefensible act of aerial bombardment,'' the letter
says. ``The victims of this terrible atrocity suffered human
anguish. We renounce the bombardment by the German aviators and the
horror it caused. Now we call for reconciliation and peace between
our two peoples.''
</P>
<P>
   Copies of Picasso's working drawings for ``Guernica'' are also
on display in the museum. An accompanying note says that Picasso
produced 25 sketches a month after the news of the bombing reached
Paris. An oil painting, in the spirit of ``Guernica,'' covers an
entire wall of the exhibition. This triptych by Sofia Gandarias, an
artist originally from Guernica, shows the devastation caused by
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks from the Guernica Museum, on the first floor of a
small office building in the town square, is the peace research
center named, in Basque, Gernika Gogoratuz (Guernica Remembered),
where the new documentary was created. ``The horror of that day
marks the survivors forever,'' the film's narration says in part.
``What is more, they were forced to conceal the truth about the
crime committed against them during the four decades that Gen.
Franco's dictatorship held power. Now the survivors don't want the
remembrance of this horror to fall into oblivion.''
</P>
<P>
   A slogan accompanies the film: ``Forgive, but never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Guernica Museum will become the first peace museum in
Spain, thanks to the support of the government,'' said Iratxe
Momoitio Astorkia, the museum's director.
</P>
<P>
   Above the town square is a park dedicated to peace and
reconciliation. It includes a bronze sculpture by Henry Moore
called ``Great Figure in a Shelter.'' The sculpture, installed in
1990, was commissioned by the Basque regional government and paid
for by the Madrid government. The sculpture recalls the helmet
figures that Moore, a Loyalist sympathizer, executed during the
Spanish Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is a peace monument called ``Our Father's House,'' by
Eduardo Chillida. A tall, semi-abstract structure sheathed in
concrete, it was installed in 1988 to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of a historic moment that the people of Guernica hope
will continue to inspire those who seek to end the slaughter of
innocents everywhere.

SPORTS COLUMN: SAMPRAS NOW PLAYING FOR A LEGACY
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Vladimir Voltchkov was hanging in early
against Pete Sampras on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This was a semifinal matchup and the underdog from Brooklyn by
way of Minsk, Belarus, was one of the tournament's compelling
stories: no endorsements, and forced to borrow shorts and shoes for
his extended stay at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   On a gray day, a hopeful Wimbledon crowd pulled for a mammoth
upset by Voltchkov. He gave them hope by narrowly losing the first
set in a tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   But around the third game of the second set, Voltchkov realized
that Sampras, even with a leg injury, had become a freight train
and that he, Vladimir, was standing in its way. The defending
Wimbledon champion prevailed, 7-6 (4), 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he'll grow from this experience,'' Sampras said.
``His ranking will go up. He can probably get a contract now for
some clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, John McEnroe had spoken about how unlikely it was
Sampras would play for the U.S. Davis Cup team against Spain in a
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Since being named Davis Cup captain last year, McEnroe has
pressed Sampras to play in the century-old team competition.Sampras
skipped the first round because of a different injury but did help
the Americans beat the Czechs in April.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, who has become increasingly public in his efforts to
get Sampras on the team, thinks the Californian will use his injury
as an excuse to skip the latest round.
</P>
<P>
   ``When players go out there and see Pete Sampras totally
dominate, it's aggravating to have him say he's not feeling right,
McEnroe said Thursday. ``Pete talks about it, and it's like he's
saying: `If I lose, its because of the injury. And by the way, I'm
about to be in the finals again.'''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe may not fully understand Sampras, a champion who, in
many ways, is like Tiger Woods. The worlds they choose to in live
may only be an inch wide but may run miles deep. Woods focuses only
on golf and winning; all that matters to Sampras is tennis, winning
titles and being No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even about prosperity. Sampras will go for a record
13th men's Grand Slam singles title. He wants to win it here at
Wimbledon; if not, then at the U.S. Open. If Davis Cup becomes an
obstacle, he will remove it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Sampras, the individual parts _ winning here Sunday or
at Flushing Meadows in September _ are more important than his body
of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, when you're going through the battle, you can't
think of your place in history or your legacy,'' Sampras said
Friday. ``It is the match at hand. That's the attitude you have to
have. You can't put that much pressure on yourself, looking at
breaking records. You wake up Sunday morning prepare for your
final. You know, when you're competing, you're in kind of your own
little world. You're not thinking about history
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, McEnroe explained why he was so passionate
about Davis Cup; how from the time he was a kid growing up in
Queens, Davis Cup tennis symbolized a love of game and country. How
can anyone not be serious about Davis Cup?
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, who last won Wimbledon in 1984, is 41, Sampras will
turn 29 in August. They are champions of different generations.
What they have in common is tennis _ and an exceptionally good life
gained through tennis. Presumably each wants to give back to the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Is playing Davis Cup somehow tied into giving back to the game?
``I don't know,'' McEnroe answered. ``That's a good question: I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Until he comes up with an answer, Davis Cup will remain for most
Americans little more than a curious artifact in search of a rhyme
or reason. Sampras has been in Davis Cup before _ giving his all,
playing hurt, winning the trophy _ only to feel like the soldier
who comes home from war and nobody cares.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe's challenge is to convert the passion and fire he has
for the event into a broader vision that accommodates interests _
as diverse as the game of tennis is rapidly becoming. Diverse as
29-year-old Pete Sampras to 19-year-old Venus Williams to
22-year-old Vladimir Voltchkov.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have to talk with young players the way Arthur Ashe, as
Davis Cup captain, talked to a young McEnroe _ about conduct and
civility.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe can't understand how players don't feel passionate about
Davis Cup; Arthur, refined and dignified, couldn't understand why
McEnroe behaved as he did.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Sampras doesn't get the Davis Cup. He gets Wimbledon.
He gets the U.S. Open.

FRANCE AND U.S. TOLERATED GENOCIDE IN RWANDA, NEW REPORT CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to recast lede, to clarify the roles of Rwanda and others in
the 2nd and 3rd grafs, and for overall restructuring.)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States and other nations that failed
to prevent or stop the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 should pay a
``significant level of reparations,'' an independent panel said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member international panel, assembled by the
Organization of African Unity, also singled out France and Belgium
as well as the United Nations and the Roman Catholic and Anglican
Churches as those most guilty of not doing enough to prevent or
stop the atrocities that killed up to 800,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The group acknowledged that Rwanda's Hutu-led government was
behind the killings, in which Hutu militias rampaged through the
country, massacring ethnic Tutsi and moderate or antigovernment
Hutu who defended them, but it added that ``external forces'' had
also had a responsibility for what has happened to Rwanda in a
century of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The panel asked Secretary General Kofi Annan to establish a
commission to formally identify the countries that owe Rwanda the
money to rebuild the devastated country, and to set an appropriate
scale of compensation. It also demanded that Rwanda's international
debts be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, ``Rwanda: The Preventable Genocide,'' the panel
said that the events of 1994 cannot be forgotten, and that Rwanda
should no more be assigned to ``ancient history'' than the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   It also noted that the long-term effects of those weeks of
horrific violence and brutality continue to be felt throughout the
region, especially in Congo. ``The 1994 genocide in one small
country ultimately triggered a conflict in the heart of Africa that
has directly or indirectly touched at least one-third of all the
nations on the continent,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report reviews the same issues and reaches many of the same
conclusions as another independent experts' study commissioned by
the secretary general. But it also takes a deeper look at the roots
of the ethnic conflict in Rwanda, beginning with 60 years of
colonial rule, first by Germany and then Belgium, when ethnic
divisions were exacerbated if not manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   It is also far harsher in its criticism of Security Council
members, especially France and the United States, saying France
could have prevented the genocide and the United States could have
stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there would have been no genocide if certain
Rwandans had not organized and carried it out; there is no denying
that fundamental truth,'' the report said. ``But it is equally true
that throughout the past century external forces have helped shape
Rwanda's destiny and that of its neighbors.'' The report does not
absolve the current Tutsi-led government in Rwanda of sometimes
failing to meet challenges it inherited, despite the ``resilience
and vigor'' shown by the survivors now rebuilding the country and
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandans still confront human rights abuses under the Tutsi-led
government formed from the Rwanda Patriotic Front, which seized
power in the summer of 1994. The country, struggling with refugee
resettlement, is still at war in Congo, where ethnic Hutu militias
remain a menace, the Rwandan government says.
</P>
<P>
   Those militias instigated the genocide in April 1994, after
President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was killed in a plane crash
in Kigali that was possibly caused by a missile attack. The report
characterizes the four-year period leading up to the outbreak of
violence as ``the triumph of ethnic radicalism'' among the majority
Hutu population that set the scene for the nightmare that followed.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the report said, France had ``unrivaled influence
at the very highest levels'' of the Hutu-led government in Rwanda
and chose not to exercise it to derail well-laid plans for the
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, Ambassador Stephen Lewis, a
Canadian member of the Organization of African Unity panel and a
former deputy executive director of UNICEF, said that the new
report chose to focus more heavily on the role of the Security
Council, especially France and the United States, than the report
prepared for Annan last year. Lewis said that French behavior was
particularly indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We repudiate the position of the government of France, the
position that asserts they had no responsibility,'' he said. ``They
were closer in every way to the Habyarimana regime than any other
government. They could have stopped the genocide before it began.
They knew exactly what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he said, the French peacekeeping mission eventually sent
to the region allowed a huge number of Hutu attackers to flee the
country to neighboring Congo, then known as Zaire, ``thereby
ushering in the larger Great Lakes catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost no redemptive feature to the conduct of the
government of France,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the United States, which blocked the Security Council
from sending peacekeepers to Rwanda once the massacres had begun,
Lewis said the American role was ``an almost incomprehensible scar
of shame on American foreign policy.'' Speaking personally, he
said, ``I don't know how Madeleine Albright lives with it.''
Albright, now secretary of state, was then the U.S. representative
at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, on a subsequent visit to Africa, apologized
to Rwanda for the lack of international response, as has Belgium,
the former colonial power. France has never expressed remorse or
accepted blame.
</P>
<P>
   The report was very critical of the Roman Catholic Church. ``We
were shocked by the role of the church,'' Lewis said Friday.
Although priests and lay Catholics were among those who tried to
save Tutsi, there were other church officials who did not; some
helped lure Tutsi to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   There were ``leaders of the church who did not speak out
strongly and take stands,'' Lewis said. ``Since Rwanda is a very
Catholic country, we felt we had to say something.''
</P>
<P>
   Anglican Church authorities have apologized for ignoring human
rights abuses or for acts that encouraged Hutu death squads. The
Roman Catholic Church has not, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lewis, who introduced the report here Friday, the
panel consisted of Ketumile Masire, a former president of Botswana
and the panel leader; Amadou Toumani Toure, former president of
Mali; Lisbet Palme, a Swedish child psychologist and expert on the
U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child; Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf,
former finance minister of Liberia; P.N. Bhagwati, former chief
justice of India's Supreme Court; and Hocine Djoudi, an Algerian
judge and diplomat.

HENNINGER HAS NO MERCY FOR A VULNERABLE COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEMONT, Ill. _ With the course there for the taking, Brian
Henninger took full advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Both Henninger and Stephen Ames tied the course record Friday at
Cog Hill Golf and Country Club, shooting nine-under-par 63's that
continued a two-day birdie barrage at the Western Open.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, this is one of the more challenging stops on the PGA
Tour, but with lower rough and soft greens this year, players are
salivating as they reach the first tee.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Nick Price shot 63 to take the first-round lead.
Friday, it was Henninger's turn. He shot 33 on the front nine and
followed it with an eye-opening 30 that propelled him to the top of
the leader board. Meanwhile, Ames also shot his 63 in the morning,
moving him into second place, and setting up an interesting
weekend, with Tiger Woods lurking six strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming for his third career tour victory, Henninger was at
11-under par at 133 over all, a stroke ahead of Franklin Langham
and two strokes ahead of five players who were tied at nine-under
par _ Ames, Price, Fred Couples, Stuart Appleby and Steve Flesch.
Woods was in the mix at five-under par after shooting a 69 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a challenge for Henninger, a 37-year-old tour
veteran, to hold off proven winners like Couples, Price, Woods and
Appleby. But Henninger is not seeking to end a long drought. He won
last year's Southern Farm Bureau Classic.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that the weekend would be a test, he also
said he was looking forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I continue to hit it good, I'm going to have a great
tournament,'' said Henninger, who is 121st on this year's money
list. ``It's tough, because you've got some world-class players up
there _ Nick, Tiger, Fred. Everybody has the talent to win out
here, but it's usually somebody that has experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a world-class golfer, but they're the elite.
But this feels good. This feels great. I've been out here long
enough. I know I can play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   After making four birdies and a bogey on the front nine,
Henninger found a zone on the back with consecutive birdies on Nos.
11, 12 and 13, followed by an eagle at the par-5, 519-yard 15th.
The eagle was set up by an impressive second shot, a 3-iron from
211 yards that landed 6 feet from the pin. Call that adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can not usually hit a 3-iron that far, but I jacked this one
up big time,'' he said. ``It just exploded off the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Henninger followed that by making a 10-foot birdie putt at No.
16, and he could have set the course record if he had not missed an
8-foot birdie attempt at No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Henninger will start Saturday holding the lead,
while Woods will play catch-up. Friday's round was similar to
Thursday's opening round for Woods. He hit the ball well, but he
missed putts. Few people were counting out the world's No. 1
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm making my normal amount of putts, I'm right there next
to the lead,'' Woods said before heading to the putting green to
practice before dark. ``If I can get a few putts to go down early,
hopefully I can ride the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Price, who started the day with a three-stroke lead, could
manage only a 72 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The wind was not much of a factor, but Ames teed off in the
morning, when conditions were nearly perfect for scoring. It was a
lot different than the conditions Ames faced early in his career,
when he played on the European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play in Europe, you're playing adverse weather
conditions,'' said Ames, a 36-year-old native of Trinidad and
Tobago who lives in Canada. ``I think you have to be mentally tough
to play in those kind of conditions, week in and week out. Here,
this is paradise. Every shot I hit today came off the way I picture
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for a hotly contested weekend on a course
where low scores can be had. Henninger has the lead. To keep it, he
will have to remain aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tour's getting so strong, you have to force yourself to
continue,'' he said. ``You can't slow down out there.''

   CHINA BACKS LINUX SYSTEM OVER MICROSOFT'S WINDOWS
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders are concerned that the country is growing overly
dependent on Microsoft's Windows operating system, which controls
computers running everything from banks to President Jiang Zemin's
e-mail box.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese government, itself a master at monopoly, is
taking its case against Microsoft not to the courtroom but to the
marketplace, albeit with a bit of administrative fiat. It is
backing the Linux operating system, which was created by a Finnish
university student in 1991 and is distributed free to anyone who
wants it.

   FTC SET TO CHALLENGE HEINZ DEAL
</P>
<P>
   H.J. Heinz's proposed $185 million purchase of the closely held
Milnot Holdings, maker of Beech-Nut baby foods, was challenged by
antitrust enforcers who said the transaction would hurt
competition. The Federal Trade Commission voted 3-2 to challenge in
court the combination of Heinz with Beech-Nut, the No. 2 U.S.
baby-food producer. The FTC said the combination would mean that
just two companies, Heinz and Gerber, a unit of Novartis, would
control 98 percent of the U.S. market for prepared baby foods.
Shares of Heinz rose 31.25 cents, to $45.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

   LESSONS FROM NEVADA FOR CONGRESS
</P>
<P>
   Nevada has adopted a prescription-drug program for the elderly
very similar to one approved last month by the House of
Representatives, but the program is off to a rocky start. Insurance
companies have spurned Nevada's invitation to provide coverage.
Nevada's experience offers ominous lessons for Congress, especially
Republicans, who want to subsidize insurance companies to entice
them into providing drug benefits to elderly and disabled people on
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD BANK REPRESENTATIVE CLEARED
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank said this week that an eight-month investigation
found no evidence to support accusations that a former Russian
representative at the World Bank passed confidential information to
a Russian commercial bank in 1993. The bank did conclude that the
representative, Leonid Grigoriev, had established a business
relationship with the now defunct Inkombank, and that he received
$13,000 for out-of-pocket expenses from the bank in 1993.

   STUDENTS LEARN ART OF NEGOTIATING
</P>
<P>
   A group of some 50 students from two dozen countries
participated in the second Model WTO 2000 _ an idea that the World
Trade Organization hopes to export to universities worldwide. The
students, sequestered in a conference room in the WTO's building
with spectacular views of Lake Geneva, concentrated on long and
tough negotiations on the most sensitive trade issues, oblivious to
the sunny weather outside. The mock negotiators were able to spend
some time with the trade group's director general, Mike Moore, who
told them they were lucky that they did not have to ``go home and
sell'' their trade proposals to their parliaments.
</P>
<P>
   A CONTEMPT RULING IS OVERTURNED
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., has overturned a U.S.
district judge's criminal-contempt citation against a reporter who
printed details of a sealed legal settlement after documents
describing the agreement were inadvertently handed to her by a
court clerk. The judges found that there was no evidence that
Kirsten B. Mitchell, a reporter for The Morning Star in Wilmington,
N.C., intended ``to violate a court order or confidentiality,'' and
that she acted ``wholly innocently.''

   EX-GM OFFICIAL TO FIGHT EXTRADITION

indicted Lopez in May on six criminal counts related to accusations
that he stole company secrets from GM when he went to work for a

<P>
   NEGRIL, Jamaica _ In the dying light, the prayers for the
missing woman poured out of the hilltop church near Montego Bay,
two hours' drive from this beach resort town.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick and Mary Ann Kirschhoch stood up beneath whirring
fans. The Moravian congregation was asking God for the safe return
of the couple's daughter, Claudia, 29, a travel editor for
Frommer's who vanished from Negril around May 27.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Kirschhoch had grown up with the Moravian church in
New York. He knew the hymns by heart. But the Jamaicans sang with
an intensity that sounded almost otherworldly to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an outpouring of warmth and comfort and empathy
that was overwhelming,'' Kirschhoch said. ``It's something we'll
never forget, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   There are few things about Jamaica that these parents from
Morristown, N.J., will be able to erase from their memories. This
was their second visit in three weeks to help in the search for
their daughter, a resident of New York.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to the lush, mountainous island on June 22, even
though investigations by the police, the FBI and a private
detective were coming up empty. (The detective had been hired by
Gordon Stewart, the owner of the resort where Claudia Kirschhoch
had been staying, and the FBI had sent agents at the request of the
Jamaican police.)
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, newspapers, radio stations and television
programs have been running reports on the disappearance every few
days. Several days before the Kirschhochs arrived, they increased
their reward offer for information leading to their daughter's
whereabouts, to $25,000 from $6,200; the new amount is about 10
times the average annual income in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, four days after the Kirschhochs returned home,
Stewart added another $25,000 to the pot. The parents plan to fly
back to Jamaica on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like this in Jamaica,'' said Daniel
Grizzle, chairman of the resort board at the Negril Chamber of
Commerce. ``There's never been a search of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Kirschhoch arrived in Jamaica on May 24 and stayed at
Beaches Negril, part of a 15-hotel Caribbean chain run by Sandals
Resorts International, after a trip to Cuba sponsored by Sandals
was canceled. She was last seen by Tania Grossinger, a freelance
travel writer from New York, at breakfast on May 27.
</P>
<P>
   When she did not fly back to New York on June 1 as scheduled,
her parents called the hotel. In her room, hotel staff found
clothes, luggage, her passport, and a wallet with cash and credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   The parents said the only things missing were a blue-striped
bathing suit, sunglasses, a portable radio and possibly a notepad.
Helicopter and boat searches turned up nothing. The local police
said they had no leads.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 people have been reported missing in Jamaica so
far this year, the police said. Most were local teen-agers who had
run away from home, only to turn up after a few days. Despite being
pressed by reporters, police officials said they had no statistics
on how many foreign visitors were reported missing, but insisted
that the number was low.

<P>
   The Kirschhochs were methodical in their search. Frederick
Kirschhoch, 57, a part-time engineer, approached the task the same
way he does when finishing buildings: making a checklist, going
through the details, marking off the loose ends one by one.
</P>
<P>
   The Kirschhochs were staying at another Sandals resort in Negril
in a room paid for by Stewart, owner of the Sandals chain. The
resort was loud, with partying couples, swim-up bars and blaring
reggae, not the kind of place where they would have chosen to spend
time.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no vacation, and when Frederick Kirschhoch walked
into their room, he opened the tourist brochure and tried to think
like his daughter. Where would I go? Whom would I speak with? He
considered her an experienced traveler. She had visited Italy and
the Canary Islands, and she had lived for seven months in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that nobody knows anything,'' her father said.
The Kirschhochs came here because they believed they could describe
their daughter to Jamaicans in a way that only parents could. Or
maybe people who had information would be more forthcoming with
them than with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Kirschhoch, 60, a retirement account manager at
Honeywell, carried a notebook in which she meticulously recorded
their findings. She scribbled questions they wanted to ask hotel
workers and other people who had seen their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Jones was one of those. The young man worked as a
lifeguard on a beach that Claudia Kirschhoch might have visited.
After her parents tracked him down, he pointed to a far-off spot
next to a trash bin where he thought he had seen their daughter a
month before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a black lady, a local lady, talking to her,'' he
said. ``She told the lady she wanted to go to Westmoreland, maybe
to the Black River area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you be sure it was her?'' Frederick Kirschhoch asked. His
wife held up a flier with two photographs of their daughter and a
description: 5 feet 2 inches tall, slim build, long dark brown
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Jones stared ahead, pondering.
</P>
<P>
   ``How tall was she?'' Kirschhoch asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 5-6.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you remember what day it was?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, mon, I can't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of their mornings, they walked the seven-mile white-sand
beach and passed out fliers. They believed this did some good. They
could not follow up on each of the 377 telephone tips the police
had received.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people whom the Kirschhochs met on the beach held
their hands and told them how much they felt for them. But after
the parents walked away, some people said that the American woman
must be dead, or had somehow made her way to Cuba, and that if the
search turned up anything, it would be something horrible.
``Somebody must have kidnapped her,'' said Carmen Purchase, a baby
sitter. ``Because she's gone so long, then maybe she's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   At night the Kirschhochs went to the half-dozen or so reggae
clubs in town. Their daughter liked reggae, and maybe someone had
seen her.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Mary Ann Kirschhoch went, she stared at every young
white woman. Was it Claudia? She looked under beach umbrellas. She
looked in car windows.
</P>
<P>
   The Kirschhochs also spent much of their time meeting with
newspaper reporters and speaking on radio talk shows. On June 27
they flew from Negril to Kingston, the country's capital, for a
news conference arranged by Sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica depends on its $1 billion-a-year tourism industry for
over half of its foreign-exchange earnings, so some people were
sensitive about news reports on missing travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The police tried to sound optimistic. Two officers at the news
conference said they had a ``95 percent feeling'' that Claudia
Kirschhoch was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour into the conference, Leo Lambert, a Sandals
spokesman, suggested to reporters that the missing woman might have
had an adventurous spirit. He said that she had admitted to
Grossinger, her fellow guest, that she smoked marijuana, went
skinny-dipping and had gone out one night with a hotel bartender.
</P>
<P>
   The statement took her parents by surprise. (Grossinger declined
to comment on Lambert's statement, because of the continuing
investigation.)
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the owner of Sandals, later removed Lambert as
spokesman in the case and called the parents to apologize. But at
the conference the Kirschhochs had to face the journalists.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter from a Jamaican newspaper asked Frederick Kirschhoch
whether his daughter had ``social problems.'' Another asked whether
she was ``loose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mary Ann and I know our daughter better than
anybody,'' Kirschhoch said. ``Those things are not like her.
They're not true. They're absolutely not true.''
</P>
<P>
   As photographers clicked away, he stood at the lectern,
seething. Just the day before, he had chewed out an editor of The
Sunday Herald over the phone. The Jamaican tabloid had run a
front-page headline saying that Claudia Kirschhoch ``broke loose''
on the island.
</P>
<P>
   That was the phrase Jamaicans used to describe how young
tourists, mostly North Americans, sometimes came here to drop out
of society. In the 1970s, Negril drew American hippies looking for
surf, spirituality and ganja. Many Jamaicans spoke of foreign women
who went into the hills to live with Rastafarians, and they
believed Kirschhoch might be among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people here have a very romantic notion that Claudia
just came over here and dropped out,'' Mary Ann Kirschhoch said one
morning on the beach. ``That's not the Claudia I know. But that
would be the best scenario for them. And for us too, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, the Kirschhochs boarded a small plane
bound for Negril. For the entire flight, they stared out the window
at the mist and undulating hills. The island looked much larger
than it did on any map, and the canopy of trees seemed dense enough
to hide a lot of things.

TEST OF PROPOSED U.S. ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEM IS BEING WATCHED AROUND
THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 8th graf with test being delayed)  
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Protesters took to the seas, scientists voiced
their doubts and Pentagon planners monitored weather patterns
Friday as the United States prepared for a high-altitude test that
is expected to determine whether President Clinton approves a plan
to build a shield of missiles aimed at protecting U.S. soil from
enemy attack.
</P>
<P>
   The test lasts only thirty minutes; it costs $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The test Friday night is being watched around the world. Not
since 1983, when President Reagan envisioned a defense based in
space that would render nuclear weapons obsolete, has an issue of
military technology seized the imagination of U.S. policy-makers
and politicians and alarmed America's friends and foes.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has also entered the presidential campaign, with Vice
President Al Gore endorsing a limited version of the plan and Gov.
George W. Bush backing a more ambitious plan that could be deployed
in space.
</P>
<P>
   And it has raised a chorus of criticism from a sizable swath of
scientists in the United States, some of whom argue that the
proposed $60 billion system is not feasible and that the tests are
rigged.
</P>
<P>
   The test calls for sending a 37-year-old remodeled Minuteman
missile containing a mock warhead and a decoy balloon thundering
aloft over the Pacific from a tightly-guarded launch pad at
Vandenberg Air Force Base, 125 miles north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, a 54-inch, 130-pound ``exoatmospheric kill
vehicle'' was to launch from Kwajalein Atoll about 4,300 miles away
in the Pacific and to guide itself to a collision with the incoming
mock warhead in midflight. If the kill vehicle destroys the mock
warhead, the sky will be filled with a blinding flash.
</P>
<P>
   The test was scheduled to take place during a four-hour window
that began late Friday night. But a last-minute technical problem
set back the launching by at least two hours. Pentagon spokesmen
said engineers hoped to fix the problem quickly; it was related to
electronic signals that keep the ground control informed about the
missile's flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting a bullet with a bullet,'' is the way one Pentagon
official described the hoped-for collision. ``Steel on target,''
said another.
</P>
<P>
   The test follows two previous tests attempts to intercept a
target, part of a series of nineteen planned tests.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Pentagon hailed its first intercept test as a
complete success, but later acknowledged that the kill vehicle
initially had drifted off course and picked out the large bright
decoy balloon instead of the mock warhead.
</P>
<P>
   In the next and more complicated test in January, the kill
vehicle missed the mock warhead by between 300 to 400 feet after a
cooling line clogged and shut its heat-seeking sensors. ``There was
an ice cube in one of the lines,'' a Pentagon official explained.
``We fixed that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the last test, this time a communications system has been
added that transmits information directly to the kill vehicle about
the location of the target after it has lifted off. Called a
global-positioning-system transmitter, it uses the same technology
that helps motorists from getting lost.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that the new test is a misleading guide because it
is taking place under conditions that do not reflect a real attack.
They say that the decoy is not a true decoy, but is more like a
lure that attracts the kill vehicle to the real target, and that an
adversary would use many decoys, not one. About two weeks after the
test, Secretary of Defense William Cohen is to give Clinton a
formal recommendation of whether it is feasible to build the
system. Even if the test is a failure, he may recommend that the
plan proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to decide this fall whether to push the
United States down the road to a national missile defense system by
starting construction of a radar in the Aleutian Islands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Administration lawyers have advised Clinton that, in their view,
he could begin building this first phase of the missile defense
without violating the 1972 AntiBallistic Missile Treaty with
Russia, one of the cornerstones of arms control agreements between
Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has been hit by a storm of criticism from
prominent scientists, arms control experts, former officials and
the General Accounting Office over the cost, technology and effect
on relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Korb of the Council on Foreign Relations called the
entire system a ``shield of dreams'' whose supporters believe that
``if you build it, it will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even within the administration, a debate is raging among
intelligence and Pentagon officials and policy analysts over the
nature and extent of the potential threat from countries like North
Korea, Iran and Iraq that is the official justification for
building a missile shield. Some senior Pentagon officials have
warned that the administration's schedule is much too accelerated
and therefore risky, because testing would continue even as
construction has begun.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to stop the test, Greenpeace, the anti-nuclear
organization, said that a small team of missile defense opponents
entered the grounds of Vandenberg Air Force Base on foot. Equipped
with survival gear and supplies for several days, they intended to
stay inside the area as long as they could, according to a
Greenpeace statement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Dutch vessel Arctic Sunrise threatened to enter
one of the hazard zones designated by the Pentagon in the shores
off Vandenberg.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified man was caught entering the base, but base
spokesman John Cherry said that there was no evidence of intruders
in the heavily-guarded area around the launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing in Washington, a group of business leaders
and scientists weighed in with eleventh-hour criticism of both the
test and the entire plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop this insensate and tortuously rationalized arms race that
drains money away from our vital civilian programs,'' said Alan
Kligerman, the chief executive officer of Akpharma Inc., and a
board member of Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, which
seeks to cut military spending. He added, ``If I would represent my
products and sell them with the same shortcomings in the products
as regard to what they are supposed to do, I would be indicted. My
products would be seized'' by the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Blair, president of the Center for Defense Information,
argued at the same briefing that the development of a national
missile defense is justifiably seen by Russia as a threat to its
nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia today can barely cope with U.S. offensive power, let
alone a combination of offense and defense, a one-two punch that
could deliver the knockout blow to their strategic forces,'' Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China are adamantly opposed to aU.S. missile defense
because they consider it a threat to their ability to defend
themselves. European countries are also distressed that the United
States would take such a position without regard to Europe's
security.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the supervising judge in Bronx Family Court, Judge
Clark V. Richardson spends most days presiding over one arduous
decision after another _ when to sever a mother's legal ties to her
child, when to throw a teen-age troublemaker behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   But these days there is a particularly vexing category of cases
on his docket: Richardson handles all of the cases in the Bronx
when the city's child welfare agency has removed children from
their homes because, in essence, one of their parents has been the
victim of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The city can take children into foster care if a parent is
believed to ``engage in acts of domestic violence.'' Its authority
to do so was strengthened by a 1998 state court ruling that
declared incidents of domestic violence in the presence of a child
to be sufficient grounds for a finding of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, Richardson said, that usually means that a mother
who is a victim of abuse can be accused of failing to protect her
children from danger. Often, she may have done nothing wrong or
negligent, but simply lacked the financial or emotional resources
to leave an abusive partner.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, it falls to Richardson, and other Family Court
judges across the state, to decide whether those mothers get their
children back, and under what terms. After all, he and other child
welfare experts acknowledge, abusive parents can frequently be
players in the most tragic cases of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   And so for Richardson, who deals daily with disputes of law and
love, violence and poverty, these cases present an especially
daunting exercise in balancing interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is difficult is that you're victimizing them twice,'' he
said of the mothers. ``On the other hand, you have the notion of
protecting the children. And they are not necessarily consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He cited two recent examples: in both, the city had taken
custody of children after a violent fight between their parents.
And in both, the women implored him to send their children back
home.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, a woman with a black eye stood before him,
claiming to have hurt herself by banging into a refrigerator. Her
husband sounded belligerent. Their 13-year-old daughter insisted
she had never witnessed any domestic violence at home. The judge
suspected she had been coached.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, a woman appeared alone, her arms pocked with
bruises, her face glazed by weariness. She told the judge of being
terrified of her husband. She agreed to move, to take her children
someplace where he would never find them. For the judge, the
questions were plain, if painfully hard to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Is it fair to punish an abused woman by taking her children
away? Is it wise to return children to a parent who has been unable
to shield them from the danger of an abusive partner?
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the judge, who under a pilot program sees all
such cases in the Bronx, ultimately allowed the children to return
home, but only after being assured that the women would make use of
counseling and other support services, he said. In the first case,
he waited even longer, until the couple acknowledged that there had
been a problem with violence in the home.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, such cases reflect an unintended consequence of
new and arguably enlightened perspectives on domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   It is now widely acknowledged that watching adults fight at home
_ and especially witnessing a parent being beaten _ can scar
children forever. Moreover, domestic violence can sometimes be part
of a package of dysfunction at home, a red flag for egregious forms
of child abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there's a close correlation between domestic violence
and child abuse,'' said Nicholas Scoppetta, commissioner of the
Administration for Children's Services, in an interview. ``Very
often where there's physical abuse of children, there's also
domestic violence in the home, in particular, when there's an
unrelated male in the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, Scoppetta said, caseworkers routinely inquire into
domestic violence. The fact that one parent is abused, he asserted,
should not be the sole reason to remove their children, but if the
victim resists taking the steps necessary to protect the children _
by failing to keep the batterer away, for instance, or refusing to
move to a safe place _ the children should be removed for their
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials said they did not keep figures on how many
children were removed principally because of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a judgment call on the part of caseworkers,'' Scoppetta
said. ``I would hope they would make that call only when there's
evidence that the child is in imminent danger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we always get it right?'' he asked. ``I suspect it doesn't
always happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women's advocates contend that the agency often does not
get it right. They have recently filed a class-action lawsuit
claiming that the city violates the due process of rights of
parents who have been victims of domestic violence by removing
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of punishing the perpetrator, these advocates say, an
overzealous application of the law ends up punishing the victim.
That fear can keep victims of domestic violence from taking action
against their batterers, they say. And just as it can hurt children
to watch a parent being abused, they add, it can also hurt them to
be suddenly taken from that parent's care.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   They offer the example of women like Sharlene Tillett, who was
accused of exposing her child to domestic violence even though the
child had not yet been born. Tillett, 29, was pregnant with her
second child last year when the baby's father, her ex-boyfriend,
from whom she had already separated, came to her apartment one
night and, in a bout of anger, began pummeling her.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time he had assaulted her, she said, but it
would be the last. She had decided, she said, to move to
California, where she had family, after the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans unraveled the day she gave birth to a healthy baby
boy, whom she named Uganda. When a social worker at Jamaica
Hospital Medical Center asked about domestic violence as part of a
routine questionnaire, Tillett said, she answered candidly.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, in a move that she soon realized was a grave
mistake, she agreed to let the baby's father, Jamie Gray, take them
home from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   City records indicate that the social worker filed a complaint
to the state central register on child abuse and neglect. The next
day, child welfare caseworkers, accompanied by police officers,
carried away her 2-day-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Tillett was charged with child neglect. ``The respondents engage
in acts of domestic violence in the present of the subject child,''
the caseworker's report said.
</P>
<P>
   Tillett was also charged with not having a crib for the baby. It
did not help, she said, when she explained she was planning to move
to California. She had a plane ticket in hand, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It took Tillett seven weeks to get Uganda back, as well as 19
weeks of court-ordered workshops for domestic violence victims, 10
hours of classes on being a good parent and counseling once a week.
She now lives in a homeless shelter for battered women. The city
child welfare agency is continuing to monitor her case.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tillett, Sharwline Nicholson said she was wholly unprepared
for the arrival of the child welfare agency in her life. She, too,
had separated from the father of her second child. He had never
been violent until one wintry afternoon last year, when in an
apparent fit of jealousy, she said, he went to her Brooklyn
apartment unexpectedly, hurled whatever was in sight, and kicked
and hit her so severely that her arm was broken. The baby,
Destinee, was sleeping in another room; her 6-year-old son,
Kendell, was in school.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-boyfriend, Claude Barnett, fled. When the police and
paramedics arrived, Nicholson said, she asked a neighbor who
frequently watched her children to baby-sit until her cousin could
pick them up later that day. Knowing her children would be safe,
she said, she slept peacefully at Kings County Hospital that night.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, a child welfare caseworker called the
hospital. ``They said they had possession of my kids,'' Nicholson
recalled. ``I was devastated. I've always heard the worst when they
get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The city charged her and Barnett with child neglect. Barnett,
the court papers added, had hit the little boy in the mouth once
before. ACS officials also said Nicholson had not showed up in
court and had refused to move to a new apartment.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Nicholson denies that Barnett had hit Kendell. She
admits she missed one court appointment, citing a severe snowstorm.
And she calls the child neglect charges ``ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I called 911 I was bleeding so badly I knew I needed
medical attention,'' Nicholson, 31, a store cashier and part-time
student at Mercy College, said the other day. ``I didn't know I'd
end up down that road, that calling for help would escalate and I'd
end up losing my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   A Family Court judge in Brooklyn returned her children in a
week, while the child welfare agency continued to monitor her case.
Her case has since been closed, but Nicholson's outrage at the
child welfare agency remains.
</P>
<P>
   She is the lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit filed in
April against the agency, claiming that her due process rights were
violated. Carolyn A. Kubitschek, the lawyer who filed the suit,
said she did so to compel the city to better train its caseworkers,
so that children would not be removed just because a parent had
been abused.
</P>
<P>
   By everyone's admission, deciding when a child is safe with a
parent can be a nuanced, difficult question. The circumstances of
each family are different, as are the highly subjective approaches
of judges.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, the pilot project placing all such cases under one
judge was driven by the theory that doing so would bring a greater
uniformity to how those decisions are made.
</P>
<P>
   In the vast majority of the 35 to 40 cases that Richardson has
handled in the last six months, the city had removed the children.
And, in the vast majority of cases, he reversed the city's decision
and sent the children back home. When a parent has agreed to take
all the prescribed precautions, he said, it is unnecessarily harsh
to keep their children in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the worst thing to do at that point is to remove their
children,'' he said. ``Then that person has absolutely nothing,
nothing to hope for.''

FOUR TOP 3-YEAR-OLDS FACE OFF IN THE DWYER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ It will be one of the smallest fields of the
year, but also one of the most distinguished, and it will take the
stage Sunday at Belmont Park: Four colts will open the second half
of the racing season in the Dwyer, a race that will propel one
along the path toward the 3-year-old championship.
</P>
<P>
   In the 83 years the Dwyer has been run, it has been won by such
stars as Man O'War, Gallant Fox, Native Dancer, Nashua, Damascus,
Behrens and Coronado's Quest. This year's cast is loaded with star
quality.
</P>
<P>
   At the draw for post position Friday, the rail was won by Red
Bullet, winner of the Preakness; the No. 2 slot by Commendable,
winner of the Belmont Stakes; the No. 3 slot by More Than Ready,
fourth in the Kentucky Derby, and the outside gate by Albert the
Great, the swift rookie opening the second half of the season with
the aim of overtaking the veterans of the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've got the best 3-year-old,'' said Joe Orseno, who
trains Red Bullet. ``And he's going to prove it this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Zito, the trainer of Albert the Great, took the second-half
perspective.``People get caught up with horses who win the
classics,'' he said. ``There is still a long way to go and many
races to be run before championships are decided.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dwyer is the first major race of the second half, the
doorway to the Haskell at Monmouth, the Jim Dandy and the Travers
at Saratoga, the Woodward at Belmont and the Breeders' Cup Classic
at Churchill Downs in November. It takes horses a mile and
one-sixteenth for a purse of $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet runs with one distinction that none of the others
hold. In the Preakness, he outran Fusaichi Pegasus, who won the
Kentucky Derby and was presumed to be the star of the year. Red
Bullet has not run since the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent workouts, he has blazed away, speeding four
furlongs in 49 2/5 seconds and five furlongs in 59 2/5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect this race to be as tough as it came up,''
Orseno said. ``But we've had it marked on our schedule for some
time. He's fresh and has grown physically since the Preakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Orseno concedes that he is worried that a colt as fast as More
Than Ready might get the jump on his horse turning for home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Bullet is at his best when he settles and comes with one
run,'' he said. ``There is a possibility that More Than Ready can
shake loose.''
</P>
<P>
   More Than Ready looked like a speed demon last year when he won
his first four races. But his trainer, Todd Pletcher, decided to
skip the Breeders' Cup Juvenile after the colt lost the Futurity
and the Champagne. His patience was rewarded this year when More
Than Ready won the Hutcheson in a dead heat, ran second in the
Louisiana Derby and the Blue Grass, and ran a good fourth in the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Commendable, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, ran 17th in the Derby,
skipped the Preakness, but then won the Belmont in a major upset.
He has not raced since, and his handlers are still looking for some
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he deserves some credit for the Belmont win,'' said
Mike Marlow, the assistant to Lukas in New York. ``But the Dwyer is
going to be a new ball game.''

MRS. CLINTON URGES TAX CREDITS TO SPUR JOB GROWTH UPSTATE
</HEADLINE>
  By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORNING, N.Y. _ On Friday, Democratic candidate for Senate
Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed tax credits to stimulate job growth
among small businesses in the upstate region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks came on the second day of a tour celebrating
her first year of campaigning for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech, Clinton called for a tax credit of up to $3,000 per
employee for small businesses that set up operations in communities
losing population _ like many of the towns she is visiting on this
campaign swing.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks to about 300 people, as well as at an earlier
appearance in nearby Elmira, Clinton highlighted economic issues in
a region that has been considered a Republican stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for more federal funds to develop and
improve highways in western New York, and called for airlines to
bring more frequent and less expensive air service to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do everything possible to entice some airlines to look
more closely at the regional airports,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton continued her attacks on Rep. Rick
Lazio, her Republican opponent in the Senate race, this time for a
fund-raising letter sent earlier in the week by his campaign. In
the letter, Lazio said Clinton and her husband, President Clinton,
had ``embarrassed our country and disgraced their powerful posts.''
Lazio has said that he did not see the letter before it was sent,
but that he stood by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is a perfect example of how he tries to be all
things to all people,'' Clinton said. ``And it's part of the
typical political double talk that's marked his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began her day in Ithaca, where she walked through the
Commons, a business district, and visited a coffee shop. She went
on to attend an outdoor rally in Elmira organized by labor groups
and Democratic Party officials.
</P>
<P>
   As in many of her campaign stops, Clinton evoked both cheers and
protests from onlookers. Friday's appearance in Ithaca drew an
especially vocal group of protesters complaining of the
continuation of the Navy's bombing on the Puerto Rican island of
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the Democratic supporters at both stops were groups of
protesters holding signs reading ``Stand by Your Man . . . in
Arkansas'' as well as other slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, Clinton said that she was not bothered by
such protesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have hundreds of millions of opinions,'' Clinton said.
``And I have no problem with anybody expressing their opinions in a
civil way. It doesn't bother me. It's part of the political
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Clinton departed from her typical pattern of riding in a
van with her staff and security detail by boarding the bus carrying
the reporters covering her campaign. For the 20-minute ride from
Ithaca to Elmira, she spoke with the reporters, reflecting on the
year since she formed an exploratory committee to run for the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a great experience for me,'' she said, referring
to her first attempt at gaining elective office. ``I had to learn
how to be a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the negative tone of the protesters' placards
gave her pause, Clinton said: ``Oh, they are amateurs. I have been
down this road for so many years. Even before I was married to Bill
Clinton, people had strong opinions about me. And it hasn't changed
ever since I was a little girl, and I don't expect it to change any
time before the end of this election. It is just part of the
background music of my life.''

 &HT;    Like a log. Like a baby. With the fishes. Who cares? As long as
it is a good night's
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Rip Van Winkle, the Greek poet Epimenides and
Charles Perrault's Beauty are the only ones I can think of who had
too much sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep consumes about 20 years of a human lifetime _ or it
should. More than 100 million Americans of all ages, however,
regularly fail to get a good night's sleep. Some blame it on a
snoring mate, a neighbor's barking dog or too much to eat or drink.
Sleepless nights reduce worker productivity and increase
irritability. Need to know more about sleep cycles and disorders?
Ever wonder what causes a yawn? Think preschoolers are the only
ones who benefit from naps? Think again. This edition of the Greig
Files cannot guarantee a good night's sleep but does give you
something to read if you are sleepless.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT THE HECK IS SLEEP?
</P>
<P>
   A periodic state of relative inactivity for the mind and body.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep comes in two types: REM (rapid eye movement), during which
vivid dreams transpire, and nondreaming or dull dreaming non-REM
sleep. About 75 percent of every night is spent in non-REM sleep.
REM periods become longer as the night wears on. When sleep is on
its way, brain waves are progressively wider and taller than those
produced during waking periods. Brain nerve cells are firing in
concert _ like an audience clapping to the same beat _ to make
these waves slower.
</P>
<P>
   Think of going to sleep like going down a hillside.
</P>
<P>
   Stage one is a light sleep in which the brain and muscles begin
to relax on the way down the hill. At stage two, the brain's waves
are markedly wider, and heart rate and respiration slow. Sleep in
stages three and four is characterized by taller, wider brain waves
_ known as Delta sleep _ slower brain activity and noticeable body
recovery. If awakened during this stage, most folks feel lousy _
the total sleep cycle has been interrupted, and wakening from a
Delta sleep is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The final stage is REM sleep, which restores mental alertness
and is characterized by brain waves similar to those during waking
periods.
</P>
<P>
   This sleep cycle takes about 90 minutes to complete; then it's
back to the top of the hill.
</P>
<P>
   WHO SLEEPS AND FOR HOW LONG?
</P>
<P>
   The sandman of sleep is Dr. Peter Hauri, whose book ``No More
Sleepless Nights'' is the bible of bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Newborns average 16 1/2 hours of sleep a day, and by six months,
14 hours. (Unfortunately for new parents, these hours are not
consecutive.) At age 2, this drops to 12 1/2 hours (split into 11
hours at night and 1 1/2 hour nap time). By age 6, children usually
drop the nap and stick with the 11 hours of sleep. By 10, a child
averages 10 hours of sleep; 13- to 20-year-olds need nine to 10
hours but seldom get it. On average an adult (regardless of age)
sleeps 7 1/2 to 9 hours.
</P>
<P>
   A common misconception is that the elderly need less sleep, but,
in fact, seniors log the same hours as other adults, only in
spurts, as routine napping returns to the sleep pattern.
</P>
<P>
   HELP! IS THAT MY CIRCADIAN CLOCK TICKING?
</P>
<P>
   Sure is. The circadian clock (from the Latin, circa, about; and
dies, day refers to the 24-hour daily rhythm driving everything
from humans to flowers. Sleep runs on this clock. The urge to sleep
in humans is very compelling between midnight and 6 a.m., and again
between 3 and 5 p.m. This clock's major signal? Light.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF SLEEP PROBLEMS?
</P>
<P>
   Bad sleep habits, notes Dr. David Duhon of the Sleep Disorders
Center of Central Texas. There are so many temptations at night.
Electricity and the light bulb are just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, radios, television, stereos, shift work, part-time
jobs _ all conspire to cut into time traditionally reserved for
rest, if not for sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 10 percent to 15 percent of adults suffer from
obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, marked by snoring and uneven
breathing. WHAT DO JERKS HAVE TO DO WITH SLEEP? These are sleep
starts, also known as ``hypnic jerks,'' when drifting off to sleep.
Accompanied by a sense of falling, the jerks are ``a primitive
postural reflex,'' notes Duhon, a reminder that human ancestors
slept in trees for safety. Maintaining posture during sleep (not
falling out of the tree into a lion's mouth) was essential. The
jerking is a muscle reflex to the natural relaxation of sleep _
reaching out for an imaginary tree branch.
</P>
<P>
   BOSS, IS IT TIME FOR MY NAP?
</P>
<P>
   Sounds funny, but napping _ power napping, that is, of 30
minutes or less _ is one way to increase productivity. The body's
circadian clock is set for sleep at night but also during the
middle of the day. So it's not the el plato grande you had for
lunch that is making you sleepy, nor is it the droning of the staff
meeting. This is nature fighting for a few daytime ZZZZZs.
</P>
<P>
   A short nap is the most effective way to increase alertness.
Ever spy a co-worker dozing in the car? Has your head jerked back
while gazing at a computer monitor recently? Remember, more than 40
percent of Americans admit to taking a daily nap. By the by, women
feel more guilty about napping than men (there's a shock).
</P>
<P>
   Contact the World Nap Organization at
home.bluemarble.net/(tilde)amyloo/wno.html for napping survey
results. No time to nap? There is always the possibility of moving
to Spain for a daily siesta.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS INSOMNIA?
</P>
<P>
   This ubiquitous term means the inability to fall asleep or stay
asleep. It causes irritability, restlessness and anxiety. Mild
insomnia is characterized by a regular (but not daily) feeling of
not being rested, although routines are not impaired. Moderate
insomnia is a nightly experience and causes moderate problems
during waking hours. Severe insomnia occurs regularly and seriously
impairs work and social functioning. For more information on the 84
sleep disorders, visit the American Academy of Sleep Medicine at
asda.org.
</P>
<P>
   IS THERE A DOWN SIDE TO TRAVEL?
</P>
<P>
   Jet lag, the battle of the body against its environment.
Environment usually wins. Body time and local time at war? The
travel gurus at the Austin Diagnostic Center's Travel Clinic advise
common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Get adequate rest before traveling, reduce smoking and avoid
alcohol and caffeine, carry healthy snacks and avoid heavy meals,
increase fluid intake (8 ounces per hour during flight), exercise
(in-seat flexes, walk the aisle), sleep as much as possible on the
plane (pillow, blankets, earplugs and eye cover if necessary),
shower or wash hands and face when possible.
</P>
<P>
   So skip the free champagne (or at least drink less of it), grab
some shut-eye and drink water like a fish. Upon arrival, do not
immediately sleep but force yourself to live in the new time zone
day. Get some sunshine if possible.
</P>
<P>
   DID YOU DREAM A LITTLE DREAM?
</P>
<P>
   You bet you did. Everyone dreams (most in color, although it may
not be remembered that way) every night. And, no, having the same
dream repeatedly does not mean anything in particular. Keep a dream
diary to discern patterns. Certain dreams may replay during times
of change or stress. The Association for the Study of Dreams
reports dreams may be influenced by giving yourself pre-dream
suggestions. As for predicting the future? You might have more luck
becoming Greek and hightailing it to Delphi. Dreams as well as
their interpretation are personal, very personal.
</P>
<P>
   IS THERE A MONSTER UNDER THE BED?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The monster may just be a nightmare, a normal occurrence.
Nightmares may be caused by medication, stress or illness. Think of
nightmares as a way to explore mental images. For a detailed flier
on nightmares, send a stamped, self-addressed envelope to the
Association of the Study of Dreams, P.O. Box 1166, Orinda, Calif.
94563. Nightmares should not be confused with night terrors, in
which the sleeper may scream and thrash about. Children may suffer
from such terrors and, when comforted by parents, often conquer
these terrors.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CAUSES YAWNING?
</P>
<P>
   Just reading the word, for one thing. No one knows why yawns
occur, only that they do. Theories abound.
</P>
<P>
   Yawns give a burst of oxygen when the body needs it. Or yawns
are a socializing event, alerting others in prehistoric tribes that
it is time for sleep. Or yawning is part of an overall stretch when
muscles need to prepare for work.You pick.
</P>
<P>
   Each explanation can be argued. If yawning occurs when oxygen is
needed, why don't athletes in the middle of strenuous exercise,
when more oxygen is beneficial, yawn? How difficult could it have
been to synchronize sleep in ancient times, when little or nothing
could be accomplished after dark? And if stretching prepares
muscles for work, why is yawning particularly frequent before
bedtime?
</P>
<P>
   Even without the whys of yawning, a few facts have been
established at the University of Washington, where such matters are
studied. Everyone yawns. The average yawn lasts six seconds, and in
humans,the earliest yawning occurs in utero, about 11 weeks after
conception. Children between 1 and 2 years old begin to participate
in contagious yawning. The incidence of yawning is increased when
the hypothalamus is injected with some neurotransmitters (e.g.
dopamine, nitric oxide) of test animals. Yawn.
</P>
<P>
   DOES MR. ED NEED AS MUCH SLEEP AS HUMANS?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, notes Duhon.
</P>
<P>
   The average equine and other large grazing animals such as
elephants and giraffes need only three hours per day. The
exception? Lions and tigers spend a great deal of the day asleep.
In contrast, chimpanzees sleep nine to 10 hours; gorillas, 12 to
15; and the South American owl monkey, 17 hours per day. Bats need
about 20 hours of shut-eye.
</P>
<P>
   Reptiles and fish do not ``sleep'' per se but have periods when
they are less sensitive to their environment. Some birds manage to
nap in flight. Neat trick _ but not as neat as fur seals and some
dolphin species, which manage to allow one hemisphere of the brain
to sleep at a time. This particular adaptation allows them to sleep
without drowning.
</P>
<P>
   And the king of all nappers? The Indus River dolphin, a blind
species living in swift river currents. This dolphin sleeps a total
of seven hours a day _ 4 to 40 seconds at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ARE YOU SLEEPLESS IN SAN DIEGO?
</P>
<P>
   That is what 17-year-old Randy Gardner was in the mid-1960s,
when he went 264 hours without sleep. There were, however, plenty
of cold showers, rock 'n' roll and caffeine to keep young Randy
awake. Before succumbing to Morphias, Gardner suffered slurred
speech, finally falling into a silent stupor. Although the
sleepless period was supervised, such stunts are dangerous. A
University of Chicago study showed that rats die when prevented
from sleeping for 2 1/2 weeks, reports Michael Cannell in Science
World.
</P>
<P>
   NIGHTTIME SUPERSTITIONS
</P>
<P>
   _ To rid yourself of possible aftereffects of bad dreams, spit
three times as soon as you wake up. _ The best night's sleep is had
in a bed facing south.
</P>
<P>
   _ If your bed faces east, you will be rich; west, you will
travel. _ Avoid nightmares by hanging socks or stockings over the
end of the bed with a pin stuck through them. _ To dream of muddy
water is to be warned of trouble or impending death. _ Dreaming of
lice portends some family member will be sick. _ Being sleepy after
dinner means company is coming. _ Daytime sleep induces fever,
especially in the summer. _ Never waken a person suddenly, lest his
spirit, which wanders during sleep, not have sufficient time to
re-enter the body. _ Sleeping on the left side invites heart
trouble. _ A woman who dreams of fish will have a baby.
</P>
<P>
   _ A dream told on Saturday will come true.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THE SLEEP YOU NEED
</P>
<P>
   Here are some sleep tips from the Mayo Clinic:
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish a regular bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get up at the usual time in the morning, even if you did not
have a restful night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   _ Read or watch television until becoming sleepy, rather than
trying to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   _ Set an alarm clock, but put it out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cut down time in bed by 30 to 60 minutes to deepen sleep. _
Exercise four to six hours before bedtime. _ Make the bedroom as
comfortable as possible. _ Eat a light snack. _ Take a hot bath two
hours before going to bed. _ Avoid alcohol. _ Avoid beverages
containing caffeine after lunchtime. _ Avoid tobacco. _ Deal with
worries before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   LATE NIGHT ?
</P>
<P>
   Catch up, like payback, is . . . well, difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree missing your normal shut-eye one night, like
missing one meal, is not that debilitating. You can catch up the
next day by going to bed early or sleeping a bit later. But do not
delay. Waiting until the weekend to grab needed shut-eye only
compounds the sleep deficit and general malaise. Better yet, bank a
little extra sleep when a late night looms.

 &HT;    Track claims another life
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Death is a possibility every time a person climbs
behind the wheel of a high-speed automobile. Winston Cup drivers
are fully aware of the extreme job hazard, but they don't like to
talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   However, when two drivers are killed in the same turn at the
same track in eight weeks, the racing community quickly speaks up.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin was killed on Friday after crashing in the third
turn of New Hampshire International Speedway, only a few yards
farther down the outside retainer wall where Busch driver Adam
Petty died on May 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two (deaths) means it is a problem,'' Ward Burton said. ``It
needs to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR needs to look into this tragedy, along with Adam's, to
prevent it from occurring again,'' Steve Park said. ``They need to
investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's incident had drivers questioning the safety of
1.058-mile track, the third turn and the engine throttles in
Winston Cup stock cars. Minutes after winning the pole for Sunday's
thatlook.com 300, Rusty Wallace wondered aloud about his
participation in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am, clearing tire rubber out of my eyeballs and grease
out of my fingernails and friends are getting killed _ these are
days that make you not want do it, I'll tell you that,'' Wallace
said. ``It really makes you question why you're doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire and Martinsville are mentioned by drivers as being
two of the most dangerous tracks on the circuit. Not due to high
speeds, but because of sharp turns required in the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has a safety suggestion for New Hampshire and other
tracks: flexible protection barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of these barriers after what I saw in (the Busch
race) at Watkins Glen,'' Wallace said. ``(Jimmie Johnson) hit and
flipped and the (barrier) softened the blow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's make sure our drivers are protected at the race track,''
Mike Bliss said. ``Let's make sure they can hit a wall and walk
away (with barriers).''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Rudd said the difficult thing about New Hampshire is it
being a flat track. Drivers can build up fast speeds on the front
and back stretches, which may cause problems making a turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the hardest I ever hit anywhere was when I had a
throttle stick in a test session at Martinsville,'' Rudd said.
``You would think Martinsville would be the least place you'd worry
about getting hurt, but I think it sort of lures you to sleep
because the straightaways are so long and the speeds are very fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have any kind of mechanical problem at all, you don't
have time to recover from it and it's usually head-on into the
fence.''
</P>
<P>
   The final concern, which is growing among all race teams, is
about hung throttles. Most drivers speculated that Irwin's crashed
because his engine throttle got stuck. NASCAR declined to comment
on the cause of the wreck until further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers thought Petty's wreck was due to a stuck
throttle. NASCAR Chief Operating Officer Mike Helton said earlier
this week that there was ``no conclusive evidence'' to prove that
Petty crashed because of mechanical error.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to learn from this -- I'm going to my car right
now to look at what I can do for pulling the throttle back,'' Bliss
said. ``I needed to see what I can do in my race car to prevent
anything from happening if my throttle hung.''

   ``Those (deaths) are circumstances beyond human control,'' Petty
said. ``There ain't nothing the matter with this race track.

   WASHINGTON _ The two-star general accused of sexually harassing
the Army's highest-ranking woman has requested early retirement
after military investigators endorsed the charges against him,
Pentagon officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith has denied any wrongdoing, but he asked
to step down after a letter of reprimand was entered into his
personnel file, the officials said. He is to retire on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's inspector general determined that he harassed and
assaulted Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy in her Pentagon office in 1996.
But officials said there were no plans to reduce his rank or
retirement benefits through a Grade Determination Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, whose high-profile allegations were closely followed
throughout the armed services and by women's rights advocates,
released a statement expressing satisfaction at the conclusion of a
case she had pursued reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am satisfied with the Army's action in this case,'' she
said. ``As far as I am concerned, this matter is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the Army, Smith said: ``I have always
and continue to maintain that I did not commit these allegations
and I am deeply disappointed with the decision to substantiate
them. However, for the good of my family and the Army, we have
elected to put it behind us and move on with our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The action against Smith, a 55-year-old veteran of three tours
in Vietnam, ended the first instance of sexual harassment charges
lodged by one Army general against another. The case embarrassed
the Army, which has been roiled by a series of sex scandals and has
sought to appeal to women by insisting that it will not tolerate
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In a heavily edited report released Friday under the Freedom of
Information Act, the Army's inspector general, Lt. Gen. Michael
Ackerman, concluded that Kennedy, who is 52, told the truth about
the encounter with Smith even though only the two generals were
present.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the incident, the two were of equal rank, and
they both said only that they had met in Kennedy's office and that
the encounter ended with a hug, the report said. Beyond that, they
``were in total disagreement as to what happened when they were
alone,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith testified that he gave Kennedy ``a hug and possibly a
`cheek kiss,''' the report said, but he ``strongly denied any
wrongdoing.'' Prior to her allegations, Smith said he considered
Kennedy a ``family friend,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   But the inspector general concluded that Smith's actions
amounted to assault and battery and sexual harassment. The evidence
did not support a more serious charge of indecent behavior to
gratify sexual desires, the investigation found.
</P>
<P>
   ``By holding her and kissing her against her will,'' the report
said, Smith displayed conduct that ``was unbecoming of an officer
and a gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general largely based his conclusions on the
strength of Kennedy's testimony and the belief that she had more to
lose than to gain by making her charges public.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy filed charges against Smith only last year, three years
after the incident. She pressed the case after Smith was named to
become the Army's deputy inspector general, a post that would have
given him responsibility for investigating charges of sexual
harassment, among other types of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evaluating the allegations came down to a question of
credibility,'' the report said. ``There appeared to be no motive
for'' Kennedy ``to jeopardize her career and reputation by making
false allegations against'' Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not in competition for assignments,'' the report
said. ``She did not arrange the office call. There was no apparent
incentive for her to ruin his unblemished career and destroy their
friendship with false allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general concluded: ``When one weighed all the
testimony and considered all the evidence, coupled with the lack of
motive to lie, the preponderance or greater weight of the evidence
was sufficient to substantiate'' Kennedy's allegations against
Smith.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Eugene R. Fidell, an expert on military law, said there was
nothing unusual about the inspector general's approach to the sort
of dispute frequently dismissed as ``he said, she said.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They found her a credible witness based on her demeanor,''
Fidell said. ``They decided she's telling the truth, and one of the
factors that decided it is she doesn't have a motive to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith asserted that he had been treated unfairly. He provided 52
character witnesses in his defense. The inspector general's office
interviewed seven of those references and six others before
determining that there were no other known reports of prior
misconduct by Smith, whom it called ``a highly respected officer.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general noted that while Kennedy did not formally
pursue the case against Smith until last year, she referred to the
incident in 1997, five months after it occurred. Without providing
details, the report noted: ``The complainant, in an open forum,
cited it as an example of how she had been sexually harassed'' by
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The report said she eventually decided to report the incident
``out of loyalty to the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony in May honoring her 31 years of military service,
Kennedy, who is scheduled to retire next month, urged women in
uniform to report incidents of harassment, or ``misconduct will
continue to harm us.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the memorial to Women in Military Service to America
at Arlington National Cemetery, she exhorted the crowd of 100
well-wishers to heed the advice of French novelist Emile Zola to
``live out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Living out loud begins by telling a friend and then later by
telling people in authority who care,'' Kennedy said. ``Our army is
filled with women and men who care and are in a position to change
and improve the conditions in which we serve.''

GRANDSON OF DODGERS STAR IS CHARGED IN FRIEND'S ACCIDENTAL DEATH

   NEW YORK _ The grandson of Gil Hodges, the first baseman for the
postwar Brooklyn Dodgers, was charged with manslaughter Friday
after he accidentally killed the brother of a man believed to be a
member of the Lucchese crime family, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges' grandson, also named Gil Hodges, is accused of killing
Lance Marino, the brother of Craig Marino, who was described by
investigators as a member of the Lucchese family.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Hodges, 26, and Marino, 27, both Brooklyn
residents, spent Thursday night drinking at the Northside Cafe in
the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Toward the end of the
evening, Marino fell asleep on the hood of Hodges' Range Rover,
which was parked outside the bar. Hodges drove off with his friend
still atop the car, the police said, and after about a mile, Marino
fell off, striking his head on construction debris. He was
pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn district attorney's office charged Hodges with
vehicular manslaughter, reckless endangerment, driving while
intoxicated and reckless driving. His lawyer, Vincent Romano, said
Hodges was ``in shock'' because he and Marino had been best
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Romano, who said he had also represented Marino before his
death, said Marino did not have any ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Marino, 30, Marino's brother, is believed to be a member
of the Lucchese crime family, said Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for
the Brooklyn district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gil Hodges played for the Dodgers during the 1940s and
'50s. He later managed the New York Mets, leading them to victory
in the 1969 World Series. He died in 1972.

RAFTER DEFEATS AGASSI IN STIRRING SEMIFINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS ``is'' to ``in'' in headline) 
By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WIMBLEDON, England _ For months, Patrick Rafter rode out the
mood swings that turned his good-natured personality inside out.
The same Aussie who had always been ready with a good joke, a toast
and a smile _ the profile of the perfect best man at a wedding _
had his spirits rustled when forced to confront his tennis
mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Rafter underwent shoulder surgery, and the No. 1
ranking he worked so hard to obtain last July had evaporated. But
against a backdrop of rehab setbacks that left him pondering
retirement at times, the 27-year-old Rafter looked at peace Friday.
He realizes there are only so many serves left in his right rotator
cuff, but he did not seem the least bit concerned with the dynamics
of supply and demand on Center Court.
</P>
<P>
   To handcuff Andre Agassi's Houdini-like return game, Rafter
needed a big serve with the high kick of a Rockette. And he needed
as many as possible. As a gray afternoon extended into a crisp and
clear evening, as the first set of this hypnotic semifinal morphed
into the fifth, Rafter ignored the shrinking life span of his
serve. Unfurling his body freely, he pounded a high percentage of
first serves to undermine Agassi's strength on his way to a 7-5,
4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 victory that put him in position to play Pete
Sampras in Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a match that I couldn't have played any better under
the circumstances, on a big court against one of the best players
ever,'' Rafter said. ``I think it was probably very satisfying to
have actually done it on these grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   As a beaming Rafter lifted his arms in victory and spotted his
brothers sitting in the friends box, Steffi Graf was hustling out
of the stadium, not to return. Agassi's run was over, and the
American dream final had vanished. Only one half of it was alive
after the cash-poor qualifier, Vladimir Voltchkov, allowed one
pivotal shot to undo his upset chance against Sampras and lost, 7-6
(4), 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   With a huffing Sampras scrambling to chase down a deep, sliced
backhand, Voltchkov botched the easy backhand volley that would
have evened the first-set tiebreaker at 5-5. In disbelief,
Voltchkov dropped his racket and hung his head. The unknown
22-year-old from Belarus _ whose vagabond career took a brief
detour through Brooklyn seven years ago _ couldn't believe the
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hit a hundred out of a hundred of those in practice,''
said Voltchkov, who came to Wimbledon too cash-strapped to eat out
and left with $193,000 in prize money. ``You miss one here. I guess
it's the nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   Voltchkov never recovered. He went on to lose the tiebreaker and
never posed a threat to Sampras again. The only problem Sampras had
was with his sore lower left shin. At the end of the second set, he
asked a trainer for assistance. Scurrying around with only a slight
limp, he played on. After easing through the tournament without
having to face a seeded player, the top-seeded Sampras was in the
final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking at Sunday as pressure,'' said Sampras, 28, who
can break Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slams with a victory
against Rafter. ``I'm looking at it as an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Unchallenged through the tournament, Sampras will go up against
a player who has had his moments against Sampras in the past. They
have not always been pleasant encounters, either. As a part of an
odd tennis turf war when both were in their early days on the tour,
they exchanged a few heated words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get along fine,'' Sampras said. ``We'll just go out there
and do the best we can and then shake hands. But everything is
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Rafter wasn't focused on old grudges. He was fixated on
his recovery. Even as Agassi exited the grounds of the All England
Club, he seemed genuinely pleased for Rafter. One year ago, Rafter,
beginning to feel the first unsettling pains in his shoulder, was
crestfallen after his semifinal loss to Agassi at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat's gone through a tough stage here with his injury,''
Agassi said. ``He looks like he's found his game. I thought, in the
crucial times of the match, he was playing tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Every game seemed to present a critical point during a match
that unveiled a glorious contrast of styles. There was the
ponytailed Rafter, a serve-and-volley fiend with a touch as soft as
cashmere at the net, faced with a bald icon who uses his racket
like a laser from the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   For four sets, neither style had a clear edge over the other. To
threaten Rafter's serve in the seventh game of the first set, the
second-seeded Agassi pounced on a second serve and slapped it back
at the feet of the Aussie as he raced to the net. In the same game,
Rafter dared to reach back and go for a second-serve ace that split
the court in half.
</P>
<P>
   This was just part of a riveting back-and-forth. Agassi would
catch Rafter creeping into the net and airbrush a lob just over his
outstretched racket. Rafter would watch Agassi rip a service return
down the line, and then stab it like a swashbuckler for a
half-volley winner. The high level of play left the crowd in a
constant state of awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good enough if you lose,'' said Agassi, who converted
4 of 9 break points while Rafter succeeded on 5 of 12. ``I didn't
serve as well as I wanted to, made some careless errors. To his
credit, he played well at the right time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a 3 hour 18 minute match, the hiccups in Agassi's
game caught up to him. In the sixth game of the fifth set, Agassi
went for too much on a second serve in an attempt to keep Rafter on
his heels. He double faulted. That mistake set up the 12th-seeded
Rafter with a break point. With Rafter at the net, Agassi sent a
forehand passing shot hurdling into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi couldn't break back. Rafter's first serve only got better
as the match progressed. In the first set, Rafter put 53 percent of
his first serves in. By the fifth, he was nailing 74 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As the match unfolded, it was obvious: Rafter's shoulder was
holding up just fine. Just after Rafter left the interview, he was
headed for his strength routines. Twice a day, he ties a rubber
band from a door knob to his racket and begins swinging away
against the resistance. So far, this dedication to rehabilitating
has extended his career. How long, no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just taking it week by week, just really grateful to be
out there,'' he said. ``I'm hoping I can get a few more serves out
than what everyone expects.''

HERNANDEZ AND THE YANKEES DERAIL THE METS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is the kind of season it has been for Al Leiter,
according to New York Mets Manager Bobby Valentine: He usually
pitches very well, and on the days he doesn't, the other team's
line drives are caught. Either way, Leiter usually wins.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter did not win Friday night, chiefly because the Mets
encountered a pitcher who was both lucky and good. Orlando
Hernandez mystified the Mets, allowing five hits and one run in
eight innings and leading the New York Yankees to a 2-1 victory
before a crowd of 54,132 at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the opener of this weekend's four-game series, which
resumes on two fronts Saturday: an afternoon game at Shea, with
Dwight Gooden returning there as a starter for the Yankees, then a
night game at Yankee Stadium to make up for a rainout there on June
11.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night belonged to Hernandez (8-6), who held the Mets'
All-Star selections, Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza, hitless in
eight at-bats as he won his second start in a row since elbow
soreness sidelined him near the end of June. Leiter was nearly as
sharp, giving up only six hits and two runs over eight innings and
facing one batter over the minimum over his last seven and
two-thirds innings.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter's record dropped to 10-2, but he was nearly taken off the
hook in the eighth inning. Melvin Mora smoked a one-out triple to
right-center, and Derek Bell followed with a drive to deep right.
</P>
<P>
   Bell slowed to a trot: the ball was hit so high that it would
either be gone for a game-tying home run or right fielder Paul
O'Neill would catch it. O'Neill drifted back, jumped and with his
back at the wall, reached back and robbed Bell of a homer.
</P>
<P>
   Bell stopped just past first base, standing still for a bit and
wearing an expression that asked if that really had just happened.
Mora scored from third on the sacrifice fly, but the moment was
deflating, and Alfonzo flied out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera pitched a scoreless ninth inning, allowing a
two-out single to Todd Zeile after getting by Mike Piazza and Robin
Ventura. Rivera earned his 19th save by getting Jay Payton to fly
to right with a runner on first to end the game.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Mets' hitters had chances with runners in scoring position.
In the second, Ventura smacked a one-out double to deep center
field, but Zeile lined out and Payton popped out.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Agbayani led off the third with a single, and Leiter
sacrificed him to second. Mora bounced a bunt in front of the
plate, but he ran into the ball on his way to first for the second
out. Bell grounded out, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets' best chance over the first seven innings may have
been in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez walked the first two batters, then Agbayani came up,
swung at the first pitch, and hit a hard line drive up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez, looking more like a shortstop, leaped, reached
across his body and snared the ball. He turned and fired to Derek
Jeter covering second base for the second out. Payton, who was at
first, scrambled back to beat Jeter's throw and avoid the triple
play.
</P>
<P>
   And so it continued for the Mets. In another inning, Zeile
grounded sharply down the third-base line with one out; a few
inches to the right, and he would have had a double. Instead it was
foul, and Zeile wound up hitting a single. He never left first, as
Payton struck out looking and Agbayani lined out to first.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees got all the runs they would need in the first.
Leiter had allowed only one first-inning run this year, and his
first inning Friday night was easily his worst of the season. The
first five Yankee hitters reached base.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter may start Tuesday's All-Star Game, and he quickly
returned to the form that made him the National League's leader in
winning percentage (.909) entering Friday night's game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch led off the first with a walk, but before
Leiter's first pitch to Jeter, he picked Knoblauch off first. Then
Jeter lined a single to right, and O'Neill advanced him to third
with a ground single through the left side of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter got ahead of the next two hitters, but it made no
difference. With an 0-2 count against Williams, Leiter left a
fastball up in the strike zone, and Williams lashed it to right for
a single, scoring Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter tried a slider on 0-2 to the next hitter, Posada, who let
it go by for a ball. Posada got a fastball on the next pitch, and
ripped it to left, bringing in O'Neill from second.
</P>
<P>
   He retired Martinez on a fly to left and he struck out Spencer,
ending the inning. It took him 33 pitches to escape the first, but
Leiter was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   He worked 1-2-3 innings in the second, third, fourth and fifth,
and looked every bit the pitcher who had beaten the Yankees in his
previous three Subway Series starts. Leiter pitches on emotion, and
he thrives on the energy of Mets-Yankees meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very, very tough competitor,'' Valentine said. ``He
enjoys the rivalry stuff. He understands it and relishes the fact
that he's part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter didn't allow another base runner until Jeter reached on
an infield single to lead off the sixth, beating Mora's throw.
Again, Leiter got a pickoff, his eighth of the season, tying him
with Arizona's Brian Anderson for the National League lead.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter is third in the league in pitches per start, with an
average of 112 entering the game, and the pick-offs saved him some
pitches. But he had still thrown 95 through six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had thrown just 72 pitches through six, mainly because
the Mets were swinging early in the count. Half of the Mets' first
22 hitters had one- or two-pitch at-bats.

COMMENTARY: INVITING AN INVASION OF PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reading about New York politics lately can make you
wonder if you've turned to the wrong part of the newspaper. A lot
of it sounds as if it ought to be on the television page, in an
article on a new daytime soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   This weeper has everything: politics, stymied ambition, a
marriage on the rocks, a bitter wife, whispers of an old love
affair, a new girlfriend and a cancer menace.
</P>
<P>
   Not satisfied with power, romance and disease? How about a
little crime?
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a tale about how the main character's father once did
prison time for an armed stickup and then became a leg breaker for
loan sharks. While you're at it, let's have an uncle who ran a
gambling operation out of his bar. And a cousin who was a wise guy
gunned down by the feds.
</P>
<P>
   For want of a better title, we can call the soap opera, ``As the
Mayor Turns.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been some year for Rudolph Giuliani, and it could
easily get worse because of revelations in two new books about him.
Details have dribbled out all week, none more startling than
criminal skeletons from the Giuliani family closet that are
described in Wayne Barrett's ``Rudy! An Investigative Biography of
Rudolph Giuliani'' (Basic Books).
</P>
<P>
   Things have been going so badly for the mayor that the first
instinct was to sympathize with him the other day when he asserted
his right to privacy and denounced ``the almost crazed atmosphere''
of the press probing into his personal matters.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking specifically about the medical treatment he plans
for his prostate cancer. But he might as well have been musing
about the electron microscope now trained on his love life and
family history.
</P>
<P>
   Watching someone's life being turned into a fishbowl isn't
pretty. First instincts are not always dead-on, though. Sympathy,
while still there, was joined by a second thought: that Giuliani
brought much of his privacy ordeal on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Who disclosed his cancer? He did, though it was after a reporter
saw him at a hospital. Why is it then surprising that New Yorkers
would be curious about how he deals with the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Who announced to the news media that he was separating from his
wife, Donna Hanover? He did _ before he even told her. Until then,
New York journalists had been most circumspect about his plainly
unhappy marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It was Giuliani who then showed off his new ``very good
friend,'' Judith Nathan. No reporter suggested to him that he take
Nathan one May evening on a 10-block stroll through a sea of
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   As for the revelations that his father, Harold, was an ex-con,
the mayor has not confirmed them. But he also has notably passed up
several opportunities to deny them. It is not clear if he even knew
Harold Giuliani had been in Sing Sing in the 1930s, a decade before
Rudolph Giuliani was born.
</P>
<P>
   A natural inclination was to agree with him the other day when
he said, ``My father died 19 years ago, and the details of his life
died with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet only four months ago the mayor did not think that Patrick M.
Dorismond deserved the same consideration after he was shot to
death, though unarmed, by an undercover police officer. Then,
Giuliani did everything he could to blacken Dorismond's reputation,
even releasing the dead man's juvenile court records. When critics
protested his tactics, the mayor brushed them aside. ``Privacy
interests and rights expire with you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So much for his faith in privacy. Shouldn't what is good for
Patrick Dorismond also be good for Harold Giuliani?
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question would seem to be whether the Giuliani family
secrets, if true, tell us anything about the mayor who has so
thoroughly dominated New York.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Mario Cuomo thinks not. ``I find it very difficult
to make a case that it is relevant unless you can show me the
connection between the father's conduct and the son's quality,'' he
said. ``And I don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's right.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be surprised if New Yorkers are fascinated that the
racket-busting mayor may have come from a mob-connected family. Or
if some wonder whether his war on the Mafia had something to do
with nasty things he saw up close as a young man. Or if some ask
why he is so unsympathetic to almost anyone who has had a brush
with the law when his own father's story, as Barrett said this
week, ``should tell Rudy something about the complications of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Those asking such questions may well be off base. But the
armchair psychoanalysis seems inevitable all the same, as
inevitable, perhaps, as further installments of ``As the Mayor
Turns.''

LAZIO'S CAMPAIGN HIGHS AND LOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He has taken a licking from a cow focused on his
khakis and a licking from the press focused on a fund-raising
letter attacking his opponent. In one day he was told by a
beer-clutching middle-aged man to ``kill'' his opponent and by an
elderly woman that his position generally favoring abortion rights
amounts to murder. He has heard people greet him as Rick while
others stood back, asking who he was.
</P>
<P>
   If Rep. Rick Lazio's 1,200-mile tour across the state this past
week seemed up and down, it apparently never fazed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a chance to talk about some of the issues I've been
working on in Washington,'' Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee,
said before heading to a factory outside Rochester and his final
stop at a Bronx hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At a later briefing, he turned unusually introspective as he
spoke of responding to issues of the day. He said the experience
had reconfirmed his goal ``to not let myself get too defensive when
somebody is saying something that bothers me, to try and take a
deep breath and answer questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, while traveling on a plane from Rochester to New York
City, he revealed some things he has missed because of the
campaign, such as a Bible study group he attends with a group of
fellow congressmen. He struggled to name the last movie he had
seen, relying on his wife, Patricia, to remind him that it was
``Pokemon,'' and said he had not read a book in months. The last
one was ``Tuesdays With Morrie.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spoke on a variety of topics in his five-day tour _ child
care, housing for the elderly, support for farmers, the desire to
lower taxes, all things that he said he supported through
legislation in the House. But like his first bus tour after winning
the nomination on May 30, pictures counted, too, particularly as a
camera crew shot material over three days for future commercials.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain the rocketing streamers fired off at two stops,
at rallies of fewer than 75 people in otherwise deserted parks. Or
the large American flag that dwarfed Lazio at a Schenectady rally.
Or why Michael Murphy, his chief strategist, sat on the bumper of a
red pickup truck in the town of Argyle's Independence Day parade,
directing Lazio, who was marching right behind.
</P>
<P>
   On a dairy farm in Burke, a few miles from Canada, Lazio changed
from a dress shirt to a blue-and-white checkered shirt before
sitting among bales of hay. With the camera on, he showed concern
as farmers talked about hard times. Later, his aides asked
reporters to step out of sight while the Lazios and their two young
daughters walked off into a gloriously green field with cows, for
some more filming.
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on when the commercials will be broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   In Saratoga Springs, they brandished American flags from a small
window on the bus that Lazio used for his swing across the state.
In Yonkers, they hurled hats and T-shirts at eager supporters. And
as he marched in an Independence Day parade in Lake Placid, the
daughters got on the microphone in the bus and called out, ``Vote
for my dad, he's great!''
</P>
<P>
   A little over a week after Chelsea Clinton coyly signaled that
she would be around a little more, now that her mother, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, was running for Senate, along come Molly and Kelsey
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The debut of Molly, 8, and Kelsey, 6, has not attracted the
attention given to Chelsea Clinton, who was surrounded by reporters
at a recent City Hall news conference. But at least on this trip,
they have been front and center much of the time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They have traveled with their father before but stayed largely
in the background or out of sight. This time they scampered about,
amusing onlookers with their antics, such as showing off
operating-room garb while Dad toured Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Having the family around _ Patricia Lazio is often by her
husband's side at campaign events _ helps bolster the mainstream,
family-man image that Lazio is striving to project. Lazio says the
family also helps relieve the stress of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But after summer vacation is over, he does not expect to bring
them on the campaign trail often.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure they do their homework,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As much as it had to do with talking over issues, Lazio's tour
was about getting his name and face out more _ particularly
important for a relatively unknown Long Island congressman in a
contest with the first lady of the United States. And on this, his
score was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   In a Yonkers diner early in the trip, a waitress who had served
the congressman and his family was asked her opinion of him. She
replied, ``What's his name again?''

PIRRO SETTLES PATERNITY SUIT IN INDIANA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)  By COREY KILGANNON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A long-standing paternity suit against Albert Pirro
Jr., the husband of the district attorney for Westchester County,
New York, was settled on Thursday in Indiana, two weeks after
Pirro's conviction for tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The paternity suit, filed by the mother of a teen-age girl,
figured during Pirro's tax-fraud trial: prosecutors said that he
claimed money spent in fighting the suit as a business expense on
his tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro, a prominent Republican businessman who is married to
District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, was convicted by a federal jury of
improperly deducting $1.2 million in personal expenses as business
write-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, DNA testing indicated that Pirro, 52, was the father
of a teen-age girl whose mother, Jessica Marciano of Indiana, sued
him for child support.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Pirro in Indiana did not return a phone message
left Friday. Pirro's spokeswoman, Colleen Roche, confirmed that a
settlement had been reached, but said the court ruling kept her
from commenting or providing details.
</P>
<P>
   During the tax-fraud trial, several private investigators
testified that Pirro had hired them to help him fight the suit and
had paid them from one or more companies he owned.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer and Pirro family friend who once employed Marciano also
testified that Pirro had paid him to find hospital and divorce
records on her.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that these fees were included in Pirro's tax
deductions, which also included expenses for sports cars, cruise
tickets and furniture for the Pirros' home in Harrison, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano, who has married and now goes by the name Lynne
Lichtefeld, did not attend the tax-fraud trial, which ended June
22. She had been arrested May 30 at Newark International Airport on
a warrant for violation of probation in Florida related to a 1992
theft conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro was convicted along with his brother and accountant,
Anthony Pirro, on tax charges in U.S. District Court in
Westchester. Pirro is appealing the conviction.

MESSIER IS SET ON THE RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doug Messier, the father and agent of Mark Messier, indicated
that while other teams had expressed interest in signing him, the
Messiers were talking only to the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   And, Doug Messier said, the deal to bring Messier, a 39-year-old
free-agent center, back to the Rangers after his departure in 1997
could be done as soon as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had considerable interest, but we haven't responded,''
Doug Messier told The Canadian Press, a news agency, about other
teams seeking to sign his son. ``Mark is basically looking at
seeing what we can work out with the Rangers. We're just having
conversations and exchanging some ways that might make it possible
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are believed to be close to a two-year, $11
million deal. But because Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and
general manager, is at the wedding of one of his sons in Banff,
Alberta, this weekend, Doug Messier said, ``We'll have nothing
until Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   According to several NHL officials, Sather is also close to
signing the free-agent defenseman Vladimir Malakhov.
</P>
<P>
   But the Messier deal would be the Rangers' signature signing
because their former captain led the club to the Stanley Cup in
1994.

TWO ROBBED IN CENTRAL PARK, UNDERSCORING RISE IN CRIME THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two people _ including a tourist from Israel _ were
reportedly robbed in well-trafficked areas of Central Park Friday
morning in incidents that did not appear to be related, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The daylight robberies followed weeks of embarrassing scrutiny
of safety and policing in Central Park, the crown jewel of New York
City's parks. On June 11, groups of men sexually assaulted 59
women, including tourists, in Central Park after the Puerto Rican
Day parade on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   Overall crime in the Central Park precinct is up 9 percent
through July 2 this year, compared with the same period last year,
police statistics show. And robberies have increased 32 percent
since 1999, with 33 during that period this year, compared with 24
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the robberies Friday reportedly occurred near the
Central Park Zoo at 6:40 a.m. Two men punched James Jonest, 43, of
Manhattan in the face and stomach and stole $253 and his jacket,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second robbery, reported by a tourist from Israel, the
tourist was walking near the Central Park Boathouse around 11:05
a.m. when a man demanded her money. The tourist, Mae Benhur, 23,
told the police that the man said he had a gun, but he did not show
one. The man stole Benhur's CD player, $20 and a $100 traveler's
check.
</P>
<P>
   Two other robberies occurred in Central Park during the past
week. On Sunday, three men reported being robbed at gunpoint in the
Conservatory Garden. On June 30, a picnicking couple reported being
robbed at gunpoint near Wollman Rink.

ANN ROE ROBBINS, 94, FOOD WRITER AND TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Mass.)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ann Roe Robbins, a teacher of cooking who, along with
James A. Beard and other food writers, helped to convince Americans
of the 1960s that cooking could be an art form, died June 25 at her
home in Manhattan. She was 94.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Craig Claiborne, the New York Times food critic, heaped
praise on Robbins' private cooking school and the one run by Beard
as the most important such schools in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' popular classes were held in the large kitchen of her
apartment overlooking Central Park West. She specialized in
international cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins also wrote about a dozen cookbooks, including ``25
Vegetables Anyone Can Grow'' (Crowell, 1942) and ``How to Cook
Well'' (Crowell, 1946), and she collaborated on ``The Dione Lucas
Meat and Poultry Cook Book'' (Little Brown, 1955). An anonymous
reviewer for The New York Times said of the meat and poultry book:
``This probably is the cookbook of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins was born on Sept. 14, 1905, in Newark, N.J. She
graduated from Smith College in 1926, and when she married a few
years later, she told an interviewer, she could ``hardly make a
meat loaf.''
</P>
<P>
   But she learned. When asked for advice on how to learn to cook,
she said: ``By going into the kitchen and pitching in. Get a good
basic cookbook and let it be your guide. I learned by experience. I
still think it the best teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by three daughters, Jennifer Manocherian of
Scarsdale, Susan Morrison of Hingham., Mass., and Victoria Cowal of
Mexico City; 11 grandchildren; and 14 great-grandchildren.

ANALYSIS: CONSENT DECREE IS WILD CARD IN TALKS ON POLICE OVERSIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Pa., N.J.)  By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police departments vary greatly in size and in
the issues they face. The communities they serve are just as
diverse: the small town of Steubenville, Ohio, the city of
Pittsburgh and the entire state of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But in each of these places, the federal government has found
that the police force engaged in systemic violations of civil
rights. And each local government, to avoid a federal lawsuit,
agreed to accept federal oversight to ensure that changes would be
instituted.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, which is now facing a similar lawsuit, has said
it will consider accepting some form of federal oversight as well,
and the looming question is whether the city will accept the
established model of monitoring or forge some new method.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are indications that the breach between what the
city and the Justice Department will accept is so large that it may
undermine any success in reaching an agreement that would forestall
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have said for months that they
are prepared to sue the city to force changes in what they
characterize as the ineffective way the New York Police Department
investigates and disciplines officers accused of brutality. Their
findings, which the city disputes, were based on a two-year inquiry
begun after the August 1997 torture of Abner Louima in a Brooklyn
station house.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations in other places, the federal government has
insisted on largely similar types of oversight.
</P>
<P>
   In each, the parties signed an agreement that detailed the basic
reforms and standards that were needed, like new training regimens.
In each, they agreed to the appointment of an outside auditor who
would measure the police force's compliance. And in each, the
written agreement was filed in federal court as a consent decree so
that any disputes over compliance would be subject to the review of
a federal judge, who could levy sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Based on interviews with people who have been involved in or
briefed on the negotiations in New York, it appears that the city
and the federal government are close to agreeing on some policy
changes needed, and on the appointment of an outside auditor. But
the city appears to be balking at entering into a consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   City lawyers have said they are, in general, reluctant to enter
into consent decrees because such decrees transfer power over city
agency matters to a federal judge, who may be less versed in the
operations of the agency and the needs of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But one federal official involved in the negotiations said it
was difficult to envision any settlement that would not involve the
parties signing a consent decree, or some legal agreement that
resembled it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to the fact that there has to be enforceability
that respects the agreement between the parties,'' the official
said, ``that permits the aggrieved party to go in and get
compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they are negotiating possible reforms, New York
officials have consistently said the police force is a model of
restraint and does an effective job of disciplining officers who
use excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   Settlements in other places were tailored to address particular
problems. For example, the Steubenville agreement called for the
city to set up a system to allow residents to file complaints
against officers, a procedure already in place in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But all three settlements call for the appointment of an outside
auditor, whose selection is ratified by a federal judge. The
auditors are paid by the local governments, and they prepare
periodic reports that measure police compliance with the consent
decrees.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh, for example, is paying Public Management Resources,
a Texas consulting firm, $400,000 to serve as the auditor for five
years. The auditors, who prepare quarterly reports, measure the
city's compliance with 70 provisions in a 40-page consent decree,
including its progress installing a computer system to track
officer histories for evidence of excessive force or racial
prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Each settlement calls for the auditors' reports to be forwarded
to the Justice Department. If prosecutors believe that there is
evidence of noncompliance, they can bring an action in federal
court to have the local government held in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   The length of oversight can vary, depending upon the agreement.
Pittsburgh signed its consent decree in 1997, and its oversight
will last at least five years. At that point, the oversight can be
lifted if a judge finds that the police department has been in
substantial compliance with the consent decree for at least two
years.
</P>
<P>
   If New York were to refuse to sign a consent decree, both
parties could still sign a simple contract that would not require
court approval. But if the city failed to keep the agreement, the
federal government's recourse would be to sue for breach of
contract, experts said, instead of bringing a contempt motion in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Witold Walczak, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union chapter in Pittsburgh, said the settlement there
needed to be a consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody realizes,'' he said, ``that without the threat of an
enforcement action by a federal judge, none of the reforms would
have taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary DuFour, the city manager in Steubenville, said a settlement
in New York would have to be considerably different from the one
that covers his city of 22,000 on the West Virginia border.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have almost twice as many officers as we have citizens,''
he said. ``Some of the issues are going to be very different.''

RAY SCHERER, 81, BROADCASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)   By ERIC V. COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Scherer, a former White House correspondent for NBC News who
covered six presidents, from Harry S. Truman to Gerald R. Ford,
before becoming an executive for the RCA Corp., died on July 1 at
his home in Washington. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Scherer's career in broadcast journalism began in the infancy of
television, when technical limitations meant interviews that could
be no longer than two minutes. In 1956, he was among the first
journalists to broadcast live from the floor of presidential
nominating conventions. He was also one of the first to report live
from the White House and to have a live nationally telecast midday
news program.
</P>
<P>
   Scherer was born on June 7, 1919, in Fort Wayne, Ind. His father
was the business manager of The Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette, for
which the younger Scherer delivered newspapers when he was a
teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Valparaiso University in Indiana and served in
the Navy in World War II. He earned a master's degree in
international relations from the University of Chicago and became a
feature writer at The Journal-Gazette. He became a staff news
writer at NBC in 1947 and soon became an on-air reporter.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 foot 4 inches and 200 pounds, he had an on-screen presence
that radiated authority in the early days of television news
broadcasts. He once calculated that he had logged 250,000 miles on
various assignments in his 28 years as a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to covering the White House, Scherer reported on the
Pentagon, Congress and, for four years beginning in 1969, Europe.
He retired from journalism in 1975 and became a vice president with
RCA, at the time the parent company of NBC. He retired from that
position in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Scherer is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Barbara
Hetzner; a daughter, Nancy, of St. Paul; a son, David, of
Washington; and two grandsons.

SUN. JULY 9 -- Recently, Mazda found itself without a sport utility
vehicle which meant that they were missing out on the hottest auto
fashion trend of the decade. Next month, Mazda receives a sport
utility vehicle from Ford called the Tribute and looks to have a
bright future. The Tribute has the potential to be the best in its
class in a booming segment of the car market. It is aimed at young
singles, couples and small families on budgets. Sales of small
sport utilities have more than doubled in the last four years and
further growth is expected both in the United States and overseas.

that their son's pledge to ``restore honor and integrity'' to the
Oval Office would resonate with voters. Bush also says that Vice
President Al Gore's ties to Clinton would not allow him to present
himself credibly as a fresh start, and that Gov. Bush's ability to
do so would prove decisive. (Paul Hosefros/The New York Times)

of those for competing talk shows, earns the station nearly $1
million a year in revenue, a remarkable figure for a daytime show.

WILLIAM MCGOWAN DIES AT 76; FOUNDED NYPD EMERALD SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC V. COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William McGowan, a founder of the New York City Police
Department Emerald Society, a fraternal organization of
Irish-American police officers, died July 1 in Tarrytown, N.Y. He
was 76 and lived in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was heart failure, his son William McGowan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Police Department Emerald Society is the
oldest of its kind and now has 10,000 active members, said the
current president, Joseph Keenan Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous Irish societies, which were centered on religion
or ancestors' county of origin, the Emerald Societies that began to
take root in the 1950s were for those of Irish descent in a
particular occupation. Among the other Emerald Societies are those
for sanitation workers, firefighters and telephone workers.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Police Department Emerald Society was founded
in 1953, long after the time when being a New York police officer
was practically synonymous with being Irish. The founding of the
society was an indication of how much the Irish had assimilated
into American society, and of the increasing diversity of the
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as things started to wane,'' said Frank McLoughlin, a
former newspaper reporter who became a deputy police commissioner.
``People kind of said, `Jeez, we'd better get together.'''
</P>
<P>
   William John McGowan was born Oct. 23, 1923, in Brooklyn. At 17,
he joined the Navy, where he became a chief petty officer. In 1947,
he joined the New York Police Department, a member of the third
generation in his family to do so. He rose from patrol duty to
detective, eventually becoming head of what was known as the Hippie
Squad, assigned to track down and return runaway teen-agers. He
retired in 1972 as a detective captain.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 48 years, the former Ellen Lilienthal, died last
year at 72.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son William, of Brooklyn, McGowan is survived
by four other sons: Bryan, of San Francisco; Kevin, of Brooklyn;
Sean, of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.; and Terrance, of Manhattan; three
daughters: Ellen McGowan-Salter of Agoura, Calif.; Laureen Quinn of
Alpharetta, Ga.; and Regina McGowan Pezanowski of Groton, Mass.;
and 17 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement in 1972, McGowan opened Danny Boy's Pub, at
50th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan, which was frequented by
newspaper reporters, sports figures, judges, labor leaders and
lawyers of Irish extraction, said Frank Cull, a columnist for The
Irish Echo who knew McGowan for 35 years. McGowan sold the pub in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the `in' place for the Irish-American community,'' Cull
said.  &QL;

WALTER CASSEL, 90, COMMANDING MET BARITONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Iowa, Neb.)   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Cassel, an American baritone who sang 275 performances
with the Metropolitan Opera and 126 with the New York City Opera,
and who originated a key role in Douglas Moore's opera ``The Ballad
of Baby Doe,'' died on Monday at his home in Bloomington, Ind. He
was 90.
</P>
<P>
   During his long career Cassel appeared with American companies
in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and New Orleans, as well as
the major companies of Vienna, Duesseldorf and elsewhere. When
Birgit Nilsson made her acclaimed Met debut in Wagner's ``Tristan
und Isolde'' in 1959, Cassel sang the role of Kurwenal.
</P>
<P>
   He was the composer's choice for the role of Horace Tabor when
``The Ballad of Baby Doe'' was given its premiere in Central City,
Colo., in 1956. Beverly Sills, who sang the first New York
performances of the title role, one of her favorites, considered
Cassel's portrayal definitive. ``Each time Horace died in Baby's
arms,'' Sills recalled in her 1987 autobiography, ``I really did
start crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Born John Walter Cassel on May 15, 1910, in Council Bluffs,
Iowa, he began playing trumpet in high school. In his senior year
he joined the glee club and started taking voice lessons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, Cassel auditioned for the great American baritone
Lawrence Tibbett, who was giving a recital in Omaha, Neb. Tibbett
encouraged him to pursue a career in opera and praised him
generously in an interview with the local newspaper. So with $40 in
his shoe, a pair of coveralls and a briefcase full of music, Cassel
boarded a cattle train for a five-day trip to Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In New York he supported himself by singing on radio programs,
including ``Air Breaks'' and ``Hammerstein's Music Hall.'' He
auditioned for the Metropolitan Opera and in 1942 made his debut on
short notice, filling in for an ailing singer, as Bretigny in
Massenet's ``Manon.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassel was valued for his well-modulated, robust voice and
commanding stage presence. Olin Downes, writing in The New York
Times, was deeply struck by Cassel's portrayal of Jochanaan in
Strauss' ``Salome,'' opposite Phyllis Curtin in the title role, at
the New York City Opera in 1954. ``We never had seen so convincing
and impressive an interpretation of the role,'' Downes wrote.
``There was fire, nobility and pathos, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassel always said his comfort on the stage came from his
extensive experience with light opera. One of his last major roles
came in 1970 when he sang the role of Johann Strauss Sr. in Erich
Korngold's operetta, ``The Great Waltz,'' in London, a production
that ran for two years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Cassel retired from the stage and began teaching at
Indiana University in Bloomington.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Gail; two daughters, Jeannie Cassel
Charles and Mary; and a son, William. Another son, John Jr., died
in 1996.

W. DAVID KINGERY, 73, DIES; MODERNIZED CERAMICS MAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William David Kingery, who opened a high-technology chapter in
the science of ceramics, died on Friday at his summer home in
Wickford, R.I. He was 73 and had his principal residence in Tucson,
Ariz., where he taught at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Kingery's work on advanced materials technology in ceramics, at
Arizona and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was
vastly different from the hands-on methods that produced bricks,
china, pottery and glass from natural materials through the ages.
He built upon recent advances in high polymers, solid-state physics
and crystallography to bring ceramics into the era of aerospace and
electronics engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He was a pioneer in the process of sintering, a form of bonding
that uses temperatures below the melting point and is the most
critical process in modern ceramics manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Kingery's research led to the use of ceramics in oxygen sensors,
fuel cells and a wide variety of electronic components through the
careful selection of raw materials and strict controls of the
manufacturing process. Largely because of that work, producing
high-performance ceramic materials with unique electrical
characteristics _ like extreme heat and pressure resistance,
hardness, and corrosion resistance _ became possible.
</P>
<P>
   The W. David Kingery Award of the American Ceramic Society
honored Kingery's contributions to ceramic technology, science,
education and art worldwide. He was its first recipient, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, he received the Kyoto Prize for materials science and
engineering. The prize is Japan's highest private award in the
field and carries the cachet of a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Born in White Plains, N.Y., he graduated in 1948 from MIT, where
he received a doctorate in ceramics two years later while working
as a research assistant. Kingery rose to full professor at MIT in
1962. In 1988, he joined the Arizona faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Kingery wrote Introduction to Ceramics, a classic textbook on
ceramic materials translated into most major languages, as well as
books on the archaeological history of ceramics and more than 200
scientific papers. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.
</P>
<P>
   Kingery is survived by his wife, Lily Koers Kingery; a son,
William, of Chevy Chase, Md.; a daughter, Rebecca Jones of
Burlington, Mass., a stepson, Bart H. LePoole of Norwalk, Conn.; a
stepdaughter, Marina Vooren of Wichita Falls, Tex.; two brothers,
John M., of Greenwich, Conn., and Robert E., of Charlotte, N.C.;
and 11 grandchildren.

OTHER TEAMS EYE BOTTENFIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Pitcher Kent Bottenfield is drawing attention from
teams around the league looking for pitching help, and there
figures to be more scouts than normal at Edison Field Sunday for
his start against the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels aren't necessarily shopping Bottenfield, but he is in
his free-agent season and so far the Angels haven't made any
attempts to re-sign him beyond this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing going on,'' Bottenfield said of talks with the
Angels. ``I haven't heard anything about their interest in doing
anything. I would assume I'll be a (trade) candidate in the next
few weeks. Being a free agent it's only natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield was acquired along with second baseman Adam Kennedy
in a trade with the Cardinals for Jim Edmonds on March 23. He is
making $4 million this season and said he'd like to talk to the
Angels about returning next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let them know at one point a while back we were interested
in listening,'' Bottenfield said. ``I have high respect for
(manager) Mike (Scioscia) and (pitching coach) Buddy (Black). I
like the players here, I like the situation here. That's where it
was left.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield said his agent contacted the Angels sometime in late
April. But Angels general manager Bill Stoneman said he will not
discuss the contract status of any players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something best left between employer and employee,''
Stoneman said. ``Usually it works better if you don't make it a
public issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, 31, won 18 games last season and was named to the
National League All-Star team. This season he's struggled, going
4-7 with a 5.78 ERA. He also spent time on the disabled list with
tendinitis in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Tim Belcher was suspended and fined and undisclosed
amount for his actions during the game against the Mariners June 27
in Seattle. Belcher disputed a balk call and lost his temper after
being ejected from the game. The Major League office said the
suspension was a result of Belcher arguing excessively and causing
physical contact with an umpire, in this case homeplate umpire Mike
DiMuro.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher is currently on the disabled list with a strained muscle
in his right elbow and cannot begin serving the suspension until he
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Which pitcher on the Angels staff has the best ERA? Would you
believe Mike Fyhrie, at 2.45?
</P>
<P>
   Fyhrie's role is as a long man, which has become important
recently with the abbreviated starts of Belcher and Ken Hill. He
has pitched as long as 4 fr 2/3 innings and been able to keep the
team in the game after falling behind by large margins early.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly a starter, Fyhrie said the transition to long man has
gone smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I went from starter to reliever, so there was a
transition period,'' he said. ``This year I'm more comfortable with
it. When I came into spring training they told me I was going to be
a reliever. So I could focus on that, getting ready quickly and
going right after hitters.''

EDITORIAL: THE FEDERAL DEATH ROW  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 8:
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government cannot by any measure of fairness carry out
executions when there is powerful evidence of racial discrimination
and geographic disparities in the imposition of federal death
sentences. The Clinton administration, which has been unflinching
in its support for capital punishment, is planning to take a small
step in the direction of justice by postponing the execution of
Juan Raul Garza.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, a migrant worker, was sentenced to death in 1993 under
federal law for three drug-related murders in Texas. He is
scheduled to die on Aug. 5, making him the first inmate to face
execution by the federal government in nearly 40 years. The White
House says it will postpone the execution to allow Garza to apply
for clemency from the president under new rules that the Justice
Department will issue soon.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary stay, though welcome, does not address the flaws
in the system that has condemned Garza. This page has long opposed
capital punishment on constitutional and moral grounds. At the very
least President Clinton needs to order a moratorium on all federal
executions until glaring inequities of race and geography can be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The Garza case engages both issues. The government has long had
the duty of protecting racial minorities from discrimination. Yet
racial bias in the federal system is worse than it is in most
states. Of the 21 inmates facing federal death sentences, 17 are
members of racial minorities, and 13 of those are
African-Americans. These are overwhelmingly disproportionate
numbers. Indeed, there is a higher percentage of blacks on federal
death row than in the vast majority of death-penalty states,
including Texas and Alabama. Of the 199 cases in which the Justice
Department authorized the federal death penalty since 1988, 76
percent involved minority defendants, 52 percent of them
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The geographic disparities are also startling. Fourteen of 21
death row inmates are from three states _ Texas, Virginia and
Missouri. Nearly half of the death-penalty requests sent by federal
prosecutors to the Justice Department for review in recent years
came from a handful of federal districts. Yet there are many
federal prosecutors who have not filed any death-penalty requests,
even though there is no reason to believe that the nature of crimes
varies so greatly from city to city. But because prosecutors have
discretion in deciding what crime to charge and whether to offer a
plea bargain, the same crime may lead to death in one jurisdiction
but not in another.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is completing a report on these
disparities. Even Clinton last week acknowledged that he was
disturbed by the racial composition of the death row population and
the fact that ``what your prosecution is may turn solely on where
you committed the crime.'' He needs to act on his observations and
re-examine this grossly unjust system. He cannot allow the Justice
Department, which routinely investigates bias by state and local
governments, to operate a system that disproportionately condemns
minority members to death.

EDITORIAL: AN ILL-CONSIDERED PROSECUTION  

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 8:
</P>
<P>
   In a regrettable denouement to the Clinton impeachment drama, a
former spokesman for Kenneth Starr has been charged with criminal
contempt in an investigation of news leaks stemming from the Monica
Lewinsky inquiry. The former spokesman, Charles Bakaly III, is
scheduled to stand trial beginning next week, according to recently
unsealed court documents.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a front-page article that appeared in The New York
Times on Jan. 31, 1999, in the midst of President Clinton's trial
before the Senate. Citing ``several associates of Mr. Starr'' as
sources, the article reported that Starr had concluded that he had
constitutional authority to indict a sitting president, but had not
decided whether, or when, to seek such an indictment. Bakaly, who
resigned abruptly from Starr's office after an internal
investigation of unauthorized disclosures, said at the time and has
since maintained that he was not a source of the article.
</P>
<P>
   It is the policy of The Times not to discuss sources. But as a
general matter we look askance at crusades by the federal
government to prevent leaks, as they are almost always aimed at
damming up information the American people are entitled to know,
rather than safeguarding any legitimate secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The invocation of the criminal process against Bakaly is
particularly troubling in that the subject matter of the leak _ the
fact that Starr was considering indicting a sitting president _ was
obviously of great national moment. Moreover, a federal appeals
court ruled last September that there was no violation of grand
jury secrecy, and thus nothing illegal, in the discussions Starr
and his aides may have had with reporters about these
deliberations, either for direct attribution or on a background
basis.
</P>
<P>
   To pursue Bakaly under these circumstances on charges that he
lied to investigators seems unduly punitive and extreme. We would
have the same view if the dispute involved another newspaper or
broadcast news outlet. The government is serving no important
public interest with this after-the-fact witch hunt. Rather this
prosecution will chill the news-gathering process in a world where
the public must rely for crucial information on the willingness of
government officials to be forthcoming with reporters.

EDITORIAL: VOTING RIGHTS IN KUWAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 8:
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait is further along the road toward social liberalism than
most of its Persian Gulf neighbors, with a woman at the helm of
Kuwait University, a female ambassador and women outnumbering men
in public schools. But if Kuwaitis are to achieve any semblance of
the country's constitutional guarantee of ``equal rights'' for men
and women, full political rights must be granted to women. That
would serve as an example for other gulf nations that have yet to
give women the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaiti feminists recently suffered a setback when the
constitutional court dismissed cases petitioning for women's voting
rights. Activists and government officials who favor the change
have to push harder on an issue that the nation's Islamist majority
views as a threat to traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait's highest court rejected the cases on procedural grounds.
The plaintiffs had challenged the constitutionality of a law that
grants the vote only to certain men. The law contradicts the
constitution's guarantee of equal rights for men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Since the court is unwilling to act, lobbying pressure must be
applied to parliament. Conservative tribal and Islamist legislators
worked together last year to overturn a decree by the emir, Sheikh
Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, that would have given women the right to
vote and stand for public office. This coalition also narrowly
defeated a suffrage bill, 32-30. The thin margin can be reversed
with energetic campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The cause warrants renewed support from the Council of
Ministers, the prime minister and the emir. The emir and his
cabinet must secure the lead on this issue and take swift steps
toward drafting women's rights measures and mobilizing
parliamentary acceptance of them. Kuwaiti women deserve the support
of their government in their struggle to gain a voice in their
nation's politics.

EDITORIAL: CROATIA'S DEMOCRATIC TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 8:
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans have not generated much good news recently, but
Croatia is a happy exception. Since the death of President Franjo
Tudjman last December and the election of the opposition to the
parliament and presidency, the country has turned away from
authoritarianism and nationalism. While Croatia's parallels with
Serbia are not exact, the rapid change in Croatia's political
culture is an optimistic sign for those suffering under Slobodan
Milosevic's dictatorship. But nationalism could return in Croatia
if the economy continues to slide. Helping the government improve
Croatians' living standards will take more Western support than
Croatia is getting now.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman never attracted the notoriety of Milosevic, but he too
might have been charged with war crimes if he had lived. Tudjman
wanted an ethnically pure Croatia that encompassed all the areas
where Croats live, and his troops carried out atrocities against
Serbs and Muslims. As it turns out, he also stole billions of
dollars and gave the money to friends, family and his political
causes. The larceny was grand enough to have ruined the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The new president, Stipe Mesic, and Prime Minister Ivica Racan
have closed some of Tudjman's intelligence agencies and ended his
harassment of the press and citizens' groups. They have begun
cooperating with the war crimes tribunal, and cut secret funding to
the Croats in Bosnia. They pledge to welcome Croatian Serb refugees
back to Croatia, although their return has been obstructed by local
officials and bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these measures, like the return of Croatian Serbs, are
not wildly popular, and the government will lose public support if
it cannot heal the economy. Croatia needs foreign help in
recovering the stolen money. The EU has promised a slight increase
in economic assistance, but has also eliminated humanitarian aid.
The Clinton administration has promised $35 million in extra aid,
mostly technical assistance, but Congress has delayed it. Croatia's
economy needs reform, but the country needs investment and aid that
can cushion the budget cuts' effects on ordinary people, if they
are not to feel nostalgia for the Tudjman days.

<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Southeast Asia's economies are growing again. Its
stock markets are getting smaller.
</P>
<P>
   If that contrast sounds odd, it is. Last December, economists
and analysts predicted that 2000 would be a boom year for Asian
stocks and currencies. They said foreign investors, enriched with
gains in high-technology stocks, would snap up Indonesian rupiah,
Thai baht and Philippine pesos to buy stocks and bet on the
region's continued recovery from the financial crisis that began in
mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   Those forecasts have gone astray. Foreign investors have sold
Southeast Asian stocks and currencies for much of the year, helping
make several of the region's markets among the worst performing in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and fund managers attribute the sell-off to a
perception that Southeast Asia, despite an economic rebound,
remains a dangerous place to invest because of political
instability, corruption and a lack of technological sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's looking at fundamentals these days,'' said Rebecca H.
Patterson, a currency strategist at J.P. Morgan in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much investment funds from the United States, Europe
and Japan have sold is difficult to determine. Securities exchanges
in some countries, notably Singapore, do not release figures on
foreign trading.
</P>
<P>
   Lipper Analytical Services in New York says that so far this
year at least $230 million had been pulled out of United States
funds that make investments in Asian markets other than Japan's.
But that figure would tend to understate the situation, because it
includes funds investing in popular markets like South Korea,
Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Figures from individual exchanges indicate where withdrawals and
investment losses are worst. The Philippine Stock Exchange reports
that foreigners have sold roughly $172 million more than they have
bought so far this year. In Thailand, foreigners have sold nearly
$700 million more in Thai stocks than they have bought. In
Indonesia, foreigners had a $20 million net withdrawal in the first
five months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the benchmark stock indexes in the region have dropped
25 percent or more, making the 7.5 percent year-to-date decline of
the Dow industrial average look modest. The exchange values of most
Southeast Asian currencies have also fallen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's benchmark stock index is down 25 percent. Combined
with a 31 percent currency-rate decline, Indonesian stocks have
lost nearly 56 percent of their value in dollar terms this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that this may balloon into another crisis,''
said Steven Lim, who manages $500 million in investments in
Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia for Daiwa International, the
Japanese investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lim cites the problems of an Indonesian fishing company, Daya
Guna Samudera, to indicate how the investment statistics apply in
real terms.
</P>
<P>
   Daya Guna has exclusive licenses to catch and export fish and
shrimp from Indonesia's teeming eastern seas. With its costs in
Indonesian rupiah and its revenue in dollars, investing in Daya
Guna seemed like an obvious opportunity last year.
</P>
<P>
   But in December, the company informed investors that its catch
had fallen 15 percent from the previous year. A third of its crew
members, it said, had deserted to escape Muslim-Christian clashes
in the eastern islands, leaving many new fishing vessels idle and
the company in difficulty with creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Seen more broadly, missing fishermen are the least of problems
Indonesia is having with foreign investors now.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, Muslim rebels in the west, secessionists in the
east and sectarian clashes on the islands in between have crippled
confidence. Skirmishing between President Abdurrahman Wahid, his
central bank chief and his cabinet have left the economy
rudderless.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat similar troubles are souring investor sentiment
elsewhere in the region. In the Philippines, insurgents in two
separate Muslim rebellions have brought bombings to the capital and
have kept 20 scuba divers hostage on a jungle island for nearly two
months _ situations that do little to entice foreign capital. Nor
has an insider-trading scandal involving a friend of President
Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Thailand is tamer. But a two-year court battle
between the founder of a local plastics maker and its bankers has
underlined the troubles still faced by Thai banks as they try to
recover the 40 percent of their loans that borrowers cannot or will
not repay. Banks make up roughly a quarter of the benchmark stock
index, leading Peggy Creveling, who heads Salomon Smith Barney's
research in Thailand, to ask, ``how can the market go up?''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian stocks, which had been rising this year in
anticipation of their inclusion again in global market indexes,
have lately succumbed to the exodus of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   And Singapore, famously stable and in the midst of an economic
liberalization campaign, is suffering the effects of living in a
tough neighborhood.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I don't get it,'' said Chia Yeng Boo, 53, a Singaporean
investor, as he watched local stock prices dwindle on a television
screen. ``The economy keeps getting better, but the stocks keep
going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Local investors expecting a flood of foreign funds this year
helped fuel a powerful rally late in 1999, particularly in
electronics and telecommunications stocks. Their logic: when
Nasdaq's bulls came to bank on a Southeast Asian recovery, they
would look for anything remotely related to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But smaller markets in the region lacked sufficient Internet
appeal for foreign investors. There were just not enough high-end
exports, dot-com stock offerings or flashy Internet market
statistics, analysts say, to match markets in Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq rout in technology shares in April made things even
worse. Investors, rather than seizing an opportunity to jump into
fundamental economic stories like Southeast Asia's, simply lost
their appetite for any risk.
