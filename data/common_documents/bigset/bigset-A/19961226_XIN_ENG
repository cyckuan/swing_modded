<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Partner Chief Calls for Party Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the National
Democratic Party (RPP), the second ruling party in Nepal, today
called for party unity after the three-party government survived a
no-confidence motion Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
RPP President Surya Bahadur Thapa in a press statement issued
today urged all workers and leaders of his party to shun a sense
of defeat or victory and move ahead unitedly.
</P>
<P>
A no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba of the Nepali Congress (NC) and his coalition government,
filed by the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML), the main opposition party, was defeated Tuesday at a
special session of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Nine MPs of the RPP, including its parliamentary leader
Lokendra Bahadur Chand, voted in favor of the opposition-sponsored
motion.
</P>
<P>
The censure motion failed with 101 MPs voting for it and 84 MPs
against it in the lower house. It requires a majority of 103 votes
to pass in the 205-seat house.
</P>
<P>
Despite a whip issued by Chand ordering RPP's all 19 MPs to
withdraw their support for the government and vote for the
no-confidence motion, the RPP president and his supporters in the
party chose to remain in the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that the RPP split up into two factions after
disputes between the two leaders over the no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition CPN-UML earlier offered to form a new
RPP-UML coalition government with Chand as prime minister if the
present government was ousted through the motion.

<HEADLINE> Japan Unveils 1997 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government today
endorsed a 77.39 trillion yen (704 billion U.S. dollars) budget
for the next fiscal year starting from April 1997.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 budget jumped 3.0 percent over the initial budget for
1996. But its growth rate, however, is down from the 5.8 percent
for the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, general expenditures will edge up 1.5 percent
from the current fiscal year to 43.81 trillion yen (398 billion
dollars), the smallest growth since a 1.2 percent rise in the
fiscal year of 1988.
</P>
<P>
Fresh issuance of government bonds for the next fiscal year
will be cut by 4.3 trillion yen (39 billion dollars) from a record
21 trillion yen (191 billion dollars) in the fiscal 1996,
reflecting Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's pledge to rebuild
the deficit-ridden state coffers.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of state revenues mainly stems from an additional
burden of nine trillion yen (82 billion dollars) on the people --
a rise in consumption, increased medical premiums, and
discontinuation of special income tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
The budget draft will be submitted to the next regular session
of the Diet, starting in January, for approval.

ULAN BATOR, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia has launched an
anti-alcoholism campaign, warning government officials that they

STOCKHOLM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The year 1996 has been

ISLAMABAD, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today appealed to the masses to elect honest and
trustworthy representatives in the forthcoming general elections
scheduled for February 3 next year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation on radio and TV, Leghari hoped that the
composition of next national and provincial assemblies would be
better than the previous ones.
</P>
<P>
On the accountability process, the president said "all that the
caretaker government has done so far to bring to the book the real
culprits is quite encouraging."
</P>
<P>
The process of accountability was slow in the first half of the
caretaker period due to known but unavoidable reasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the coming days would witness a speedy process of
accountability according to the wishes of the nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The accountability process could effectively deal with corrupt
elements in the highest echelons of government and public life.
</P>
<P>
"We have done our best to block the way of the corrupt people
to the parliament. Now the rest is up to you to elect
representatives of integrity," Leghari said.

<HEADLINE> Two Qataris Imprisoned for Spying in Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Bahraini State Security
Court today condemned two Qatari citizens to three years
imprisonment for spying, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
According to a Gulf news agency report from the Bahraini
capital of Manama, the court has found both Fahd Ahmed al Bakir
and Salwa Jassim Fakhri (female) guilty.
</P>
<P>
The two Qataris were on the charge of providing information to
a foreign country with the object of harming the military and
political status of Bahrain. And they were found to receive funds
from overseas for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
In addition the Qataris were charged with divulging classified
defense information, and criminal complicity.
</P>
<P>
The two were also imposed a fine of a 1,000 Bahraini dinars
(about 2,600 U.S. dollars) for each.
</P>
<P>
The two Qatari suspects were arrested by Bahraini authorities
about two months ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Al Bakir held the post of
communications technician at a Qatari security agency, and had
earlier accompanied Qatari officials on official visits to various
Gulf, Arab and foreign countries, including several visits to
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Fakhri is a Qatari woman married to a Bahraini citizen named
Ahmed Hassan Youssef. She used to reside in Bahrain before and
during marriage and after her divorce in 1989. She lived with her
relatives as well as her Bahrain-born daughter.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the trial of the two accused coincided with the
opening of the 17th summit conference of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states in the Qatari capital, Doha.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain boycotted the GCC summit in view of its time-long
border dispute with Qatar, while Qatar holds Bahrain responsible
for the deterioration of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture of support, Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Ben
Khalifa al Thani reportedly paid a visit to the family of the
accused Fahd al Bakri.

<HEADLINE> Diplomat: Omani Has No Contacts With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Oman today formally inform the
Arab League (AL) that it has recently decided to suspend all forms
of contacts with Israel in light of the Israeli procrastination in
peace negotiations with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here, Omani representative Hamad Abdullah
Bousaeedy briefed AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid on his
country suspension of contacts of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"In the light of Israel's non-abidance with the signed
agreements, Oman decided to stop all contacts with Israel until
the Israeli side makes some progress with the Arab negotiators,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs entered the peace march because they were convinced
of the necessity of realizing a comprehensive and just peace, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Oman sees no genuine or real progress made
regarding the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Bousaeedy voiced his hope that the year 1997 would witness
further positive steps, noting that this requires the commitment
of all parties concerned to promote the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Oman was engaged in official contacts with Israel for
years. Following the opening of the Israeli interests office in
Oman in mid-May, the sultanate established in August a trade
office in Tel Aviv, Israel, becoming the seventh Arab nation to
have a diplomatic representation in the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> PA, Israel Remove Sticking Points in Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators are trying to hammer out a timetable for implementing
rest parts of the autonomy accords after removing several sticking
points, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today, quoting
Palestinian sources.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators met today in Jerusalem to wrap up a deal on Israeli
withdrawal from Hebron after a meeting between Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser
Arafat has moved the two sides closer to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insisted the conclusion of the executive
protocol on Hebron be linked to Israel's withdrawal from the B and
C areas in the West Bank under U.S. and Egyptian guarantees, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
But the Israelis pledged to pull out of the B areas within
weeks from the signing of the Hebron deal and from the C areas
later.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, the Israelis should go out of the B and
C areas surrounding the Palestinian cities in the West Bank in the
transitional phase.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Israel dropped its reservations over the
opening of the Hussein market and giving the Palestinians right of
passage in the Shohada Street.
</P>
<P>
Israel also gave up its demand for hot pursuit of extremist
suspects into Palestinian-controlled areas and allow Palestinian
police to carry rifles in self-controlled areas but only pistols
on the points of tangency.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Israelis will inform the other side of their security
requests while the Palestinians will communicate to them the
findings of investigations and take measures they deem
appropriate, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to run joint patrols in the city of
Hebron with both sides having equitable armament.
</P>
<P>
However, they could not agree on the routes or timing of the
joint patrols.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Israelis and the Palestinians split
as yet on the role of the PA on the Ibrahimi Mosque since Israel
is strongly opposed to any Palestinian presence.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis seek outright security control on the mosque which
would open the door wide for the Jewish settlers to occupy the
place and block the Palestinians' access to the mosque, the
sources complained.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troop pullout was delayed after a series of suicide
bombings in Israel in February and March. It was further stalled
over Netanyahu's insistence on better security for the 450 Jewish
settlers living among the 120,000 Palestinians in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
A deal on Hebron would be the first major progress in the peace
process since the new Israeli government took office in June.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that there will be letters of assurances to tie
the deal to some outstanding issues that Israel failed to
implement.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Oslo accords, Israel should have
released prisoners, opened a secure corridor between the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip and resolved the problem related to the Gaza
Airport.

<HEADLINE> Credit-Card Delinquencies in US Up in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 25 (Xinhua) -- More Americans failed to
pay their credit-card bills on time in the third quarter and U.S.
banks continued to tighten lending limits, AP reported today.
</P>
<P>
As of September 30, 1.83 percent of credit-card debt in the
U.S. was 90 days or more overdue, up from 1.68 percent in the
second quarter, it reported by quoting a study by Veribanc Inc., a
banking research company in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase followed a drop in delinquencies during the
prior quarter and came as U.S. banks are working to forestall
credit abuse during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
Delinquency rates for credit-card debt in the U.S. had been
increasing steadily since year-end 1994 except the second quarter
of this year. The level of delinquencies dipped to 1.68 percent of
all outstanding charges in the quarter from 1.70 percent in the
first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
But with the resumption of growth in the third quarter,
"credit-card delinquency is now at levels not seen since early
1992, when the effects of the 1991 recession were strong," the
study said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, credit-card issuers have continued to boost
lending limits, signaling that "consumers and banks could
encounter more problems in 1997, particularly if usual seasonal
credit expansion occurs during the fourth quarter of 1996,"
Veribanc Inc. said in the study.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, consumer bankruptcies in the U.S. topped a record 1
million for the 12 months through September 30, a 27.2 percent
increase from the same period a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blasts Kill Two, Injure 80 Near Cape Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 24 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were
killed and 80 others were wounded on Christmas Eve by two bomb
blasts in a shopping center in Worcester, about 100 kilometers
northeast of Cape Town in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The center was packed with people doing last-minute Christmas
shopping when the first explosion was heard shortly after 13:00
p.m., the South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted witnesses
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The explosion caused great damages to the shopping center. A
section of the center's roof was blown away with glass shattering
all over the place, a witness said.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the first bomb exploded, another bomb ripped off at
a pharmacy close to the shopping center, a witnesses said. He
said the blast wave broke the window of the drug store.
</P>
<P>
The two explosions were apparently caused by homemade
time-bombs, according to Cape Town's police superintendent Leon
Engelbrecht.
</P>
<P>
The injured people including a number of children have been
taken to nearby hospitals. After the blasts, the police had
cordoned off the spots while bomb and forensic experts were
sifting through the debris.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) issued a statement
later today expressing condolences to families of those who died
in the explosions. It also condemned the bomb blasts, and called
on the police to do their best to identify and punish the
criminals.

whose jurisdiction will extend to Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after receiving a 10-man committee report on maritime
safety here today, the Minister For Communication and Transport,

need for the government to formulate a comprehensive policy on marine
requirements and uses.
</P>
<P>
The committee wants the policy to encompass marine transport,
fisheries, marine mining, port state control, maritime safety, marine

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ethiopia Strives to Double Income in 15  Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has recently set
a target to double its per-capita income in 15 years which
envisages an average annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) at seven percent.
</P>
<P>
This expresses the government's commitment to alleviate
poverty and backwardness and bring about a sustained economic
development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, as the third most populous country in Africa after
Nigeria and Egypt, is one of the 33 least developed
countries in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's poverty and the associated legacy of a long and
devastating war have made the country one of the most
economically backward nation in the world, with per head GDP
being about 100 U. S. Dollars a year in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ethiopian government has emphasized that "the
overriding objective should be the replacement of the command
economy by an economic stem driven by market forces" since it
came to power in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable progress has been made in economic development
after the government adopted the new economic policy.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement made by the Ethiopian government,
during the reform program for the period 1992-95 under the new
government, the average of annual real GDP rate of growth was 7.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Ethiopia's economy rebounded to grow by 10.4
percent in 1995-96, the highest record during the recent years
and above the average growth rate of African countries.
</P>
<P>
It should be mentioned that the agricultural sector accounts
for about 50 percent of GDP of the country. Ethiopia has achieved
a good harvest for the second consecutive year in 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
In 1995/96, the agricultural sector registered a 14 percent
growth rate as peasants, encouraged by the favorable climate
conditions, peace and stability, and market based economic
development policies, increased their acreage of cultivated land
as well as productivity through a relatively increased use
of modern agro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
The nation has attained for the first time in history almost
self-sufficiency in grain in 1996.
</P>
<P>
To concentrate its effort to alleviate poverty and improve the
living standard of the people, the Ethiopian government has set
the target to double per capita income in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the declared aim of the government, it has planned
that the GDP of the nation to grow at an annual rate of 7-8
percent and the population growth reduced from the current three
percent to two percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has adopted its second reform
program for the period 1996-99. The new medium-term
program is aimed to reduce poverty through a broad based economic
growth in a stable macro-economic environment.
</P>
<P>
Major elements of the program for the three year period
consist of acceleration of privatization, further liberalization
of exchange regime, civil service reform, rehabilitating the
environment and building of physical infrastructure,
strengthening of human resources based of the economy, promoting
family planning, extending fully budgeted social safety net
measures to mitigate social cost of adjustment.
</P>
<P>
During the three years, the program envisages an average
annual growth rate of real GDP of at least seven percent, which
would require public and private investment equivalent of over 21
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Annual average rate of inflation would remain around two
percent, and external current account deficit at about nine
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
To support Ethiopia's effort to alleviate poverty and
sustainedly develop its economy, the donor community who attended
the recent third consultative meeting here for Ethiopia has
pledged 2.5 billion U. S. Dollars over the next three year
period.
</P>
<P>
The pledged assistance will mainly support Ethiopia's
strategies on improving food security, education and health.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's challenge is formidable but its future is bright.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank representative said at the consultative meeting
that "Ethiopia's economy has the potential to grow at a sustained
rate of 7-8 percent over 15 years, particularly in the light of
recent performance and given how far it is from the world's
technological frontier. but this will require intensified,
sustained reform efforts."

<HEADLINE> Only 112 White Chinese Dolphins Remain in HK Waters: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 26 (Xinhua) -- There are only 112 white
Chinese dolphins remaining in the Hong Kong waters, which means a
40 percent drop in number from the figure registered three years
ago, according to a research report.
</P>
<P>
Most deaths have occurred among the young ones, or "baby
dolphins," the local newspaper Hong Kong Daily News reported
today.
</P>
<P>
It was found through the three-year-long research that the rare
 species are on the verge of distinction, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Environmental pollution has been blamed mainly for the deaths
of the dolphins, especially the young ones which could not
withstand the toxic materials, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Among the white dolphins which died last year, eight were baby
dolphins below two-year-old as compared with only one among the 11
 deaths recorded a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Tissue analysis of the eight white dolphins which died this
year showed that they died from high-level poisonous traces inside
 their bodies, which are believed to be the result of a toxic
contamination of the water.
</P>
<P>
Noise and pesticide pollution are believed to be other factors
affecting the normal life of the species, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The experts who took part in the research called for more
effective measures to save the rare species.

<HEADLINE> Senior Leaders Praise Law on Township Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese senior government
leaders today stressed the importance of a new law on township
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
They called its enforcement next year a "great event with
strategic importance for the growth of the national economy".
</P>
<P>
At a Beijing forum on Township Enterprise Law, which comes into
effect on January 1, 1997, Tian Jiyun, vice chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
China's legislature, said that the law is key to the sustained,
steady, and sound development of the country's township industries.
</P>
<P>
"It has not only reaffirmed the important status of the
township industry in the national economy, but also mapped out the
general principles and strategy guiding its internal reforms and
development," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Calling township industries "a great creation of the farmers",
vice premier Jiang Chunyun pointed out that the industry has
established itself as a "major pillar of China's rural economy",
playing a vital role in absorbing the country's huge rural surplus
labor.
</P>
<P>
He demanded government departments at all levels fully
understand the significance of the law on township enterprises,
and try to improve the management of the township industry in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
"Township enterprises need legal protection for their
development, and their business operation must be regulated and
standardized by the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, told today's
forum that people's congresses at all levels across the country
must take effective measures to enhance the supervision on the
enforcement of the township enterprise law.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Prime Minister Asked to Resign Immediately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Nepal's
opposition party and a faction of one ruling partner today asked
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to resign immediately as his
coalition government has lost majority parliamentary support.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference here today, both President
of the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN-UML) Man Mohan Adhikari and
parliamentary leader of the National Democratic Party (RPP)
Lokendra Bahadur Chand said that it is clear that a majority of
the existing members of parliament are against the government.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali three-party governmsion of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
However, Only 84 MPs of the 205-seat lower house voted against
the no-trust motion while 101 MPs were in favor of it.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution of Nepal, such a censure motion required
a majority of 103 votes to pass in the house. The Nepali lower
house currently has five vacant seats.
</P>
<P>
Nine MPs of the second ruling partner RPP including its senior
leader Chand voted against the government after the party split
into two factions respectively led by him and party president
Surya Bahadur Thapa, who decided to remain in the ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Chand earlier announced to withdraw support to the government
and was expected to led a new RPP-UML government if the present
government was ousted through the motion. But some RPP MPs loyal
to Thapa defied a whip issued by Chand ordering them to vote
against the government.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the government of preventing some MPs, who were
supposed to vote for the no-trust motion, from attending the house
voting, Adhikari and Chand disclosed at today's press conference
that they will go to court and try to garner public support by
organizing street demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML president also said preparations are being made to
seek legal remedy against the ruling of House Speaker Ram Chandra
Poudel, who is from the main ruling NC party, that the no-trust
motion was defeated.
</P>
<P>
Disciplinary action will be initiated against those RPP MPs who
voted against the motion because of their defiance of the party's
instructions, RPP leader Chand told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
The RPP MPs voting against the no-trust motion included Foreign
Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani and Water Resources Minister
Pashupati J.B. Rana.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Called for Tightening Control of Mineral Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua today
called for efforts to deepen the reform of management of mineral
resources to promote a fast and healthy development of China's
mining industry.
</P>
<P>
Zou told an on-going national working conference on geology and
mineral resources that the revised law on mineral resources, which
will come into force on January 1, 1997, signals an important step
for mineral resources in a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
"It means that China's control over the use of mineral
resources is entering a new historical stage," Zou said, calling
on all the government departments and governments in localities to
step up their work to improve the management of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
The use of all the mineral resources, including petroleum,
natural gas, rare-earth minerals and gold, should be subject to a
regional management system, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to work hard to streamline order in the mineral
industry, to crack down on exploration without licenses and other
illegal mining activities, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
Use of mineral resources is closely related to environmental
protection, he stressed, adding that efforts should be made to
save mineral resources, and make a comprehensive use of mineral
resources by combining the development of mineral industry and
protection of environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
The 61-year-old Hata and his 12 followers broke away with
Shinshinto following a bitter row with Shinshinto leader Ichiro
Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
Hata and Ichiro Ozawa, both Shinshinto leaders and longtime
political allies, squabbled over ways to oppose their former party
-- the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The two politicians had spent decades in the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) before 1993 when they quited the party and
founded Shinshinto in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Shinshinto seized 146 seats in the 500-member House of
Representatives and 65 in the 252-member House of Councillors in
general elections last October.
</P>
<P>
Hata said that his new party, consisting mostly of former
Shinshinto members, would work together with Shinshinto and other
parties to promote economic and administrative reforms.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that Hata's Taiyoto, which calls for
streamlining the bureaucracy and carrying out fiscal reform, was
barely different from Shinshinto.
</P>
<P>
Hata was prime minister for two months before he was ousted in
1994 and replaced by an LDP-dominated coalition.
</P>
<P>
The coalition, initially headed by Socialist prime minister
Tomiichi Murayama, has been led by Ryiutaro Hashimoto since last
January.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesian Economy Cools Down, Tight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has said recently that the government will continue its austerity
fiscal and monetary policies despite signs that the country's
economy is cooling down.
</P>
<P>
Significant drops in the inflation rate and the growth of
imports in 1996 indicated that the economy has started to cool
down, economic analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government and many economists late last year
voiced fear that the country's economy in 1995 was overheating due
to an inflation rate of as high as 8.64 percent and a current
account deficit of 7.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deficit was widened by an import growth of as high as 32.1
percent, as compared with a 13.5 percent increase in exports.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to reduce the high rate of inflation, Bank
Indonesia, the central bank, was ordered to increase the banking
reserve requirement, an amount of cash banks have to deposit with
the central bank, from 2 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other moves to keep money supply growth at a healthy level
included the improvement of regulations on non-bank multi-finance
companies and on the issuance of commercial papers by such
companies.
</P>
<P>
The combination of monetary policies proved to be effective in
maintaining money supply growth at a level of only around 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, this year's inflation is likely to be kept below 7
percent, down from 8.64 percent last year and 9.24 percent in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative inflation for the first 11 months of this year
stood only at 5.92 percent, compared with 7.85 percent for the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The country also recorded monthly deflation three times this
year. A month-on-month deflation rate of minus 0.61 percent was
reported in March, minus 0.07 percent in July and minus 0.04
percent in September.
</P>
<P>
This year's annual inflation rate, however, would still be
higher than the government's target of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline in inflation is actually the result of not only the
tight money policies but also the government's efforts to smoothen
procurement of goods by the people, especially foodstuffs, and the
distribution of those goods that contributed most to inflation.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers in charge of economic affairs and even
President Soeharto himself always make great efforts to ensure the
smooth distribution of the public's basic necessities.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government provided special fiscal
facilities and issued packages of deregulatory measures,
especially for export-oriented investments, to boost exports.
</P>
<P>
As a result, exports this year have exceeded imports.
</P>
<P>
Imports grew by a mere 6.68 percent to 28.28 billion U.S.
dollars during the first eight months of this year from 26.5
billion dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports jumped by 10 percent to 31.87 billion
dollars, compared to 28.97 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite the cooling-down trend of the economy, the government
looks set to continue the austerity policy as some problems such
as the current account deficit and huge foreign debt remain
unsolved or even have become worse.
</P>
<P>
The tight money policy has kept domestic interest rates high in
1996 although there has been repeated calls from public and
private sectors for lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Deposit rates stay at some 17 percent while lending rates are
at some 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Indonesia's current account deficit will
widen to 8.7 billion dollars in fiscal 1996/97 (April-March), or
about 4 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), from 6.9
billion dollars, or about 3.2 percent of GDP, in fiscal 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the country's foreign debt currently stands
at around 100 billion dollars with the private sector accounting
for slightly over half of it, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The problems must be properly handled as sooner or later they
will exert adverse impacts on the country's economy, Bank
Indonesia Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono said.
</P>
<P>
At a year-end cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Soeharto pledged to
further deregulate the country's fast-growing economy by easing
government red tape and continuing to privatize state firms.
</P>
<P>
"Monetary stabilization efforts will continue until 1997 to
curb inflation and current account deficit so that our economy
will grow in a sustainable manner," Soedradjad said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad pledged that the
government would continue to produce a surplus in its budget to
cool down the economy.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economy was estimated to grow by over 7 percent
this year, lower than the 8.1 percent recorded last year, and is
projected to remain buoyant next year despite the general election
scheduled for May.

<HEADLINE> Importance of Safety in Production Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo today
called for effective steps to enhance workplace safety in the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remark at a national televised working conference
stressing the importance of safety in production.
</P>
<P>
"Safety has a great bearing on lives and property of the
people, and on the country's social stability," he said, urging
leading officials at all levels to spare no efforts and be alert
to the issue of safety.
</P>
<P>
The system of responsibility for safe production should be
carried out strictly, and detailed goals and regulations of the
system should be worked out, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of safety work in 1997, Wu said that new and higher
requirements for safe production should be set up in order to
achieve a sustained, fast and healthy development of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that efforts should be redoubled to curb the number of
major accidents, while resolute measures should be taken to stop
production, if necessary, so that hidden troubles can be dealt
with.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to provide basic construction and technical
innovation projects with sufficient funds for safety measures, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
To push forward the standardization of safety, a whole set of
scientific safety standards and management methods should be
endorsed from every factory to every work post, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the work of safety should be subject to strict
supervision in accordance with law, Wu said, adding that close
attention should be paid to education and training in
safety.

<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan Studies Society
held a symposium today in Beijing, with the theme of reviewing the
situation in Taiwan and the relationship between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Scholars from the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences as well as from related departments,
and officials from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation and the Ministry of Communications attended the
symposium.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Dianming, vice-president and secretary-general of the
Taiwan Studies Society presided over the symposium.
</P>
<P>
He said pro-"Taiwan Independence" forces were greatly
restrained this year, thanks to opposition from the Chinese people
both at home and overseas.
</P>
<P>
But the Taiwan authorities have not yet given up their attempt
to split the country by creating "two Chinas", or "one China, one
Taiwan", he noted.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his hope that the participants will earnestly sum up
the development of cross-straits relations this year, and analyze
the future developments for next year, in an effort to promote to
a peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Experts and scholars present criticized the Taiwan authorities
for hastely turning around and harshly restricting cross-straits
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that interference by the Taiwan authorities in
the cross-straits situation, through political and executive
means, will not take effect for a long time, and it will be the
industrial circles and people in Taiwan that will suffer.
</P>
<P>
They also put forward opinions on how to relax cross-straits
relations, how to resume talks between the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and the Straits Exchange
Foundation, and how to boost economic cooperation, as well as
direct postal, commercial and transport links between the two
sides.

<HEADLINE> Japan Annoyed at Uruguay's Release of Peruvian Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today expressed annoyance with Uruguay over the release
of two Peruvian guerrillas, whose colleagues are holding more than
100 hostages at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, Kyodo
News reported.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said the move has complicated negotiations for the
freedom of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrillas freed
the Uruguayan ambassador to Peru on Tuesday following the Uruguay
government's release of two of their fellow members.
</P>
<P>
"The Uruguay government has explained that there was no link
between them. We don't know whether it is true or not, but it is
true that it has made a solution to the case difficult," Kyodo
quoted Hashimoto as telling reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot surrender to terrorism," he said, adding that Japan
will continue to seek safety of the hostages and their immediate
release, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, about 20 MRTA gunmen stormed Japanese Ambassador
Morihisa Aoki's residence in Lima and took hostage hundreds of
diplomats and dignitaries from all over the world, who were
attending a reception to mark Japanese Emperor Akihito's birthday.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas released part of the hostages in several
batches, but are still holding more than 100.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Promises Higher Fertilizer Subsidy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister H.D.
Deve Gowda today assured farmers of continuation of subsidy on
phosphatic fertilizers and doubling of rural credit during the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002) which commences on April 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the assurance at a meeting on the
outskirts of the capital today, Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
Dispelling the impression that the government was removing
fertilizer subsidy, Gowda clarified that the prices of the farm
input had gone up recently due to the hike in prices in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
The farmers would be compensated through higher subsidy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture would be given the top most priority in the Ninth
Five-Year Plan, he stated, noting that agriculture continued to be
the backbone of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed regret over the falling
investment, both by public and private sectors, in the farming
area.
</P>
<P>
Efforts would be made in the ninth plan to step up the rate of
investment and to enlarge cooperative credit to farmers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Gowda, born in a farmer's family, has always adopted a
pro-farmer approach. But it is believed that too much subsidy to
farmers would jeopardize the government's main theme to reduce the
budget deficit to below five percent of gross domestic product.

<TEXT>
<P>
Several other highway enterprises, including Chengyu
(Chengdu-Chongqing) Expressway Company, Huning (Shanghai-Nanjing)
Expressway Company, and Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo)
Expressway Company, are applying for listings on overseas stock
markets, sources say.
</P>
<P>
The Anhui Expressway issued 493 million H-shares on November
13, the first Chinese highway business to be listed on an overseas
stock market, obtaining 873 million Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company is one of the few with shares at the current
transaction price surpassing the original issue price among the 23
state-owned enterprises listed on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange. Its one-share price now stands at nearly two Hong Kong
dollars, compared with 1.77 Hong Kong dollars, the issue price.
</P>
<P>
The Anhui Expressway will purchase the operation right of
Tianchang section of No. 205 national highway, which links
Shanhaiguan in north China's Hebei Province and Guangzhou, capital
of south China's Guangdong Province, early January of next
year. Tianchang is a city in Anhui.
</P>
<P>
Tianchang highway opened on a trial basis today. Wang Shui,
board director of the Anhui Expressway, told Xinhua by telephone
that test operations show that the road is of high quality and has
complete auxiliary facilities.
</P>
<P>
The daily flow of vehicles is expected to reach 14,000 by the
year 2000. When the Anhui Expressway takes over the road its
business of collecting tolls will be expanded.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Anhui Expressway operates on Hening
(Hefei-Nanjing) Expressway, valued at 2.5 to 2.8 billion yuan,
with a total length of 134 km. The expressway is a part of the
national trunk line from Shanghai to Chengdu, and also a section
of No. 312 national highway linking Shanghai and Yining in
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Highway Builders to Seek More Funds from Overseas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans to seek more funds
on overseas stock markets to build highways, following the
successful listing of Anhui Expressway Company Limited on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange last month.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed today by Zhang Wensheng, director of the
Restructuring Economic System and Legislation Department of the
Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Zhang said that overseas stock
markets will provide a new channel for funding for highway
construction, to replenish the short supply of funds needed for
road building.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 65 billion US dollars are needed for
China's highway construction in the coming five years, and
shortfalls will be as large as 15 to 25 percent. The Ministry of
Communications hopes that overseas investment can contribute about
ten percent of the funds needed.
</P>
<P>
Funds for building of highways now have three sources in China
-- investment of central and local governments, overseas and
domestic loans, and a small amount of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Traffic experts say that the existing funding sources will see
no marginal increase in the near future, and new investment
sources are badly needed.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the Shenzhen Expressway Development Company
Limited of Guangdong Province will also issue H-shares at an
appropriate time, with approval from the securities administration
departments of the Chinese government.

<TEXT>
<P>
Anhui is projected to build 5,000 km of roads, including 650 km
of high-grade highways, during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000), bringing the total length of highways to 40,000 km in
the province, including 1,000 km of high-grade
highways. Construction of the roads will cost about 20 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The provincial communications department originally planned to
lure investment from foreign business people or companies. These
businesses, however, showed little interest in highway projects,
which need huge investments and a long time period to gain small
returns.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shui said that to list highway enterprises on overseas
stock markets is an effort to solve the funding shortage problem.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wensheng, an official of the Ministry of Communications,
said that economic performance of developed countries has been
sluggish in recent years, leaving large amounts of idle money
seeking investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, foreign investors have already bought
share-holding or management rights of a number of highways, and
have listed the roads on stock markets, which enhanced their
knowledge of China's highway enterprises, and the confidence for
highway stock prospects.
</P>
<P>
Priority is to be given to the development of traffic and
transport industries in China. The country encourages highway
construction, Zhang said, adding that highway transport is bound
to increase, with the rapid expansion of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Highway companies have a stable income by collecting tolls from
motorists, which can guarantee basic returns for share holders,
Zhang analyzed.

TOKYO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Former president of Japan's
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Yohei Kono warned Wednesday
that the international community would not accept attempts to
delete accounts of "comfort women" from Japanese history textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Kono made the remarks in an interview with the Japanese
newspaper Asahi Shimbun, in an apparent response to the call of
some LDP members for removing chapters concerning "comfort women"
from school textbooks.
</P>
<P>
He said results of a government investigation showed that all
"comfort women" were sex slaves forced into prostitution by
Japanese troops during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Kono stressed that nothing is more important than helping
Japanese students develop a correct understanding of historical
facts.
</P>
<P>
When serving as chief cabinet secretary in the Miyazawa
government from 1991 to 1993, Kono made public the results of the

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Fruitful Diplomatic Year (part 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On many occasions, Mahathir served notice to developed nations
that they cannot use strongarm tactics to impose on others trading
rules, which should be agreed upon through negotiations and by
taking into account the different levels of economic development
among the countries involved.
</P>
<P>
He often puts forward new ideas on important world issues,
leaving a lasting impression upon other world leaders.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the notion that the next century would be the
century of Asia, Mahathir termed the 21st century as the century
of the world and proposed that Asia and America form a joint
venture to create a single global commonwealth to realize this.
</P>
<P>
Gaining growing influence in the world, Malaysia is also known
to stick to its views on certain issues despite threats of
sanctions from Western countries. Defying the U.S. threat to apply
sanctions, Malaysia's national petroleum company went ahead with
its decision to take up a 30-percent stake in Iran's Sirri A and E
oil fields.
</P>
<P>
This year was another busy year for Mahathir who visited 25
countries including Thailand, Vietnam, New Zealand, Croatia,
Bosnia, Brunei, Japan, Kazakhstan, China, Portugal, Guinea, Ghana,
Trinidad and Tobago, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, the United
States, France and India.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year, officials of the Foreign Ministry were
kept busy rolling out the red carpet for a record total of 16
heads of government and state who visited the country.
</P>
<P>
Among them were the then Australian Prime Minister Paul
Keating, the first visitor of the year, and the prime ministers of
Canada, Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Myanmar as well as
the presidents of Kazakhstan, Uruguay, Argentina, Malawi,
Indonesia, Peru and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The visits further improved relations and strengthened
cooperation between Malaysia and these countries.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Malaysian relations have been further expanded following
Mahathir's fourth visit to China this year.
</P>
<P>
In full support of China as a friendly nation as opposed to the
Western belief that China could be a threat, Mahathir stressed
repeatedly that the China threat perception is far from correct.
</P>
<P>
He said it is high time to stop seeing China through the lenses
of threat and fully view China as the enormous opportunity that it
is.
</P>
<P>
Search for new markets for its products and investment
opportunities has been the main feature of Malaysia's diplomatic
activities this year.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's visit to China, for instance, saw
multi-million-dollar Sino-Malaysian ventures set up in power,
automobiles and auto components, telecommunications and
food-related industries.
</P>
<P>
To develop good relations and cooperation among the ASEAN
members has been one of the priorities in Malaysia's foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, a leading ASEAN member, sticks to the policy of
"constructive engagement" towards Myanmar and has vowed its
support for Myanmar's membership in the regional grouping at an
early date despite political pressure from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The year also marked a turning point in the protracted talks
between Malaysia and Indonesia over their overlapping claims to
the two islands of Ligitan and Sipadan as the two neighbors agreed
to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice for
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the maturing diplomatic performance, observers
said Malaysia would continue to play an active and even greater
role in the international arena in the future.

DAMASCUS, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara will head a delegation to attend the meetings of
the Damascus Declaration signatories due to be held in Cairo next
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources here, foreign ministers of the
Damascus Declaration signatories will examine the latest
developments in the Middle East, particularly the peace process,
as well as their attitude towards the accusations by the United
Arab Emirates of Iran's military presence in three islands
claimed by both of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the UAE disputed over the sovereignty on the Abu Musa
Island in the Gulf after Iran claimed complete rule over the
island, a tiny but strategically-located island in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the two countries reached an agreement to co-rule the
Abu Musa island after Iran took over half of it.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, which will be attended by
foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and those
of Egypt and Syria, the delegations will examine ways of creating
an executive schedule for the Damascus Declaration agreement
signed in the Syrian capital following the 1991 Gulf war, which
stipulates that joint security and military arrangements, in
addition to economic cooperation among signatories, should be
brought into existence.

KUALA LUMPUR, December 26 (Xinhua) -- In the outgoing 1996, the
independent and peaceful foreign policy pursued by Malaysia bore
golden fruit with the election of its permanent representative to
the United Nations as the president of the U.N. General Assembly
(UNGA).
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Razali Ismail was unanimously elected president of
the 51st session of the UNGA in New York on September 17, and
this reflected the international community's respect for Malaysia
and Kuala Lumpur's effective diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The year also saw Malaysia playing an international role by
taking over the chairmanship of several international groupings,
including the Group of 15 developing nations and the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The conferment of the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International
Understanding on its Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, an event
winding up the diplomatic year, was an honor not only for Mahathir
himself but also for the whole country.
</P>
<P>
In conferring the award in New Delhi about a week ago, Indian
President Shanker Dayal Sharma described Mahathir as an
illustrious son of Malaysia, a representative of a vibrant and
dynamic Asia, a distinguished votary and a world leader committed
to the timeless values of peace, equality and justice.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir is worthy of the praise, many say. His stewardship has
resulted in dynamic growth and all-round prosperity for his
country and on international fora, his well-known championship of
the cause of developing countries not only has won high esteem for
himself, it also has earned fame for Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has actively participated in world affairs during the
year.
</P>
<P>
It has contributed to the peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia by
sending a big contingent of troops there.
</P>
<P>
It has been an active participant at international meetings
such as the recent World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial
Meeting in Singapore, the inaugural World Solar Summit and the
G-15 summit in Zimbabwe, the informal leadership conference of
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in Manila and the ASEAN
Informal Summit in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
At the WTO meeting, Malaysia, which spearheaded the developing
countries' fight against the linkage of trade with non-trade
issues like labor standards, was said to be "behind the settlement
of pending issues."

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Support Changes to Criminal Law (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sun Tingfang said that the crimes in China are on the rise, and
crimes related to illegal drugs, new technologies and economic
order, are posing much more danger to society, and punishments
should be more severe.
</P>
<P>
Xia Jiajun, another legislator, said that drug-related crimes
was given too lenient penalties in the draft amendment, and the
limits of sentences were too loose. Xia feared this might lead to
light penalties for hard-core criminals in the implementation of
the law.
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers also believe, for the same reason, that more
severe penalties, and death sentences for existing crimes should
remain unchanged to act as a forceful deterrent against wrongdoers.
</P>
<P>
China is now in dilemma on the issue of the death sentence,
according to an official with the NPC Standing Committee. Many
scholars and officials at the top prefer to abolish such a
punishment because they view it as inhumane, but the public want
to see harsh penalties against criminals.
</P>
<P>
The official said that all the letters written to the lawmakers
from the public on the issue were in support of an increase in
death penalties.
</P>
<P>
Teng Teng, Xu Qin, Feng Kexun and many others proposed changes
to give more harsh punishments for corruption, crimes committed by
legal entities, and many others affecting public order and the
legal rights and interests of the public.

<P>
CAIRO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt no longer needs credit
from international financial establishments thanks to the rich
influx of foreign investments and improved economic situation in
the country following 15 years of economic reforms, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Weekly Al Ahram Wednesday and
published by the paper today, Minister of State for Cabinet
Affairs Youssef Boutros-Ghali said that foreign investment this
year amounted to 3 billion U.S. dollars, six times of the
projected figure. In 1997, it will reach 5 billion dollars, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the International Monetary Fund has recognized Egypt as
a good performer in the world economic community.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Egypt no longer needs loans from outside
financial institutions especially when the economic growth rate
has reached a level making the soft loans unnecessary, said the
minister.

<HEADLINE> More Than 200 Chinese Firms Listed This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- This year has seen an
accelerated pace of listing of firms on China's stock market, with
a total of 201 Chinese companies already listed.
</P>
<P>
This has brought the number of companies listed to 524, an
increase of 62 percent from the 323 at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 110 billion yuan's worth of shares have been issued so
far, including more than 25 billion yuan for the newly-listed
firms.
</P>
<P>
"An accelerated expansion of the stock market has a great
bearing on its standardization and maturing, for the present
relatively small market size allows some institutions to
manipulate stock prices and drive them up to a ridiculous high," a
stock analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 100 firms were listed on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange, with the other 101 listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of companies from central and western
China have been listed during this period, including ten from
southwestern Sichuan Province, four from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, four from northwestern Gansu Province, and two from
southwestern Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Almost 30 percent of the companies listed this year are from
pillar industries, showing the nation's increasing support to such
industries by raising funds directly from the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The nation has moved more quickly to list firms this year, with
17 in the first quarter, 38 in the second quarter, more than 60 in
the third quarter, and over 80 in the last quarter.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Government to Put Economy on Right Track: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan President Farooq
Leghari has said that the government is making every effort to put
the country's economy on the right track through stabilization and
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation over TV and Radio last night, Leghari
said that the government is trying to "build up foreign exchange
reserves, ensure fiscal discipline, remove banking and financial
sector crises, give a boost to the manufacturing sector, tackle
rampant corruption and simultaneously provide safety nets for the
poor sections of the society."
</P>
<P>
the president said the government also attaches top priority to
stabilize the price level in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We will make a concerted effort to improve fiscal management
and reduce the government resort to bank borrowing so as to
contain monetary expansion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has seriously eroded the purchasing power of the
people during the last three years, Leghari said, adding that
"prices of essential items were rising on a daily basis," and "the
cumulative increase in prices was in excess of 40 percent."
</P>
<P>
The lack of fiscal discipline, coupled with the resulting
monetary expansion and the poor growth of output in the economy
were the main factors responsible for high rate of inflation, the
president added.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said the continuing depreciation of the local currency
has created the prospect of runaway inflation in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government has taken a number of measures to
arrest the deepening economic crisis, which include restoring
macro-economic stability and initiating the development of an
integrated policy framework, Leghari noted.
</P>
<P>
Since November 5 when the caretaker government came to power,
13 Task Forces with representation of over 150 persons from the
private sector, government, non-governmental organizations and
academics have been set up.
</P>
<P>
This has ensured that the process of policy and strategy
formulation in areas of national importance is fully home-grown,
comprehensive, credible, balanced and acceptable to all segments
of the society, Leghari said.

<P>
MANILA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are Philippine
business news in brief:
</P>
<P>
-- Philippine Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said here
today that the Philippines' overall balance of payments surplus
will balloon to 4 billion U.S. dollars this year from 631 million
dollars in 1995. However, the current account deficit is estimated
to swell to 4.2 percent of the country's gross national product
because of higher imports, which are largely accounted for by the
refleeting program of the Philippine Airlines.
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine Central Bank announced here today that the
ceilings on domestic borrowings for foreign companies will be
lifted in January 1997. With the relaxation, the bank's Circular
No.572, which imposed debt-to-equity ratio on foreign firms from
as low as 60:40 to as high as 70:30, depending on the industry
category, has been repealed.
</P>
<P>
-- The Department of Trade and Industry of the Philippines is
studying plans for the re-imposition of taxes on exports of raw
material products such as lumber, coconut oil and other
agricultural products. The move is aimed at helping local export
industries become globally competitive, the department said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Support Changes to Criminal Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers have
expressed strong support for sweeping changes to the country's
17-year-old Criminal Law.
</P>
<P>
The proposed overhaul takes into account new circumstances and
new kinds of crimes.
</P>
<P>
A draft amendment has been tabled with the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress (NPC) for deliberation by its
Vice-Chairman Wang Hanbin.
</P>
<P>
The statute has faced heated debates and discussions for two
days, in which various further revision proposals were raised.
</P>
<P>
Sun Tingfang, member of the NPC Standing Committee, Qi Shigui,
director of Shanghai People's Congress, and many other
participants, said it was never too much to affirm the role of the
current criminal code in safeguarding state power, combating
crimes and protecting the legitimate rights of the state and
citizens.
</P>
<P>
However, major changes have taken place in the country's
political, economic and social situations, and new kinds of crimes
have taken shape. It is seen as necessary to detail the
stipulations in principle, adding new punishments for new crimes,
and bringing in harsher punishments to curb rising crime rates,
committee members believed.
</P>
<P>
Qi Shigui said changes to the counter-revolution crime were
very successful. This categorizes some of the crimes as sabotaging
state security, with the rest becoming ordinary crimes.
</P>
<P>
It will not only achieve the purpose of consolidating state
power, but also be conducive to combating such crimes more
forcefully, as well as being scientific, of realistic significance
and easy to implement, he added.
</P>
<P>
The successful revision will be a major breakthrough in China's
judicial system, and will have far-reaching impact, according to
Qi.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1996: Year of Bumper Harvest in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to a bumper harvest,
the year 1996 saw an eight percent growth of Zimbabwe's Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), one of the highest since the independence
of "the grain basket" in southern Africa in 1980.
</P>
<P>
A 49 percent increase has been registered in the agricultural
growth, in which maize production rose to 2.6 million tons, up
from 839,000 tons in 1995, and wheat production increased to
250,000 tons, up from 65,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government has decided to export 300,000 tons
of maize, the country's staple food, and 100,000 tons of wheat.
</P>
<P>
Other crops also registered record increases, among which the
production of tobacco, Zimbabwe's largest foreign currency
earner, rose from 198,000 tons to 209,000 tons, earning 610
million U.S. Dollars for the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Cotton production rose from 104,700 tons in 1995 to 275,000
tons this season, the third best harvest in the history of
Zimbabwe's cotton production.
</P>
<P>
And the production of 100,000 tons of soya beans met the local
demands for the first time since the 1991/92 season.
</P>
<P>
Sufficient rainfall and the government's agricultural policy
have attributed to this year's bumper harvest.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe recently formulated a 1995-2020 plan
for agricultural development in a bid to change small-holder
agriculture into a fully commercial farming system and to enable
a crop output higher than population growth.
</P>
<P>
As a result, agricultural investment were increased, loans,
fertilizer, seeds and technical know-how were provided to the
farmers. And improved variety and scientific farming were also
widely applied.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's agricultural future will still depend
on the weather. And the good rains this year promise a good
harvest.
</P>
<P>
Under normal conditions, Zimbabwe's domestic agricultural
sector could well feed the nation. But last year's serious
drought was disastrous to the national economy in which
agriculture is the pillar.
</P>
<P>
GDP growth fell by one percent in 1995. And the government had
to import about 500,000 tons of maize as relief food for more
than six million of the country's 10.5 million population.
</P>
<P>
To achieve a sustainable agricultural development, the
government embarked on a five-year one-billion-Dollar project to
build over 100 dams nationwide to minimize the negative effects
of the drought seasons.
</P>
<P>
It also decided to put 500,000 tons of maize into its
"strategic reserve stocks" which, according to the government
plan, would be kept at 954,000 tons in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"The scheme was designed to ensure that no one starves during
drought seasons," said Agricultural Minister Denis Norman.
</P>
<P>
The plan of commercial farming has also been in full swing
during the past season, raising hopes of more harvests next year.
</P>
<P>
All the early planted crops have been doing well thanks to the
good rainfall which started during the first two weeks of this
month. So far, 85 percent of the maize and 95 percent of soya
beans have been planted.
</P>
<P>
And a better start is also visible in the cotton planting this
season owing to more surface water for irrigation. And tobacco
farmers have been expanding their crops.
</P>
<P>
"If current weather patterns persist, Zimbabwe could
experience its highest ever agricultural output," said Norman.

promote Putonghua, or standard Chinese language, among local
pupils.
</P>
<P>
Gary Ngai Mei Cheong, vice president of the Macao Cultural
Department, said at a seminar last week that promotion of
Putonghua is necessary among primary school students to raise
their level of Chinese language, as China will resume its exercise
of sovereignty over Macao in three years.
</P>
<P>
"Putonghua, as an official language, should be promoted now,"
he said. "The Cantonese language, which is popular in Macao, is
only a dialect and cannot serve as a common language in the
future."
</P>
<P>
The vice president said that he hopes the language policy of
the future Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR) will be
based on Putonghua rather than Cantonese or some other dialects.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the seminar said that it is necessary to
expand the education of Putonghua, as it will be a leading
language of the MSAR government.
</P>
<P>
Currently, many Putonghua courses are offered in Macao,
attracting a large number of learners. Putonghua is also popular
in many stores in Macao.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the local radio and TV stations have all started
Putonghua news programs, which have been warmly received by
audiences.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Capital Flow to China to Top 51 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A total of 51 billion US
dollars in overseas funds are expected to flow into China this
year, according to the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
This includes 11 billion US dollars in overseas loans mainly
invested in infrastructure and basic industries, with a growing
preference for central and western provinces of China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that those areas have received 47 percent of
the total loans from overseas governments, and 40 percent of the
lendings from world financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
Direct foreign investment is forecast to reach 40 billion US
dollars this year, with the average contractual foreign capital
for each project standing at 3.02 million US dollars, as against
2.14 million US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
During the January-November period, China approved over 22,000
foreign-funded projects involving 66.5 billion US dollars of
contractual overseas investment, actually using 36.9 billion US
dollars in foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
The investment mix of foreign funds improved markedly, as a
growing amount of money was injected into infrastructure, basic
industries, pillar industries and capital and technology intensive
projects.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the rapid growth in foreign investments came
under the authorities' policy adjustment, which cut tariffs on
imports to 23 percent from 39.5 percent as of April 1, and
permitted foreign-funded ventures to buy and sell foreign exchange
at designated Chinese banks and China-based foreign banks from
July 1.
</P>
<P>
Inland provincial governments were empowered to approve larger
foreign-funded projects, costing up to 30 million US dollars each
from this year, compared to 10 million US dollars in the past.
</P>
<P>
Economists said China still needs to guide foreign capital
inflow, and cautioned against the inclination of blindly seeking
foreign funds expansion, but ignoring the economic returns of
foreign-funded projects.
</P>
<P>
They also called for an accelerated foreign input into western
areas, noting that overseas investment in those areas is not
growing fast enough.
</P>
<P>
"A new issue has also arisen concerning how to give better
protection to the national interests and safeguard economic
security when seeking more foreign funds," said an economist.
</P>
<P>
China will focus on optimizing the investment mix of foreign
capital and opening more channels to raise funds overseas next
year, said He Ju, deputy director of the Foreign Investment
Department of State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
This means the nation will go on with the experiment to attract
foreign funds through BOT (build-operate-transfer) arrangements,
strengthen control over approval of foreign-funded projects, and
gradually grant foreign-funded ventures national treatment,
explained He.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Government Endeavors to Pay Off Public Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan President Farooq
Leghari has said that the government is determined to embark on a
program of privatization and use of all the proceeds from
privatization to pay off the public debt.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation over TV and Radio last night,
Leghari said the public debt has now been raised to about 50
billion US dollars. And this large debt precludes further
expansion of the government's activities based on borrowing.
</P>
<P>
The debt-servicing requirement is putting huge strains on the
national budget, the president said, adding that the cost of
borrowing for the government has also shot up.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has also decided to accelerate the
process of on-going privatization and to expand the program by
initiating transactions across a wide front, while strengthening
the institutional capacity of the Privatization Commission to
achieve these goals in a transparent manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
Leghari hoped that over the next three months, the government
will be able to generate through privatization around 25 billion
rupees (about 6.25 million dollars) for debt retirement and by the
end of next year large segments of the economy will be privatized.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Banking Council, Leghari said, is being abolished
and a law is being promulgated to strengthen the regulatory and
supervisory functions of the State Bank of Pakistan and also
enhance its autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Existing laws are also being modified so that recovery of
outstanding loans becomes easier and the time span of litigation
is minimized, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
Leghari proposed a law to set up a statutory autonomous body in
place of the Federal Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The proposed organization will be known as Statistics Pakistan
and will report to a Standing Committee of the National Assembly
on Statistics.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coal Industry Sets Next Year's Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China has urged major
state-owned coal mining enterprises to reduce economic losses in
the coming year, according to a national conference today in
Zhengzhou.
</P>
<P>
Wang Senhao, minister of coal industry, said that 70 percent of
the major state-owned coal mining enterprises should strive to
gain profits next year, compared to some 60 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Coal output next year is expected to reach 1.35 billion tons to
maintain the same level with that of this year, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, China will streamline the workforce in the
major state-owned coal mining enterprises and some employees to
other trades, he said.
</P>
<P>
By developing other industries, the enterprises will provide
jobs for 100,000 employees next year, and control the number of
coal production workers within 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain the strong momentum of the coal industry,
China will invest as much as 19.3 billion yuan (about 2.3 billion
US dollars) in capital construction in the industry next year.
</P>
<P>
The ranking official stressed that next year, China will
standardize the order of coal production by coping with illegal
mining activities and improving the safety conditions of coal
mines.
</P>
<P>
The control of township mines will remain an arduous task next
year, Wang said, adding that coal management departments will
solicit support from geological, minerals, taxation, judicial, and
public security departments for a crackdown on illegal small mines
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the country will also take all effective measures to
improve safety conditions, and spare no effort to prevent
accidents in coal mines, the minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China has conducted over
100,000 state asset evaluations during the past eight years, with
combined asset values gaining by nearly 50 percent, according to
the State Administration of State Property (SASP).
</P>
<P>
The industry watchdog said that the appraising industry has
developed rapidly since China began to set up state property
management departments nationwide in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has established more than 2,890
asset evaluation agencies and had nearly 48,000 professional
appraisers.
</P>
<P>
The agencies have already conducted more than 100,000
evaluations, and found that the assets evaluated had an actual
value of 2.15 trillion yuan (about 259 billion US dollars), almost
50 percent more than their account value.
</P>
<P>
The evaluations have helped safeguard the rights and interests
of enterprises, and have effectively curbed the loss of state
property, a SASP official said.
</P>
<P>
China has basically set up a nationwide asset evaluation
system, he said, pointing to the fact that evaluation agencies
have been set up at provincial level.
</P>
<P>
In most places asset evaluation agencies have been established
at city and prefecture level, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that by December 31 last year China's
state assets were valued at more than 5.71 trillion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman Urges Guatemala to Correct Wrong Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang today urged Guatemala to "correct its wrong
policies and take constructive action" to create the necessary
atmosphere and conditions for a proper settlement of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Shen made the statement at a press conference in Beijing
when asked whether the Chinese attitude at the United Nations
towards sending military observers to Guatemala is related to
Guatemalan policies on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that China has always supported the peace progress
in Guatemala and welcomes the agreement to be signed between the
two parties of Guatemala, hoping for a realization of a true and
lasting peace there.
</P>
<P>
Starting from this stance, Shen pointed out, China has always
in the past few years supported resolutions on the Guatemalan
issue passed by the UN General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He continued that it is regretted that the Guatemalan
government, disregarding repeated protests by the Chinese side,
has raised clamors in succession for four years in the UN General
Assembly for Taiwan to "re-join the UN", which wantonly interfered
in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Shen added, the Guatemalan government has gone so far
as to decide to invite the so-called "foreign minister" of the
Taiwan authorities to attend the signing ceremony for the peace
agreement of Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
"This has severely violated the spirit of the UN Charter and
the stipulations of the relevant resolutions of the UN General
Assembly, thus seriously breaking the political basis for
Sino-Guatemalan cooperation in the UN", Shen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Guatemalan side to "correct its wrong policies and
take constructive actions" to create the necessary atmosphere and
conditions for a proper settlement of the issue".

<HEADLINE> Hydroelectric Corridor Planned for Upper Reaches of Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 26 (Xinhua) --China will build a hydroelectric
corridor consisting of 13 hydropower stations on the upper reaches
of the Yellow River by early next century.
</P>
<P>
The gigantic project is located in a valley in eastern Qinghai
Province, one of China's 10 major bases for hydroelectric
development, where the Yellow River originates and zigzags for 200
km to flow eastwards, posing a difference of 900 m in elevation.
</P>
<P>
The planned hydropower stations will have a combined generating
capacity of 11 million kw when completed and will be able to
generate 37 billion kw/hour of electricity.
</P>
<P>
So far, only Longyangxia Hydropower Station, which is the first
of the planned 13 stations, is operating. The station has so far
transmited tens of hundreds of billions of kw/hour of electricity
to northwest China since it finished construction and began to
generate electricity in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Lijiaxia Hydropower Station, a state key construction project
with a generating capacity of two million kw, is still under
construction. When completed, it will be the largest hydropower
station with most advanced equipment on the upper reaches of
the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
In addition to another medium-size power station solely
invested by Qinghai Province, which is being constructed, two more
hydropower stations have just passed preliminary appraisal, while
the rest are still under planning.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that in building the hydroelectric corridor,
installation of every 10,000 kw generating unit will only inundate
three hectares of farmland, and the project cost is 20 percent
lower than similar stations built in other places.
</P>
<P>
The development of hydroelectrical resources has advanced the
growth of metallurgical industrial sectors in Qinghai which is
expected to become China's largest production base of electrolytic
aluminum, ferrosilicon, carbofrax and magnesium.

<HEADLINE> Golan Heights Residents Condemn Israel for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Syrians of the Golan
Heights condemned Israeli celebrations of 30 years of Jewish
settlements in the occupied Syrian territory, JMCC, a Palestinian
press service based in East Jerusalem, reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday night, the Syrians said that
"holding celebrations under the patronage of the Israeli
president and prime minister, is a proof of the continued
settlement expansion policy, and is another proof of Israeli
rejection of a just peace compromise."
</P>
<P>
The statement came apparently in response to an Israeli
Knesset (parliament) conference marking the 30th anniversary of
the establishment of the settlements since Israel snatched the
Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu addressed the
conference Wednesday morning declaring that the Golan Heights is
essential for Israel, not only for security value, but also for
water resources.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with representatives of the Golan Heights
settlers, Knesset Speaker Dan Tichon said he hopes the Knesset
will also celebrate 50 years of settlement in the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the participation of some Israel-appointed
mayors in the celebrations hurts the national feelings of the
Syrians in the Golan Heights."
</P>
<P>
"We assert our rejection to the Israeli occupation and we
denounce and condemn the settlement campaign in Golan and all
Arab territories. Israel holds all consequences of this grave
policy," the statement declared.
</P>
<P>
"And we assert our support to the policy of our country, led
by staunch President Hafez Assad, calling for the prevailing of
a just and comprehensive peace based on restoration of all our
usurped rights," it noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli press reports, the Golan Arab Druse
residents have recently stepped up anti-occupation activities,
including firebomb attacks on Israeli army vehicles and arson
attacks on police buildings.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- An explosion was heard this
morning within the Japanese ambassador's residence compound in
Lima where some 104 hostages are being held.
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses said the explosion, which occurred at 1:43
a.m. local time (0645 GMT), came from within the residence at the
back part, while others said it was from inside the front part.
</P>
<P>
Police said they did not know the cause of the blast.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 heavily-armed Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA)
guerrillas stormed the residence during a party on December
17. After that, the guerrillas freed some women and children, but
held government officials, Japanese VIPs and some foreign
diplomats as hostages.
</P>
<P>
On Christmas Day, they released a sick man, who was pushed out
of the residence in a wheelchair by a Red Cross worker. He was
later identified as a first secretary at the Japanese embassy in
Peru.
</P>
<P>
So far, a big number of hostages have been released by the
armed guerrillas. It was already the ninth day of the siege, but
the guerrillas and the Peruvian government were deadlocked since
President Alberto Fujimori refused the guerrillas' demand to
release their jailed comrades.

the government.
</P>

against the autocratic activities of the government," the former
prime minister told her supporters at the airport.

Khaleda Zia also assured the party people that she was
well-informed about the government's increasing repression of the

<P>
URUMQI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Although the peak period of
population flow around China's Lunar New Year has not yet arrived,
railway stations and long-distance bus stations in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are packed with migrant
workers.
</P>
<P>
With the development of Xinjiang's oil and cotton industries
the region attracts over 1.2 million migrant workers from other
parts of China every year.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the travelling safety of the workers, the regional
government has made advance preparations.
</P>
<P>
Railway departments have arranged eleven special trains for the
migrants, whose main destinations are Nanjing, Zhengzhou and
Chengdu in east, central and southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the special trains extra carriages will be added to
regular trains to enhance the capacity of the railway transport.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in addition to the normal timetable, highway
transport departments have arranged special buses to travel to
east, central and northwest China in response to the demands of
the migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
Some 500,000 migrant workers had left Xinjiang for home by the
end of November, according to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
The regional government asks relevant departments to provide
board and lodging to them on their way home.
</P>
<P>
The government has not forgotten those who will remain in
Xinjiang during the Spring Festival, which will fall on February
7th. It has made elaborate arrangements for their work and lives,
with activities organized in the Lunar New Year period.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Improves Shanghai's Economic Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment has
contributed heavily to improving the economic quality of Shanghai,
China's largest economic and financial city, a senior local
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The inflow of overseas investment has also brought to Shanghai
advanced technology and management expertise, and has accelerated
its upgrading of industrial structure," the official said in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Shanghai, China's leading economic
powerhouse, has successfully kept its economic growth rate high
but inflation low this year, with the two indicators standing at
12.9 percent and 5.1 percent year-on-year in January-November.
</P>
<P>
"You know, our economic growth rate is higher than the national
average while that of inflation lower," the official
noted. China's 1996 economic growth rate is expected at around 10
percent and the national retail price index in the first 11 months
of this year was 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
"I must say that overseas investment has played a big part in
enabling us to achieve an intensive growth of our economy by
employing more advanced technology and management," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has approved over 18,000 overseas-funded projects
since early 1980s, with a combined contractual investment volume
of more than 50 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official said that most of the city's 10,000-strong
operational overseas-funded firms have begun to reap profits.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Shanghai has been keen on improving its
economic structure by using overseas investment with priority
given to industrial projects, urban infrastructure facilities,
agriculture and the service sector.
</P>
<P>
"The effort has paid off," he said, pointing to the fact that
industrial projects have accounted for more than 60 percent of all
approved overseas-funded projects.
</P>
<P>
Most of the industrial projects cover automobile, electronics,
computer, bio-medicine, fine chemicals and other
technology-intensive sectors, he said, adding that around 50
world's largest industrial transnationals have made investment
here.
</P>
<P>
He added that, as a result, the city's industrial structure is
shifting added value from that of textile
industry and other labor-intensive, high energy-consuming sectors.
</P>
<P>
New and high-tech industries now contribute to 12 percent of
Shanghai's industrial output value, up from merely two percent a
decade ago, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In foreign trade, which is expected to grow 10 percent to 52
billion US dollars this year, overseas-funded firms contribute to 87
percent of the incremental value, he added.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of the service sector in the city's gross
domestic product, thanks to overseas investment, has soared to
more than 40 percent at present from 18 percent in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Committed overseas investment in Shanghai grew six percent to
slightly over 10 billion US dollars in the first 11 months of this
year, with the total amount expected to top 11 billion US dollars
by the turn of the year, according to the official.

<P>
CHANGSHA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The spread of a new strain of
hybrid cotton in central China's Hunan Province has been proved a
success, with high economic returns and less labor costs.
</P>
<P>
The new strain, "Xiang Hybrid Cotton No. 1", has been planted
on a total of 110,000 hectares of land in Hunan over the past two
years. It has generated an output increase of 14 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Created by the provincial cotton science and technology
research institute, the strain passed state-level appraisal in
1995. It had been selected from nearly 1,000 hybrid combination
patterns.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated that under similar conditions, the per ha.
output of the new strain is 128 km more than the output of common
ones.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural scientists in the province have also made
achievements in research on seed-production of cotton.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to plant 60,000 ha of hybrid cotton next
year, with the figure increasing to 100,000 ha in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: South Africa's Currency Fluctuations in  1996 (1 ) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Ye Xingzeng, Liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
currency Rand has experienced an ever-continuing depreciation
since early this year due to political and economic developments
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Rand has lost about 30 percent of its value in U.S.
Dollar terms and about 25 percent against a basket of other main
hard currencies in the financial market since mid-February,
plunging from 3.6 against a Dollar to below 4.7 in November,
trundling "all one-way traffic" through one new low after
another.
</P>
<P>
Among others, the main reasons reportedly triggering Rand's
decline include widespread rumors about President Nelson
Mandela's health, talk of an imminent easing of foreign exchange
controls, the replacement of the finance minister, a slump in foreign
investor confidence and uncertainty about government's commitment
to implementing the macro-economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
In mid-February, widespread rumors that Mandela had suffered a
mild heart-attack and speculations about an imminent removal of
foreign exchange controls caused the slide of Rand, which
remained steady since the abolition of financial Rand in early
1995.
</P>
<P>
In a related response, Mandela, described by his doctors as
fit and healthy, said that someone was gaining a lot
through spreading these rumors.
</P>
<P>
Though the government has already pledged its commitment to
eventual lifting of foreign exchange controls, yet the lack of a
timetable has frustrated investors and encouraged speculators to
sell the Rand short, anticipating an outflow of funds when the
controls finally go.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the exchange controls, President Mandela said:
"The lifting of South Africa's foreign exchange regulations is
now only a matter of timing and detail."
</P>
<P>
However, the then Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg said the
fall in the Rand had not changed the government's thinking on its
approach or timing to the easing of foreign exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Liebenberg stressed that the Rand's decline
underlined the need to maintain fiscal discipline and get the
economic fundamentals right in order to reassure overseas
investors, adding the government would not fight the market to
defend the currency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Governor
Chris Stals said the SARB would not interfere in the foreign
exchange market to peg the currency at any pre-determined level.
</P>
<P>
Stals said the SARB, which executes the role of the country's
Central Bank and has a consultative role in foreign exchange
policy, would not advise the government to relax controls in any
way that would lead to the destabilization of internal or
external financial conditions.
</P>
<P>
Stals reiterated Liebenberg's commitment to a "gradual
and prudent" policy in abolishing the remaining exchange
controls, adding the idea of a "big bang" approach to this effect
is "preposterous".
</P>
<P>
Following a cabinet reshuffle late March, former Trade and
Industry Minister Trevor Manuel was appointed new finance
minister, the country's first black finance minister, once again
causing a stir in the financial market.
</P>
<P>
Concerns by foreign investors about the replacement of finance
minister and the continuity of government policy prompted the
weakening Rand to drop to a new record low of below 4.22 against
the Dollar in mid-April. (more

<HEADLINE> Boy "Pregnant" With Two Fetuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A three-month-old baby boy,
who underwent medical checks in southwest China's Chengdu City
this month, was found to be carrying two dead fetuses.
</P>
<P>
A team of surgeons at the Hospital of the West China Medical
University successfully removed the fetuses from the "pregnant"
baby's abdominal cavity on December 16. The boy is now recovering
in hospital and will soon be discharged.
</P>
<P>
"It is the rarest case of its kind ever reported both at home
and abroad," said paediatrician Hu Tingze, head of the surgical
team. He added that the cause of the case still needs further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The fetuses, diagnosed as parasitic deformed fetuses, weighed
600 grams and 200 grams respectively. The bigger one, 25
centimeters long, had a well-developed body and limbs, but it had
six-toe feet and an under-developed brain. The smaller fetus's

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Traditional Medicine Enjoys World Popularity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners have started to take
an interest in reading the four books of the famous "pharmacopoeia
of the Traditional Tibetan Medicine", which are even too difficult
for most Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey of the Northwest Research Institute of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences there are 191 categories, or 2,200
kinds, of plant medicines, 150 types of animal medicines, and 57
kinds of mineral medicines on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine is a system of pure natural medicine.
Statistics show that there are more than 170 companies and 40
research institutes developing the natural plant medicines, with
500 products being sold to more than 20 countries and
regions. Medical organizations have also been set up in those
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Pills of the Tibetan medicine are sold to Nepal, Bhutan, India,
Japan, Thailand and Hong Kong and Macao, at prices ranging from
several dozen yuan to more than 100 yuan each.
</P>
<P>
A professor at the Beijing Medical University said: "The global
pharmaceutical industry faces serious challenges. People tend to
use more natural medicine, which cause little pollution and are
free of side-effects. Tibetan medicine just meets the need."
</P>
<P>
"Western medicine is confronted with challenges, but we see
Tibetan medicine as very beneficial to people," said Doctor
Joachim Bruch of Germany's Essen University. He hoped that he
could combine advanced production techniques of his country with
the abundant natural medicine resources on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: South Africa's Currency Fluctuations in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Ye Xingzeng, Liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
currency Rand has experienced an ever-continuing depreciation
since early this year due to political and economic developments
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Rand has lost about 30 percent of its value in U.S.
Dollar terms and about 25 percent against a basket of other main
hard currencies in the financial market since mid-February,
plunging from 3.6 against a Dollar to below 4.7 in November,
trundling "all one-way traffic" through one new low after
another.
</P>
<P>
Among others, the main reasons reportedly triggering Rand's
decline include widespread rumors about President Nelson
Mandela's health, talk of an imminent easing of foreign exchange
controls, the replacement of the finance minister, a slump in foreign
investor confidence and uncertainty about government's commitment
to implementing the macro-economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
In mid-February, widespread rumors that Mandela had suffered a
mild heart-attack and speculations about an imminent removal of
foreign exchange controls caused the slide of Rand, which
remained steady since the abolition of financial Rand in early
1995.
</P>
<P>
In a related response, Mandela, described by his doctors as
fit and healthy, said that someone was gaining a lot
through spreading these rumors.
</P>
<P>
Though the government has already pledged its commitment to
eventual lifting of foreign exchange controls, yet the lack of a
timetable has frustrated investors and encouraged speculators to
sell the Rand short, anticipating an outflow of funds when the
controls finally go.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the exchange controls, President Mandela said:
"The lifting of South Africa's foreign exchange regulations is
now only a matter of timing and detail."
</P>
<P>
However, the then Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg said the
fall in the Rand had not changed the government's thinking on its
approach or timing to the easing of foreign exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Liebenberg stressed that the Rand's decline
underlined the need to maintain fiscal discipline and get the
economic fundamentals right in order to reassure overseas
investors, adding the government would not fight the market to
defend the currency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Governor
Chris Stals said the SARB would not interfere in the foreign
exchange market to peg the currency at any pre-determined level.
</P>
<P>
Stals said the SARB, which executes the role of the country's
Central Bank and has a consultative role in foreign exchange
policy, would not advise the government to relax controls in any
way that would lead to the destabilization of internal or
external financial conditions.
</P>
<P>
Stals reiterated Liebenberg's commitment to a "gradual
and prudent" policy in abolishing the remaining exchange
controls, adding the idea of a "big bang" approach to this effect
is "preposterous".
</P>
<P>
Following a cabinet reshuffle late March, former Trade and
Industry Minister Trevor Manuel was appointed new finance
minister, the country's first black finance minister, once again
causing a stir in the financial market.
</P>
<P>
Concerns by foreign investors about the replacement of finance
minister and the continuity of government policy prompted the
weakening Rand to drop to a new record low of below 4.22 against
the Dollar in mid-April. (more

<HEADLINE> Roundup: South Africa's Currency Fluctuations in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Ye Xingzeng and Liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Manuel, experiencing a
baptism of fire since his appointment, said the government would
not take any panic decisions in reacting to the currency's
all-time depreciation, saying the volatility of the Rand should
be seen in broad perspective.
</P>
<P>
There have been significantly shifts in the global economic
environment, with the Dollar stronger against other currencies
than it had been in a long time, said the Minister, adding it was
to all these circumstances that the Rand was reacting.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to exercise fiscal discipline in managing the
economy and cooperate closely with the SARB in a gradual removal
of the controls.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to soothe market nerves after the Rand plunged
below 4.5 late April, Mandela expressed his belief that no Rand
crisis existed and the currency was going to firm.
</P>
<P>
The SARB, however, increased bank rate by one point percentage
to 16 percent at the end of April to stabilize the sliding Rand,
saying "some further tightening of monetary policy has now become
essential".
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the currency market fluctuations, Stals said
inflation rate, labor productivity and wage level, account
deficit and capital inflow, money supply and exchange controls
were among the factors attributing the all-time depreciation of
the Rand.
</P>
<P>
While economists argued that the issue of Rand's continuing
depreciation had been compounded by lack of confidence in the
government's commitment to delivering its macro-economic
strategy.
</P>
<P>
They believed the authorities should spell out plans for
exchange controls easing and convince the markets of the
government's commitment to fiscal discipline in the best
interests of South African economy.
</P>
<P>
Late October, Stals threw further cold water over tense
financial markets by warning that the SARB would further tighten
monetary policy should bank credit extension and money supply
continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Stals's remarks took its roll on the government bond market to
its lowest level in five months and prompted heavy speculative
selling of the Rand, particularly by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stals and Manuel spoke with a single voice on the
gradual abolition of the controls as part of South Africa's
long-term macro-economic strategy, arguing that controls could
not be scrapped while foreign reserves remained at a low level.
</P>
<P>
The SARB's foreign reserves have reportedly fallen by some 50
percent in Dollar terms to 10 billion Rand (about 2.2 billion
Dollars) at the end of September, equivalent to only around four
weeks' import cover, far from the expected three months' import
cover.
</P>
<P>
Contrasting to the investors' downbeat attitude towards the
Rand's depreciation, Stals said: "The present run on the currency
does not reflect any South Africa's economic problem. It is all
sentiment driven."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Manuel said it is important to re-emphasize that
government's perspective on economic growth is a
medium-to-long-term one and that market and media pressure should
not take priority over long-term priorities.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1996: Year of Bumper Harvest in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to a bumper harvest,
the year 1996 saw an eight percent growth of Zimbabwe's Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), one of the highest since the independence
of "the grain basket" in southern Africa in 1980.
</P>
<P>
A 49 percent increase has been registered in the agricultural
growth, in which maize production rose to 2.6 million tons, up
from 839,000 tons in 1995, and wheat production increased to
250,000 tons, up from 65,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government has decided to export 300,000 tons
of maize, the country's staple food, and 100,000 tons of wheat.
</P>
<P>
Other crops also registered record increases, among which the
production of tobacco, Zimbabwe's largest foreign currency
earner, rose from 198,000 tons to 209,000 tons, earning 610
million U.S. Dollars for the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Cotton production rose from 104,700 tons in 1995 to 275,000
tons this season, the third best harvest in the history of
Zimbabwe's cotton production.
</P>
<P>
And the production of 100,000 tons of soya beans met the local
demands for the first time since the 1991/92 season.
</P>
<P>
Sufficient rainfall and the government's agricultural policy
have attributed to this year's bumper harvest.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe recently formulated a 1995-2020 plan
for agricultural development in a bid to change small-holder
agriculture into a fully commercial farming system and to enable
a crop output higher than population growth.
</P>
<P>
As a result, agricultural investment were increased, loans,
fertilizer, seeds and technical know-how were provided to the
farmers. And improved variety and scientific farming were also
widely applied.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's agricultural future will still depend
on the weather. And the good rains this year promise a good
harvest.
</P>
<P>
Under normal conditions, Zimbabwe's domestic agricultural
sector could well feed the nation. But last year's serious
drought was disastrous to the national economy in which
agriculture is the pillar.
</P>
<P>
GDP growth fell by one percent in 1995. And the government had
to import about 500,000 tons of maize as relief food for more
than six million of the country's 10.5 million population.
</P>
<P>
To achieve a sustainable agricultural development, the
government embarked on a five-year one-billion-Dollar project to
build over 100 dams nationwide to minimize the negative effects
of the drought seasons.
</P>
<P>
It also decided to put 500,000 tons of maize into its
"strategic reserve stocks" which, according to the government
plan, would be kept at 954,000 tons in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"The scheme was designed to ensure that no one starves during
drought seasons," said Agricultural Minister Denis Norman.
</P>
<P>
The plan of commercial farming has also been in full swing
during the past season, raising hopes of more harvests next year.
</P>
<P>
All the early planted crops have been doing well thanks to the
good rainfall which started during the first two weeks of this
month. So far, 85 percent of the maize and 95 percent of soya
beans have been planted.
</P>
<P>
And a better start is also visible in the cotton planting this
season owing to more surface water for irrigation. And tobacco
farmers have been expanding their crops.
</P>
<P>
"If current weather patterns persist, Zimbabwe could
experience its highest ever agricultural output," said Norman.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Reservoir in Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build a
reservoir in the sea off its east coast to solve the water
shortage for an island county.
</P>
<P>
Yuhuan, an island county in east China's Zhejiang Province,
will build dikes in the sea to create a land area of 3,700
hectares, in which a reservoir will be built.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the reservoir will take five years and a total
investment of 400 million yuan (about 48 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed, the enclosed area will bring 85
million cubic meters of freshwater more to Yuhuan, one of the 12
island counties in the county.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of water and limited land resources have long plagued
Yuhuan. Each person on the island only has 600 cubic meters of
freshwater resources, less than one quarter of the average amount
in the country, and 0.02 hectares of land.

HANGZHOU, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A factory worker in Hangzhou
has never dreamt of his two deposit books with 22,000 yuan (about
2,650 US dollars) being found again and sent back by a farmer
thousands of kilometers away after they were lost for two months.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jianhong, in Jianqiao town in this capital of Zhejiang, a
comparatively developed province in east China, donated a new
overcoat months ago to the poor in Sichuan Province in the
southwest, in the wake of a poverty relief campaign between the
two provinces.
</P>
<P>
Xu volunteered to offer his new overcoat, but forgot all about
his 22,000-yuan deposit books, his long-time savings, in the
overcoat pocket.
</P>
<P>
The two deposit books traveled in the overcoat all through
their way to Yuan Changyang, a farmer in a village of Nanchong
city in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Yuan stumbled upon the bankbooks and sent them immediately to
the township council. He insisted the bankbooks be returned to the
owner, who donated the overcoat with a loving heart.
</P>
<P>
"It is my duty to give them back to the unselfish Zhejiang
brother," the young farmer said.
</P>
<P>
A vice-mayor of Hangzhou, who was then with an aid-the-poor
study group in Nanchong, received the bankbooks after their
two-month journey and returned them to Xu.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Wine Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
unearthed some four tons of wine that had been stored underground
for one and half century.
</P>
<P>
According to the words inscribed on the sides of four huge
wooden boxes that contain the liquid, the material was made as
tribute to the court and buried in cellars in the 25th year of the
Daoguang Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, or 1845.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said that this is the largest quantity of wine
with the longest time of storage they have ever found in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"It is the treasure of the nation," said Guo Dashun, head of
the archeology team.
</P>
<P>
He added that the wine was unearthed in Jinzhou city in
northeast China's Liaoning province, and it was made by the
biggest wine factory in the region 150 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people have a long history of wine obsession, with a
highly developed wine-making industry both in the present time and
ancient society.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the newly-recovered ancient wine is very
tasty, and the fact has supported the theory that the longer the
wine is stored, the better it becomes.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that a precise research be done to find out the
ways of making ancient wine, so that modern factories can re-make
it, while some of the wine should be auctioned.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A large-scale three-hour
strike is underway in Israel today, affecting air traffic,
post and communication as well as port and train services.
</P>
<P>
The strike, organized by Histadrut (General Federation of Trade
Unions) against the government economic policy, may last longer,
according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
As both staff of El Al, Israel's national carrier, and Airport
Authority are going on strike, passangers are advised to make
telephone calls to their airlines before traveling to the
Ben-Gurion Airport.
</P>
<P>
Although passenger trains are operating as normal, there are
no freight services. Bezeq (the Israel Communication Corporation)
has stopped providing a large part of services. The Ports of
Haifa, Ashdod and Eilat are all closed.
</P>
<P>
Other industry sectors are expected to take similar steps in
the coming days in a dispute aimed to coincide with the Knesset's
 deliberations on the government's 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
The decision to strike was taken after separate meetings
between Histadrut chairman Amir Peretz and Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, and Finance Minister Dan Meridor.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published after Tuesday night's marathon
meeting of senior Histadrut officials, organization spokesman Yossi
Leibovitch said the strike was declared amid "a crisis of
confidence," because of the behavior of Netanyahu and Meridor.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable that just a few hours after the
meetings that the Treasury introduced new measures, and they
didn't mention them at all to me," said Peretz.

<HEADLINE> World Food Program Helps Chinese Farmers Quench Thirst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A project aided
by the World Food Program has solved the water shortage problem
for hundreds of thousands of farmers in an impoverished region in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
For centuries people in Xingbaochuan, on the border of
northwest China's Gansu Province and Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region, transported the drinking water from areas far away.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, China launched a project to divert water from the
Yellow River to Xingbaochuan. Later, the project won support from
the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
So far, China and the WFP have invested in the project a total
of 146 million yuan (about 17.6 million US dollars). Of the total
investment, the WFP contributed oil and grain worth nearly 9.9
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
After years of construction, the project has not only quenched
the thirst of 130,000 people in Xingbaochuan, but also improved
the ecosystem in the area, which was suffering from
desertification.
</P>
<P>
The project has also increased grain output, and promoted the
development of animal husbandry and township enterprises in
Xingbaochuan. Last year, the average income of a farmer there
reached 850 yuan (about 102 US dollars), nearly 26 times the
figure of 1978.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China's largest jet fighter
manufacturer, Shenyang Aircraft Industrial (Group) Company, is
expected to turn out 500 million yuan's worth of civilian products
this year.
</P>
<P>
Civilian production now makes up half of the company's total
annual output, said a company official.
</P>
<P>
The company was the birthplace of China's first jet plane, the
first group-to-air missile and the first high-altitude fighter.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of a market-oriented economy in China, the company
gave up a policy of concentrating on military production and began
a strategic shift to civilian products.
</P>
<P>
It has since developed 200 kinds of civilian products in five
categories. The company now owns a plant which turns out 2,000
high-grade coaches annually, a plant which assembles 5,000
cross-country vehicles and a plant with an annual production
capacity of 100,000 square meters of aluminium products.
</P>
<P>
It also produces civilian plane parts for 10 air companies in
seven countries and earns three million US dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
China's defense industry has become a major contributor to the
country's economic development in recent years and has kept a
close watch on the country's market demands to develop more
civilian products.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Volleyballers in Limelight Agian (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The top story in
volleyball in 1996 is that women players of China took the
limelight of the volleyball world again in the passing year.
</P>
<P>
After hitting the nadir by ending up eighth at the last world
volleyball championships, Chinese girls snatched the silver medal
at the Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta last summer.
</P>
<P>
They also finished fourth in October's Grand Prix finals in
Shanghai, China and wrapped up a lucky year by taking the Super
Challenge title in November.
</P>
<P>
The mastermind behind the miraculous resurrection was Lang
Ping, a former star spiker who led the Chinese team to complete a
clean sweep of major world titles in the early 1980s and now
became the only female among the sport's top coaches.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to her acumen, diligence and charisma, Lang, in merely
500 days after takeover, ushered her young players into the rank
of powerhouses which include Cuba, Brazil, Russia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Just like four years ago in Barcelona, the Caribbean girls took
home the Olympic gold but with less dominance.
</P>
<P>
Cuba lost to Russia and Brazil in the preliminary pool.
However, the indomitable team coached by a resourceful Eugenio
George edged its old foe Brazil 3-2 in the semis and trounced
China 3-1 in the final.
</P>
<P>
Brazil had to be contented with a bronze. It managed to win the
post-Olympic World Grand Prix and finished third behind China and
Cuba in the Super Challenge in Osaka, Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
But in what may be the most mysterious sacking in world
volleyball, George was removed from his post just two weeks after
the final due to "actions incompatible with his educational roles."
</P>
<P>
Antonio Perdomo, Geroge's assistant, took over the formidable
squad after the GP and the Super Challenge.
</P>
<P>
Comparable to the rivalry between Cuba and Brazil, the
Netherlands and Italy are the cynosure of all eyes in the men's
volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Repeating the hard-fought decisive 3-2 win over the Italians
for the crown at the World League, Joop Alberda's Orange Brigade
routed Julio Velasco's team in the Olympic final to revenge their
humiliation at almost all previous events.
</P>
<P>
Italy found some consolation by clinching November's Super
Challenge meet, where the Dutchmen were second and Olympic bronze
medalist Yugoslavia third.
</P>
<P>
Beach volleyball, which debuted at the Olympics as a medal
sport under the scorching sun of Atlanta, robbed a good deal of
attention from its indoor cousin.
</P>
<P>
The superman combination of Americans Kent Steffes and Karch
Kiraly and Brazilian superwomen Jackie Silva and Sandra Pires
carried home the first-ever Olympic golds won on the sand.
</P>
<P>
The huge success of the volleyball family as spectator sport in
Atlanta started a wave of volleymania in many countries. And the
national associations are riding on the crest.
</P>
<P>
In China, where fans still revel in the runner-up finishing,
matches in both men's and women's national leagues will be played
for the first time in home-and-away format.
</P>
<P>
The leagues, which kicked off simultaneously on December 21,
have eight teams each and will last for four months.
</P>
<P>
"The achievement of the women team in Atlanta is really
inspiration for us," said senior volleyball official Gao Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the new format would make the sport more
attractive and competitive against the country's fledgling
professional soccer and basketball.

<HEADLINE> Bank Opens For Book Circulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A special bank has opened in
central-south China's Hunan province in a bid to circulate books
among the public.
</P>
<P>
The bank, a cultural establishment with deposits of books
instead of an establishment for keeping money, is sponsored
jointly by a library in the Hengdong county, Hunan, and a local
businessman Liu Jixun.
</P>
<P>
Since having built up a fortune through hard work , Liu, a
former farmer in his sixties, donated approximately 400,000 yuan
to boost the educational development in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, he noticed that more than 400,000 books
scattering in local families and they were placed on the top shelf
after reading. On the other hand, the county library was short of
funds to purchase new books.
</P>
<P>
The discovery later led him in sponsoring the "book bank".
</P>
<P>
The bank was equipped with 150,000 yuan worth of computers,
electronic monitor system and air conditioners donated by Liu.
</P>
<P>
It was stipulated that local residents may deposit books in
the bank, except pornographic and violent ones.
</P>
<P>
Books in the bank will be re-evaluated, and the owner may get
10 percent of interest on their investment in the form of books
each year, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
People who want to borrow books only need pay little fees.
</P>
<P>
Local residents hailed the opening of such a special bank, and
within one week, it received more than 13,000 books.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Yaochu, a retired cadre, deposited 150 informative and
instructive books in the bank. "Such a bank benefits both the book
owners and the county's cultural development," said he.
</P>
<P>
Seven branches are planned to be opened in the county's
downtown areas, while a library-on-wheel is expected to carry
books to remote villages.

to buy a tractor or truck has come true in some rural areas, where

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- More jobless people in east
China's Jiangsu Province have found new work, thanks to a
re-employment program in the province.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade the province has helped 148,000 laid-off
workers to get new jobs, accounting for a half of the total
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The province has adjusted its existing employment policies and
adopted effective measures to encourage laid-off people to work in

Statistics from the Bureau of Civil Affairs showed that many of
the re-employed people act as porters, housekeepers, child-minders
and nurses.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that more than 2,000 organizations have
been set up to introduce jobs to laid-off workers, while 335
training centers have been established to offer courses on

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Beijingers have
proved their ability to operate computers by taking the national
computer examination this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Beijing Education Examination Institute
show that more than 46,800 Beijingers were registered to take the
computer exam this year, 42,000 more than in 1995. Some 26,500 of
them passed the examination.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A white bus is now found
slowly touring the downtown area of Chongqing city, in southwest
China's Sichuan Province, each Sunday, and passers-by view it with
importance because it is a moving center constantly receiving
complaints from the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
It stops time and again when it finds people
approaching. Officials on the bus handle the complaints on the
spot if they can, and if they can not, they take notes and forward
the complaints to departments concerned.

<P>
One official explained that the move aims to better protect the
legitimate rights of the people by broadening channels of handling
complaits.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Receive More Foreign Aid in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will receive 3.5 billion
U.S. dollars of foreign aid in 1997, one billion more than in
1996, Valery Litvitsky, chief assistant to President Leonid
Kuchma, told a news briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the donor nations
decided earlier this month in Washington to give Ukraine 3.424
billion dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
However, Litvitsky said Ukraine will still have to seek another
300 to 400 million dollars to meet its financial need.
</P>
<P>
Till now, the country has already pocketed 1.5 billion dollars
of loans, and another one billion will come in the next few
days. This year's total, however, is lower than that of 1995,
which fetched 4.416 billion, Litvitsky said.
</P>
<P>
There exists "a monopoly" in the international community in
loans to Ukraine, he said, with certain organizations and Russia
playing a more active role than others.
</P>
<P>
On the debt issue, he said, by November 1 Ukrainian foreign
debts totaled 8.60 billion dollars, or as high as 180 dollars per
capita for a population of 50 million.
</P>
<P>
Among Ukraine's creditors, he said, Russia is the weightest
with more than 3.614 billion dollars, the IMF the second with
2.173 billion dollars, and Turkmenistan with 700 million.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview with the Interfax news agency,
Litvitsky called this year's economy with an inflation rate almost
dropping to 40 percent "a prelude to economic growth".

<HEADLINE> Stone Ages Cave Discovered in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A team of Indian
archeologists have recently unraveled the most exciting and
hitherto unknown part of prehistoric civilization in the
subcontinent, the Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
In some caves located on the range of seven hills in Bihar
State's Hazaribagh District, the archeologists discovered many
valuable rock art paintings belonging to the Mesolithic and
Neolithic-chalcolithic period in the hills.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was a major historical breakthrough, Atul Kumar
Verma, leader of the team, said.
</P>
<P>
"Many missing links in the study of the state of economy and
culture in that early period -- hitherto dubbed as the dark period
in the continent due to lack of records -- could be filled by this
discovery," he added.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists are geared up to take a second and deeper look to
consolidate their initial findings shortly.
</P>
<P>
The paintings which portrayed animals, men with bows and arrows
and some geometrical designs will provide valuable sources of
information for the study of stone-age life in the subcontinent,
said Verma.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists tracked the hills to discover a series of
fabulous pictures drawn by nomadic groups whose foremost
occupation was hunting and gathering.
</P>
<P>
Animals found in drawings include the antelope, monkey, tiger,
humped bull, bison, boar and deer. Pictures of cattle or other
domesticated animals are not found.
</P>
<P>
"The persons behind these paintings appear to be living an
unsettled life," Verma said.
</P>
<P>
These paintings are found engraved in eight rock shelters along
a long stretch of the range and they are more or less of the same
pattern.
</P>
<P>
The most striking features found in these pictures are the
overwhelming geometric or anthropomorphic patterns with intricate
designs on many variations. Red and white colors are profusely
used in these paintings along with some yellow pigments.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of superimpositions found in these paintings
-- an important link in drawing the prehistory of the region in
that early period.
</P>
<P>
However, the portrayals do not contain any chronological
materials, thus making categorizing difficult in time perspective.

SHIJIAZHUANG, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Around 10,000
enterprises, including over 300 foreign-funded companies, have
signed collective contracts with workers in north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Signed by labor unions on behalf of workers and with the
companies, the contracts cover wage levels, working hours,
vacation entitlement and job security. The collective contract has
been written into China's Labor Law as an important measure to
strengthen workers' management of their workplaces and improve
their working conditions.
</P>
<P>
To make the task run smoothly, the province has set up special
groups to oversee the implementation of collective labor contracts
in 11 cities and prefectures. Meanwhile, related documents have
been issued to enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The signing of collective contracts has stablized relations
between enterprises and workers, said a local government official.
</P>
<P>
In Xingtai, an industrial city in the province, 1,297 firms
have signed collective contracts with their workers, and since
then, the number of labor-dispute cases has decreased

<HEADLINE> Ramos Back at Work After Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos went back to the Presidential Palace after checking out of
the Makati Medical Center (MMC) this morning.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was greeted by cheers and applause from a crowd composed
of reporters, hospital staff and visitors when he emerged from the
elevator on the ground floor of the MMC, where he underwent an
operation on his neck to clear a carotid block Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wearing a blue jacket over a white shirt and looking
well-rested, Ramos expressed his profound thanks to the MMC
doctors who operated on him.
</P>
<P>
The removal of the blockage in Ramos' carotid artery was the
second major operation on the president since 1950 when he had one
of his kidneys removed.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' doctors said earlier that significant cholesterol
deposits resulted in the blockage in Ramos' carotid artery, which,
if remained, could lead to a stroke.
</P>
<P>
The country's stock market tumbled Monday over the surprising
news of Ramos' operation performed that morning and rumors that
Ramos may need a heart surgery. But the market rebounded
considerably Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' hospitalization this week, the second in 10 days, has
raised concern about the state of his health among the country's
political and business communities. Doubts have arisen about
whether Ramos, 68, can serve out the rest of his six-year term,
due to end in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was hospitalized from December 12 to 14 for what his
doctors said "a systemic viral infection."

<P>
WUHAN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Four million more people in
central China's Hubei province have said farewell to poverty
thanks to the poverty-relief plan carried out by the local
government.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims to help poverty-striken areas build
infrastructures and improve farming conditions, and it has been
proved successful.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, the gross domestic product in 38
poor counties grew 3.7 times compared with ten years ago and per
capita income for farmers increased to 1,061 yuan from 1985's 322
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province has controled soil erosion on 7,800
square kilometers of land and raised crop yield on nearly 200,000
ha of poor farmland.
</P>
<P>
The building of roads, bridges, power stations and other
infrastructures helped improve the living standards of the local
people.
</P>
<P>
Since the middle of the 1980s, the province has carried out
seven aid-the-poor projects in remote areas with the total
investment reaching 3.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Further, the provincial government, since 1994, has allocated
an additional 50 million yuan every year for the purpose.

<HEADLINE> Parley Held to Avoid showdown on CPP Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- In a significant move,
India's Congress Party President Sitaram Kesri and Congress
Working Committee (CWC) member Rajesh Pilot discussed the issue of
the Congress parliamentary party (CPP) leadership on Wednesday,
the Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Pilot refused to disclose what transpired during the one- hour
meeting but reaffirmed his position on the holding of election for
a new CPP leader to replace former Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha
Rao without further postponement.
</P>
<P>
Rao resigned from the CPP leadership under immense pressure
from his own party on December 19, triggering off the current race
for his position.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday Kesri-Pilot meeting was the first between the two
leaders after Pilot announced his decision to stand in the
election.
</P>
<P>
Pilot has been insisting that a new CPP leader should be chosen
by a ballot while Kesri supporters say the Congress president
should become the consensus choice to avoid the emergency of "two
power centers" within the party.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his meeting with Kesri, Pilot said he was invited
by Kesri to his residence for discussions. "The Congress president
called me. So I went," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pilot's meeting with Kesri took place after he sent a letter to
CPP Secretary H. Hanumanthappa, demanding that the schedule for
the deferred CPP leadership election should be formally announced.
</P>
<P>
Kesri's meeting with Pilot was believed to be part of the
efforts to avoid a showdown on the CPP leadership issue. The
Congress president is also expected to meet another rival, senior
Congress party leader Sharad Pawar.

<HEADLINE> HKFA, Senior Club Fined for Cup Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the Hong Kong
Football Association (HKFA) and senior football club South China
breathed a sign of relief after the association and the club were
each given a relatively light fine of 5,000 U.S. dollars for the
violence which occurred during a September match in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The officials were grateful that none of their players was
suspended by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), the sport's
regional governing body, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The AFC held a disciplinary meeting last Thursday in Abu Dhabi,
the United Arab Emirates, during the Asian Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Violence erupted during an ill-tempered Asian Cup Winners' Cup
first-round, second-leg match on September 29 at the Hong Kong
Stadium between South China and Indonesia's Mastrans Bandung Raya.
</P>
<P>
But Bandung players were barred from playing all AFC-sectioned
tournaments for a year and fined 10,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bandong's Cameroon defender Kissito Atangana who was sent off
for a crude tackling from behind on South China's Dale Tempest in
the match, was also suspended for a year.
</P>
<P>
Players scuffled and fans pelted the Indonesian bench with
plastic bottles and other missiles moments after Atangana was sent
off for the second half.
</P>
<P>
Some of South China players were involved in fighting and an
Indonesian player was seen throwing a corner flag into the
spectators.
</P>
<P>
Police were called in to restore order.
</P>
<P>
The HKFA was believed to be fined for failing to control the
crowd during the match.
</P>
<P>
Twelve South China players were chosen into the Hong Kong team
for next year's World Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
"The HKFA has not received any AFC confirmation of a fine, but
if the reports are true then a fine is better than a suspension,
especially with our World Cup qualifying matches coming up," said
Peter Leung, the Hong Kong team's administrative executive
director and a representative of South China.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Partner Leaders Demand Party Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Nepal's second
ruling party have demanded a party central committee meeting
within one week to outline the party's future after a censure
motion against the coalition government failed to pass Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter Wednesday, 21 central committee members of the
National Democratic Party (RPP) asked party president Surya
Bahadur Thapahim to call the meeting within seven days to discuss
the political crisis the party is facing.
</P>
<P>
Three of the RPP's 19 MPs in the lower house Tuesday voted
against a no-trust motion against Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba and his three-party government.
</P>
<P>
The motion tabled by main opposition the Communist Party of
Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), was rejected with only
101 MPs voting in favor, two votes short of the required 103 for
its passage in the 205-seat house.
</P>
<P>
Nine RPP MPs voted for the motion while the other MPs of the
party were absent from the voting.
</P>
<P>
The RPP seems to have split into two factions after its
parliamentary leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand and President Thapa
clashed over whether to withdraw from the ruling coalition and
support the opposition-tabled motion.
</P>
<P>
The RPP's 41-member central committee earlier decided to
withdraw the party's support to the government by a majority vote
of 23 but Thapa expelled six of the members voting for the
discussion.
</P>
<P>
The six expelled members, believed close to Chand who wanted to
topple the government led by the Nepali Congress (NC) and form a
new coalition with the CPN-UML, were among those who asked Thapa
to call the party's central committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
The RPP, with its 19 seats in the house, holds the key to any
political equation in Nepal as each of the NC and the CPN-UML, the
two largest parties with 86 and 88 seats respectively, could not
form a majority government without its support.

<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China has worked out plans to
aid more poor people in poverty-stricken areas in the coming year,
according to the People's Daily (overseas edition}.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted recently that three major programs would be
launched by the China Poverty Relief foundation, a
non-governmental organization in the country.
</P>
<P>
They include a program to provide adequate drinking for
residents in arid regions in northwestern china, and a farmland
improvement program to help poor farmers in rocky mountain areas
in the southwest to build more terraced fields so that they will
be able to solve the problem of feeding.
</P>
<P>
Among others, a housing project for Yi ethnic group in
Daliangshan Mountainous area of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, will help the ethnic Yi people change the traditional
way of living so that they will separate their dwellings from the
sheds for their livestock.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding eight years ago, the poverty relief
foundation has gone all out to support the economic development in
poverty-stricken areas, and to help locals to eliminate poverty.

<HEADLINE> Yacht Race Favourites Recalled after False Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Most of the pre-race
favourites at the 52nd Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race restart later
Thursday after prematurely breaking the line, according to reports
from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong yacht Exile had led the 95-yacht fleet down Sydney
Harbour but was recalled by race officials and suffered a
20-minute penalty after being among a group of yachts which
broke the line ahead of the official starter's gun.
</P>
<P>
The crews aboard other yachts, including German maxi Morning
Glory and Australian maxis Brindabella and Amazon, immediately
realised their mistakes and rounded the fleet to start again in
light northerly winds without incurring a 20-minute penalty.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Yacht Sydney, a 60-foot yacht designed and
helmed by Australian America's Cup veteran Iain Murray, surprised
its more fancied rivals by reaching the heads first ahead of
Australian maxi Condor, winner of the race in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Brindabella, owned by Australian businessman George Snow,
was runner-up the past two years but made up good time after its
restart to pass Condor soon after it left the harbour.
</P>
<P>
The 95-boat fleet faced a tough run after the wind died
shortly after they left Sydney Harbour. A southerly change was
expected on Thursday afternoon and there appeared little hope
that any would challenge the 21-year-old race record, one of the
most prized in international yachting.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Pro-peace tribal leader of the
Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) was gunned down Wednesday, a day
after fresh peace talks started between the government and the
tribal insurgents for a lasting solution to the long-drawn CHT
issue, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Subinoy Chakma, who had been actively involved in the peace
process in the area since his surrender to government 10 years
ago, was killed by a single shot behind his head within 40 yards
(about 40 meters) of his residence at Champaknagar in the
Rangamati Hill district town.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina last night expressed her deep
shock at the killing and directed the local administration to
round up the persons responsible for the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Chakma was secretary general of the CHT National Coordination
and Peace Council, a combined body of tribal and non-tribal people
of the three hill districts -- Rangamati, Khagrachari and
Bandarban.
</P>
<P>
The council welcomed the fresh peace talks between the
government and leaders of Parbartya Chattagram Jana Sanghati
Samity (PCJSS), a paramilitary organization of the
autonomy-seeking ethnic minority rebels in the CHT area.
</P>
<P>
It organized two "long-march" campaigns of tribal and

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 26 (Xinhua) -- As regional and global
integration efforts are reshaping the world's economic order,
Latin America is trying to define its position as an active part
of this historical current.
</P>
<P>
Latin America, with a total population of nearly 450 million, a
gross regional product of over two trillion U.S. dollars and an
annual foreign trade volume of 493 billion dollars, has to build
internally to reach out externally.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, statistics from different sources concur on
the fact that the Latin American economy has walked out from the
shadow last year, precipitated by the financial crisis in Mexico
and the recession in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The region's average gross domestic product (GDP) growth is
expected to reach 3.4 percent this year, much higher than the 0.6
percent last year, according to an annual report of the United
Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Argentina, two major economies in Latin America,
have recorded three and 3.5 percent growth rates respectively;
while Mexico, the most populous country in the region, recovered
faster than expected with a 4.5 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
In the year, more capital has flowed into Latin America, the
amount of which hit 50 billion dollars. Foreign direct investment
climbed to 30.8 billion dollars from last year's 16.8 billion,
making the region second only to Asia among the recipients of
direct investment in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation is showing a downward trend and the
average is estimated at 19.3 percent, representing a drop of 24
percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Alongside the macroeconomic stability, the regional integration
process has gathered stronger momentum.
</P>
<P>
Latin America's economic scenario has been characterized in
1996 by the dynamism and the progressive convergence of various
mechanisms of integration, such as the South American Common
Market (Mercosur), the Andean Community, the Central American
Common Market and the Caribbean Community.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, the biggest free trade alliance in South America
formed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, has grown
stronger since its creation in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Chile and Bolivia have become associate members of Mercosur
after signing free trade accords with the bloc in June and
December respectively. Venezuela, Mexico and other countries are
also interested in joining the trade body.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Mercosur and the Andean Community, which is
made up of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, are
negotiating to establish a larger free trade zone in the South
American continent.
</P>
<P>
The accelerating integration of Latin American economies,
backed by the improved individual performance by many of them, has
put Latin America in a better position in negotiations with other
trade groups in the world, thus consolidating the basis for its
participation in the globalization process.

<HEADLINE> Small Dog Gives Birth to Nine Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A small dog in China's capital
has given birth to nine cubs, and they are now growing healthily.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that it is rare a dog gives birth to such a
large number of cubs in China, as there are usually four cubs at
one birth.
</P>
<P>
The mother dog, called "Pipi", is 30 cm tall and 60 cm long,
and has been registered with the local dog-raising management
office. Its husband lives just next door, according to the Beijing
Daily.
</P>
<P>
On the night of November 6, the dog's belly was as big as a big
water melon, and it had to lay down at a corner of its owner's
house. At 21:30 pm, it gave birth to a cub, and very soon one
after another until the ninth.
</P>
<P>
And the delivery process lasted nine hours until 6:00 the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
The dog now is very tired day and night, as it has to feed its
nine cubs with its eight nipples. So the dog owner has to prepare
eight bags of milk to feed the cubs to avoid their fighting for
milk.
</P>
<P>
At present, smaller cubs eat four meals a day and the bigger ones
three per day.
</P>
<P>
Big Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou,
have imposed strict regulations on dog raising to limit the dog
population.

<TEXT>
<P>
A further extension of the regional efforts, so as to join the
ongoing global economic integration, is what's needed to address
one of Latin America's biggest challenges: lack of diversity in
trade relations and capital sources.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the fact that without diversifying its trade links and
capital sources, the region would be difficult to keep abreast
with the globalization process, many Latin American leaders have
visited major economies in Asia and Europe in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Samper, the Colombian president, declared after his
Asian tour that his country could no longer afford to turn its
back on the economically most dynamic region of the world.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Frei, the Chilean president, concluded after a European
trip that the strengthening of relations between his country and
the European Union will be an important step towards engaging
Chile in the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
The desire to expand intercontinental economic and trade ties
has not been unilateral.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from Germany, Japan, Portugal, Spain, South Korea and
Russia paraded, one after the other, through the American
continent in 1996, leaving behind themselves proof of their
interest in Latin America, particularly in investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese prime minister, was the most
eloquent in expressing his confidence in the future of Latin
America. He asserted, while touring the region, that it
constitutes a vital link for world development in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
However, while every economy is faced with the challenge of how
to adapt itself to the globalization process, the challenge has
special implications for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
In the first place, although progress has been made in economic
and administrative reforms centered on free-market policy, Latin
American societies are still being perplexed by a wide gap between
the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
At present, one in every three Latin Americans is mired in
poverty and many people have not benefited from the economic
expansion. The situation has the potential to trigger social
unrest, analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, growth in recent years was basically due to
capital inflows and active exports, but Latin America is limited
in capital sources and export markets.
</P>
<P>
In the second place, Latin American countries face the task of
readjusting their economic policies in face of continuing
protectionism in the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that Latin America should give equal
emphasis to production and trade when they are implementing
export-oriented policies.
</P>
<P>
Domestic industrial structure should be optimized and domestic
market cultivated, they said.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the rapid progress of globalization is due, to a great
extent, to the technology innovations in the past few decades.
Latin America, as a part of the developing world, has to develop a
new education system to improve the quality of its work force.
</P>
<P>
Latin America, with bright prospects as well as big challenges
ahead, is emerging as a new dynamic economic bloc. The region's
continued development and integration efforts will no doubt help
it claim a due position in the globalized world economy and play a
bigger role in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Lifts Price Controls on Small Autos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry has
lifted price controls on small automobiles with engines smaller
than 1600cc as supply currently exceeds demand on the country's
market.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasani said auto companies now
can set their own prices freely, but must post visible price tags
on all vehicles to be sold.
</P>
<P>
The executives of auto companies which fail to do so will face
a one-year term in jail or a fine up to 100,000 baht (4,000 U.S.
dollars), the minister was quoted as saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Auto makers and importers no longer have to inform the Internal
Trade Department of their stock volume, but must keep the
department up-to-date on their prices, Narongchai said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, he said, the price controls were necessary because
demand outstripped supply and auto dealers used the market trend
to take advantage of buyers with inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that a fully competitive auto market will benefit
buyers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1996: Year of Bumper Harvest in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to a bumper harvest,
the year 1996 saw an eight percent growth of Zimbabwe's Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), one of the highest since the independence
of "the grain basket" in southern Africa in 1980.
</P>
<P>
A 49 percent increase has been registered in the agricultural
growth, in which maize production rose to 2.6 million tons, up
from 839,000 tons in 1995, and wheat production increased to
250,000 tons, up from 65,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government has decided to export 300,000 tons
of maize, the country's staple food, and 100,000 tons of wheat.
</P>
<P>
Other crops also registered record increases, among which the
production of tobacco, Zimbabwe's largest foreign currency
earner, rose from 198,000 tons to 209,000 tons, earning 610
million U.S. Dollars for the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Cotton production rose from 104,700 tons in 1995 to 275,000
tons this season, the third best harvest in the history of
Zimbabwe's cotton production.
</P>
<P>
And the production of 100,000 tons of soya beans met the local
demands for the first time since the 1991/92 season.
</P>
<P>
Sufficient rainfall and the government's agricultural policy
have attributed to this year's bumper harvest.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe recently formulated a 1995-2020 plan
for agricultural development in a bid to change small-holder
agriculture into a fully commercial farming system and to enable
a crop output higher than population growth.
</P>
<P>
As a result, agricultural investment were increased, loans,
fertilizer, seeds and technical know-how were provided to the
farmers. And improved variety and scientific farming were also
widely applied.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's agricultural future will still depend
on the weather. And the good rains this year promise a good
harvest.
</P>
<P>
Under normal conditions, Zimbabwe's domestic agricultural
sector could well feed the nation. But last year's serious
drought was disastrous to the national economy in which
agriculture is the pillar.
</P>
<P>
GDP growth fell by one percent in 1995. And the government had
to import about 500,000 tons of maize as relief food for more
than six million of the country's 10.5 million population.
</P>
<P>
To achieve a sustainable agricultural development, the
government embarked on a five-year one-billion-Dollar project to
build over 100 dams nationwide to minimize the negative effects
of the drought seasons.
</P>
<P>
It also decided to put 500,000 tons of maize into its
"strategic reserve stocks" which, according to the government
plan, would be kept at 954,000 tons in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"The scheme was designed to ensure that no one starves during
drought seasons," said Agricultural Minister Denis Norman.
</P>
<P>
The plan of commercial farming has also been in full swing
during the past season, raising hopes of more harvests next year.
</P>
<P>
All the early planted crops have been doing well thanks to the
good rainfall which started during the first two weeks of this
month. So far, 85 percent of the maize and 95 percent of soya
beans have been planted.
</P>
<P>
And a better start is also visible in the cotton planting this
season owing to more surface water for irrigation. And tobacco
farmers have been expanding their crops.
</P>
<P>
"If current weather patterns persist, Zimbabwe could
experience its highest ever agricultural output," said Norman.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Send Troops to Fight Terrorism in Lima </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that Russia could send special troops to Lima to help
combat terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who just returned to the Kremlin Monday after his
recovery from a by-pass heart surgery in November, said this in a
letter to his Peruvian counterpart, Alberto Fujimori, the
Itar-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also appealed to the leaders of Group-7 -- the United
States, Canada, Britain, Japan, Italy, France and Germany -- to
provide Peru with necessary assistance, including sending special
forces to help free the hostages taken by rebels of the Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA).
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis of Peru began late last Tuesday when MRTA
guerrillas seized the Japanese ambassador's residence and took
hostage hundreds of people at a reception in honor of Japanese
emperor's birthday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president, who saw the incident as a challenge to
the international community and another indication that terrorist
activities went without national boundaries, proposed to set up a
joint commanding office of special troops from the Group-7
countries and Russia if Peru gave the green light.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Investment Policies not Fully Implemented in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has failed to tap the
potential of its investment policies in 1996, a senior Ukrainian
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Valery Litvitsky, aide to
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, said the worst chapter of
Ukraine's economic crisis has passed, but Ukraine is not
attractive for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade was facing numerous limitations in the country.
Ukraine's economic reform has not gone fast enough this year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has drawn about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars of foreign
investment during the first nine months of this year, equal to the
total figure of four years since the country became independent in
1991. But it was only a fraction of what its East European
neighbors have pulled in.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ukraine needs 40 billion dollars in
investment to prop up its ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Unstable and ever-changing economic policies are the main enemy
to foreign investors, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He forecast Ukraine would see a large increase in foreign
investment next year and announced the country's trade deficit has
dropped by 40 percent compared with last year, while export
revenues were balanced with its import value in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ukraine's foreign debts were decreasing, standing at
8.5 billion dollars now, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's biggest creditor is Russia. It has owed Russia more
than 3.6 billion dollars by the end of this year, followed by
Turkmenistan with 704 million dollars, and the International
Monetary Fund, almost 2.2 billion dollars.

contrast to a decrease in grain output in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The harvest has made it much easier for the government to
purchase grain from farmers this year.
</P>
<P>
To make the purchase of grain more successful, the government
raised grain purchasing prices by a large margin. Officials at
various levels in the province also made adequate preparations to
raise enough money to purchase grain in advance.
</P>
<P>
In addition, working groups dispatched by the government have
made rounds of the countryside to inspect grain purchasing.
</P>
<P>
During the process of grain purchasing, no 'IOUs' have been
given to farmers.

<HEADLINE> ASEM Not Ready to Admit New Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Asian and European officials
have agreed that the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) would not admit
any new members before its next summit scheduled for 1998, a
senior Thai Foreign Ministry official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was reached at a meeting of senior officials from
Asia and the European Union (EU) last week in Dublin, Ireland,
during which the form of political dialogue and expansion of
membership were discussed.
</P>
<P>
The decision on whether to admit new members might be made by
leaders from the two regions at the 1998 ASEM meeting in London,
according to Saroj Chavanaviraj, permanent secretary for foreign
affairs, who represented Thailand at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
ASEM currently comprises the 15 EU nations and 10 nations from
Asia - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand, Vietnam, China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
At the Dublin meeting, Germany and Malaysia suggested that the
newly-born ASEM Foundation should be consolidated before it admits
new members as there are not so many activities at hand, Saroj was
quoted by local newspapers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Australia, New Zealand, India and Pakistan reportedly have
formally asked for membership on the Asian side, while European
countries including Switzerland, Norway, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Bulgaria, Russia and Ukraine also want to join.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed in principle that each region will
consider whether to admit new members only from their respective
sides.

NANJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Implementation of the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) became the focus of a
seminar attended by Chinese officials, Non-governmental
Organization (NGO) leaders and officials from the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The seminar, held in Zhangjiagang city of east China's Jiangsu
province, was designed to promote CRC among relevant departments,
NGOs and different social circles so that children's rights can be
better protected.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF advisor Goonesekere explained the background and content

Officials from the Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Civil
Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the State Education
Commission (SEC), and college professors reviewed the legal status
of Chinese children, children's right to education and various
related laws and regulations adopted by Chinese law-makers.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Protection of Minors went into effect in 1992, and
other related laws and regulations have also been drafted. China
mapped out the Outlines on Development Plans for Children in the
1990s, soon after it approved the CRC. The Outlines detail goals
and effective measures in the area of children's rights.
</P>
<P>
Since CRC was taken into effect in April, 1992, working

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Proposes Better Relations with with Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov proposed Wednesday that his country sign a friendship and
cooperation treaty and a free trade accord with neighboring
Bulgaria and Albania, according to reports from Skoplje.
</P>
<P>
Outlining Macedonia's foreign policy at a year-end session of
the parliament, Gligorov said such accords will be conducive to
cooperation and reconciliation in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the fact that the development of the
ties between Macedonia and Albania remained in a standstill due to
certain political factors was unfavorable for both sides.
</P>
<P>
It was in the interests of Macedonia to develop ties with
Bulgaria on the basis of a new political reality in the Balkan
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gligorov stressed that the present was the best time to adopt a
realistic attitude and overcome the problems in the bilateral
relations between Macedonia and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
On Macedonia's ties with Yugoslavia, Gligorov said the
normalization of ties between the two countries has made it
possible for their regular, equal and mutually beneficial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Gligorov expressed the hope that Macedonia will solve the issue
of border demarcation with Yugoslavia in the spirit of the treaty
on normalization of relations the two sides signed in April this
year.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Greece, Gligorov said the interim agreement
on normalization of ties which Macedonia signed with Greece in
September this year had brought the two countries' relations into
a new positive stage.
</P>
<P>
Gligorov said Macedonia held a pragmatic and optimistic
attitude toward the negotiations with Greece in the United Nations
on the dispute over Macedonia's name, which Greece said implies
Macedonia's territorial claim to one of its province with the same
name as Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
On Macedonia's Asian ties, Gligorov said cooperation with
China, Japan and other Asian countries are developing positively.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the president reiterated his country's
intention to join the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
</P>
<P>
When addressing domestic issues, Gligorov said the government
will carry out new investment and stabilization programs.
</P>
<P>
So far, 90 percent of Macedonia's enterprises have been
privatized, Gligorov said.
</P>
<P>
While the market, currency and supply remain stable and
inflation comes under control, inadequate investment in the
infrastructure sector, unemployment and other social problems
still remain as sensative issues, said Gligorov.

<HEADLINE> Economic Reform in Tibet Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Over the past two years, the
Tibet Autonomous Region has given full scope to the market role by
carrying out reforms in state-owned enterprises, and in such
sectors as tax, finance, investment, price and social security.
</P>
<P>
Many factories have introduced a modern enterprise system. For
example, the Lhasa Beer Brewery has set up a market-oriented
managerial body. By establishing joint ventures, it has raised 36
million yuan, increasing its capital and reducing its debts. Its
output this year is expected to rise to 15,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Breakthroughs have been made in introducing the share-holding
system. The year 1996 saw the listing of two Tibetan companies in
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of the reform, some state-owned enterprises
have been seeking cooperation partners and raising funds to
expand their business.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the regional government is encouraging the
development of private businesses, in a bid to establish an open,
competitive and orderly market system.
</P>
<P>
The government has decontrolled prices of over 85 percent of
capital goods, those of 90 percent of farm products and animal
by-products and those of 95 percent of manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
In infrastructure construction, the ratio of the
government investment has decreased to 40 percent from 68.8
percent in 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey by the Polish
Central Bureau for Statistics shows that unhealthy eating habits
and excessive use of flavorings are the main causes of some common
artery diseases in Poland.
</P>
<P>
The survey, on 100,000 subjects, discovers that increasingly
more people die of unhealthy diets in recent years as compared to
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
For example, cardiac anemia and brain artery disease, two
common diseases here, are caused by unhealthy foods and have now
become the main killers.
</P>
<P>
The study also indicates that compared with 35 years ago,
diseases like hypertension, diabetes and cirrhosis are ever more
connected with foods containing much animal fat and high
cholesterol, or to excessive use of alcohol and salt.
</P>
<P>
Polish nutritionists recommend a more balanced model of daily
dietary: less pork, beef, eggs, sweets, dessert and salt; and more
chickens, fish, vegetables, fruits, peas, walnuts, grain and
potatos.

<HEADLINE> Audio-Video Industry Aims at Rental Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China's audio-video industry
is focussing its eyes on the renting of videos and CDs.
</P>
<P>
Hiring instead of buying on the retail market is seen as a new
weapon against pirate videos and audio material, the Press and
publishing Journal has reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that chain stores will be established for
electronic product renting, helping to boost the country's
audio-video industry.
</P>
<P>
And a corporation for audio-visual product hire businesses will
be set up jointly by the China Audio-visual Association and the
General Administration of Posts.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 60,000 post offices scattered in
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, said Sheng
Minghuan, head of the administration, adding that they will be a
great advantage for the development of electronic publication
rental services.
</P>
<P>
The country's audiovisual industry developed rapidly in the
early 1980s, But it was threatened by pirated electronic
products, and dived into a all-time low period.
</P>
<P>
The circulation of any tapes or video cassettes could only
reach 1,000, said the paper, adding that it was far from meeting
the demand of the market.
</P>
<P>
China now has 100,000 stores dealing with the release of
electronic material, and 80,000 video rooms, the paper said, with
only 3.56 million items sold each year.
</P>
<P>
However, nearly 24 million audio-video products are needed per
year, said Liu Guowei, president of the Audio-Visual Association.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the market has been occupied by illegal electronic
publications.
</P>
<P>
The country's audio-video product dealers hailed the move and
believed it will be am effective step in the fight against pirated
and pornographic publications.

<P>
MANILA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- There are in the Philippines
approximately 3.7 million child laborers, aged between 5 and 17,
and most of them are working under hazardous conditions, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the working children, or a total of 2.2
million, have been exposed to hazardous conditions in their work
places, the reports said, citing a recent survey by the National
Statistics Office.
</P>
<P>
As a result, almost one of every four working children has
experienced work-related injury or illness, according to the
survey, conducted with close cooperation from the Department of
Labor and Employment.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Gert Gust, head of the International
Labor Organization' program for the elimination of child labor, is

<HEADLINE> Rebels Free Japanese Diplomat in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Peru's rebels released a sick-
looking Japanese diplomat on Christmas Day from the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima, where they are still holding 104
captives and demanding freedom for their jailed comrades.
</P>
<P>
The freed man was identified by Japanese officials as Kenji
Hirata, 34, a first secretary at the Japanese embassy in Lima.
</P>
<P>
Steven Anderson, spokesman for the International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC), said Hirata "left because he was in a
delicate condition."
</P>
<P>
After a medical team which checks on the hostages health daily
determined that Hirata needed medical help, ICRC officials asked
for the release of Hirata on medical grounds and the rebels (the
MRTA) accepted, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, President Alberto Fujimori's daughter Keiko
appealed for the release of hostages from the besieged Japanese
embassy residence.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to make an appeal to the MRTA (rebels) to lay
down their arms," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
On Christmas Eve, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA)
guerrillas freed the Uruguayan ambassador after his government
released two suspected members of the MRTA from jail.
</P>
<P>
The release created a crisis in Peruvian-Uruguayan relations.
Peru, expressing its displeasure over the release, has called back
its top diplomat in Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Uruguay's move might weaken the hard-line
position of the Peruvian government, and that some countries might
start unilateral negotiations with the rebels to extract their
nationals held hostage.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 MRTA guerrillas stormed the Japanese ambassador's
residence on December 17, holding over 400 officials, diplomats
and dignitaries hostage and demanding the government release their
imprisoned comrades. Japan has around 30 nationals inside the
besieged residence, including its ambassador Morihisa Aoki.
</P>
<P>
The rebels also wanted an end to the free-market economic
policies and more state support for the poor.
</P>
<P>
President Fujimori has flatly rejected all the demands,
promising not to storm the building if the guerrillas released the
captives and laid down their weapons.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, nevertheless, have said that they would not
surrender until the government release more than 400 jailed MRTA
members.
</P>
<P>
They released all women and many of the young and elderly on
the first night of the siege. They released 38 men Friday night
and 225 more as a "Christmas gesture" Sunday night.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Build Another Nuclear Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
started selecting possible sites for the country's next nuclear
power station, the local daily Manila Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Energy Secretary Francisco Viray as saying the
nuclear power steering committee had identified 10 possible sites
across the country for the new nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
The country's first nuclear power plant was built in Bataan
Province in the central Philippines, but had to be mothballed
after it was embroiled in a political controversy, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Viray said the nuclear power steering committee will soon
conduct initial inspection of at least four candidate sites to
further determine the suitability for building a nuclear power
plant.
</P>
<P>
Under a work program drafted by the committee, the new nuclear
power plant is tentatively scheduled to be in commercial operation
by 2025.
</P>
<P>
By 2025, nuclear energy can provide a small part of the
country's power needs. Imported coal will still account for the
largest share of 30,400 megawatts, followed by imported oil with
29,684 megawatts and local coal with 7,120 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Viray emphasized that the government has not closed the door on
the possibility of operating a nuclear power plant despite the
shutdown of the existing nuclear power plant in Bataan.

<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China's largest metropolis
Shanghai is embarking on an ambitious program to turn itself into
a world culture center, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The new image is already taking shape as the sparkling new
Shanghai Library, Shanghai Grand Theater, Broadcasting Mansion and
the Oriental Television Tower stand out against the backdrop of
a thriving commercial hub, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Culture constitutes a major part of Shanghai's long-term
development blueprint so that the city will become a metropolis
distinguished not only for its industry, commerce and finance but
also for its culture," said Chen Zhili, deputy-secretary of the
Shanghai Municipal Party Committee.
</P>
<P>
"A metropolis that develops only industry and commerce will not
be a powerful attraction and will not have a bright future," said
Chen, who is in charge of the city's overall development in
Culture, education, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee
has approved two major documents in which major tasks in the
city's cultural development are outlined. These include raising
the cultural level of residents, improving the city's cultural
life, elevating the city's civil environment and enabling
Shanghai's performing arts troupes to be among the best in the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese adults should pay more
attention to electronic media and give better instructions to
their children on how to use TV and CD-ROM, an article urged here
today.
</P>
<P>
Children in many parts of the world are excessive TV watchers
and computer users, and they might misunderstand messages from the
adult world, today's "China Daily" said, adding that the situation
"is just slightly better" in China.
</P>
<P>
The article revealed that students in a high school in Beijing
prefer kungfu and action films to Chinese historical films with
more cultural and moral contents.
</P>
<P>
"Bad TV programs can have bad influences on adults, and even
more so on kids," it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, China does not have a single book or
magazine to help children use electronic media, much less an
educational system that can help.
</P>
<P>
It suggested parents and social institutes make greater efforts
in helping children use electronic media in a correct way. In this
regard, more books should be published to help their parents guide
them to the proper entrance ramps, it added.

CANBERRA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- An Australian aircraft will
Thursday search the Southern Ocean for a lone French sailor
believed to be in serious difficulties, according to reports on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The yacht Algimouss, skippered and sailed by 28-year-old
Raphael Dinelli alone, had activated distress beacons at about
1,250 nautical miles away from Perth, the reports said.
</P>

An air force spokesman said three of the yacht's four emergency
beacons had been activated, including one that operates only when
the hull was taking in water.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Algimouss, originally part of the fleet
competing in the Vendee Globe solo round-the-world race which
started on November 3, had dropped out of the race a couple of
days ago.

<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital will have
14.9 billion yuan (about 1.78 billion US dollars) worth of
revenues this year, an increase of nearly 29 percent over last

<HEADLINE> Hard Year for Chinese Swimming (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua/OANA) -- With a modest show of
winning one gold and three silvers at the Centennial Olympic
Games, the Chinese swimming team was by no means satisfied in the
year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
World champion Le Jingyi chalked up China's sole swimming gold
in the women's 100-meter freestyle and got a silver in her
specialty, the 50-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Butterfly expert Liu Limin finished runner-up in the 100 meters
while the other silver came from the women's 4x100 meters
freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
"China's swimming faces serious problems," said Chen Yunpeng,
former head coach and current adviser of the Chinese national
team. "If we can't cope with the problems properly, we will have
an uncertain future."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women team, which has emerged as an impressive
swimming force in the world from early 1990s, is sharp in
sprinting events, but is quite weak in the middle and long
distance.
</P>
<P>
"That's our fatal weakness," said Chen. "No country or region
will come out as a powerhouse without improving in the middle and
long distance events."
</P>
<P>
In the total of 32 Olympic swimming events, 18 are of the
middle and long distance.
</P>
<P>
Chen also showed his worry about the younger
generation. "Comparing with those from other countries, the
Chinese youngsters have no advantage at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
China fielded a line-up mixed with the old and the young for
the Centennial Games. None of these youngsters claimed a medal in
the individual events even though they registered impressive
results in the national Olympics trials last April.
</P>
<P>
However, China did have something to celebrate, which came not
from the female this time.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Qiliang and Jiang Chengji both entered the men's finals in
Atlanta. Jiang's fourth-place finish is the best ever result for
the Chinese male at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"It's a historical breakthrough for us," said Jiang's coach
Zhou Ming. Jiang also set up two new Asian records in the 50-meter
freestyle and 100-meter butterfly.

<TEXT>
<P>
With the home-turf advantage, the United States was the biggest
winner in the Olympic pool with 13 golds, 11 silvers and two
bronzes, well ahead of second-placed Russia at 4-2-2.
</P>
<P>
For Amy Van Dyken, 1996 was a year of fame.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Dyken, who suffered from asthmatic, became the
first American woman to win four titles at a single Games.
</P>
<P>
Less-known Irish woman Michelle Smith, a freckled redhead from
a small town of Rathcoole, southwest of Dublin, surprised the
world by snatching three golds and one bronze in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Smith's overnight fame triggered off mudslinging by her
American counterparts who alleged the Irish might have used
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, stuck in mud were those swimmers from Australia and
the United States. Australia's Samantha Riley, who failed a doping
test at the Rio de Janeiro World Short-course Championships, got
only a "strong warning" from the FINA, causing an outcry in the
swimming world that both the American and world swimming bodies
had used double standard.
</P>
<P>
In the quickest possible response to the Riley case, the
U.S. Swimming overturned a two-year suspension imposed on Jessica
Foschi, who was caught for using steroid at the U.S. swimming
summer national championships.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old Foschi was allowed to participate in the
U.S. trials in Indianapolis last March, but she failed to gain a
berth in the Olympic roster.
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, it was difficult to single out who
was the top swimmer of the year.
</P>
<P>
American Tom Dolan, Russian Alexander Popov, Denis Pankratov
all showed top form in their respective events.
</P>
<P>
One thing was certain that Popov has taken the limelight both
inside and outside the pool.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Popov, who now lives in Australia, was stabbed
in the abdomen in a street fight in Moscow, just one month after
winning two Olympic golds for his country.
</P>
<P>
Popov has recovered from his wound. Let's hope he won't be one
more Monica Seles, who never regained her top form shown in the
years before the knife-attack incident.

<HEADLINE> Company Provides Shuttle Bus Service for Pupils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A service to shuttle
primary-school students between school and their homes has been
offered by a local bus company in Guangzhou, reported today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The service, initiated early this month, has caught the
attention of parents across the capital city of south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Currently, ten such buses have been used to run on eight lines
connecting Guangzhou's several major primary schools and
surrounding residential areas.
</P>
<P>
At least 150 pupils, living far from their schools, are now
using the bus service.
</P>
<P>
The charge for the service is 250 yuan (30 US dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
Company officials said they were considering the transportation
of more pupils and that 1,000 kids would be able to use the
service by February of next year when around 70 such buses are
expected to be put to use.
</P>
<P>
Reports suggest that many families have moved out of the city
limits in recent years to residential areas in Guangzhou's
suburban regions.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30,000 such pupils have to take buses themselves or be
accompanied by their parents to school.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification Enters into Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Convention
to Combat Desertification (CCD), designed to curb degradation of
arid lands affecting more than 1 billion people worldwide, entered
into force today.
</P>
<P>
The environmental treaty, called for at the Rio Earth summit in
1992 and adopted in June 1994, has been ratified by 53 countries
up to now.
</P>
<P>
The interim secretariat of the CCD said in a press release
issued here that the damage caused by desertification remain
staggering as the livelihoods of more than 1 billion people are at
risk despite the rising international mobilization to fight
desertification and drought.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of the 5.2 billion hectares of dry lands used
for agriculture around the world are already degraded, it says.
The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) estimates that
desertification costs the world 42 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
"In all, desertification damages 30 percent of the total land
area of the world and 110 countries have dry lands potentially at
risk," says the secretariat, stressing that desertification is not
just a problem limited to developing countries, "parts of Spain,
Italy, France, Portugal and Greece also suffer from
desertification."
</P>
<P>
Large parts of Australia are also desertified while many of the
most affected areas in Asia are in Russia and the former USSR
republics, it said.
</P>
<P>
The first conference of the parties to the CCD will be hosted
by the Italian government in Rome from September 29 to October 10,
1997, with the support of the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO). A preparatory meeting next January will try
to lay the final groundwork for the conference.
</P>
<P>
The two meetings will determine the remaining elements to be
resolved concerning the future infrastructure, budgets and
location of the permanent secretariat of the CCD, for which
Germany's Bonn, Spain's Murcia and Canada's Montreal are
candidates.

<HEADLINE> China Provides 2.3 Billion Yuan in Relief Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China has provided 2.3 billion
yuan (about 277 million US dollars) in relief funds to disaster
victims this year.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Civil Affairs said that this sum
of money comes from the central government's budget and another
960 million yuan from governments of various provinces and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that this marks a good beginning for the disaster
relief work during the Ninth Five-Year (1996-2000) Plan period,
according to the China Social News.
</P>
<P>
This year is the most serious disaster year after 1991 because
24 provinces and autonomous were hit by flooding and 18 by
drought. But the basic life of the disaster-affected people is
secured.
</P>
<P>
By November, the ministry had received domestic and overseas
relief donations worth 220 million yuan, while the disaster-hit
areas accepted relief donations worth 750 million yuan. The
donations have been provided to the disaster-hit people promptly.
</P>
<P>
The disaster-affected areas have computerized their disaster
relief information and offered preferential policies to guarantee
the relief work, including the exemption from and reduction of
taxes.
</P>
<P>
The ministry stressed the need to further improve the disaster
relief work and make sure that disaster-affected people live a
secure life.

HONG KONG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China, one of the
organizers, will be absent from the starting stages as the
inaugural Tour of South China Sea Cycling Race opens here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Chinese Cycling Association (CCA) complained

The tour has set five stages -- the first two in Hong Kong, the
third in Zhuhai of South China's Guangdong province, and the last

race in the Victoria Park in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the first two stages here are 11 teams -- five
from host Hong Kong, two each from Macao and Chinese Taipei, and
one each from South Korea and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Tian Junrong, deputy secretary-general of CCA, said that
although the Chinese teams are to suffer from not competing in the

third stage in Zhuhai.

<HEADLINE> 100 Alleged Terrorists Killed in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Defense
Force in an offensive has killed and wounded over 100 alleged
terrorists who tried to cross into Ethiopia in an attempt to
attack the town of Dollo again.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted a statement issued by the
Defense Ministry as saying today that 19 members of the
multinational Islamic extremist group killed during the recent
offensive were Arab nationals from different Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"The terrorists were crushed last August by the Ethiopian
Defense Force while bracing to destabilize the sub-region and
impose Islam fundamentalism by force with the help of some
neighboring countries," the statement recalled.
</P>
<P>
It added that the remnants were forced to flee to far off
areas deep into Somalia in a futile attempt to reorganize
themselves.
</P>
<P>
However, Somalia accused Ethiopian troops of crossing into
Somalia 20 kilometers and taking the Somali town of Dolow,
killing 47 militiamen of an Islamic group.
</P>
<P>
Yet the Ethiopian statement said the multinational terrorist
group has been bent on preparing itself for the past five months
with the assistance it received from certain neighboring
countries and crossed the Ethiopian border recently in an attempt
to attack the border town of dollo.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Defense Force "has gallantly fought and
destroyed the terrorists", the statement said, adding that
following the offensive, the remnants of the group were forced to
retreat in disarray back into Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the Ethiopian people to "remain
vigilant, against activities of the terrorist group" and stressed
the readiness of the defense force to ward off any attempt of
aggression.
</P>
<P>
''the attempt by the fundamentalist group to attack Ethiopia
after recuperating for some time is a proof that it is determined
to destabilize the sub-region and spread its extremist ideology
by force,'' the statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia will not tolerate the futile attempt by the group to
impose its belief on neighboring countries and reiterated its
determination to deal a crushing blow at such an attempt, the
statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the Ethiopian Defense Force killed 232 alleged
terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Allows Scaled-down Multi-National Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- After heated debates, the
Turkish parliament today agreed to terminate the mandate of the
Operation Provide Comfort (OPC) which was established to protect
the Kurds in Northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But the parliament gave the cabinet six months to work out the
capacity and time limit of a new multi-national force, which will
start to act on January 1 under the name of "Reconnaissance Force".
</P>
<P>
The OPC, including the U.S., British, French as well as Turkish
troops and aircraft, has been patrolling a no-fly zone in the
north of the 36th parallel in Iraq to deter possible attacks from
Baghdad since 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, some Turkish government officials and parliamentarians
have been demanding the termination of the OPC since early this
year, fearing the operation would become a protection umbrella of
Turkey's separatist Kurds sheltering in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, who was eager to
establish closer links with Baghdad, supported the replacement of
the OPC with a relatively-restricted multi-national force.
</P>
<P>
Earlier discussions of the Turkish and U.S. military officials
agreed that the number of daily patrols of the Reconnaissance Force
would be restricted and the aircraft would not be able to engage
in punitive attacks against Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
France, one of the former OPC members, said Wednesday that it
was studying the question on whether to participate in the new
force.
